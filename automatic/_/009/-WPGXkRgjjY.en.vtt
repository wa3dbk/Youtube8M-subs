00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.920
 hello good afternoon today we are going to make a 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.620
 anti wrinkle cream for it we are going to 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.830
 need rosehip glycerin 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.590
 aloe vera and lemon is a recipe 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.119
 simple let's cut a piece more or 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.119
 less than this size aloe vera 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.710
 we cut the edges 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.460
 we are going to skin 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.159
 and now with a spoon 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.910
 let's go withdrawing 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.970
 ro piece of something pretty much a couple of 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.750
 them if it is a larger plant 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.600
 then with one is enough 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.320
 but if we do not cut the pieces equally 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.320
 the same 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.100
 and here it is rather all the fault with 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.720
 a 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.490
 I would go 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.850
 and now what we have to do is 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.550
 wash the aloe vera to remove all the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.780
 mucus that has 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.710
 and take a little of it 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.710
 of iodine 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.390
 we are going to open it so that it will go away 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.390
 watching the mucus 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.950
 aloe vera is a plant that is 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.039
 great has a lot of collagen with what 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.970
 what 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:16.180
 the skin is restructured again 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.370
 then he has a lot of iodine that using it 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.210
 unwashed 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.980
 It is healing to heal wounds 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.560
 then it also serves to take it in 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.239
 juice 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.239
 the iodine is also removed 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.050
 and for the stomach it's great 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.920
 all the people who have problems 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.920
 of acidity 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.860
 let's listen 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.310
 glycerin three tablespoons of 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.310
 glycerin 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.989
 of our windows 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.920
 let's take a spoonful of pink 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.920
 rosehip oil 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.390
 and we are going to throw him 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.390
 a tablespoon of lemon juice 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.300
 so now what we are going to do is 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.490
 store it in any jar of creams 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.710
 old well washed 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.770
 we keep it there and we keep it 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.690
 always the refrigerator because it 's a 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.730
 natural cream that does not have any 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.710
 preservative for all these people 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.710
 allergic is going to come wonderfully 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.440
 baratta 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.680
 simple to do and nothing else that you have to 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.830
 do it like for a week or as 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.770
 very much two weeks because this is 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.919
 spoil yes no 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.930
 and well you will see the results 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.780
 you have to put your hand or finger because 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.389
 it contaminates the cream becomes contaminated and 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.389
 also take the heat also by the hand 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.940
 salty is like that and you shop 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.080
 you can also give it to your hands 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.080
 and in the rest of the body 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.550
