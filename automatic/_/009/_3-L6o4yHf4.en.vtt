00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.780 

I<00:00:28.480> think<00:00:29.440> the<00:00:29.530> great<00:00:29.740> thing<00:00:29.770> about<00:00:30.010> being<00:00:30.490> here

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
I think the great thing about being here

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.700 
I think the great thing about being here
is<00:00:30.910> that<00:00:31.150> no<00:00:31.330> matter<00:00:31.360> what<00:00:31.750> your<00:00:31.960> level<00:00:32.380> you

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
is that no matter what your level you

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.130 
is that no matter what your level you
will<00:00:32.890> go<00:00:33.130> back<00:00:33.430> better<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:37.180> come<00:00:37.480> for<00:00:37.930> one

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
will go back better you come for one

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.460 
will go back better you come for one
week<00:00:38.440> but<00:00:38.739> it's<00:00:38.890> like<00:00:39.210> having<00:00:40.210> two<00:00:40.900> years<00:00:41.260> of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
week but it's like having two years of

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.350 
week but it's like having two years of
lessons<00:00:41.680> I<00:00:42.190> think<00:00:42.550> it's<00:00:42.670> a<00:00:42.760> really<00:00:42.970> special

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
lessons I think it's a really special

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.450 
lessons I think it's a really special
opportunity<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.620> get<00:00:44.860> away<00:00:44.980> from<00:00:45.129> everything

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
opportunity to get away from everything
