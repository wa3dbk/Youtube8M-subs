00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.299
 body 10 but first of all I will do 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.049

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.429
 a lot of attention 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.840
 this is included within that group of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.780
 those who have a metabolism 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.580
 fast it costs him to get muscle mass 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.830
 practices usually trainings 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.350
 high intensity or very practical 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.740
 often sports background or just 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.019

 that's why I tell you how we started 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.080
 this new video 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.690
 one of the aspects that most feeders of 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.670
 head brings us to those who are looking 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.710
 of the body 10 is the gain of mass 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.199
 muscle and also its subsequent 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.730
 maintenance sure that many of the 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.829
 that you are listening to me right now 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.960
 you completely agree with me 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.120
 and that is that those who are subject to 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.190
 high intensity workouts or 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.589
 do a lot of sport along the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.379
 day and those also those who have a 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.170
 rapid metabolism we are a great 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.420
 dose and a great contribution of calories for 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.460
 recover and replenish the levels of 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.380
 glycogen after training 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.149
 promote recovery and also the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.399
 muscle growth but not os 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.710
 worry because thanks to science and 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.350
 thanks to exclusive and favorite stores 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.020
 from paco dÃ­az we got to have in 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.450
 our hands wonders like this that 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.679
 I already have a lot of me here 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:33.979
 attention to what I am going to tell you now 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:36.950
 same the web www.proceso.com.mx of 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.020
 calories without sugar or aspartame 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.420
 with creatine bc you have chosen this mine 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.270
 of glutamine and of course a complex 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.250
 of vitamins and minerals a powerful 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.170
 mixture of compounds that we found 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.729
 inside the extreme 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.310
 geithner that is what it's called and that 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.920
 act synergistically and with those who 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.740
 you'll get a big increase in mass 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.409
 muscle of little or nothing is worth training 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.079
 as it should be if you do not accompany it later 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.319
 a balanced diet according to 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.780
 objectives that they pursue or of course of 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.930
 a supplementation according to that plan 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.780
 in this case I take this gamer to 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.489
 gain muscle mass in volume stages 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.110
 according to my somatotype but for that 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.780
 You will have your personal trainer 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.430
 will be the one who can advise you of which ones 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.890
 are the objectives and what supplements 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.810
 you must take I advise you of course 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.450
 of this one to get muscle mass 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.069
 also because my experience is 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.349
 one of the best gamers you have 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.720
 right now in the market nothing more and 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.030
 nothing less than almost three kilos of 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.349
 supplement I usually take 3 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.379
 dosers like the one you're seeing 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.050
 on screen that equals 55 grams in 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.780
 this bowl are exactly those 3 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.180
 that dissolve perfectly in water 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.040
 in this case I mixed them with 350 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.040
 milliliters of water and how it dissolves 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.660
 without problem you can use for example 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.570
 I know that I use my seiquer of 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.670
 pro fish point is to mix it and 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.500
 when I take it I take it right after the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.480
 training and I also take it between 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.630
 meals to maintain the balance 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.910
 positive nitrogen and thus favor the 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.560
