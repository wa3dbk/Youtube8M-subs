the original Prime series which was
speed<00:01:41.250> except<00:01:42.250> for<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.430> think<00:01:42.580> zero<00:01:42.880> mission

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
speed except for I think zero mission

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.480 
speed except for I think zero mission
where<00:01:43.390> they<00:01:43.600> combined<00:01:44.050> both<00:01:44.350> speed<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:44.800> item

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
where they combined both speed and item

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.760 
where they combined both speed and item
collection<00:01:45.670> because<00:01:46.420> i<00:01:46.600> only<00:01:46.900> got<00:01:47.200> Sam

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770
