00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
okay so this is testing the game were to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.299 
okay so this is testing the game were to
make<00:00:09.690> sure<00:00:09.900> cuz<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.470> jump<00:00:10.800> heard<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.040> speaker

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
make sure cuz I jump heard the speaker

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:11.959 
make sure cuz I jump heard the speaker
to<00:00:11.580> another

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
to another

boy<00:00:12.209> then<00:00:13.139> here's<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.799> soldering<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:15.349> then

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
boy then here's the soldering and then

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.679 
boy then here's the soldering and then
there's<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.920> new<00:00:17.039> PSP<00:00:17.640> speaker<00:00:18.090> soldered<00:00:18.539> on

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
there's the new PSP speaker soldered on

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.439 
there's the new PSP speaker soldered on
and<00:00:19.669> then<00:00:20.900> everything<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> case<00:00:22.349> and<00:00:23.449> then

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
and then everything in the case and then

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.150 
and then everything in the case and then
there's<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> old<00:00:24.960> speaker<00:00:25.439> he<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.890> kind<00:00:26.130> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
there's the old speaker he can kind of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.589 
there's the old speaker he can kind of
see<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:26.430> broken<00:00:26.579> there<00:00:26.880> I'll<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.419> to<00:00:27.570> that

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
see it's broken there I'll get to that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.290 
see it's broken there I'll get to that
later<00:00:27.860> some<00:00:28.860> two<00:00:29.009> seven<00:00:29.340> nine<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.759> doing<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
later some two seven nine here doing a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.889 
later some two seven nine here doing a
video<00:00:30.619> showing<00:00:31.619> speakers<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.480> game<00:00:33.660> what

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
video showing speakers of the game what

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.049 
video showing speakers of the game what
color<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.129> PSP<00:00:35.610> speaker

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
color this is the one of the PSP speaker

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.639 
color this is the one of the PSP speaker
compared<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> original

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
compared to the one with the original

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.069 
compared to the one with the original
speaker<00:00:38.280> now<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> replace<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> speaker<00:00:39.870> in

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
speaker now I replace the speaker in

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.520 
speaker now I replace the speaker in
this<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.520> because<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.690> don't<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.440> if

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
this one because of this I don't know if

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.049 
this one because of this I don't know if
you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.949> it<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.429> see<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.789> wire

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you can see it but you can see this wire

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.439 
you can see it but you can see this wire
here<00:00:46.489> that's<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> way<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.120> supposed<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
here that's not the way it's supposed to

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.950

be anyway now you just saw a slideshow

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.290 
be anyway now you just saw a slideshow
of<00:00:51.989> putting<00:00:52.859> it<00:00:52.949> together<00:00:53.159> when<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.149> was

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
of putting it together when I was

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
of putting it together when I was
putting<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.839> here<00:00:55.079> when<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> after<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> got

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
putting it to here when I after I got

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.790 
putting it to here when I after I got
the<00:00:56.339> speaker<00:00:56.699> soldered<00:00:56.999> in<00:00:57.289> and<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.409> was<00:00:58.620> using

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the speaker soldered in and I was using

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.779 
the speaker soldered in and I was using
this<00:01:00.170> battery<00:01:01.170> pack<00:01:01.409> I<00:01:01.620> had<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.979> jump<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.550> had

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
this battery pack I had it jump or I had

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.260 
this battery pack I had it jump or I had
jumper<00:01:03.629> cables<00:01:04.220> attached<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.580> plugged<00:01:06.090> them

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
jumper cables attached to I plugged them

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.649 
jumper cables attached to I plugged them
in<00:01:06.390> backwards<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.710> battery<00:01:08.659> terminals

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
in backwards on the battery terminals

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.690 
in backwards on the battery terminals
and<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.470> had<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:10.740> back<00:01:10.890> off<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.490> put

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and I had the back off so I can put

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.149 
and I had the back off so I can put
batteries<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.470> anyway<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> fried<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
batteries in it anyway I fried one of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.220 
batteries in it anyway I fried one of
the<00:01:14.220> diodes<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> board<00:01:15.060> thanks<00:01:15.690> Nintendo

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
the diodes on the board thanks Nintendo

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.270 
the diodes on the board thanks Nintendo
for<00:01:16.350> putting<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.070> first

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
for putting that there in the first

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.960 
for putting that there in the first
place<00:01:17.900> anyway<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.200> soldered<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.130> just

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
place anyway I just soldered it I just

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.280 
place anyway I just soldered it I just
removed<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.390> jumper<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.750> put<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> solder

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
removed the jumper and put a solder

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.590 
removed the jumper and put a solder
bridge<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.510> everything's<00:01:24.510> working

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
bridge there so everything's working

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
bridge there so everything's working
this<00:01:24.960> fine<00:01:25.230> I<00:01:25.260> just<00:01:25.650> hope<00:01:25.800> I<00:01:25.890> don't<00:01:25.980> put<00:01:26.190> look

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
this fine I just hope I don't put look

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
this fine I just hope I don't put look
at<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.840> batteries<00:01:28.230> backwards<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.800> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
at that the batteries backwards in it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.970 
at that the batteries backwards in it
again<00:01:29.160> which<00:01:29.550> should<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.330> pretty<00:01:30.510> hard<00:01:30.980> but

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
again which should be pretty hard but

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.680 
again which should be pretty hard but
anyway<00:01:32.640> now<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.240> show<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
anyway now I'm going to show you the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.560 
anyway now I'm going to show you the
loudness<00:01:34.170> difference<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.280> by<00:01:36.090> showing<00:01:36.360> you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
loudness difference in a by showing you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:02:38.040 
loudness difference in a by showing you
the<00:01:36.720> pokemon<00:01:37.140> theme<00:01:37.440> from<00:01:38.250> crystal

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.710 

okay<00:02:39.050> not<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.500> other<00:02:39.620> one<00:02:40.120> no<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.150> will<00:02:41.450> say

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
okay not to the other one no I will say

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.210 
okay not to the other one no I will say
I<00:02:41.750> didn't<00:02:42.170> recognize<00:02:42.530> any<00:02:42.740> difference<00:02:43.070> in

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
I didn't recognize any difference in

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.110 
I didn't recognize any difference in
loudness<00:02:43.610> but<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.570> PSP<00:02:45.080> speaker<00:02:45.530> was<00:02:47.530> CRISPR

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
loudness but the PSP speaker was CRISPR

00:02:49.120 --> 00:03:49.820 
loudness but the PSP speaker was CRISPR
dr.<00:02:50.120> Mario

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.760 

anyway<00:03:50.830> like<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.430> said<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.670> think<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:52.770> PSP

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
anyway like I said I think the PSP

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.900 
anyway like I said I think the PSP
speaker<00:03:54.480> sounds<00:03:55.480> crisper<00:03:56.520> but<00:03:57.520> it<00:03:57.640> doesn't

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
speaker sounds crisper but it doesn't

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.460 
speaker sounds crisper but it doesn't
have<00:03:58.030> quite<00:03:58.240> a<00:03:58.270> Depot<00:03:58.959> sound<00:03:59.200> which<00:03:59.350> is

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
have quite a Depot sound which is

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.500 
have quite a Depot sound which is
understandable<00:03:59.980> because<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.670> PSP<00:04:01.090> speaker

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
understandable because the PSP speaker

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.980 
understandable because the PSP speaker
is<00:04:01.860> this<00:04:02.860> size<00:04:03.130> when<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.450> game<00:04:04.630> what<00:04:04.810> color

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
is this size when the game what color

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.990 
is this size when the game what color
