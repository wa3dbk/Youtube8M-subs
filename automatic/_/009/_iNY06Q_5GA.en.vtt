 process when going from premium channel to

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.790
 view of the canal at that time 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.870
 competing hand to hand because of the 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.669
 popularity that had 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.770

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.360
 bet only worldwide since it has

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.900
 free disney chanel with a 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.590

 juvenile and family child on 23 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.280
 May 2014 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.350
 disney channel released a new logo on 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.419
 which consists of the classic signature of 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.919
 disney but this time with circles 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.470
 that form the head of the character 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.960
 mickey mouse over the point of the 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.900
 and ceasing to use the previous logo of the 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.030
 box that is used since 2010 said logo 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.250
 is currently being used in the 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.260
 German version of the channel which happened to 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.030
 be an open television channel from 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.030
 on January 17 , 2014 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.310
 good after analyzing its history 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.320
 I'll start with my criticism good for me 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.210
 Disney Chanel was a great channel and with 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.250
 good programming for all 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.770
 ages that entertained both adults and children 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.020
 but well I can not tell you much how 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.820
 were his programs in the 90s since 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.650
 I never saw them but when they came to the 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.240
 television I liked many of his 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.440
 programs like the family pro a 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.390
 impossible 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.270
 jane long the western dragon between 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.980
 other programs that were forgotten 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.510
 but over the years the channel has 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.430
 has been declining since it has stopped 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.830
 transmit good programs and drawings 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.080
 animated to give way to series between 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.120
 good and successful quotes giving you greater 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.860
 importance to live action series 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.050
 as they are in the case of 'hosting' and 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.660
 ali are the dog blogger jesse 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.460
 etcetera now nowadays I do not 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.740
 I follow this channel a lot because I do not 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.180
 they interest their current series only what 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.100
 I see from time to time for some 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.320
 caricature like phineas and ferb or their 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.310
 classic movies but leaving aside 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.380
 all this matter 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.720
 disney chanel is currently a channel 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.670
 bored with bad programming but if a 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.830
 someone likes the current chanel disney 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.980
 good to respect your tastes but for me 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.740
 the channel is currently disgusting 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.360
 oh I forgot to tell you anything else from 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.400
 my point of view also one of the 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.260
 reasons why the current channel is 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.450
 a disgust is to transmit the novel 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.100
 argentina violet and I can hardly believe 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.990
 because they transmit it that they do not give 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.180
 account that they can lose so many 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.610
 viewers but good that you can 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.590
 do but neglecting the negative 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.620
 disney chanel was originally a channel 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.900
 that amused many good friends this 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.940
 It was my criticism of Disney Chanel, I hope 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.770
 that you liked before I left them 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.810
 I will leave two channels to vote for 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.120
 which one do you want to make my next video 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:34.590
 nickelodeon or fox kids well that's it 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.590
 until the next video goodbye
