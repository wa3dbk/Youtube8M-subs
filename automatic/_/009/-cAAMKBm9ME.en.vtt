consistency<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.960> groundstrokes<00:00:07.910> prepare<00:00:08.910> for

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179

consistency on groundstrokes prepare for
the<00:00:09.269> ball<00:00:09.650> early<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.250> what<00:00:11.700> do<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.880> mean<00:00:12.030> by<00:00:12.090> that

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
the ball early so what do I mean by that

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.660 
the ball early so what do I mean by that
as<00:00:12.660> soon<00:00:12.840> as<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.080> see<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.320> ball<00:00:13.440> coming<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.130> want

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
as soon as I see the ball coming I want

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.279 
as soon as I see the ball coming I want
to<00:00:14.730> turn<00:00:14.910> sideways<00:00:15.179> by<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.750> time<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.139> ball

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
to turn sideways by the time the ball

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.620 
to turn sideways by the time the ball
bounces<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.949> my<00:00:17.100> court<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.699> want<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.330> be<00:00:18.420> ready

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
bounces in my court I want to be ready

bounces in my court I want to be ready
with<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.199> racket<00:00:19.650> behind<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.730> path<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.539> the

with the racket behind the path of the
incoming<00:00:22.080> ball<00:00:22.430> try<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.490> make<00:00:23.760> contact<00:00:24.180> with

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
incoming ball try to make contact with

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.960 
incoming ball try to make contact with
the<00:00:24.359> ball<00:00:24.390> somewhere<00:00:25.109> between<00:00:25.640> knees<00:00:26.640> high

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the ball somewhere between knees high

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.220 
the ball somewhere between knees high
and<00:00:28.220> shoulder<00:00:29.220> high<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:30.029> ideally<00:00:30.539> your

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and shoulder high so ideally your

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.370 
and shoulder high so ideally your
contacts<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.980> should<00:00:32.219> be<00:00:32.399> somewhere<00:00:32.910> around

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
contacts all should be somewhere around

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.080 
contacts all should be somewhere around
waist<00:00:34.380> height<00:00:35.570> as<00:00:36.570> far<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.530> footwork<00:00:38.160> try<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
waist height as far as footwork try to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.010 
waist height as far as footwork try to
use<00:00:39.360> small<00:00:39.870> steps<00:00:40.340> to<00:00:41.340> adjust<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> ball<00:00:42.270> so

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
use small steps to adjust to the ball so

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.930 
use small steps to adjust to the ball so
I'm<00:00:43.079> talking<00:00:43.320> about<00:00:43.530> tiny<00:00:44.370> tiny<00:00:45.149> steps<00:00:46.940> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
I'm talking about tiny tiny steps to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.420 
I'm talking about tiny tiny steps to
move<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.570> keep<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.350> better<00:00:49.770> balance<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
move and keep a better balance and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.069 
move and keep a better balance and
obviously<00:00:51.149> butter<00:00:51.989> consistency<00:00:53.690> not<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.960> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
obviously butter consistency not if you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.670 
obviously butter consistency not if you
the<00:00:55.170> ball

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the ball

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.970 
the ball
make<00:00:56.399> sure<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.789> recovered<00:00:57.300> quickly<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> I'm

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
make sure you recovered quickly so I'm

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.709 
make sure you recovered quickly so I'm
just<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> ball<00:00:59.760> make<00:01:00.480> sure<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
just here in the ball make sure you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.840 
just here in the ball make sure you
don't<00:01:00.989> staying<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.559> watch<00:01:02.250> where<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> ball

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
don't staying and watch where the ball

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.320 
don't staying and watch where the ball
goes<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.809> hear<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.580> off<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.850> may<00:01:05.970> come<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
goes as you hear it off you may come to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
goes as you hear it off you may come to
the<00:01:06.420> ball<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.900> start<00:01:07.290> recovering<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the ball you start recovering and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.070 
the ball you start recovering and
getting<00:01:08.729> ready<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> next<00:01:09.360> ball<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.900> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
getting ready for the next ball so that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.870 
getting ready for the next ball so that
when<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> next<00:01:10.590> ball<00:01:10.830> comes<00:01:11.100> you're<00:01:11.670> ready

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
when the next ball comes you're ready

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.980 
when the next ball comes you're ready
for<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.180> you're<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.720> balance<00:01:14.509> try<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> avoid

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
for it you're in balance try to avoid

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.810 
for it you're in balance try to avoid
feeling<00:01:16.920> too<00:01:17.340> low<00:01:17.549> over<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.479> net<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:19.820> eating

too close to the lines always you could
sell<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.369> margin<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:23.970> error<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.900> my<00:01:25.110> case

when I when I rally over the net I tried

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.140 
when I when I rally over the net I tried
to<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> ball<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.070> least<00:01:29.340> two<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.119> three

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
feet above the net when I aim why I want

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.560 
feet above the net when I aim why I want
to<00:01:34.799> give<00:01:34.920> myself<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.400> margin<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.299> least

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
three feet go cross-court a lot going

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.370 
three feet go cross-court a lot going
cross-court<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> long<00:01:41.850> record<00:01:42.380> to

work with
one<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.700> most<00:01:46.910> important<00:01:47.450> tips<00:01:47.690> to<00:01:47.990> be

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
one of the most important tips to be

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.340 
one of the most important tips to be
consistent<00:01:48.950> would<00:01:49.130> be<00:01:49.310> create<00:01:50.350> Spain

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
consistent would be create Spain

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.390 
consistent would be create Spain
especially<00:01:52.000> topspin<00:01:53.200> topspin<00:01:54.200> by<00:01:55.070> swinging

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
especially topspin topspin by swinging

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.980 
especially topspin topspin by swinging
low<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.790> high<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:55.970> boys<00:01:56.300> gonna<00:01:56.540> go<00:01:56.660> higher<00:01:56.960> up

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
low to high the boys gonna go higher up

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.750 
low to high the boys gonna go higher up
the<00:01:57.290> net<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.740> because<00:01:58.010> of<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.250> speed<00:01:58.550> the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
the net and because of the speed the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.150 
the net and because of the speed the
speed<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.270> gonna<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.870> boys<00:02:00.050> gonna<00:02:00.290> come<00:02:00.620> down

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
speed is gonna the boys gonna come down

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.670 
speed is gonna the boys gonna come down
the<00:02:01.340> last<00:02:01.550> earlier<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.600> trust<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.110> spin<00:02:03.380> aim

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
the last earlier so trust the spin aim

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.770 
the last earlier so trust the spin aim
higher<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.340> net<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:05.060> ball<00:02:05.300> will<00:02:05.510> it<00:02:05.600> come

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
higher of the net the ball will it come

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.139 
higher of the net the ball will it come
down<00:02:05.960> if<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.590> brush<00:02:06.860> up<00:02:07.100> on<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.370> back<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:08.000> the

to create a lot more spin ultimately to
be<00:02:24.200> consistent<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:24.950> takes<00:02:25.220> repetition

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
be consistent it takes repetition

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.500 
be consistent it takes repetition
repetition<00:02:27.350> while<00:02:27.920> they<00:02:28.070> remember<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.550> try

to heat a lot of balls over and over and
over<00:02:31.970> again<00:02:32.060> that's<00:02:32.660> how<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:32.990> develop<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.680> feel

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
over again that's how you develop a feel

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.140 
over again that's how you develop a feel
and<00:02:34.250> feel<00:02:34.640> is<00:02:35.090> what<00:02:35.660> makes<00:02:35.960> us<00:02:36.170> consistent<00:02:37.150> how

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
and feel is what makes us consistent how

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.500 
and feel is what makes us consistent how
can<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.450> practice<00:02:39.490> one<00:02:40.490> way<00:02:40.730> would<00:02:40.910> be<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.120> hit

hands cross word back to each other and

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.970 
hands cross word back to each other and
if<00:03:07.070> we<00:03:07.310> missed<00:03:07.550> we<00:03:07.910> started<00:03:08.360> again<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.560> had

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
if we missed we started again so we had

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.250 
if we missed we started again so we had
that<00:03:10.160> commitment<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:11.360> not<00:03:11.570> give<00:03:11.720> up<00:03:11.870> until<00:03:12.170> we

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
that commitment to not give up until we

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.600 
that commitment to not give up until we
get<00:03:12.470> 2014<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:14.350> repetition<00:03:15.350> is<00:03:16.010> what

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
get 2014 and that repetition is what

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.229 
get 2014 and that repetition is what
helps<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.090> become<00:03:17.239> persistent<00:03:18.070> consistent

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
helps you become persistent consistent

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.720 
helps you become persistent consistent
so<00:03:20.239> have<00:03:20.450> fun<00:03:20.660> practicing<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:22.190> thank<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.550> for
