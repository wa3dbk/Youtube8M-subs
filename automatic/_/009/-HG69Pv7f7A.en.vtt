00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.360 
a perfect game with two outs in the
ninth<00:02:36.980> just<00:02:37.610> ten<00:02:38.000> times<00:02:38.450> if<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:40.010> think<00:02:40.250> about

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
ninth just ten times if you think about

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.430 
ninth just ten times if you think about
it<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.670> probably<00:02:41.209> more<00:02:41.599> remember<00:02:41.930> for<00:02:42.260> not

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
it I probably more remember for not

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440 
it I probably more remember for not
getting<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.160> how<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.850> happened<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.390> I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
getting it and how it happened and I

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.420 
getting it and how it happened and I
would<00:02:45.049> have<00:02:45.140> been<00:02:45.290> forgetting<00:02:45.799> one<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.280> so

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
would have been forgetting one and so

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.770 
would have been forgetting one and so
when<00:02:46.579> you<00:02:46.670> get<00:02:46.760> into<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> game<00:02:47.180> like<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.420> as

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
when you get into the game like that as

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.410 
when you get into the game like that as
it<00:02:47.959> progresses<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:49.190> start<00:02:49.519> feeling<00:02:50.120> better

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
it progresses you start feeling better

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.000 
it progresses you start feeling better
and<00:02:50.780> hitting<00:02:51.019> your<00:02:51.079> spots<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.650> your<00:02:51.769> stuff

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
and hitting your spots and your stuff

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.560 
and hitting your spots and your stuff
gets<00:02:52.250> better<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.640> better<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.000> then<00:02:53.120> all<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.450> a

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
gets better and better and then all of a

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.670 
gets better and better and then all of a
sudden<00:02:53.600> next<00:02:54.079> thing<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.320> know<00:02:54.470> you've

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
sudden next thing you know you've

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.740 
sudden next thing you know you've
retired<00:02:55.100> 26<00:02:55.670> straight<00:02:55.850> hitters<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.299> row<00:02:56.480> and

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
retired 26 straight hitters in a row and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.140 
retired 26 straight hitters in a row and
now<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:57.950> think<00:02:58.160> about<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:58.670> just<00:02:58.700> you

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
now that I think about it you just you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.789 
now that I think about it you just you
smile<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.780> say<00:02:59.959> that<00:03:00.230> was<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.680> was<00:03:00.709> a

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
smile and say that was a that was a

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.940 
smile and say that was a that was a
blast<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.250> be<00:03:01.310> able<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.609> do<00:03:01.730> that
