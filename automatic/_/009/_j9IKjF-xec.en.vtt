University of Texas at Dallas have found

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.580 
University of Texas at Dallas have found
that<00:00:07.639> learning<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.790> new<00:00:08.840> challenging<00:00:09.840> task<00:00:10.170> can

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
that learning a new challenging task can

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.290 
that learning a new challenging task can
be<00:00:10.620> much<00:00:10.920> more<00:00:10.950> beneficial<00:00:11.639> for<00:00:11.880> your<00:00:12.030> memory

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
be much more beneficial for your memory

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.140 
be much more beneficial for your memory
than<00:00:12.990> things<00:00:13.259> like<00:00:13.530> puzzles<00:00:14.040> or<00:00:14.280> games<00:00:14.610> as<00:00:14.849> was

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
than things like puzzles or games as was

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.330 
than things like puzzles or games as was
previously<00:00:15.480> thought<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
previously thought so this is what the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.040 
previously thought so this is what the
researchers<00:00:17.760> did<00:00:18.000> they<00:00:18.300> conducted<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.990> study

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
researchers did they conducted a study

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.470 
researchers did they conducted a study
with<00:00:19.410> 200<00:00:20.100> elderly<00:00:20.520> participants<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.420> they

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
with 200 elderly participants and they

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.820 
with 200 elderly participants and they
assign<00:00:21.750> them<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.990> different<00:00:22.020> activities<00:00:22.740> so

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
assign them to different activities so

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.019 
assign them to different activities so
some<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.160> them<00:00:23.250> were<00:00:23.369> assigned<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.699> digital

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
some of them were assigned to digital

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.460 
some of them were assigned to digital
photography<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.750> learning<00:00:25.050> Photoshop

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
photography and learning Photoshop

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.920 
photography and learning Photoshop
others<00:00:26.070> were<00:00:26.250> assigned<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.880> quilting<00:00:27.660> for

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
others were assigned to quilting for

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.169 
others were assigned to quilting for
example<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.250> had<00:00:29.490> them<00:00:29.730> practice

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
example and then they had them practice

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.840 
example and then they had them practice
this<00:00:30.269> activity<00:00:30.840> for<00:00:31.050> 15<00:00:31.439> hours<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.830> week<00:00:32.279> for

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
this activity for 15 hours a week for

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.270 
this activity for 15 hours a week for
three<00:00:33.420> months<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:34.649> compared<00:00:35.100> them<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
three months and they compared them to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.400 
three months and they compared them to
people<00:00:35.730> who<00:00:35.880> were<00:00:35.969> assigned<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.840> other<00:00:36.870> groups

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
people who were assigned to other groups

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410 
people who were assigned to other groups
so<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:38.250> had<00:00:38.370> different<00:00:38.730> groups<00:00:38.969> some<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
so they had different groups some that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.910 
so they had different groups some that
were<00:00:39.540> like<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> social<00:00:40.320> group<00:00:40.620> where<00:00:40.829> they

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
were like the social group where they

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.380 
were like the social group where they
SAT<00:00:41.100> around<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.489> watched<00:00:41.670> movies<00:00:42.120> together

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
SAT around and watched movies together

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.529 
SAT around and watched movies together
and<00:00:43.079> talked<00:00:43.559> about<00:00:43.710> vacations<00:00:44.399> other<00:00:44.879> groups

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and talked about vacations other groups

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.190 
and talked about vacations other groups
were<00:00:45.930> playing<00:00:46.320> easy<00:00:46.590> games<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.280> puzzles<00:00:47.489> or

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
were playing easy games and puzzles or

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.869 
were playing easy games and puzzles or
quiet<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.500> home<00:00:49.530> listening<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.430> classical

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
quiet at home listening to classical

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
quiet at home listening to classical
music<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:51.930> at<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> end<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> study

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
music so they at the end of the study

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.819 
music so they at the end of the study
they<00:00:53.129> saw<00:00:53.449> some<00:00:54.449> stark<00:00:54.840> differences<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.559> terms

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
they saw some stark differences in terms

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
they saw some stark differences in terms
of<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.250> memory<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.030> how<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.480> performed<00:00:57.870> on

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
of a memory and how they performed on

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.310 
of a memory and how they performed on
memory<00:00:58.230> tasks<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.890> they<00:00:59.340> found<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.320> quote

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
memory tasks and they found that quote

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560 
memory tasks and they found that quote
we<00:01:01.859> found<00:01:02.129> an<00:01:02.309> improvement<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.940> memory<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.390> we

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
we found an improvement in memory and we

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.670 
we found an improvement in memory and we
found<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.870> when<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.170> tested<00:01:04.530> our

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
found that when we tested our

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560 
found that when we tested our
participants<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.339> year<00:01:05.760> later<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.390> was

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
participants a year later that was

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300 
participants a year later that was
maintained<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.470> these<00:01:07.680> weren't<00:01:07.920> short

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
maintained so these weren't short

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
maintained so these weren't short
momentary<00:01:08.790> gains<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.240> were<00:01:09.360> only<00:01:09.540> exhibited

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
momentary gains that were only exhibited

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.330 
momentary gains that were only exhibited
during<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.380> three-month<00:01:10.740> period<00:01:10.920> they

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
during the three-month period they

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
during the three-month period they
lasted<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.240> whole<00:01:12.450> year<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.470> has

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
lasted for a whole year and that has

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
lasted for a whole year and that has
some<00:01:13.799> real<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:14.430> implications<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.390> terms

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
some real you know implications in terms

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.620 
some real you know implications in terms
of<00:01:15.810> long-term<00:01:16.140> memory<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.130> memory<00:01:17.280> loss<00:01:17.670> well

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
of long-term memory and memory loss well

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
of long-term memory and memory loss well
I<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.560> necessarily<00:01:20.070> about

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
I think it's not necessarily about

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.030 
I think it's not necessarily about
Photoshop<00:01:21.330> per<00:01:21.570> se<00:01:21.780> but<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.259> about<00:01:22.650> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
Photoshop per se but it is about you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.920 
Photoshop per se but it is about you
know<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.159> activity<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.790> using<00:01:24.479> your<00:01:24.600> brain<00:01:24.780> in

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
know the activity of using your brain in

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.109 
know the activity of using your brain in
a<00:01:25.080> way<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.500> you're<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> custom<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
a way that you're on a custom it's the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.880 
a way that you're on a custom it's the
old<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.450> know<00:01:27.570> use<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> or<00:01:28.200> lose<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.740> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
old you know use it or lose it and so

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.380 
old you know use it or lose it and so
when<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.159> use<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> new<00:01:29.640> part<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.180> brain

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
when you use a new part of your brain

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.590 
when you use a new part of your brain
you're<00:01:31.290> strengthening<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:32.189> exactly<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.299> they

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
you're strengthening it exactly so they

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.749 
you're strengthening it exactly so they
found<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.100> Photoshop<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.490> most

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
found that Photoshop was the most

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.580 
found that Photoshop was the most
effective<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.689> one<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.049> contributed

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
effective and the one that contributed

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.700 
effective and the one that contributed
the<00:01:38.400> most<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.880> these<00:01:39.119> gains<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.900> second<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the most to these gains but second to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469 
the most to these gains but second to
that<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:41.040> quilting<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> others<00:01:42.150> didn't

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that was quilting and the others didn't

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.359 
that was quilting and the others didn't
really<00:01:42.720> show<00:01:42.899> much<00:01:43.110> improvement<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.100> what

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
really show much improvement and what

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.969 
really show much improvement and what
they<00:01:44.520> think<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.259> mentioned<00:01:46.770> it's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
they think is that as you mentioned it's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.160 
they think is that as you mentioned it's
activating<00:01:47.610> new<00:01:47.820> parts<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.360> your<00:01:48.810> brain<00:01:48.930> so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
activating new parts of your brain so

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.600 
activating new parts of your brain so
these<00:01:49.320> activities<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.100> are<00:01:50.280> much<00:01:50.430> more

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
these activities that are much more

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.030 
these activities that are much more
challenging<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.479> are<00:01:51.600> new<00:01:51.960> sort<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
challenging and that are new sort of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.620 
challenging and that are new sort of
work<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.670> concert<00:01:53.850> we're<00:01:54.240> different<00:01:54.479> with

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
work in concert we're different with

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.120 
work in concert we're different with
different<00:01:54.659> parts<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.380> your<00:01:55.530> brain<00:01:55.649> they<00:01:55.950> don't

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
different parts of your brain they don't

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.770 
different parts of your brain they don't
just<00:01:56.310> focus<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.969> specific<00:01:57.000> part<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.689> your

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
just focus on one specific part of your

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.170 
just focus on one specific part of your
brain<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> Sudoku<00:01:58.979> puzzle<00:01:59.340> does<00:01:59.520> right<00:01:59.790> so

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
brain like a Sudoku puzzle does right so

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.240 
brain like a Sudoku puzzle does right so
this<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.570> much<00:02:00.810> more<00:02:00.840> incumbency<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.920> it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
this is much more incumbency and it

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.249 
this is much more incumbency and it
actually<00:02:02.610> activates<00:02:03.000> neural<00:02:03.570> networks<00:02:04.020> as

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
actually activates neural networks as

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.639 
actually activates neural networks as
opposed<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.040> certain<00:02:05.850> neurons<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:07.350> for

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
opposed to just certain neurons and for

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.320 
opposed to just certain neurons and for
people<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.520> certain<00:02:08.550> age<00:02:08.879> they're<00:02:09.179> not

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
people of a certain age they're not

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.360 
people of a certain age they're not
accustomed<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.959> using<00:02:10.259> digital<00:02:10.649> software<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
accustomed to using digital software and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.470 
accustomed to using digital software and
and<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.540> concept<00:02:14.049> of<00:02:14.580> digitally<00:02:15.580> digital

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
and the the concept of digitally digital

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.360 
and the the concept of digitally digital
space<00:02:16.780> spatial<00:02:17.530> elements<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.129> things<00:02:18.280> like

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
space spatial elements and things like

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.649 
space spatial elements and things like
that<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.700> probably<00:02:19.030> an<00:02:19.150> entirely<00:02:19.480> new

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
that it's probably an entirely new

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.509 
that it's probably an entirely new
concept<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.409> so<00:02:20.560> they're<00:02:21.010> trying<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.340> wrap

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
concept and so they're trying to wrap

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.070 
concept and so they're trying to wrap
their<00:02:21.670> heads<00:02:21.849> around<00:02:21.909> it's<00:02:22.269> causing<00:02:22.720> them<00:02:22.870> to

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
their heads around it's causing them to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.770 
their heads around it's causing them to
use<00:02:23.890> different<00:02:24.280> parts<00:02:24.879> of<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.030> game<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.510> it's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
use different parts of the game and it's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.910 
use different parts of the game and it's
interesting<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.170> mentioned<00:02:26.500> spatial

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
interesting you mentioned spatial

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.320 
interesting you mentioned spatial
elements<00:02:27.310> because<00:02:27.489> that's<00:02:27.640> also<00:02:28.000> very<00:02:28.030> much

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
elements because that's also very much

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.300 
elements because that's also very much
involved<00:02:29.019> in<00:02:29.230> quilting<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.799> people<00:02:30.040> think<00:02:30.129> Oh

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
involved in quilting so people think Oh

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.649 
involved in quilting so people think Oh
quilting<00:02:30.670> doesn't<00:02:30.940> seem<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.090> complex<00:02:31.510> but

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
quilting doesn't seem that complex but

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:32.880 
quilting doesn't seem that complex but
it<00:02:31.750> actually<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.409> have<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.709> like

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
it actually is you have to like

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.490 
it actually is you have to like
anticipate<00:02:33.459> patterns<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.510> movements<00:02:35.409> and

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
anticipate patterns and movements and

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.930 
anticipate patterns and movements and
you're<00:02:35.590> being<00:02:35.829> physically<00:02:36.280> engaged<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:36.819> an

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
you're being physically engaged in an

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.539 
you're being physically engaged in an
entire<00:02:37.239> sort<00:02:37.599> of<00:02:37.690> tape<00:02:38.079> history<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.680> but<00:02:39.340> you

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
entire sort of tape history and but you

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.649 
entire sort of tape history and but you
know<00:02:39.640> doing<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.940> quilt<00:02:40.209> or<00:02:40.360> something<00:02:40.599> like

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
know doing a quilt or something like

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.180 
know doing a quilt or something like
that<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:40.989> not<00:02:41.230> as<00:02:41.379> much<00:02:41.409> of<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.769> it's<00:02:41.980> not<00:02:42.159> a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
that it's not as much of a it's not a

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.479 
that it's not as much of a it's not a
it's<00:02:42.459> much<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> learning<00:02:43.950> process<00:02:44.950> it's

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
it's much of a learning process it's

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.599 
it's much of a learning process it's
just<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.819> rote<00:02:46.120> activity<00:02:46.870> whereas<00:02:47.799> where<00:02:48.340> is

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
just a rote activity whereas where is

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:49.979 
just a rote activity whereas where is
well<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.150> learning<00:02:49.359> process<00:02:49.480> if<00:02:49.870> you've

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
well it's a learning process if you've

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.259 
well it's a learning process if you've
never<00:02:50.109> done<00:02:50.379> it<00:02:50.530> before<00:02:50.700> ever<00:02:51.700> once<00:02:51.879> you<00:02:52.030> learn

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
never done it before ever once you learn

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.030 
never done it before ever once you learn
it<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.720> do<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.109> over<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.440> over<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.739> over<00:02:53.829> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
it you do it over and over and over and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.800 
it you do it over and over and over and
over<00:02:54.280> again<00:02:54.519> until<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.090> thing<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.359> done<00:02:55.569> I

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
over again until the thing is done I

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.839 
over again until the thing is done I
know<00:02:56.109> you're<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.319> quilter<00:02:56.769> come<00:02:57.250> on<00:02:57.400> I've<00:02:57.640> done

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
know you're a quilter come on I've done

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.039 
know you're a quilter come on I've done
a<00:02:57.879> little<00:02:58.120> bit<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:58.480> bit<00:02:58.629> of<00:02:58.690> stitching<00:02:59.680> in<00:03:01.049> all

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
a little bit of bit of stitching in all

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.349 
a little bit of bit of stitching in all
right<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.069> think<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.579> I<00:03:03.819> think<00:03:03.849> this<00:03:04.209> has

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
right but I think it I think this has

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.729 
right but I think it I think this has
some<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:04.690> interesting<00:03:05.200> implications

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
some like interesting implications

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.770 
some like interesting implications
particularly<00:03:06.250> because<00:03:06.519> all<00:03:06.849> so<00:03:07.180> often<00:03:07.659> we

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
particularly because all so often we

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.569 
particularly because all so often we
tend<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.019> hear<00:03:08.230> about<00:03:08.319> new<00:03:08.650> drugs<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.400> know

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
tend to hear about new drugs you know

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.059 
tend to hear about new drugs you know
and<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.659> know<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.409> and<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:11.799> we're

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
and you know and this and that and we're

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.500 
and you know and this and that and we're
trying<00:03:12.159> to<00:03:12.370> look<00:03:12.489> for<00:03:12.670> artificial<00:03:13.209> ways<00:03:13.329> of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
trying to look for artificial ways of

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.000 
trying to look for artificial ways of
enhancing<00:03:13.659> our<00:03:14.079> memory<00:03:14.409> and<00:03:14.590> preventing

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
enhancing our memory and preventing

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.559 
enhancing our memory and preventing
things<00:03:15.099> but<00:03:15.310> sometimes<00:03:15.970> it's<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.209> simple<00:03:16.359> as

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
things but sometimes it's that simple as

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.319 
things but sometimes it's that simple as
picking<00:03:16.780> up<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.530> know<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:18.060> quilt<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.209> like

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
picking up you know a quilt and like

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.000
