00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
on tuesday jun 17 2007 i'm making that

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.450 
on tuesday jun 17 2007 i'm making that
up<00:00:56.579> anyway<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.989> app<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.590> music<00:00:59.250> app

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
up anyway but this app is a music app

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.660 
up anyway but this app is a music app
and<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.590> basically<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.039> beat<00:01:02.370> making

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and it's it's basically a beat making

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.030 
and it's it's basically a beat making
app<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.449> make<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:03.960> own<00:01:04.019> beats<00:01:04.530> or

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
app so you can make your own beats or

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.200 
app so you can make your own beats or
whatever<00:01:05.820> mixes<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.520> more<00:01:08.909> than<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
whatever mixes but it's more than that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.310 
whatever mixes but it's more than that
because<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:10.290> easy<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:11.130> use<00:01:11.490> even<00:01:12.390> someone

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
because it's easy to use even someone

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.499 
because it's easy to use even someone
with<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.220> no<00:01:14.250> musical<00:01:14.909> talent<00:01:14.970> like

with little to no musical talent like

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.429 
with little to no musical talent like
myself<00:01:15.780> uh<00:01:16.939> can<00:01:19.189> effectively<00:01:20.189> make<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> beat<00:01:21.060> in

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
myself uh can effectively make a beat in

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.570 
myself uh can effectively make a beat in
very<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.619> time<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.189> app<00:01:23.369> it's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
very little time with this app it's

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
very little time with this app it's
called<00:01:23.640> hydrogen<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.659> i<00:01:25.070> really<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:27.920> so

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
called hydrogen and i really like it so

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.010 
called hydrogen and i really like it so
it's<00:01:29.670> made<00:01:29.850> by<00:01:30.000> some<00:01:30.180> linux<00:01:30.509> developer

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it's made by some linux developer

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.899 
it's made by some linux developer
reported<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.770> mac<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.180> yeah<00:01:34.140> let's<00:01:34.500> just

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
reported it to mac so yeah let's just

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.609 
reported it to mac so yeah let's just
I'll<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.960> called<00:01:37.259> hydrogen

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
I'll get going so it's called hydrogen

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.420 
I'll get going so it's called hydrogen
it<00:01:38.570> beat<00:01:39.570> making<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.140> basically<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.189> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
it beat making and basically what it it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.740 
it beat making and basically what it it
presents<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.979> well<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.540> guess<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.720> could

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
make loops with this I guess I guess

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.819 
make loops with this I guess I guess
that's<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.750> call<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> loop<00:01:49.409> maker<00:01:49.680> or

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that's what you call it a loop maker or

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.920 
that's what you call it a loop maker or
something<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.729> basically<00:01:51.540> what

this goes so I'm gonna pause it right
now<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.470> basically<00:03:28.920> what<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.070> did<00:03:29.190> was<00:03:29.520> I

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
now so basically what I did was I

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.990 
now so basically what I did was I
planned<00:03:30.060> out<00:03:30.240> all<00:03:30.450> these<00:03:30.600> little<00:03:30.810> dots<00:03:31.170> uh<00:03:32.000> for

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
planned out all these little dots uh for

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.250 
planned out all these little dots uh for
weather<00:03:33.150> beats<00:03:33.420> would<00:03:33.600> go<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.870> then<00:03:33.990> I<00:03:34.020> press

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
weather beats would go and then I press

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.990 
weather beats would go and then I press
the<00:03:34.440> play<00:03:34.620> button<00:03:34.650> I'm<00:03:35.160> not<00:03:35.550> sure<00:03:35.610> what<00:03:35.910> all

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
the play button I'm not sure what all

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.270 
the play button I'm not sure what all
this<00:03:36.209> does<00:03:36.510> I'll<00:03:36.959> probably<00:03:37.500> figure<00:03:37.920> out<00:03:38.070> that

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
this does I'll probably figure out that

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.310 
this does I'll probably figure out that
figured<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.240> out<00:03:39.270> later<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.140> want

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
figured that out later and if you want

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.860 
figured that out later and if you want
to<00:03:40.410> know<00:03:40.530> I'll<00:03:40.800> maybe<00:03:41.790> make<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.180> tutorial<00:03:42.570> on

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
to know I'll maybe make a tutorial on

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.370 
to know I'll maybe make a tutorial on
that<00:03:43.110> maybe<00:03:44.480> anyway<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:45.750> as<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.050> can<00:03:46.170> see

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
that maybe anyway but as you can see

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.510 
that maybe anyway but as you can see
this<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.709> very<00:03:46.980> visually<00:03:47.700> based<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.630> um<00:03:49.520> yeah

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
this is very visually based so um yeah

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.050 
this is very visually based so um yeah
it<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:51.330> helps<00:03:51.810> if<00:03:51.989> you're<00:03:52.140> beginning<00:03:52.650> is
