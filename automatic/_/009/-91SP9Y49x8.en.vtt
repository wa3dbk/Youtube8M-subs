I just go up one and two three four five
now<00:02:50.880> my<00:02:50.940> machine<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.450> all<00:02:51.600> set<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.680> put<00:02:52.830> my

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
now my machine is all set so I put my

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.620 
now my machine is all set so I put my
foot<00:02:53.069> on<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.400> foot<00:02:53.519> peddling<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.150> second

foot on the foot peddling just a second

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.780 
foot on the foot peddling just a second
but<00:02:55.049> if<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.290> cross<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.739> locking<00:02:56.160> stitch<00:02:56.549> at

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
but if I cross this locking stitch at

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.100 
but if I cross this locking stitch at
the<00:02:56.850> front<00:02:57.120> here

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
the front here

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.440 
the front here
the<00:02:59.740> machine<00:03:00.070> will<00:03:00.250> make<00:03:00.400> four<00:03:00.730> or<00:03:00.760> five<00:03:01.120> very

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the machine will make four or five very

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.930 
the machine will make four or five very
tiny<00:03:01.810> stitches<00:03:02.170> all<00:03:02.440> in<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.950> same<00:03:03.160> spot<00:03:03.640> so

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
tiny stitches all in the same spot so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.880 
tiny stitches all in the same spot so
you<00:03:04.330> don't<00:03:04.780> see<00:03:05.050> those<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:05.500> not<00:03:05.650> like<00:03:05.770> you're

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
you don't see those it's not like you're

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.290 
you don't see those it's not like you're
going<00:03:06.010> backwards<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.550> forwards<00:03:06.910> which<00:03:07.030> can

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
going backwards and forwards which can

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.810 
going backwards and forwards which can
distort<00:03:07.690> your<00:03:07.810> stitching<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:09.040> away<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.430> go<00:03:09.550> so

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
distort your stitching so away we go so
