00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.339
 as part of the skoda fabia new project in 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.319
 spotlight autocentre continues 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.090
 prepare technical diaries in which 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.660
 we give answers to our questions 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.969
 readers 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.630
 Today we answer the third 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.630
 a series of questions 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.939
 skoda fabia third generation 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.220
 a new 1 liter engine is being installed 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.129
 seek leaders for the Ukrainian market 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.890
 This unit is offered in 75 strong 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.750
 performance with torque 95 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.300
 newton meters wide rpm 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.790
 at the heart of this engine is a new modular 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.309
 volkswagen mqb motor platform 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.699
 family of units with an abbreviation and 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.650
 hey 211 new motor has aluminum 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.449
 cylinder block with cast iron sleeves and 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.739
 aluminum block head with four 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.110
 valves per cylinder 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.000
 crankshaft six counterweights 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.710
 which together with the engine cushions 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.340
 special designs allowed 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.149
 eliminate the occurrence of vibrations inherent 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.340
 unbalanced three cylinder 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.530
 units thanks to this succeeded 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.910
 eliminate the need to equip the motor 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.009
 balance equal shafts 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.840
 despite the fact that one liter engine has 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.490
 classic power system with 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.560
 distributed fuel injection 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.830
 there is a lot of intake manifold 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.910
 new interesting technical solutions 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.800
 the exhaust manifold is fluid 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.580
 cooling and mounted in the cylinder head 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.170
 cylinders 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.000
 toothed belt drive 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.950
 gas distribution mechanism in 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.840
 this engine as in other engines 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.099
 new hobby is designed for the entire period 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.289
 unit service 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:37.300
 krm in this motor has a mechanism 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.429
 variable valve timing 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.009
 it is mounted on the camshaft 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.649
 intake valves cooling system 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.569
 divided into two circuits one cools 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.319
 cylinder block and the second cylinder head 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.030
 cylinders 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.099
 This unit complies 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.770
 environmental standards Euro-6 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:56.080
 it can run on fuel a 95 though 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.420
 short term use of lower 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.259
 octane gasoline a-92 yet 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.259
 valid 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.880
 new skoda fabia is equipped 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.760
 classic hydraulic brake 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.440
 system of two contours difference from 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.360
 systems predecessors lies in 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.720
 there are several additional options 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.640
 enhancing the safety of the car so in 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.750
 emergency electronic system 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.060
 help hb 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.790
 and when fil prepare the entire hydraulic system to 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.980
 emergency braking recognized 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.500
 such situations on the speed of release 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.390
 gas pedal preparation is 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.340
 creating a slight pressure in the system 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.340
 which speeds up further operation 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.190
 brakes also brake system 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.250
 equipped with a rpc function which is drying 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.840
 brake pads and discs with a certain 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.820
 periodicity regardless 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.890
 it rains on the hydronic module 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.780
 brake system command for the supply 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.810
 brake shoes closer to the brake 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.430
 disc light touch pad disc 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.740
 allows you to get rid of moisture on their 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.480
 surfaces it also cuts 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.570
 emergency stopping distance 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.570
 braking 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.470
 unlike the standard system 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.240
 conditioning which they 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.720
 control the air temperature in 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.790
 salon 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.940
 climatronic system automatically 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.740
 maintains the set temperature block 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.690
 control of this system analyzes not 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.580
 only given temperature sensors in 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.530
 cabin but also from the light sensor 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.210
 which controls saturation 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.090
 sunlight coming in 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.070
 car light sensor installed 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.380
 under the windshield of the top of the panel 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.120
 instruments with it climatic 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.420
 the system more flexibly regulates 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.170
 car temperature 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.210
 climatronic innovation 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.310
 installed in the new skoda fabia 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.170
 is the air humidity sensor in 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.070
 cabin which is located in the mirror 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.860
 rear view 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.570
 it serves to control the dew point then 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.820
 There is a temperature at which on the glass 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.880
 condensation begins to appear and easier 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.320
 saying the glass start to fog up 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.270
 to prevent glass misting 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.130
 climatronic system adjusts the flow 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.580
 air on the glass and includes air conditioning 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.350
 which dries the air in the cabin so 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.510
 climatronic eliminates the likelihood 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.470
 misting of the windshield and forms 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.880
 cabin more comfortable microclimate 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.080
 there are differences in the compressor 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.420
 air conditioner 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.610
 skoda fabia second generation for 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.680
 fuel economy air conditioning accounted for 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.000
 manually turn off with the button on 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.460
 instrument panels 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.440
 in the new fabia system climatronic with 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.930
 the humidity sensor turns off the compressor 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.760
 automatically so the system is constantly 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.000
 saves fuel in no need 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.770
 manual adjustment off button 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.020
 air conditioning in the climatronic system 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.000
 is in the same place and also 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.140
 allows forcibly in manual mode 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.210
 turn off the compressor also on the big 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.010
 speed in the new skoda Fabia is triggered 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.520
 penetration protection 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.840
 excess air 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.850
 this is ensured by switching work 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.340
 interior ventilation systems from mode 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.740
 air supply outside the intake mode 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.660
 air from the cabin 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.910
 This reduces the noise of the system 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.910
 ventilation and increases comfort
