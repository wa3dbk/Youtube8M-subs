00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
when I'm stirring it not only is it

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.310 
when I'm stirring it not only is it
getting<00:01:35.240> cold<00:01:35.270> it's<00:01:35.630> actually<00:01:35.900> picking<00:01:36.080> up<00:01:36.260> a

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
getting cold it's actually picking up a

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.080 
getting cold it's actually picking up a
little<00:01:36.380> bit<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.620> water<00:01:36.800> as<00:01:36.920> well<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.850> it's<00:01:38.000> not

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
little bit of water as well so it's not

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.430 
little bit of water as well so it's not
really<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.360> cocktail<00:01:38.810> it'll<00:01:39.080> picks<00:01:39.230> up<00:01:39.320> that

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
really a cocktail it'll picks up that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.660 
really a cocktail it'll picks up that
water<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:39.830> kind<00:01:39.980> of<00:01:40.010> smooth<00:01:40.250> everything<00:01:40.490> out

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
water to kind of smooth everything out

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.100 
water to kind of smooth everything out
all<00:01:41.180> right<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:41.390> we're<00:01:41.510> stirred<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.930> now<00:01:41.990> we're

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
all right so we're stirred and now we're

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.450 
all right so we're stirred and now we're
pouring<00:01:42.350> yeah<00:01:42.770> now<00:01:42.920> we're<00:01:43.040> gonna<00:01:43.130> strain<00:01:43.430> it

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
pouring yeah now we're gonna strain it

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.730 
pouring yeah now we're gonna strain it
over<00:01:43.760> this<00:01:43.880> really<00:01:44.210> big<00:01:44.510> rock<00:01:44.720> right<00:01:44.960> here<00:01:44.990> the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
over this really big rock right here the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.080 
over this really big rock right here the
reason<00:01:45.860> why<00:01:45.980> we<00:01:46.100> have<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.250> big<00:01:46.310> piece<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.640> ice<00:01:46.820> is

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
reason why we have a big piece of ice is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.240 
reason why we have a big piece of ice is
because<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:47.930> keeps<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.200> drink<00:01:48.410> nice<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:48.830> cold

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
because it keeps the drink nice and cold

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.190 
because it keeps the drink nice and cold
it<00:01:49.730> also<00:01:49.910> dilutes<00:01:50.330> very<00:01:50.570> little<00:01:50.870> so<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.050> don't

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
it also dilutes very little so you don't

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.330 
it also dilutes very little so you don't
have<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.350> worry<00:01:51.500> about<00:01:51.590> having<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:51.920> water<00:01:52.130> down

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
have to worry about having to water down

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.530 
have to worry about having to water down
talked<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.760> a<00:01:52.790> lot<00:01:52.910> of<00:01:53.000> time<00:01:53.120> you've<00:01:53.240> done

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
I know there's one last component that's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.010 
I know there's one last component that's
