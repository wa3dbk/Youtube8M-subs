 he is running because he is in a hurry and 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.660
 I remember the issue is security almost 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.910
 I agree 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.890

 peje egg the theme I repeat the security 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.080
 run time I do have an opinion 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.420
 Insecurity is given for a reason and nothing 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.580
 more for money so I've decided 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.740
 take all the money to avoid 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.530
 problem and do not worry about us 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.680

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.670
