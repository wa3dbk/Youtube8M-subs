00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 It does not matter if you have a lightweight Marmaras. 

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:40.400
 From here we go as usual. 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.300
 I will change to Fireborn sansinger in preparation for the auger. 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.500
 At the same time, I also change the special frame into a powerful sniper rifle. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.400
 I did a shortcut with Boyd Walker but just forgot to change the class ^ ^; 

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:05.500
 The auger will die in an instant when it gets close because the firepower is high and it doesn't get lost. 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.200
 Therefore, I think that a sense of security will increase somewhat if there is a fire bone because a mistake of the attack is not forgiven so much in the auger game. 

00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:26.000
 I was helped by the two Gallas ... 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.000
 The rest is clear as usual. 

00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:50.500
 I think it would be nice to be able to get around six head shots of SR before hitting Lokeran. 

00:05:51.312 --> 00:05:56.300
 I thought it was quite tough without the level 32. (It was impossible for me ...) 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.800
 It was an awful play, but it would be appreciated if it would be helpful to solo players. 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.900
 Thank you for your viewing
