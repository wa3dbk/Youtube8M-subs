for<00:02:12.530> me<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.650> apply<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.099> foundation<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.819> just

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
for me to apply that foundation it just

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.390 
for me to apply that foundation it just
because<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.410> needed<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.770> thinnest<00:02:16.130> coat

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
because I just needed the thinnest coat

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.979 
because I just needed the thinnest coat
and<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.819> don't<00:02:16.880> know<00:02:17.060> what<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.390> about<00:02:17.599> the

fingers<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:18.980> it's<00:02:19.099> definitely<00:02:19.280> better<00:02:19.640> than

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
fingers but it's definitely better than

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.809 
fingers but it's definitely better than
sponges<00:02:20.599> or<00:02:20.870> brushes<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:24.580> what<00:02:25.580> I'm<00:02:25.670> going<00:02:25.790> to

I won't use this just because the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.770 
I won't use this just because the
hormones<00:04:29.920> are<00:04:30.100> shifting<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:31.000> it's<00:04:31.270> not<00:04:31.450> it's

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
hormones are shifting and it's not it's

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.420 
hormones are shifting and it's not it's
my<00:04:32.290> skin's<00:04:32.560> looking<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.830> little<00:04:33.040> bit<00:04:33.130> duller

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
my skin's looking a little bit duller

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.760 
my skin's looking a little bit duller
that's<00:04:34.150> not<00:04:34.360> when<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:34.540> will<00:04:34.810> use<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.260> at<00:04:35.560> all

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
that's not when I will use this at all

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.520 
that's not when I will use this at all
so<00:04:36.070> I'm<00:04:36.910> actually<00:04:37.090> really<00:04:37.330> really<00:04:37.870> glad<00:04:38.290> now

so I'm actually really really glad now
and<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.860> don't<00:04:39.070> think<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.370> was<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.520> waste<00:04:39.760> of

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
and I don't think it was a waste of

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.940 
and I don't think it was a waste of
money<00:04:40.120> like<00:04:40.450> I<00:04:40.480> had<00:04:40.720> did<00:04:40.930> like<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:41.680> felt
