00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
way and the thing about it is you use

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.160 
way and the thing about it is you use
these<00:00:38.880> these<00:00:39.880> two<00:00:40.270> different<00:00:40.570> chemicals<00:00:41.220> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
these these two different chemicals to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.040 
these these two different chemicals to
brush<00:00:44.170> on<00:00:44.440> or<00:00:44.880> use<00:00:45.880> any<00:00:46.390> kind<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.690> tool<00:00:46.840> you

really<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:47.440> apply<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:47.950> and<00:00:48.190> they<00:00:48.820> cause<00:00:49.090> those

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
really to apply it and they cause those

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.930 
really to apply it and they cause those
patterns<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.710> develop<00:00:51.160> to<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.550> point<00:00:51.610> where

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
patterns to develop to the point where

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.850 
patterns to develop to the point where
they<00:00:52.030> can<00:00:52.210> be<00:00:52.410> photographically<00:00:53.410> reproduced

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
they can be photographically reproduced

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.650 
they can be photographically reproduced
and<00:00:54.160> back<00:00:54.610> when<00:00:54.790> we<00:00:54.880> started<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.329> turtle

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
start with a blank piece of paper and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.660 
start with a blank piece of paper and
you<00:01:44.200> end<00:01:44.409> up<00:01:44.560> with<00:01:44.740> something<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.340> know<00:01:45.520> that

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
you end up with something you know that

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.499 
you end up with something you know that
didn't<00:01:46.150> exist<00:01:46.420> before<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:47.350> just<00:01:47.560> sort<00:01:47.799> of

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
didn't exist before and it just sort of

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.170 
didn't exist before and it just sort of
emerges<00:01:49.509> out<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.900> that<00:01:50.079> sort<00:01:50.799> of<00:01:50.860> void<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
emerges out of that sort of void of the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.880 
emerges out of that sort of void of the
paper<00:01:52.420> and<00:01:52.990> an<00:01:53.110> almost<00:01:53.680> magical<00:01:53.920> way<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
paper and an almost magical way and

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.350 
paper and an almost magical way and
that's<00:01:57.040> always<00:01:57.310> been

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
that's always been

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.540 
that's always been
really<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.720> great<00:01:58.960> pleasure<00:01:59.320> for<00:01:59.500> me<00:01:59.740> another

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
really a great pleasure for me another

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.850 
really a great pleasure for me another
cool<00:02:00.910> thing<00:02:00.940> about<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.960> dual<00:02:02.200> shade<00:02:02.500> at

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
cool thing about the the dual shade at

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.780 
cool thing about the the dual shade at
that<00:02:03.040> time<00:02:03.430> that<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:04.240> we<00:02:04.540> did<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:06.550> we<00:02:06.640> did

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
that time that we we did it that we did

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.060 
that time that we we did it that we did
those<00:02:06.910> first<00:02:07.180> books<00:02:07.480> it<00:02:08.170> was<00:02:08.350> not<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.590> technique

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
those first books it was not a technique

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.040 
those first books it was not a technique
that<00:02:09.130> was<00:02:09.369> being<00:02:09.580> used<00:02:09.880> very<00:02:10.179> much<00:02:10.450> for<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
that was being used very much for the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.810 
that was being used very much for the
first<00:02:11.320> I<00:02:11.470> think<00:02:11.680> probably<00:02:12.340> about<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.640> first

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
first I think probably about the first

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.250 
first I think probably about the first
ten<00:02:13.090> issues<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.660> was<00:02:13.750> almost<00:02:14.080> all<00:02:14.520> either

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
ten issues it was almost all either

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.460 
ten issues it was almost all either
brush<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.500> ink<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.160> or<00:02:19.110> pen<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.320> ink

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
brush and ink like this or pen and ink

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.020 
brush and ink like this or pen and ink
you<00:02:20.680> know<00:02:20.770> dipping<00:02:21.160> pens<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.670> ink<00:02:21.850> and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
you know dipping pens and ink and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.170 
you know dipping pens and ink and
occasionally<00:02:22.990> like<00:02:23.890> for<00:02:24.100> some<00:02:24.280> like<00:02:24.670> robots

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
occasionally like for some like robots

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.970 
occasionally like for some like robots
or<00:02:25.420> stuff<00:02:25.930> like<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.260> we<00:02:26.470> would<00:02:26.650> use<00:02:28.980> Statler

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
or stuff like that we would use Statler

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.180 
or stuff like that we would use Statler
Mars<00:02:30.220> for<00:02:31.030> pity<00:02:31.209> graph<00:02:31.480> pens<00:02:32.080> if<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:32.950> made<00:02:33.160> a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
Mars for pity graph pens if you made a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.490 
Mars for pity graph pens if you made a
mistake<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.940> inking<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:35.170> had<00:02:35.350> to

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
mistake in the inking and you had to

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.010 
mistake in the inking and you had to
white<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.830> out<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.820> spot<00:02:37.330> where<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.840> had

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
white it out that spot where you had

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.920 
white it out that spot where you had
waited<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.470> out<00:02:38.590> was<00:02:39.370> no<00:02:39.580> longer<00:02:40.060> really<00:02:40.630> do<00:02:40.900> a

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
waited it out was no longer really do a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.810 
waited it out was no longer really do a
shade<00:02:41.230> because<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.310> whiteout<00:02:42.520> would

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
shade because the the whiteout would

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.000 
shade because the the whiteout would
cover<00:02:43.120> up<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.780> peptone<00:02:44.200> pattern<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:44.800> when<00:02:44.890> you

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
cover up the peptone pattern so when you

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.340 
cover up the peptone pattern so when you
went<00:02:45.250> over<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.489> with<00:02:45.520> tones<00:02:45.850> there'd<00:02:46.540> be<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.720> big

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
went over it with tones there'd be a big

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.470 
went over it with tones there'd be a big
blob<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:48.100> where<00:02:48.430> you're<00:02:48.670> where<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.330> had

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
blob there where you're where you had

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.840 
blob there where you're where you had
whited<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.930> out<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:51.130> we<00:02:51.280> learned<00:02:51.489> fairly

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
whited it out and so we learned fairly

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.699 
whited it out and so we learned fairly
quickly<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.540> had<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.810> be<00:02:52.959> very<00:02:53.230> careful

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
quickly that you had to be very careful

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.860 
quickly that you had to be very careful
when<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.070> inking<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.540> magic

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
when the inking and this is the magic

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.949 
when the inking and this is the magic
part<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.550> always<00:02:57.550> love<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.360> way<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.660> this

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
part I always love the way this this

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.330 
part I always love the way this this
works<00:02:59.260> you<00:03:00.250> just<00:03:00.489> put<00:03:00.700> your<00:03:01.890> brush<00:03:02.890> in<00:03:03.070> there

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
works you just put your brush in there

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:11.880 
works you just put your brush in there
you<00:03:04.120> start<00:03:04.540> going

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.880 

and<00:03:12.370> as<00:03:12.520> you<00:03:12.640> can<00:03:12.760> see<00:03:13.000> almost<00:03:13.990> immediately

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
and as you can see almost immediately

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.520 
and as you can see almost immediately
that<00:03:15.850> develops<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:17.710> tone<00:03:18.210> it<00:03:19.210> is<00:03:19.990> a<00:03:20.020> great<00:03:20.350> way

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
that develops the tone it is a great way

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.690 
that develops the tone it is a great way
to<00:03:20.560> get<00:03:20.860> gray<00:03:21.730> tones<00:03:22.090> with<00:03:22.900> essentially<00:03:23.710> just

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
to get gray tones with essentially just

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:45.650 
to get gray tones with essentially just
black<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.000> white<00:03:25.210> art

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660
