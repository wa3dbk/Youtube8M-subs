there we go I'll get the original
battery<00:01:48.550> out<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.360> I<00:01:49.480> can<00:01:49.720> compare<00:01:50.080> with

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
battery out so that I can compare with

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.240

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
you and you guys the actual the actual

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.400 
you and you guys the actual the actual
differences<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.720> go<00:01:55.870> this<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.110> old

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
differences so you go this is the old

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.800 
differences so you go this is the old
battery<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.010> is<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.340> new<00:01:57.640> battery<00:01:58.120> so

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
battery and this is the new battery so

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.480 
battery and this is the new battery so
the<00:01:59.350> the<00:02:00.190> numbers<00:02:00.850> are<00:02:01.740> identical<00:02:02.740> as<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.370> can

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
the the numbers are identical as you can

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.350 
the the numbers are identical as you can
see<00:02:03.610> it's<00:02:04.050> 2,100<00:02:05.050> milliamps<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:07.090> serial

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
see it's 2,100 milliamps the serial

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.920 
see it's 2,100 milliamps the serial
number<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.780> C<00:02:08.110> will<00:02:08.740> be<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:09.700> little<00:02:10.660> different

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
number of C will be a little different

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.830 
number of C will be a little different
but<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.040> build<00:02:12.460> date<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:12.970> also<00:02:13.270> different<00:02:13.660> as

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
but the build date is also different as

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.230 
but the build date is also different as
you<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.080> see<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.500> on<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:15.220> fifth<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.850> the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
you can see this is on the fifth of the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.080 
you can see this is on the fifth of the
10th<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.810> May<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.950> it's<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> 24th<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.830> of

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
10th of May and it's the 24th of of

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.570 
10th of May and it's the 24th of of
April<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.960> as<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.560> can<00:02:23.650> see<00:02:23.800> there's<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> back

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
April so as you can see there's the back

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.030 
April so as you can see there's the back
of<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.790> batteries<00:02:25.180> again<00:02:26.110> exactly<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.740> same

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
of the batteries again exactly the same

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.540 
of the batteries again exactly the same
as<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.700> old<00:02:27.850> one<00:02:27.970> that's<00:02:28.270> new<00:02:28.510> one<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
as the old one that's new one and so the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.240 
as the old one that's new one and so the
new<00:02:30.730> one<00:02:30.940> I'll<00:02:31.150> put<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:31.510> now<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.890> first

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
new one I'll put it in now and the first

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.390 
new one I'll put it in now and the first
time<00:02:33.459> I'll<00:02:33.580> be<00:02:33.670> putting<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.060> actually<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.600> I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
time I'll be putting it actually in I

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.449 
time I'll be putting it actually in I
haven't<00:02:36.400> had<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.760> use<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.209> in<00:02:37.450> fact<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:39.250> you

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
haven't had to use it in fact so as you

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.460 
haven't had to use it in fact so as you
can<00:02:39.550> see<00:02:39.760> now<00:02:40.060> I've<00:02:40.510> got<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.680> extra<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
can see now I've got the extra the the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.550 
can see now I've got the extra the the
stands<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.570> I've<00:02:46.570> got<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.870> extra<00:02:47.170> battery

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
stands and I've got the extra battery

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.530 
stands and I've got the extra battery
and<00:02:47.800> now<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.950> extra<00:02:48.280> battery<00:02:48.459> can<00:02:48.850> be<00:02:48.880> charged

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
and now the extra battery can be charged

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.120 
and now the extra battery can be charged
whilst<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:50.050> am<00:02:50.080> still<00:02:50.470> using<00:02:50.739> my<00:02:51.130> galaxy<00:02:51.900> s3

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
whilst I am still using my galaxy s3

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.650 
whilst I am still using my galaxy s3
normally<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.280> would<00:02:54.400> have<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:55.180> problem<00:02:55.540> of

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
normally you would have the problem of

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.449 
normally you would have the problem of
you<00:02:55.959> have<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.260> put<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.470> battery<00:02:56.800> inside<00:02:57.190> to

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
you have to put the battery inside to

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.130 
you have to put the battery inside to
make<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.610> charge<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.570> as<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.690> can<00:02:58.810> see<00:02:58.959> there

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
make it charge so as you can see there

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.420 
make it charge so as you can see there
is<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.440> 99%<00:03:00.989> after<00:03:01.989> me<00:03:02.470> scanning<00:03:02.890> finishes

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
is on 99% after me scanning finishes

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.850 
is on 99% after me scanning finishes
there<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:03.670> go<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:03.940> 99%<00:03:04.750> right<00:03:05.140> there<00:03:05.380> so<00:03:07.860> there

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
there you go is 99% right there so there

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.520 
there you go is 99% right there so there
we<00:03:09.040> go<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.940> so<00:03:10.269> there<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.570> stand<00:03:10.959> now<00:03:11.260> so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
we go and so there is a stand now so

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.350 
we go and so there is a stand now so
that<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.709> stand<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.100> pretty<00:03:12.310> cool<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.790> don't

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
that the stand is pretty cool you don't

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.940 
that the stand is pretty cool you don't
have<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.690> have<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:13.989> little<00:03:14.170> flip<00:03:14.530> up<00:03:14.680> thing

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
have to have this little flip up thing

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.540 
have to have this little flip up thing
over<00:03:15.610> there<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.590> would<00:03:17.830> suggest<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.370> if

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
over there but I would suggest it if

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.460 
over there but I would suggest it if
you're<00:03:18.730> putting<00:03:19.120> your<00:03:19.239> phone<00:03:19.420> down<00:03:19.720> like<00:03:20.050> so

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
you're putting your phone down like so

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.410 
you're putting your phone down like so
so<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.310> stands<00:03:21.610> like<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.239> doesn't

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
so it stands like that and it doesn't

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.720 
so it stands like that and it doesn't
fall<00:03:22.750> off<00:03:22.959> it's<00:03:23.140> pretty<00:03:23.350> good<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.769> it's

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
fall off it's pretty good and it's

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.340 
fall off it's pretty good and it's
reasonably<00:03:25.209> steady<00:03:25.420> but<00:03:25.690> if<00:03:25.810> someone<00:03:26.140> just

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
reasonably steady but if someone just

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.390 
reasonably steady but if someone just
clicks<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:27.070> your<00:03:27.489> your<00:03:27.820> Galaxy<00:03:28.209> s3<00:03:28.300> will<00:03:28.750> fall

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
clicks it your your Galaxy s3 will fall

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.949 
clicks it your your Galaxy s3 will fall
obviously<00:03:30.400> there<00:03:30.489> is<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.610> other<00:03:30.970> way<00:03:31.810> of

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
obviously there is the other way of

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.840 
obviously there is the other way of
putting<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.290> like<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:32.860> which<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.519> quite<00:03:33.820> good

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
putting it like so which is quite good

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.060 
putting it like so which is quite good
now<00:03:34.600> we<00:03:34.660> bring<00:03:34.870> down<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.200> camera<00:03:37.830> there<00:03:38.830> we<00:03:38.920> go

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
now we bring down the camera there we go

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.790 
now we bring down the camera there we go
and<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.340> now<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.000> can<00:03:40.300> go<00:03:41.110> in<00:03:41.260> landscape<00:03:41.769> mode

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
and so now you can go in landscape mode

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.160 
and so now you can go in landscape mode
and<00:03:42.250> browse<00:03:43.150> around<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.660> haven't<00:03:43.900> got<00:03:44.019> auto

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
and browse around I haven't got auto

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.410 
and browse around I haven't got auto
rotation<00:03:44.620> that's<00:03:45.070> why<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.400> not<00:03:45.550> rotating

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
rotation that's why it's not rotating

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.900 
rotation that's why it's not rotating
but<00:03:46.959> that's<00:03:47.500> pretty<00:03:47.709> cool<00:03:47.980> for<00:03:48.220> say<00:03:48.459> watching

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
but that's pretty cool for say watching

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.000 
but that's pretty cool for say watching
videos<00:03:49.269> or<00:03:49.510> browsing<00:03:49.870> or<00:03:50.139> even<00:03:50.380> gaming<00:03:50.920> you

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
videos or browsing or even gaming you

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.360 
videos or browsing or even gaming you
can<00:03:51.040> get

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
can get

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.100 
can get
pretty<00:03:51.670> well<00:03:51.879> like<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:52.330> although<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:52.959> still

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
pretty well like that although I still

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.259 
pretty well like that although I still
prefer<00:03:53.470> holding<00:03:54.099> in<00:03:54.220> my<00:03:54.340> hands<00:03:54.549> like<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.730> like<00:03:55.239> a

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
prefer holding in my hands like a like a

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.330 
prefer holding in my hands like a like a
controller<00:03:56.170> almost<00:03:56.799> so<00:03:57.489> that's<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.390> stand

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
controller almost so that's the stand

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.280 
controller almost so that's the stand
unfortunately<00:04:00.340> this<00:04:00.670> has<00:04:00.909> no<00:04:01.290> additional

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
unfortunately this has no additional

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.699 
unfortunately this has no additional
charging<00:04:03.269> there's<00:04:04.269> no<00:04:04.420> charging<00:04:05.230> dock<00:04:05.440> I

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
charging there's no charging dock I

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.380 
charging there's no charging dock I
would<00:04:06.459> have<00:04:06.549> liked<00:04:06.819> if<00:04:06.970> there<00:04:07.090> was<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.209> little

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
would have liked if there was a little

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.930 
would have liked if there was a little
charging<00:04:07.840> dock<00:04:08.019> so<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:08.409> almost<00:04:08.650> dual<00:04:09.370> charged

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
charging dock so it almost dual charged

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.670 
charging dock so it almost dual charged
above<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.629> battery<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.260> battery<00:04:11.290> in<00:04:11.650> the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
above the battery and the battery in the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.220 
above the battery and the battery in the
galaxy<00:04:12.099> s3<00:04:12.430> or<00:04:12.640> if<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.360> battery<00:04:13.510> wasn't<00:04:13.840> in<00:04:14.079> it

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
galaxy s3 or if the battery wasn't in it
