00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.880
 hi how are you today I want to show you the 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.730
 neil collector dust collector 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.820
 for the nails so that we do not get 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.820
 so much I just bought it in 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.079
 the base I liked is like a sponge 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.710
 appointment so it's very comfortable comes with 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:27.229
 some bags that are these that these 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.710
 they put in the part of down here and that 

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:32.320
 look there as you are seeing it so that 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.830
 all the pole 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.830
 fall there 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.890
 let's do a little detail only 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.500
 if you think she is very crushed 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.780
 the bag we just have to put a 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.940
 little height in this part 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.210
 so that we have space 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.860
 our bag and so the dust does not 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.410
 come back as he shows you to 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.600
 then what it measures only I'm going to 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.130
 put as a base appointment can be very 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.860
 pretty or something that you put 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.020
 here and then you will have more 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.840
 our space 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.609
 when in this bag what I'm going to 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.420
 show you how it works with a fingernail 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:24.610
 here I have is a nail that says what 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.610
 we learn ok 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:48.820
 our look 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.820
 the world is falling 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.920
 down here not here you can not see 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.979
 plus 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.909
 in another case if it is with lime also 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.909
 let's do here 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.630
 in colima I feel that everything is going towards 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.470
 down because with the denim that back is to 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.680
 another speed and many times if you 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.040
 we do very fast 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.239
 it goes to the other side the dust but what 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.340
 you have to know that I liked 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.189
 because most of the dust although we 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.439
 fall in this part or come a 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:34.859
 little to the hands most 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:37.489
 cane that I remove is showing it here 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.489
 I put it 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.760
 shots 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.760
 everything is absorbing 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.220
 it did not turn off 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.770
 and then I'll show you how it is 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.220
 what if the dust 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.610
 most 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.480
 fall first 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.660
 this is this one is the dust of another 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.410
 nail and 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.750
 that I had been 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.870
 I do not know if you reach there to appreciate 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.630
 ok then you want to say 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.180
 that if it works is super good 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.450
 and I hope your soon you can have the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.420
 yours since it's not very expensive and also 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.470
 that does not prevent all the dust from 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.470
 is entering the lungs and that 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.470
 Thank you
