around as he hits the ball that gives
him<00:00:48.680> good<00:00:48.890> balance<00:00:49.570> there's<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.900> lift<00:00:51.140> and

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
him good balance there's the lift and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.100 
him good balance there's the lift and
let's<00:00:52.010> watch<00:00:52.369> the<00:00:52.640> rapid<00:00:53.119> acceleration<00:00:53.479> on

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
let's watch the rapid acceleration on

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.119 
let's watch the rapid acceleration on
contact<00:00:54.710> that<00:00:55.280> gives<00:00:55.519> you<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.729> power

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
contact that gives you the power

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.039 
contact that gives you the power
sometimes<00:00:58.129> he<00:00:58.309> even<00:00:58.339> uses<00:00:58.879> a<00:00:59.150> loop<00:00:59.420> back<00:00:59.689> swing

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
sometimes he even uses a loop back swing

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.590 
sometimes he even uses a loop back swing
but<00:01:00.470> normally<00:01:00.949> it's<00:01:01.129> a<00:01:01.250> straight<00:01:01.519> back<00:01:01.760> but

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
but normally it's a straight back but

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.079 
but normally it's a straight back but
whatever<00:01:02.839> facts<00:01:03.379> when<00:01:03.650> he<00:01:03.830> uses<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:04.790> the

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
whatever facts when he uses it's the

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.109 
whatever facts when he uses it's the
quick<00:01:05.360> hip<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:05.990> shoulder<00:01:06.380> rotation<00:01:07.220> hands

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
quick hip and shoulder rotation hands

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.200 
quick hip and shoulder rotation hands
work<00:01:08.330> together<00:01:08.540> but<00:01:09.500> on<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.860> contact<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.850> top

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
work together but on the contact the top

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.780 
work together but on the contact the top
hand<00:01:11.600> is<00:01:11.750> going<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.229> do<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.500> work<00:01:12.710> it's<00:01:13.370> going

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
hand is going to do the work it's going

hand is going to do the work it's going
to<00:01:13.910> accelerate<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.810> racket<00:01:15.200> head<00:01:15.320> through

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
to accelerate that racket head through

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.680 
to accelerate that racket head through
the<00:01:15.710> ball<00:01:15.920> some<00:01:16.580> of<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:16.820> go<00:01:16.970> out<00:01:17.180> towards<00:01:17.600> the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
the ball some of you go out towards the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.420 
the ball some of you go out towards the
target<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.290> wrap<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.620> around<00:01:18.710> your<00:01:18.980> shoulder

as he gets back to position he never

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.820 
as he gets back to position he never
takes<00:01:22.670> his<00:01:22.880> eye<00:01:23.180> off<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.720> ball<00:01:23.930> he<00:01:24.530> watches
