00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:04.779
 is 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.150
 20 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.880
 friends avatar 2 and good morning everyone 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.849
 hehe today or we would like to stay briefly he is the new android e 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.660
 two. one on motorola milestone I was updated a few hours ago 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.439
 so I haven't yet had the chance to explore the system I wanted 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.120
 just to let you see how the master works with this new system 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.220
 operating 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.540
 practically it is the first thing that is noticed was introduced from the from which he wants 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.140
 to say 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.300
 which are now basically basic 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.729
 all we have to do is naruto sud 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.480
 on the display 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.350
 select the juve wallpapers backgrounds and here is where all the will appear 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.289
 typical android and two wallpapers. one then Arab water e 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:55.379
 whatever 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.710
 note that although the update is a wiser sign motorola I have not 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.059
 still relais chateaux officially but we can download it from the internet 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.630
 install it without problems 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.540
 and the backgrounds are still not been optimized I have tried and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.659
 a few weeks ago with the rom pulsar 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.390
 and then given directing shots as you see the shots are still there 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.710
 despite the young woman who was developed by motorola 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.869
 so when change interface mode the background will click 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.220
 it also features interactive use for which it is small 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.530
 rt lei the background does not interact was no reaction instead with the rom 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.729
 pulsar of some time ago the backgrounds that were active 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.409
 so another problem 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.210
 of this of this stuff as you see the high part of the display we have 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.750
 button elements that we indicate inea frame screen we are now we are 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.100
 in the fifth and fourth intranet 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.600
 note that there are not only 5 with customizable screens - we have pine 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.330
 a9 in fact we hear inaudi display number of initial panels that we can 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.200
 choose even 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.579
 so we are not limited to 5 we go to those who die to information on the phone 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.239
 it is Rome 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.540
 2nd. 1 Apr 21 which was released a few hours ago by motorola 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.499
 is 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.749
 let's see a moment of the main menu because we have some 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.920
 this case also new 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.619
 hack appears assistance center 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.619
 and in compartments the voice commands icon 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.689
 who loves 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.809
 home 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.709
 ogay as you can see now is calling home then 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.709
 sex in the city and it's cheap 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:13.519
 so as you can see it is the function of that voice search and therefore comments 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.860
 voice commands excellently introduced 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.120
 among other innovations we have kuler - completely new camera 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.929
 let's start it here here 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:27.299
 emp now we can have all the settings on this side and we can 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.989
 taking pictures practically fine was writing we no longer have bars 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.010
 side you want us to get 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.310
 and in the display of images 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.410
 we have these various training sessions before then negative black and white e 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.410
 whatever 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:48.099
 as I said it has changed - camera and now camera and video camera have 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.039
 two emms let's say two separate sections in fact if we want to turn on the 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.109
 camcorder we have another dedicated button 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.180
 here is the menu is very similar we always have various aspects that given by 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.119
 to be able to apply to our child 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:07.030
 among other novelties with omg functions stretcher 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.210
 which will allow us to manage practically 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.310
 the with a single interface between bari and commands then music contacts 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.720
 ability to view the map 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.049
 via google maps omlola blog 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.860
 bluetooth that how to get back to the home so a function enough 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.259
 comfortable 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.409
 let's try to set another background for a moment 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.409
 just to see how it behaves 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.279
 let's try it was magical 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.169
 in this case via romea 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.539
 don't go jerky and note that I respect the pulsar and it's not we don't have 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.800
 plus automatic download rotation 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.249
 so the aura only turns when we open the keyboard 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.419
 in the messages I note that 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.529
 then excuse me for a moment in the messages I point out 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:01.619
 that during the querty keyboard digestion we will have suggestions 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.259
 now I don't know if this was timid patience because I come from one 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.659
 convulsive, however, I find this voice quite comfortable 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.120
 we close the message 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.169
 the latest news that I would like to point out is that it concerns the internet browser now 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.669
 appears and not only much faster to load internet pages let's try a 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.669
 moment load the now fabri fiber just to let you see 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:36.319
 but we also have the moves and bookmarks we have this arrangement 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:41.399
 in style and covers of the songs of a itunes really very beautiful to see 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.600
 broser seems to me much faster in loading pages and above all 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:55.650
 finally the toothed bar column when we are going to zoom the text if it is 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.650
 double click for example 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.220
 ping table door and off 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.220
 cipÃ¬ of mario 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.660
 Fight the column and finally the display resolution resolution should not 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.370
 each time it scrolls left to read the text the function is great 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.370
 waiting is finally introduced also for teachers 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.889
 direct with novelty we concluded hair unfortunately the new one does not appear 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.889
 multimedia gallery we always have the old one does not even appear 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.889
 killer will revive the net king 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:39.589
 hilton giardini naxos whale in short an update that introduces and some 

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:44.799
 interesting function but leaves it leaking on the way to other teramo teramo 

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:48.479
 very willingly like the new buzzing bit the new gallery 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:49.450
 multimedia 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.660
 and other functions, even in short, I also had nothing here 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.440
 the more just horses, for example, we do not have with Basque navigation but 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.520
 we have to install it part and downloads that also voted automatic was convenient 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.939
 especially sorry 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:09.599
 when I was in the car even though this hotel in Rome does not seem to me then 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:15.429
 so bad and as revenge. base notes with interesting features again 

00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:19.560
 android uu rock even if those who come from an accusation probably 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.520
 it was not just a question of how satisfied or how some 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.260
 functions 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.120
 which before had now disappeared 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.020
 I also note that although I have an SMS message 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.270
 it is an e-mail not read the notification led does not work 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.540
 so I don't know if this is a budget 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.640
 i have a problem due to 4 pre-installed software the fact is that she is 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.759
 it's working 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:44.719
 and I really think that I will return to my Roma status favorites button soon 

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:49.449
 this new update and u do not let me know how you are hello a 

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:50.099
