00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.480 
congratulations sir the heavy well you
weren't<00:00:09.200> up<00:00:09.320> from<00:00:09.469> your<00:00:09.559> loan<00:00:09.740> side<00:00:09.980> soon<00:00:10.370> you

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
weren't up from your loan side soon you

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.950 
weren't up from your loan side soon you
may<00:00:10.610> have<00:00:10.700> had<00:00:10.820> something<00:00:11.030> temperatures

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
may have had something temperatures

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.779 
may have had something temperatures
you<00:00:12.200> got<00:00:12.350> exceeded<00:00:12.860> in<00:00:13.459> this<00:00:15.789> overall

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
you got exceeded in this overall

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:26.440 
you got exceeded in this overall
impression<00:00:17.330> is<00:00:21.520> it's<00:00:24.940> going<00:00:25.940> to<00:00:26.030> be<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.180> fun

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
impression is it's going to be a fun

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.060 
impression is it's going to be a fun
airplane<00:00:26.810> to<00:00:26.930> fly<00:00:26.960> nice

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:38.020 

it<00:00:31.070> doesn't<00:00:31.400> feel<00:00:35.050> sensitivity<00:00:36.050> high<00:00:37.030> rudder

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
it doesn't feel sensitivity high rudder

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:49.720 
it doesn't feel sensitivity high rudder
in<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.660> air<00:00:38.840> was<00:00:39.140> not<00:00:39.620> twitching

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.900 

not<00:00:50.270> a<00:00:50.300> factor<00:00:51.080> you<00:00:51.200> weren't<00:00:51.350> thinking<00:00:51.830> of<00:00:52.070> the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.810 

nice<00:00:55.680> pitch<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:56.890> wants<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.250> pitch<00:00:57.400> up<00:00:57.580> a<00:00:57.670> little

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
nice pitch it wants to pitch up a little

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.240 
nice pitch it wants to pitch up a little
bit<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:58.720> you<00:00:59.380> will<00:00:59.620> need<00:00:59.800> a<00:00:59.830> little<00:01:00.010> bit<00:01:00.190> of

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
bit so you will need a little bit of

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.740 
bit so you will need a little bit of
trim<00:01:00.550> in<00:01:00.670> there<00:01:00.850> maybe<00:01:01.120> just<00:01:01.450> a<00:01:01.570> fixed<00:01:01.960> end<00:01:03.750> so

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
trim in there maybe just a fixed end so

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.240 
trim in there maybe just a fixed end so
throughout<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.290> power<00:01:05.500> ranges<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:06.040> seems

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
throughout the power ranges it seems

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.280 
throughout the power ranges it seems
that<00:01:06.700> you'll<00:01:07.180> need<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.330> little<00:01:07.480> bit<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:07.960> seems<00:01:08.110> a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
that you'll need a little bit it seems a

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.160 
that you'll need a little bit it seems a
little<00:01:08.380> bit<00:01:08.910> required<00:01:09.910> forward<00:01:10.330> stick<00:01:10.930> in

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
little bit required forward stick in

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.250 
little bit required forward stick in
order<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.940> keep<00:01:12.940> whatever<00:01:13.330> speed<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:13.990> wanted

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
order to keep whatever speed you wanted

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.170 
order to keep whatever speed you wanted
okay<00:01:14.530> but<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.950> force<00:01:15.160> required<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:15.790> at<00:01:16.000> the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
okay but the force required it at the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.490 
okay but the force required it at the
highest<00:01:16.480> speed<00:01:16.660> I<00:01:16.690> got<00:01:16.900> in<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.110> lowest<00:01:17.380> speed

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
highest speed I got in the lowest speed

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.800 
highest speed I got in the lowest speed
I<00:01:17.620> got<00:01:17.800> which<00:01:18.040> wasn't<00:01:18.280> very<00:01:18.580> much<00:01:19.420> different

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
I got which wasn't very much different

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.700 
I got which wasn't very much different
yeah<00:01:20.640> wasn't<00:01:21.640> that<00:01:22.270> much<00:01:22.450> different<00:01:22.510> so<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.500> a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
yeah wasn't that much different so in a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.230 
yeah wasn't that much different so in a
fixed<00:01:24.040> tab<00:01:24.190> might<00:01:24.400> do<00:01:24.550> it<00:01:24.640> across<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:24.880> speed

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
fixed tab might do it across the speed

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.400 
fixed tab might do it across the speed
range<00:01:25.420> depending<00:01:25.810> on<00:01:25.869> what<00:01:26.020> it<00:01:26.110> does<00:01:26.260> the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
range depending on what it does the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.969 
range depending on what it does the
higher<00:01:26.560> speeds<00:01:26.950> when<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:27.970> came<00:01:28.150> up<00:01:28.330> on<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.979> on

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
higher speeds when you came up on the on

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.290 
higher speeds when you came up on the on
the<00:01:30.400> throttle

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
the throttle

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.510 
the throttle
where<00:01:31.900> were<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.080> like<00:01:32.200> three-quarter<00:01:32.650> on

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
where were you like three-quarter on

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.620 
where were you like three-quarter on
takeoff<00:01:34.290> no<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:35.320> mean<00:01:35.530> in<00:01:35.710> general<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.850> took<00:01:37.479> off

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
takeoff no I mean in general I took off

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.960 
takeoff no I mean in general I took off
I<00:01:38.080> got<00:01:38.380> up<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.710> 60<00:01:39.220> 100<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:40.060> then<00:01:41.550> back<00:01:42.550> backed

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
I got up to 60 100 and then back backed

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.940 
I got up to 60 100 and then back backed
it<00:01:43.090> off<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.330> 52<00:01:43.750> in<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.960> climb<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.440> the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
it off to 52 in the climb and the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.140 
it off to 52 in the climb and the
temperatures<00:01:45.280> just<00:01:45.310> kept<00:01:45.729> creeping<00:01:45.910> up

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
temperatures just kept creeping up

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.580 
temperatures just kept creeping up
creeping<00:01:46.509> up<00:01:46.600> creeping<00:01:46.930> up<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.290> then<00:01:47.410> about

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
creeping up creeping up and then about

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.760 
creeping up creeping up and then about
2,000<00:01:48.190> feet<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:49.479> kept<00:01:49.660> 5,200<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.500> leveled

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
2,000 feet just kept 5,200 and leveled

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.050 
2,000 feet just kept 5,200 and leveled
out<00:01:50.890> trying<00:01:51.160> to<00:01:51.190> get<00:01:51.310> more<00:01:51.430> airspeed<00:01:51.850> more

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
out trying to get more airspeed more

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.240 
out trying to get more airspeed more
flow<00:01:52.300> over<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.660> engine<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.650> make<00:01:54.220> a

flow over the engine and make a

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.400 
flow over the engine and make a
difference<00:01:54.729> took<00:01:55.210> some<00:01:55.360> numbers<00:01:55.660> they<00:01:56.080> still

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
difference took some numbers they still

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.200 
difference took some numbers they still
started<00:01:56.740> they<00:01:57.130> still<00:01:57.340> kept<00:01:57.580> creeping<00:01:57.850> up<00:01:58.120> a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
started they still kept creeping up a

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.730 
started they still kept creeping up a
little<00:01:58.390> bit<00:01:58.570> done<00:01:58.810> an<00:01:58.990> oil<00:01:59.140> temperature<00:01:59.290> and

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
little bit done an oil temperature and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.390 
little bit done an oil temperature and
the<00:02:00.370> CHT<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.570> so<00:02:02.170> at<00:02:02.260> 5200<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.159> oil

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
the CHT and so at 5200 the oil

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.100 
the CHT and so at 5200 the oil
temperature<00:02:03.490> was<00:02:03.760> getting<00:02:03.940> up<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.150> 225<00:02:04.750> and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
temperature was getting up to 225 and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.250 
temperature was getting up to 225 and
climbing<00:02:05.470> oil<00:02:06.400> pressure<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:06.760> good<00:02:06.940> at<00:02:07.030> 63<00:02:07.540> the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
climbing oil pressure is good at 63 the

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.800 
climbing oil pressure is good at 63 the
CH<00:02:09.040> T's<00:02:09.280> were<00:02:09.429> 330<00:02:09.880> each<00:02:10.090> class<00:02:10.600> still

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
CH T's were 330 each class still

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.570 
CH T's were 330 each class still
starting<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.170> climb<00:02:11.410> they're<00:02:11.890> keeping<00:02:12.340> all

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
starting to climb they're keeping all

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.580 
starting to climb they're keeping all
climbing<00:02:13.000> egt<00:02:13.840> seems<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.200> little<00:02:14.260> bit<00:02:14.440> high

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
climbing egt seems a little bit high

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.050 
climbing egt seems a little bit high
1476<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.760> 1572<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:17.320> that's<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:17.680> 5200<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.700> still

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
1476 and 1572 so that's in 5200 so still

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.729 
1476 and 1572 so that's in 5200 so still
running<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.450> little<00:02:19.570> lean<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:20.200> think<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
running a little lean to think of the

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.310 
running a little lean to think of the
lean<00:02:20.920> situation<00:02:21.610> then<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.780> think<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.049> I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
lean situation then the I think that I

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.550 
lean situation then the I think that I
think<00:02:23.530> it's<00:02:23.650> lean<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:25.200> there's<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.350> mid

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
think it's lean and there's that mid

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.710 
think it's lean and there's that mid
range<00:02:26.590> between<00:02:27.010> 3,000<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:27.880> above<00:02:28.180> we're

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
range between 3,000 and above we're

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.509 
range between 3,000 and above we're
seeing<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.110> spike<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.560> then<00:02:29.680> come<00:02:29.890> down<00:02:29.920> yeah

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
seeing the spike and then come down yeah

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.039 
seeing the spike and then come down yeah
I<00:02:30.549> didn't<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.239> time<00:02:31.299> it<00:02:31.630> doesn't<00:02:31.930> come

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
I didn't do it this time it doesn't come

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.710 
I didn't do it this time it doesn't come
down<00:02:32.080> when<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.530> go<00:02:32.650> up<00:02:32.799> towards<00:02:33.610> 5,000<00:02:34.299> in<00:02:34.480> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
down when you go up towards 5,000 in the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.300 
down when you go up towards 5,000 in the
air<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.350> lean<00:02:38.350> condition<00:02:38.709> might<00:02:39.160> be

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
air and so the lean condition might be

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.690 
air and so the lean condition might be
contributing<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.870> high<00:02:41.200> CHT<00:02:41.950> which<00:02:42.549> in

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
contributing to the high CHT which in

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.340 
contributing to the high CHT which in
turn<00:02:42.850> might<00:02:43.060> be<00:02:43.209> contributing<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:44.200> high

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
turn might be contributing to the high

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.699 
turn might be contributing to the high
all<00:02:44.560> temperature<00:02:45.040> yeah<00:02:45.790> cuz<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:46.870> know<00:02:47.560> before

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
all temperature yeah cuz I know before

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.640 
all temperature yeah cuz I know before
you<00:02:48.130> do<00:02:48.549> any<00:02:48.820> massive<00:02:49.269> battling<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.900> would<00:02:50.110> try

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
you do any massive battling I would try

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.240 
you do any massive battling I would try
writs<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.010> try<00:02:51.220> rigging<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.730> up<00:02:51.850> right

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
writs and try rigging it up right

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.300 
writs and try rigging it up right
the<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:54.140> rudder<00:02:54.380> movin<00:02:54.740> it<00:02:54.830> back<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.160> forth

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
the the rudder movin it back and forth

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.330 
the the rudder movin it back and forth
like<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.580> said<00:02:55.790> was<00:02:56.290> was<00:02:57.290> not<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.680> factor<00:02:58.070> didn't

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
like I said was was not a factor didn't

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.550 
like I said was was not a factor didn't
seem<00:02:58.460> twitchy<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.480> airflow<00:03:00.170> goes<00:03:00.410> it

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
seem twitchy the the airflow goes it

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.620 
seem twitchy the the airflow goes it
right<00:03:00.680> back<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.250> oh<00:03:01.520> cool<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.270> wasn't<00:03:02.540> it

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
right back and oh cool so it wasn't it

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.330 
right back and oh cool so it wasn't it
didn't<00:03:02.840> stale<00:03:03.080> no<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:03.680> doesn't<00:03:03.950> wander<00:03:04.070> it<00:03:04.220> all

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
didn't stale no it doesn't wander it all

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.490 
didn't stale no it doesn't wander it all
boom<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.700> comes<00:03:04.820> back<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.210> Center<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.540> and

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
boom that comes back to Center and and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.920 
boom that comes back to Center and and
it<00:03:06.800> takes<00:03:07.040> very<00:03:07.190> little<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.580> move<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:07.880> but<00:03:08.120> okay

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
it takes very little to move it but okay

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.720 
it takes very little to move it but okay
do<00:03:09.170> we<00:03:09.500> have<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.650> heavy<00:03:09.860> winger<00:03:10.310> no<00:03:12.430> not<00:03:13.430> enough

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
do we have a heavy winger no not enough

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.040 
do we have a heavy winger no not enough
to<00:03:13.850> mention<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.270> put<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:15.050> put<00:03:15.490> extremely<00:03:16.490> like<00:03:16.700> my

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
to mention I put I put extremely like my

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.270 
to mention I put I put extremely like my
quotation<00:03:18.050> marks<00:03:18.290> for<00:03:18.860> light<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.190> these

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
quotation marks for light and these

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.530 
quotation marks for light and these
they're<00:03:19.430> double<00:03:19.700> quotation<00:03:20.150> marks<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.420> me

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
they're double quotation marks it's me

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.330 
they're double quotation marks it's me
it's<00:03:20.660> extremely<00:03:21.140> light<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.920> tendency<00:03:22.310> to

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
it's extremely light the tendency to

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.980 
it's extremely light the tendency to
roll<00:03:22.610> right<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.270> can<00:03:23.420> be<00:03:23.570> a<00:03:23.750> combination

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
roll right and that can be a combination

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.470 
roll right and that can be a combination
of<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.410> airspeed<00:03:24.740> prop<00:03:25.040> combination<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.390> I

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
of the airspeed prop combination and I

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.120 
of the airspeed prop combination and I
never<00:03:26.720> never<00:03:26.990> settled<00:03:27.440> out<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.680> constant

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
never never settled out to a constant

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.170 
never never settled out to a constant
cruise<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.520> that's<00:03:28.670> where<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:28.940> would<00:03:29.030> want

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
cruise and that's where you would want

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.020 
cruise and that's where you would want
it<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:29.570> everything's<00:03:29.990> level<00:03:30.320> but<00:03:30.950> if<00:03:31.820> the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
it so everything's level but if the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.570 
it so everything's level but if the
airlines<00:03:32.420> require<00:03:32.510> trim<00:03:33.430> during<00:03:34.430> any

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
airlines require trim during any

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.460 
airlines require trim during any
condition<00:03:34.880> it's<00:03:35.690> not<00:03:35.780> going<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.140> be<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.350> much

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
condition it's not going to be that much

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.000 
condition it's not going to be that much
it's<00:03:36.680> going<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.860> be<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.010> little<00:03:37.220> edge<00:03:37.900> whatever

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
it's going to be a little edge whatever

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.140 
it's going to be a little edge whatever
pitch<00:03:40.010> wanted<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.400> pitch<00:03:40.550> up<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.790> little<00:03:40.940> bit

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
pitch wanted to pitch up a little bit

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.360 
pitch wanted to pitch up a little bit
y'all<00:03:41.420> at<00:03:41.990> the<00:03:42.110> speeds<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.650> was<00:03:42.800> going<00:03:43.070> at<00:03:43.190> the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
y'all at the speeds I was going at the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.790 
y'all at the speeds I was going at the
it<00:03:43.910> was<00:03:44.030> fairly<00:03:44.270> high<00:03:44.390> rpm<00:03:44.840> 5200<00:03:45.410> fairly<00:03:45.680> low

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
it was fairly high rpm 5200 fairly low

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.480 
it was fairly high rpm 5200 fairly low
speed<00:03:46.130> down<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.460> 80<00:03:46.730> knots<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:48.220> he<00:03:49.220> wanted<00:03:49.430> to

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
speed down to 80 knots and he wanted to

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.160 
speed down to 80 knots and he wanted to
go<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.670> ball<00:03:50.210> and<00:03:50.330> a<00:03:50.390> half<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.720> right<00:03:50.930> which

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
go a ball and a half to the right which

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.990 
go a ball and a half to the right which
makes<00:03:51.410> sense<00:03:51.650> because<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.580> have<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.790> correct

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
makes sense because you have to correct

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.770 
makes sense because you have to correct
it<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.210> don't<00:03:53.330> have<00:03:53.420> enough<00:03:53.570> speed

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
it you don't have enough speed

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.830 
it you don't have enough speed
straighten<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.320> out<00:03:54.410> that's<00:03:55.330> just<00:03:56.330> a<00:03:56.420> hair<00:03:56.600> I

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
straighten it out that's just a hair I

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.210 
straighten it out that's just a hair I
mean<00:03:57.140> just<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.500> hair<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.739> left<00:03:57.920> rudder

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
mean just a hair of left rudder

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.790 
mean just a hair of left rudder
take<00:03:58.760> it<00:03:58.880> off<00:03:59.000> boom<00:03:59.239> like<00:03:59.360> say<00:03:59.540> like<00:03:59.810> a<00:04:00.020> you<00:04:00.709> go

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
take it off boom like say like a you go

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.990 
take it off boom like say like a you go
maybe<00:04:00.980> one<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.310> half<00:04:01.430> degrees<00:04:01.550> to<00:04:01.910> the

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
maybe one and a half degrees to the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.760 
maybe one and a half degrees to the
right<00:04:02.180> I'm<00:04:02.630> not<00:04:02.989> a<00:04:03.020> ball<00:04:03.200> in<00:04:03.320> half<00:04:03.440> one<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:03.680> a

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
right I'm not a ball in half one and a

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.890 
right I'm not a ball in half one and a
half<00:04:03.890> degrees<00:04:04.010> that<00:04:04.459> ball<00:04:04.820> just<00:04:05.060> just<00:04:05.720> saw<00:04:05.810> in

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
half degrees that ball just just saw in

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.360 
half degrees that ball just just saw in
the<00:04:05.989> edge<00:04:06.140> of<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.380> just<00:04:06.620> barely<00:04:06.860> tickles<00:04:07.280> out

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
the edge of it just barely tickles out

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.870 
the edge of it just barely tickles out
right

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
right

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.930 
right
the<00:04:08.390> took<00:04:09.260> it<00:04:09.380> as<00:04:09.650> low<00:04:09.920> as<00:04:10.070> 55<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.690> at

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
the took it as low as 55 and the at

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.390 
the took it as low as 55 and the at
Tufts<00:04:13.940> on<00:04:14.180> either<00:04:14.300> start<00:04:14.660> side<00:04:15.170> jump<00:04:15.709> start<00:04:16.250> to

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
Tufts on either start side jump start to

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.630 
Tufts on either start side jump start to
twirl<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:17.799> 55<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.980> about<00:04:19.160> where<00:04:19.310> we're<00:04:19.489> going

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
twirl and 55 is about where we're going

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.930 
twirl and 55 is about where we're going
so<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:20.120> after<00:04:20.270> one<00:04:20.510> was<00:04:20.690> going<00:04:21.260> first<00:04:21.530> and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
so the after one was going first and

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.520 
so the after one was going first and
which<00:04:22.940> means<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.480> when<00:04:24.140> we<00:04:24.230> go<00:04:24.350> through

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
which means that when we go through

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.800 
which means that when we go through
there's<00:04:24.740> no<00:04:25.430> all<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:26.120> way<00:04:26.210> after<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.630> one

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
there's no all the way after that one

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.409 
there's no all the way after that one
yeah<00:04:26.980> that<00:04:27.980> one<00:04:28.130> was<00:04:28.160> going<00:04:28.550> first<00:04:28.790> as<00:04:29.060> was

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
yeah that one was going first as was

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.200 
yeah that one was going first as was
this<00:04:29.630> one<00:04:29.810> over<00:04:30.050> here<00:04:30.290> which<00:04:31.280> means<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:31.880> if

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
this one over here which means that if

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.000 
this one over here which means that if
we<00:04:32.390> go<00:04:32.570> for<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.810> stall<00:04:33.050> without<00:04:33.200> stall<00:04:33.680> strips

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
we go for a stall without stall strips

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.220 
we go for a stall without stall strips
we<00:04:34.190> have<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.400> be<00:04:34.490> careful<00:04:34.850> that<00:04:35.350> person<00:04:36.350> and

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
we have to be careful that person and

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.750 
we have to be careful that person and
expect<00:04:39.230> it<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.410> fall<00:04:39.919> off<00:04:40.100> on<00:04:40.130> one<00:04:40.400> side<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.640> the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
expect it to fall off on one side of the

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.180 
expect it to fall off on one side of the
other<00:04:40.850> which<00:04:41.780> isn't<00:04:42.410> dangerous<00:04:42.680> if<00:04:43.010> you<00:04:43.100> have

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
other which isn't dangerous if you have

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.909 
other which isn't dangerous if you have
enough<00:04:43.430> altitude<00:04:43.580> but<00:04:44.450> based<00:04:45.290> on<00:04:45.470> what<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:45.680> saw

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
enough altitude but based on what I saw

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.950 
enough altitude but based on what I saw
approaching<00:04:46.520> stall<00:04:46.790> that's<00:04:47.540> what<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.810> looked

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
approaching stall that's what it looked

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.280 
approaching stall that's what it looked
like

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
like

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.630 
like
if<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.470> airspeed<00:04:48.770> so<00:04:48.950> it's<00:04:49.070> not<00:04:49.190> progressing

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
if the airspeed so it's not progressing

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.950 
if the airspeed so it's not progressing
like<00:04:49.700> we<00:04:49.880> like<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.210> over<00:04:50.419> here<00:04:50.600> it's<00:04:50.780> right

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
like we like it over here it's right

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.630 
like we like it over here it's right
right<00:04:51.320> right<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:51.919> want<00:04:52.100> it<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.370> want<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.520> to

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
right right you want it you want it to

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.850 
right right you want it you want it to
be<00:04:52.760> dancing<00:04:53.120> all<00:04:53.270> down<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.840> back<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:54.350> then

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
be dancing all down the back and then

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.800 
be dancing all down the back and then
break<00:04:55.340> loose<00:04:55.580> at<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:55.820> root<00:04:56.210> first<00:04:56.450> to<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
break loose at the root first to the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.230 
break loose at the root first to the
tips<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.200> want<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.440> go<00:04:57.530> at<00:04:58.310> warp<00:04:58.820> do<00:04:59.090> that

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
tips you want to go at warp do that

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.000 
tips you want to go at warp do that
broom<00:04:59.450> to<00:04:59.600> tip<00:04:59.810> and<00:04:59.990> stall<00:05:00.470> strips<00:05:00.740> will<00:05:00.860> make

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
broom to tip and stall strips will make

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.220 
broom to tip and stall strips will make
these<00:05:01.160> great<00:05:01.400> first<00:05:01.669> right

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
these great first right

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.200 
these great first right
but<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:03.250> might<00:05:03.400> be<00:05:03.520> worth<00:05:03.610> trying<00:05:03.820> without<00:05:04.090> the

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
but it might be worth trying without the

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.360 
but it might be worth trying without the
stall<00:05:04.420> strips<00:05:04.660> but<00:05:05.010> indications<00:05:06.010> are<00:05:06.100> might

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
stall strips but indications are might

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.420 
stall strips but indications are might
go<00:05:06.490> off<00:05:06.610> on<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.820> wing<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:08.100> like<00:05:09.100> slightly

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
go off on a wing and like slightly

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.250 
go off on a wing and like slightly
uncoordinated<00:05:09.850> I'm<00:05:10.120> gonna<00:05:10.240> do<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.480> right

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
uncoordinated I'm gonna do that right

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.640 
uncoordinated I'm gonna do that right
and<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.720> they<00:05:13.720> say<00:05:13.870> slow<00:05:14.020> flight<00:05:14.290> got<00:05:14.470> down<00:05:14.620> to

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
and the they say slow flight got down to

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.210 
and the they say slow flight got down to
55<00:05:15.160> flew<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.180> approaches<00:05:16.630> 70<00:05:17.020> pitch<00:05:17.860> might<00:05:18.070> be

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
55 flew the approaches 70 pitch might be

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.340 
55 flew the approaches 70 pitch might be
a<00:05:18.400> little<00:05:18.610> bit<00:05:18.790> late<00:05:18.970> so<00:05:19.000> I'll<00:05:19.300> come<00:05:20.140> up<00:05:20.260> a

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
a little bit late so I'll come up a

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.720 
a little bit late so I'll come up a
little<00:05:20.470> bit<00:05:20.680> in<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.890> flare<00:05:21.130> and<00:05:21.220> hard<00:05:21.460> to<00:05:21.550> sit

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
little bit in the flare and hard to sit

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.700 
little bit in the flare and hard to sit
and<00:05:21.850> see<00:05:22.030> where<00:05:22.180> we<00:05:22.330> were<00:05:22.480> but<00:05:22.690> yeah<00:05:22.990> yeah<00:05:23.410> but

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
and see where we were but yeah yeah but

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.630 
and see where we were but yeah yeah but
the<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:25.000> landing<00:05:25.360> gear<00:05:25.570> is<00:05:25.750> in<00:05:26.430> exactly<00:05:27.430> the

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
the the landing gear is in exactly the

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.090 
the the landing gear is in exactly the
right<00:05:27.760> position<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.480> mean<00:05:29.080> cool<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.650> read<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.890> book

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
right position I mean cool I read a book

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.340 
right position I mean cool I read a book
for<00:05:30.340> that<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:31.330> was<00:05:31.450> a<00:05:31.480> touchdown<00:05:31.720> on<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.110> mains

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
for that it was a touchdown on the mains

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.410 
for that it was a touchdown on the mains
your<00:05:32.860> ear<00:05:33.100> at<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.220> mid-range<00:05:33.550> over<00:05:33.850> CG<00:05:34.210> right

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
your ear at the mid-range over CG right

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.000 
your ear at the mid-range over CG right
now<00:05:34.570> was<00:05:34.780> cuts<00:05:34.990> down<00:05:35.170> on<00:05:35.230> the<00:05:35.410> mains<00:05:35.590> and<00:05:35.740> film

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
now was cuts down on the mains and film

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.650 
now was cuts down on the mains and film
uses<00:05:36.280> held<00:05:36.430> it<00:05:36.550> there<00:05:36.670> and<00:05:37.200> and<00:05:38.200> for<00:05:39.660> for

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
uses held it there and and for for

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.090 
uses held it there and and for for
somebody<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:41.110> get<00:05:41.200> in<00:05:41.320> a<00:05:41.380> plane<00:05:41.560> for<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.860> first

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
somebody to get in a plane for the first

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.140 
somebody to get in a plane for the first
time<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:42.460> be<00:05:42.550> able<00:05:42.640> to<00:05:42.790> hold<00:05:42.910> it<00:05:43.030> in<00:05:43.120> that

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
time and be able to hold it in that

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.700 
time and be able to hold it in that
position<00:05:43.240> means<00:05:43.930> it's<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.170> plane<00:05:44.320> is<00:05:44.470> hoping

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
position means it's the plane is hoping

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.310 
position means it's the plane is hoping
and<00:05:45.430> what's<00:05:46.390> helping<00:05:46.660> is<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.930> position<00:05:47.230> of

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
and what's helping is the position of

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.980 
and what's helping is the position of
the<00:05:47.380> gear<00:05:47.560> relation<00:05:47.980> to<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.190> plane<00:05:48.990> you're

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
the gear relation to the plane you're

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.780 
the gear relation to the plane you're
right<00:05:50.140> in<00:05:50.200> the<00:05:50.230> middle<00:05:50.290> of<00:05:50.500> CG<00:05:50.800> boom<00:05:51.100> tall<00:05:51.640> from

right in the middle of CG boom tall from
those<00:05:51.970> up<00:05:52.180> just<00:05:52.480> sits<00:05:52.840> there<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.560> put<00:05:53.800> the

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
those up just sits there and put the

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.200 
those up just sits there and put the
nose<00:05:54.010> down<00:05:54.040> when<00:05:54.370> you<00:05:54.460> want<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:54.970> think<00:05:55.150> we

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
nose down when you want you think we

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.160 
nose down when you want you think we
should<00:05:55.360> leave<00:05:55.450> the<00:05:55.600> counterweight<00:05:55.930> where<00:05:56.080> it

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170 
should leave the counterweight where it

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.550 
should leave the counterweight where it
is<00:05:56.290> for<00:05:56.470> now<00:05:56.560> then<00:05:57.420> for<00:05:58.420> now<00:05:58.690> yes<00:05:59.050> because<00:05:59.260> we

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
is for now then for now yes because we

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.470 
is for now then for now yes because we
haven't<00:05:59.860> fully<00:06:00.010> checked<00:06:00.370> that<00:06:00.760> lawyer<00:06:01.090> and

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
haven't fully checked that lawyer and

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.110 
haven't fully checked that lawyer and
the<00:06:01.570> stall<00:06:01.810> stabilities<00:06:02.410> things<00:06:02.620> like<00:06:02.800> that

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
the stall stabilities things like that

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.220 
the stall stabilities things like that
the<00:06:04.890> so<00:06:05.910> with<00:06:06.910> the<00:06:07.030> angles<00:06:07.390> of<00:06:07.660> attack<00:06:07.780> you're

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
the so with the angles of attack you're

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.110 
the so with the angles of attack you're
giving<00:06:08.500> you<00:06:08.560> don't<00:06:08.710> see<00:06:08.920> any<00:06:09.340> weirdness<00:06:09.880> with

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
giving you don't see any weirdness with

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.540 
giving you don't see any weirdness with
the<00:06:10.240> tail<00:06:10.450> no<00:06:11.200> no<00:06:11.710> everything<00:06:12.130> seems<00:06:12.340> solid

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
the tail no no everything seems solid

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.760 
the tail no no everything seems solid
back<00:06:12.820> there<00:06:13.000> no<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.870> tail<00:06:14.080> seen<00:06:14.320> plenty<00:06:14.590> big

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
back there no the tail seen plenty big

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.670 
back there no the tail seen plenty big
yeah<00:06:15.540> it<00:06:16.540> didn't<00:06:16.780> run<00:06:16.840> out<00:06:17.020> of<00:06:17.050> elevator<00:06:17.500> and

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
yeah it didn't run out of elevator and

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.380 
yeah it didn't run out of elevator and
flare<00:06:17.950> we're<00:06:18.370> not<00:06:18.490> at<00:06:18.580> the<00:06:18.610> most<00:06:18.850> forward<00:06:19.180> CG

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
flare we're not at the most forward CG

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.450 
flare we're not at the most forward CG
which<00:06:19.750> would<00:06:19.870> be<00:06:19.960> the<00:06:20.050> most<00:06:20.230> critical<00:06:20.460> forward

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
which would be the most critical forward

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.310 
which would be the most critical forward
heavy<00:06:21.640> that's<00:06:22.030> where<00:06:22.240> that's<00:06:22.870> really<00:06:22.960> trying

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
heavy that's where that's really trying

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.840 
heavy that's where that's really trying
to<00:06:23.410> hold<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.650> nose<00:06:23.800> up<00:06:24.010> yeah<00:06:24.190> but<00:06:24.490> I<00:06:24.550> didn't

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
to hold the nose up yeah but I didn't

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.670 
to hold the nose up yeah but I didn't
reach<00:06:25.000> full<00:06:25.300> laughs<00:06:25.450> stick<00:06:25.720> full<00:06:25.900> aft<00:06:26.110> as<00:06:26.320> you

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
reach full laughs stick full aft as you

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.950 
reach full laughs stick full aft as you
know<00:06:26.800> very<00:06:27.250> well<00:06:27.400> my<00:06:27.610> crotch<00:06:27.820> and<00:06:28.180> it<00:06:28.450> was<00:06:28.570> it

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
know very well my crotch and it was it

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.410 
know very well my crotch and it was it
was<00:06:29.020> probably<00:06:29.430> there<00:06:30.430> on<00:06:30.670> touchdown<00:06:31.090> this<00:06:31.270> my

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
was probably there on touchdown this my

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:40.350 
was probably there on touchdown this my
guess<00:06:36.930> it<00:06:37.930> was<00:06:38.140> just<00:06:38.850> the<00:06:39.850> feeling<00:06:40.180> that<00:06:40.270> you

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
guess it was just the feeling that you

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.760 
guess it was just the feeling that you
get<00:06:40.450> flying<00:06:40.750> around<00:06:41.020> it<00:06:41.230> feels<00:06:41.350> nice<00:06:41.740> and

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
get flying around it feels nice and

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.100 
get flying around it feels nice and
solid

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
solid

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.860 
solid
it'll<00:06:44.069> do<00:06:44.189> what<00:06:44.310> you<00:06:44.400> wanted<00:06:44.639> to<00:06:44.759> do<00:06:44.909> on

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
it'll do what you wanted to do on

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.899 
it'll do what you wanted to do on
takeoff<00:06:46.319> on<00:06:46.349> the<00:06:46.590> first<00:06:46.800> turn<00:06:46.949> out<00:06:47.159> it<00:06:47.669> might

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909 
takeoff on the first turn out it might

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.399 
takeoff on the first turn out it might
need<00:06:48.060> just<00:06:48.360> a<00:06:48.449> little<00:06:48.479> bit<00:06:48.750> of<00:06:48.870> coordinating

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 
need just a little bit of coordinating

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:55.399 
need just a little bit of coordinating
with<00:06:49.620> the<00:06:50.629> in<00:06:51.629> the<00:06:51.840> turn<00:06:52.080> where<00:06:54.020> it<00:06:55.020> felt<00:06:55.259> like

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:55.409 
with the in the turn where it felt like

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:59.330 
with the in the turn where it felt like
tail<00:06:55.919> wanted<00:06:56.189> to<00:06:56.250> fall<00:06:56.400> off<00:06:56.610> a<00:06:56.639> little<00:06:56.879> bit<00:06:58.340> in

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
tail wanted to fall off a little bit in

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.899 
tail wanted to fall off a little bit in
the<00:06:59.460> turn<00:06:59.639> but<00:07:00.500> but<00:07:01.500> certainly<00:07:01.800> not<00:07:01.979> not

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:02.909 
the turn but but certainly not not

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:04.640 
the turn but but certainly not not
wandering<00:07:03.300> on<00:07:03.509> the<00:07:03.539> tail<00:07:03.780> so<00:07:03.960> the<00:07:04.050> tail<00:07:04.229> is<00:07:04.439> big

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
wandering on the tail so the tail is big

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.110 
wandering on the tail so the tail is big
enough<00:07:04.830> to<00:07:04.979> have<00:07:05.099> good<00:07:05.250> directional

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
enough to have good directional

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.179 
enough to have good directional
stability<00:07:06.270> like<00:07:06.689> this<00:07:06.930> it<00:07:07.620> might<00:07:07.830> be<00:07:07.860> a<00:07:07.979> little

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:08.189 
stability like this it might be a little

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:09.800 
stability like this it might be a little
bit<00:07:08.280> small<00:07:08.550> require<00:07:09.419> a<00:07:09.449> little<00:07:09.569> bit<00:07:09.689> more

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
bit small require a little bit more

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.600 
bit small require a little bit more
coordination<00:07:10.409> than<00:07:10.800> you<00:07:10.949> might<00:07:11.099> expect<00:07:11.219> in

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
coordination than you might expect in

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.209 
coordination than you might expect in
this<00:07:11.729> record<00:07:12.509> and<00:07:13.139> but<00:07:13.650> again<00:07:13.860> that<00:07:14.039> was<00:07:14.189> a

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:14.219 
this record and but again that was a

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:17.589 
this record and but again that was a
slow<00:07:15.000> speed<00:07:15.270> on<00:07:15.419> the<00:07:15.509> climb<00:07:15.719> out<00:07:15.900> as<00:07:16.050> well<00:07:16.229> so

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 
slow speed on the climb out as well so

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:19.850 
slow speed on the climb out as well so
like<00:07:18.599> I<00:07:18.659> say<00:07:18.780> just<00:07:18.810> that<00:07:19.080> initial<00:07:19.259> impression

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
like I say just that initial impression

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.409 
like I say just that initial impression
was<00:07:19.889> okay<00:07:20.340> tails<00:07:20.580> falling<00:07:20.909> off<00:07:21.030> a<00:07:21.060> little<00:07:21.300> bit

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
was okay tails falling off a little bit

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.860 
was okay tails falling off a little bit
kick<00:07:21.599> a<00:07:21.629> little<00:07:21.780> rubber<00:07:22.020> but<00:07:23.270> it's<00:07:24.270> you<00:07:24.840> know

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870 
kick a little rubber but it's you know

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.010 
kick a little rubber but it's you know
it's<00:07:25.409> it's<00:07:25.949> not<00:07:26.009> like<00:07:26.129> a<00:07:26.569> it<00:07:27.569> doesn't<00:07:27.900> rattle

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
it's it's not like a it doesn't rattle

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.110 
it's it's not like a it doesn't rattle
like<00:07:28.289> an<00:07:28.379> aluminum<00:07:28.560> the<00:07:29.099> engine<00:07:29.400> rattles

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 
like an aluminum the engine rattles

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.390 
like an aluminum the engine rattles
noise<00:07:30.870> but<00:07:31.469> the<00:07:31.590> plane<00:07:31.800> doesn't<00:07:32.039> rattle

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
noise but the plane doesn't rattle

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.309 
noise but the plane doesn't rattle
there's<00:07:32.759> no<00:07:32.909> leaks<00:07:33.210> like<00:07:33.539> a<00:07:33.569> two-bit<00:07:33.930> fabric

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 
there's no leaks like a two-bit fabric

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.420 
there's no leaks like a two-bit fabric
plane<00:07:34.529> so<00:07:34.770> you're<00:07:34.889> gonna<00:07:34.979> have<00:07:35.159> that<00:07:35.250> nice

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
plane so you're gonna have that nice

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.730 
plane so you're gonna have that nice
solid<00:07:35.639> feeling<00:07:36.210> you<00:07:36.719> have<00:07:36.900> a<00:07:37.110> nice<00:07:37.379> solid<00:07:37.560> feel

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
solid feeling you have a nice solid feel
