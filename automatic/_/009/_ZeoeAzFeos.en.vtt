on those things flash games fan turns on
turn<00:00:37.800> off<00:00:37.890> light<00:00:39.800> gives<00:00:40.800> me<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:43.879> yeah<00:00:44.879> it's

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
turn off light gives me that yeah it's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.410 
turn off light gives me that yeah it's
in<00:00:45.239> kilobytes

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.610 

that<00:00:50.079> starts<00:00:50.620> up

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.800
