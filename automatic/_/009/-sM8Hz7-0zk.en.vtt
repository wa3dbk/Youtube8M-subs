00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.660
 flying is an experience today a 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.490
 available to all 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.000
 traveling on large scheduled aircraft 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.590
 at high speed and in total safety 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.360
 to maintain and improve comfort 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.610
 safety and performance 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.920
 there are ongoing research activities and 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.500
 development especially with regards to 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.270
 the components of aeronautical engines i 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.430
 main aspects of research in 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.740
 aeronautical field are oriented towards the 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.450
 weight reduction while preserving the great 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.590
 reliability 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.740
 the goal to be achieved is a 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.230
 lower consumption and therefore lower emissions 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.060
 pollutants to improve performance 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.150
 optimize palette profiles 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.740
 aeronautical systems and reduce noise 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.180
 colony I was a consortium of which they are part 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.430
 ario aero w zl 4 the university bag of 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.920
 technology and the minor university of 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.040
 technology has started and listed in 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.840
 poland the construction of one with a 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.260
 the plant that will be operational by the 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.300
 end of 2014 to test scale 1 to 1 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.080
 or reduced whole turbines of low 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.970
 pressure for the engines of the future 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.710
 the tests are an obligatory path for 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.360
 increase the yield and the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.490
 performance of turbine modules 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.830
 in the plant says the on carpi will be the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 larger and more modern 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.270
 generally, agreements will be reproduced 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.430
 turbine aerodynamics similar to 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.860
 those that occur in flight but with 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.810
 lower temperatures from which comfort la 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.340
 simulation predicts that the air sucked 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.440
 from the external environment 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.770
 you risk a compression process e 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.740
 heating up to 375 degrees before 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.510
 be pushed with a capacity of 80 kg a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.370
 second towards the low turbine 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.200
 in test pressure monitoring 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.060
 air passage inside the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.100
 turbine takes place with and conditions 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.390
 perfectly set parameters e 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.860
 control yourself 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.510
 this allows you to observe and evaluate 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.530
 the reactions to perform 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.390
 so improvements are made 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.899
 the basis for the modification of the components 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.430
 based on the results obtained 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.530
 optimization of the revision flows of 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.500
 profiles and the number of pallets of the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.709
 turbines a big commitment to develop 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.390
 the new aircraft engines in service 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.390
 of the aeronautics of the future
