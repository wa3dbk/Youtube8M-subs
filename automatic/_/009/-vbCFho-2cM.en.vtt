00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
it depends what part of the animal or

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440 
it depends what part of the animal or
the<00:01:37.680> lamb<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.070> they're<00:01:38.250> using<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the lamb that they're using for the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
the lamb that they're using for the
particular<00:01:39.810> garment<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.409> look<00:01:40.650> at<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
particular garment but look at the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.609 
particular garment but look at the
quality<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.030> jacket<00:01:42.390> yes<00:01:42.750> another<00:01:43.290> thing

quality of this jacket yes another thing

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.280 
quality of this jacket yes another thing
on<00:01:43.920> every<00:01:44.280> single<00:01:44.640> garment<00:01:45.020> extra<00:01:46.020> buttons
