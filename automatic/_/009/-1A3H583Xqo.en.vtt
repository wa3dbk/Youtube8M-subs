and<00:01:01.079> read<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.949> watch<00:01:03.979> by<00:01:04.979> pulling<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> crown

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and read this watch by pulling the crown

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.520 
and read this watch by pulling the crown
into<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.420> number<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:06.930> position

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
into the number one position

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.539 
into the number one position
turning<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.930> crown<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.549> clockwise

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
turning the crown in the clockwise

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.969 
turning the crown in the clockwise
position<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.439> am<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:13.650> setting<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.549> date<00:01:15.979> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.960 
set the home time by turning the crown
in<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.450> opposite<00:01:27.450> direction<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.890> let's<00:01:29.729> just

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
in the opposite direction and let's just

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.340 
in the opposite direction and let's just
set<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:31.729> New<00:01:32.729> York<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.900> see<00:01:34.079> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
set that to New York as you can see it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.890 
set that to New York as you can see it
says<00:01:34.500> New<00:01:34.770> York<00:01:35.040> at<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.939> top<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> dial

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
says New York at the top of the dial

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.440 
says New York at the top of the dial
which<00:01:37.350> indicates<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.400> home<00:01:39.060> timezone<00:01:41.450> it

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
which indicates the home timezone it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.510 
which indicates the home timezone it
finally<00:01:42.780> let's<00:01:42.990> set<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.259> time<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.189> I'll<00:01:44.310> pull

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
finally let's set the time so I'll pull

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.130 
finally let's set the time so I'll pull
the<00:01:44.729> pusher<00:01:45.060> out<00:01:45.180> into<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> number<00:01:46.110> two

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the pusher out into the number two

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.670 
the pusher out into the number two
position<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:48.950> you'll<00:01:49.950> notice<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> move<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
position and you'll notice as I move the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.399 
position and you'll notice as I move the
minute<00:01:52.680> hand<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.220> change<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> time<00:01:54.409> this

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
minute hand to change the time this

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.649 
minute hand to change the time this
numeric<00:01:55.950> dial<00:01:56.219> will<00:01:56.399> also<00:01:56.790> turn<00:01:57.450> in

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
numeric dial will also turn in

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.170 
numeric dial will also turn in
synchronization<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:59.310> keep<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.939> time

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
synchronization to keep the time

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.580 
synchronization to keep the time
synchronized<00:02:00.810> across<00:02:01.200> all<00:02:01.469> 24<00:02:02.009> time<00:02:02.189> zones<00:02:03.590> so

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
synchronized across all 24 time zones so

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.950 
synchronized across all 24 time zones so
let's<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:05.040> set<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> time

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960
