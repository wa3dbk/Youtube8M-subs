I<00:02:05.299> don't<00:02:06.229> particularly<00:02:06.679> care<00:02:07.429> for<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:08.390> clone

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
I don't particularly care for the clone

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.830 
I don't particularly care for the clone
troopers<00:02:09.410> cause<00:02:09.590> they<00:02:09.709> all<00:02:09.799> look<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.069> same

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
troopers cause they all look the same

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.930 
troopers cause they all look the same
I'd<00:02:11.840> rather<00:02:11.989> have<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.319> different<00:02:12.799> figure<00:02:13.370> maybe

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
I'd rather have a different figure maybe

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.089 
I'd rather have a different figure maybe
a<00:02:14.060> mace<00:02:14.330> windu<00:02:14.780> or<00:02:15.080> something<00:02:15.410> like<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.830> or

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099

another<00:02:16.670> exclusive<00:02:17.319> Luke<00:02:18.319> Skywalker<00:02:19.069> but<00:02:19.299> now

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
another exclusive Luke Skywalker but now

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.420 
another exclusive Luke Skywalker but now
he's<00:02:20.450> some<00:02:21.260> people<00:02:21.560> really<00:02:21.829> like<00:02:22.040> their<00:02:22.190> clone

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.839 
lieutenants and it may be nice to get
one<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.500> perhaps<00:02:24.680> stands<00:02:25.099> out<00:02:25.370> from<00:02:25.670> the

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
one that perhaps stands out from the

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.740 
one that perhaps stands out from the
others<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> little<00:02:26.510> bit<00:02:26.829> but<00:02:27.829> it's<00:02:28.420> it's<00:02:29.420> free
