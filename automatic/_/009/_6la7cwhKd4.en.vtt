00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200

 youtube so you like combos 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.240
 singh today we have the unboxing of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.800
 nexus 4 but before the presentation 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.599
 before starting the video I want 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.480
 remind them something friends the little hands 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.670
 up are not by the device that I 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.350
 is showing if he likes it or not so that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.020
 you can use the comments the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.779
 little hands up are if the video liked it 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.730
 yes or no so now we go with the new 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.730
 logo to start this video 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.120
 well my people here we have it 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.989
 finally google decided to send me this 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.549
 new phone the nexus 4 I say new 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.379
 because it 's new to me since the 

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:48.659
 phone came out in November and well yo 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.460
 I bought it in November but I barely 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.890
 they sent it to us we are going to take it out in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.649
 the shipping box is not not in this box 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.589
 that comes if it is not in this that we have 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.059
 here and there we have it I suspected that 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.659
 it was something else that was going to come to me and not 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.450
 is the nexus you see look here where 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.490
 we have to and we will see in comparison 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.979
 the iphone 5 case that is the box that 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.679
 we all already know minimum is the lateral 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.409
 the other lateral other side of this 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.420
 side and another side of this side there 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.459
 we can appreciate that box is bigger 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.140
 as we can see the face of the nexus looks 

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.850
 a little bigger it is only the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.600
 comparison of the house that we are going to draw 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.380
 this baby here we are going to perform 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.899
 jamenÃ©i in the box I really is a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.890
 box with a totally different design 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.560
 what is it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.320
 to little so we can have fun 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.240
 little let's see I really wanted 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.130
 Third give in November as I told them 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.640
 but imagine now because it came to me 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.619
 because they did not have cell phones available and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.830
 he has in mind the first look at 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.720
 this phone looks pretty cute look 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.840
 here a screen as I had them 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.430
 mentioned of 4.7 and diagonally 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.649
 has a resolution of 1280 x 768 and most 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.970
 important has 320 pixels per inch 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.670
 remember that the retina that we have the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.590
 iphone 5 is 320 26 so now you guys 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.720
 can have a good idea only 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.850
 let's light the miners where 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.769
 turn on here see how you instructed the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.290
 volume and the power button here 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.610
 let's see the sides of the phone 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.610
 also so that you do not know what 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.040
 lose well on this side we have the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.920
 miniusb connector and from this side we have 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.900
 where to enter 5 and the buttons 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.970
 volume as we just learned from my 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.590
 network where we enter the jack for the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.989
 hedge fonds on this side I imagine that 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.760
 that would be one of the microphones and 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.530
 this side 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.170
 what has been the home button 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.180
 for android phones this phone 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:53.989
 it's 133 point 9 millimeters by 668 and 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.200
 It has a thickness of 9.1 and weighs only 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.120
 It weighs 139 grams if we talk about the camera 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.730
 we have a 1.3 front camera 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.940
 megapixels while the camera 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.930
 8- megapixel rear come 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.470
 capacities 8 and 16 gb only this one that 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.750
 I bought is 8 gb you have 2 gb of 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.120
 ram memory qualcomm processors 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.709
 snapdragon s4 pro and has android 4.2 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.420
 that's something also that we have to 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.489
 realize how is a telephone 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.500
 google is going to come with the latest 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.150
 Android like samsung or the others 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.190
 phones that use android but not 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.470
 have the most recent system of 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.170
 android the serious difference that I saw is 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.260
 that this one has fs the iphone 5 does not have 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.299
 but this one does not have wifi connection and does not 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.280
 has lte connection while the 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.109
 iphone 5 if something also fits 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.090
 to mention is that we have the screen is 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.420
 a gifted gorilla you know that the 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.360
 gorilla 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.550
 It is the most resistant glass that they have 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.290
 right now it is not the last one that you 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.599
 they know that the gorilla glass 3 already exists 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.730
 but this safety gas 2 that is also 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.200
 resistant this phone brings many 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.150
 interesting times that I would like 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.739
 try but I would like you 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.750
 tell me there below in the comments 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.640
 what do you want me to do with this 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.230
 cellular I initially bought it for 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.540
 make a comparison with the iphone 5 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.630
 with all the functions it brings in each 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.160
 device but I really do not know now 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.450
 what to do since he has arrived so late 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.610
 it is outside as of me of my plans 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.860
 let's turn it on here in doing there 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.389
 understand it as he kept saying it is 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.590
 out of my plans for you tell me 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.360
 if you want me to make a 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.460
 comparison that you compare they wanted 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.440
 they want to see some of the functions that 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.690
 I'm interested in this device is that it 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.520
 charge wirelessly this is something 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.020
 that I do not want to see and if I see that it's very 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.060
 interesting maybe I upload a video and 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.669
 also the camera that has a 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.540
 photo capture technology that is the same 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.940
 the photos that we can see in 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.620
 google streetview let's see what it has 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.900
 the box also before I got 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.870
 forget in the box we have 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:02.229
 booklet nexus we have the charger and the 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.580
 speaker ebook and here we have the 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.800
 card to take out the farms 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.590
 introduce another farm that we want to use 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.090
 this phone is unlocked here 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.789
 we are already on the home screen 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.590
 so nothing like I was saying no 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.020
 I know what to do with this phone so 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.880
 you say the return I sell it 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.500
 tell me in the comments but I do not 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.150
 tell me to burn it even if they vote and 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.770
 nothing if you do not tell me if they want me 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.110
 make a comparison with the iphone 5 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.600
 let's see there as seen with the iphone 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.419
 5 over there you can already see a 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.860
 comparison what the physicist quickly 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.539
 but aesthetically he wants me to do 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.389
 a comparison to the style as I 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.850
 I do so deep with the camera with what 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.260
 what is the use of the phone the screen 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.180
 tell me you there I will be 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.979
 using this phone I will see how of 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.320
 your inference maybe I'll make a video 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.169
 telling him if it's worth it or not 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.880
 cellular and nothing you tell me there 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.889
 below in the comments and as I said 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.870
 At the beginning the little hands up are for 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.220
 rate the video not the product because 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.110
 I can not make the product 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.730
 like it or not but I would do 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.650
 the video so if the video liked it 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.630
 as I always say little hands up 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.460
 subscribe if they have not already 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.080
 made for youtube to notify them every 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.930
 who his new video and also attend 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.570
 can see my activity on youtube 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.170
 session 2 for this video martian font yes 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.170
 is the section
