00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.490
 the staff 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.179
 today we are going to test the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.090
 ford focus ford mandel e 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.139
 ford eco sport works with computer 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.820
 of board 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.500
 we have here then regulator of 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.590
 and voltage 5360 will be tested in 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.930
 bench with our testing alternator 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.830
 so neither the test coach we have 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.289
 here our lamp and we have after 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.969
 all the threads needed for us 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.690
 able to test any 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.160
 voltage outside the alternator 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.590
 so what we've connected the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.980
 Regulator to show you 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 on the one hand is that we have the positive 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.980
 but we have the stator terminal a 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.309
 Navy down here is one of the legs 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.090
 of schools and the other as a stimulator is 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.820
 one positive field regulator the other 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.190
 The brush tip is connected to the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.309
 we do not have a little picture up here 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.710
 a black is our negative 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.060
 then how the regulator is already connected 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.970
 not the coach 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.810
 just call the coach to 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.810
 start face 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.320
 he started loading 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.250
 note that these players do not need 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.040
 lamp to react to it see only with a 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.150
 signal coming here from our stator. 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.340
 roy son 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.350
 it has a connector context courts 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.480
 but we did not take any of the three 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.130
 terminals 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.490
 the nomenclature of these terminals is cs 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.960
 where ol is a signal that the regulator 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.860
 sends to the exchange 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.010
 You are a control signal from the central 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.260
 It was the regulator and is a positive OECI 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.970
 Battery sensor does not protest of 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.460
 we do not need to get any 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.920
 of the three terminals 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.760
 just fix our movie well one 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.190
 extractor 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.310
 if it is a contact the value will not 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.890
 start generating 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.340
 so that was another test from then 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.340
 you
