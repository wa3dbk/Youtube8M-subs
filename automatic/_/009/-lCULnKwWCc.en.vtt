 Entrance examination problem of prefectural high school in Kanagawa Prefecture From among English problems that were held in February 2013 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.650
 Let's do one question Yes 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.370
 This is a problem 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.610
 Yes 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:24.240
 Such a problem came out 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:28.860
 Tango I have a problem though 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:34.170
 It is difficult to answer for a moment if you do not know the composition of the sentence 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:39.750
 I think it was such a problem It is part of here that you have to answer 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.600
 It is said that these two words should be written here and this insistence 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.180
 It was a problem 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 Yes, because the Japanese translation of this sentence is actually attached, I will write while looking at that early 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.230

 That's a sentence, I'm glad 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:20.580
 I wonder why I'm so happy-it's about being cold and listening to it 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.900

 Good for surfing 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.690

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.650
 That what begins with m 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.189

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.720

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.700
 Yes 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:05.050
 I'd want you to remember is something I shall begin with the m in the ski 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.650
 Well moon certainly 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:14.500
 It is a moon which starts with m but it is in the sky 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:20.380
 Moon I'm no good that there is no, but I also want to put that Moon because it is the remaining Moon 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:25.069
 What it is that or a good month Toka two months it took Do'm not the month 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:30.690
 Or decision to Fu that Do's month when Tteyuu Toka next month or the month 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.590
 And august ys are good man one 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.310
 Right 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.000
 August is 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.290
 It is with good to enjoy the surfing 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.440
 It will be said that yes 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:51.670
 And the next sentence is kind of surf board du half 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:55.989
 What kind of surfboard do you have 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:59.740
 It's a quick translation, but what about add-on surfboards? 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:03.850
 It's I feel it 's yes and 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.630
 So I entered the other one is what Kaiser Brewer 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.910

 Blue is the guy that I'm above and r rainbow 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.120
 Well a rainbow is drawn 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.139
 That means 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.820
 Then I think I'm thinking of starting with m here 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:26.170
 If it were two words 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:32.320
 You can predict My Sama board 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:34.660

 It's a blue guy with a rainbow 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:46.550

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.350
 That's what that means, yes 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:17.710
 So I want you to be careful here every time 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:20.129
 wid rainbow I guess you probably won't do this in class 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.880
 For example 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:26.150
 this back is mine 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.220
 I think I did this 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.849
 Or thats 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.330

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:37.620
 Pace sheet 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:42.020
 I think I think that this did But Toka wonder if many times not before 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:45.980
 Maybe Tteyuu Mine in the wind is the subject Tteyuu is 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:49.580
 I think I wonder if not it was not Naraha 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.860
 But I want you to remember here 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.060
 For example 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.310
 turn 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.030
 Microphone 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:01.180
 The draft of when I say represents a = 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.110
 It is said that 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.820
 Oh hiko is a microphone 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.870
 That's why Mike 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.969
 It is said that 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.679
 Man 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:15.449
 Even the say 

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:19.710
 Say = j 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:22.650
 I mean it means chain = 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.970
 Because Mike = love 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.620
 If you look at the above sentence, the notebook is mine and this is a recall 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:36.060
 I can replace it 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:37.500
 Given the well that way but it is not true to Fu say asthma notebook for each 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.980

 Also say I Mai Ne Well Burudu 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:54.970
 I think that you can judge whether it is okay to come by any means of mine 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:57.910
 I feel that it was a little difficult problem, but the basics of this be verb 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.340
 If you have a job in mind 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.340
 I felt that it was a problem I could make
