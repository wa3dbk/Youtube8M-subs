40 kill streak so um until then I think
a<00:03:27.370> five<00:03:27.579> kill<00:03:27.910> life<00:03:28.060> or<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.299> 5k<00:03:28.750> d<00:03:28.810> pretty<00:03:29.139> much

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
a five kill life or a 5k d pretty much

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.080 
a five kill life or a 5k d pretty much
was<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.530> pretty<00:03:29.829> good<00:03:30.010> score<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.609> guess<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
was a pretty good score I guess the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.370 
was a pretty good score I guess the
Rockets<00:03:31.420> actually<00:03:31.660> did<00:03:31.780> have<00:03:31.870> one<00:03:32.019> shot<00:03:32.230> and

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
Rockets actually did have one shot and

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.830 
Rockets actually did have one shot and
left<00:03:32.590> in<00:03:32.739> them<00:03:32.889> and<00:03:33.209> some<00:03:34.209> people<00:03:34.420> say<00:03:34.630> they

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
left in them and some people say they

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.960 
left in them and some people say they
avoid<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.260> Rockets<00:03:35.650> after<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.069> but<00:03:36.310> one

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970

all<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.790> pros<00:04:26.240> they<00:04:26.600> would<00:04:26.750> not<00:04:26.960> slow<00:04:27.200> down

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
all the pros they would not slow down

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.500 
all the pros they would not slow down
the<00:04:27.500> shot<00:04:27.740> whatsoever<00:04:28.310> I'm<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.060> few<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.390> them

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
the shot whatsoever I'm a few of them

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.240 
the shot whatsoever I'm a few of them
would<00:04:29.630> slow<00:04:29.810> down<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:30.050> shot<00:04:30.350> for<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:31.070> head

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250

shot at the end on the five shot but

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.660 
shot at the end on the five shot but
most<00:04:33.230> of<00:04:33.320> them<00:04:33.380> are<00:04:33.500> just<00:04:33.560> going<00:04:33.800> for<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.430> full

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
most of them are just going for the full

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.300 
most of them are just going for the full
out<00:04:34.790> spray<00:04:35.240> if<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:35.840> compare<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.410> DMR's<00:04:36.890> full

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
out spray if you compare the DMR's full

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.810 
out spray if you compare the DMR's full
bloom<00:04:37.670> to<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.090> be<00:04:38.480> ours<00:04:38.660> on<00:04:39.400> standard<00:04:40.400> reticle

bloom to the be ours on standard reticle

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.180 
bloom to the be ours on standard reticle
it's<00:04:40.970> about<00:04:41.240> similar<00:04:41.810> um<00:04:42.500> so<00:04:42.800> if<00:04:42.890> you<00:04:42.920> think

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
it's about similar um so if you think

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.340 
it's about similar um so if you think
about<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.400> you're<00:04:43.550> pretty<00:04:43.820> much<00:04:44.260> when<00:04:45.260> you're

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
about it you're pretty much when you're

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.630 
about it you're pretty much when you're
spraying<00:04:45.620> off<00:04:45.800> your<00:04:45.950> bullets<00:04:46.190> like<00:04:46.280> that<00:04:46.460> it's

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
spraying off your bullets like that it's

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.320 
spraying off your bullets like that it's
kind<00:04:46.850> of<00:04:46.880> like<00:04:46.970> using<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.360> br<00:04:48.050> from<00:04:48.410> Halo<00:04:48.680> 3<00:04:48.710> and

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
kind of like using a br from Halo 3 and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.900 
kind of like using a br from Halo 3 and
I've<00:04:50.330> been<00:04:50.540> using<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.870> method<00:04:51.290> lately<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.820> I

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
I've been using that method lately and I

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.220 
I've been using that method lately and I
find<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.180> more<00:04:53.330> effective<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.720> kill<00:04:54.020> see<00:04:54.170> all

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
find a more effective to kill see all

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.820 
find a more effective to kill see all
that<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.440> second<00:04:54.890> faster

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.630 

you<00:04:58.830> see<00:04:59.010> here<00:04:59.190> this<00:04:59.340> is<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.460> good

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
you see here this is a good

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.100

communication on my team I go for the
melee<00:05:01.440> just<00:05:01.650> because<00:05:01.920> I<00:05:02.160> get<00:05:02.400> them<00:05:02.490> down<00:05:02.610> at

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
melee just because I get them down at

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.340 
melee just because I get them down at
one<00:05:02.910> shot<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.330> then<00:05:03.480> somebody<00:05:03.840> cleans<00:05:04.170> it<00:05:04.290> up

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
one shot and then somebody cleans it up

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.380 
one shot and then somebody cleans it up
looks<00:05:05.070> like<00:05:05.250> Wayne<00:05:05.490> cleaned<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:05.910> up

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.690 

you<00:05:10.200> see<00:05:10.380> here<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.590> key<00:05:10.710> once<00:05:10.890> circling<00:05:11.580> back

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
you see here a key once circling back

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.030 
you see here a key once circling back
down<00:05:11.940> towards<00:05:12.270> rockets<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.350> keep<00:05:13.650> on<00:05:13.770> going

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
down towards rockets and I keep on going

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.820 
down towards rockets and I keep on going
just<00:05:14.430> back<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.670> get<00:05:14.970> them<00:05:15.320> what<00:05:16.320> I<00:05:16.350> do<00:05:16.470> here<00:05:16.740> is

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
just back to get them what I do here is

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.110 
just back to get them what I do here is
I'm<00:05:16.950> not<00:05:17.160> gonna<00:05:17.280> leave<00:05:17.580> them<00:05:17.790> just<00:05:17.820> because

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
I'm not gonna leave them just because

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.970 
I'm not gonna leave them just because
they<00:05:18.300> should<00:05:18.540> spawn<00:05:18.870> back<00:05:19.140> in<00:05:19.380> about<00:05:19.530> 15

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
they should spawn back in about 15

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.850 
they should spawn back in about 15
seconds<00:05:20.960> that's<00:05:21.960> what<00:05:22.110> a<00:05:22.140> would<00:05:22.380> have<00:05:22.470> been<00:05:22.620> or

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
seconds that's what a would have been or

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.260 
seconds that's what a would have been or
actually<00:05:23.040> no<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:23.370> should<00:05:23.520> be<00:05:23.640> a<00:05:23.820> minute<00:05:24.150> from

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
actually no it should be a minute from

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.670 
actually no it should be a minute from
now<00:05:24.330> but<00:05:24.630> since<00:05:24.900> that<00:05:24.960> little<00:05:25.170> host<00:05:25.470> migration

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
now but since that little host migration

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.950 
now but since that little host migration
thing<00:05:26.280> it'll<00:05:26.520> be<00:05:26.580> 15<00:05:26.910> seconds<00:05:27.630> when<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.810> next

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
thing it'll be 15 seconds when the next

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.410 
thing it'll be 15 seconds when the next
rocket<00:05:28.380> spawns<00:05:28.760> so<00:05:29.760> that's<00:05:29.940> things<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.360> keep

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
rocket spawns so that's things to keep

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.630 
rocket spawns so that's things to keep
into<00:05:30.810> in<00:05:31.200> check<00:05:31.650> just<00:05:31.980> to<00:05:32.070> make<00:05:32.130> sure<00:05:32.250> you<00:05:32.520> know

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
into in check just to make sure you know

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.790 
into in check just to make sure you know
and<00:05:32.820> power<00:05:33.000> weapons<00:05:33.300> spawn<00:05:33.650> it's<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.680> good

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
and power weapons spawn it's a good

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.540 
and power weapons spawn it's a good
example<00:05:35.280> of<00:05:35.310> things<00:05:35.760> switching<00:05:36.180> like<00:05:36.330> that<00:05:37.550> um

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
example of things switching like that um

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.880 
example of things switching like that um
they<00:05:39.090> will<00:05:39.240> not<00:05:39.330> spawn<00:05:39.720> also<00:05:40.080> if<00:05:40.350> you<00:05:40.680> have<00:05:40.860> a

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
they will not spawn also if you have a

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.500 
they will not spawn also if you have a
power<00:05:41.190> weapon<00:05:41.520> in<00:05:41.610> your<00:05:41.640> hand<00:05:41.760> so<00:05:42.210> if<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:42.420> have

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
power weapon in your hand so if you have

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.730 
power weapon in your hand so if you have
the<00:05:42.630> sniper<00:05:42.870> in<00:05:43.020> your<00:05:43.140> hand<00:05:43.290> and<00:05:43.440> you<00:05:43.530> wait

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
the sniper in your hand and you wait

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.100 
the sniper in your hand and you wait
another<00:05:44.070> 90<00:05:45.030> seconds<00:05:45.420> to<00:05:45.600> a<00:05:45.630> minute<00:05:45.750> and<00:05:46.020> a

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
another 90 seconds to a minute and a

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.250 
another 90 seconds to a minute and a
half<00:05:46.310> they<00:05:47.310> will<00:05:47.520> not<00:05:47.640> spawn<00:05:48.030> back<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:48.960> you're

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
half they will not spawn back so you're

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.830 
half they will not spawn back so you're
gonna<00:05:49.380> have<00:05:49.530> to<00:05:49.620> drop<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.190> weapon<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.840> do

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
gonna have to drop the weapon and do

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.000 
gonna have to drop the weapon and do
something<00:05:52.170> about<00:05:52.260> it<00:05:52.380> before<00:05:52.800> you<00:05:52.920> can

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
something about it before you can

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.220 
something about it before you can
actually<00:05:53.160> pick<00:05:53.400> it<00:05:53.490> up<00:05:53.580> again<00:05:53.990> but<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.020> think

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
actually pick it up again but I think

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.720 
actually pick it up again but I think
this<00:05:55.380> game<00:05:55.500> is<00:05:55.560> coming<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:55.920> a<00:05:55.950> close<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:56.460> get
