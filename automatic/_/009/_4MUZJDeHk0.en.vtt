 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki 

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:10.800
 and today I will show you how to easily block the Internet troll on YouTube when he made his channel 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.467
 unavailable to the public. 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.467
 Unfortunately, in this case, we can not just enter his channel and block it, and again as we delete the comment 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.533
 right away, as I did in this one case of this "gentleman" whom you see here. 

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:34.667
 Well, then, we do not have the possibility of blocking. 

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:38.267
 Please see, I click on his channel. 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.133
 Something goes a long way ... unfortunately the channel is unavailable. 

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:58.467
 Of course, the online troll can create channels endlessly or also use the help of colleagues, but I say 

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:06.200
 the blockade takes you 10 seconds, while creating the account for a few minutes. 

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:16.733
 A simple removal is done here - it blocks us from being able to enter the troll channel and blocking it from the channel position. 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:26.867
 Please, however, see what we do - a simple trick, we do accept, answer ... 

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:38.533
 and in response we have to share, delete, report as spam, report as spam damage, although you can and do block user. 

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:46.270
 Are you sure to block this user - ok, although it is not exactly the same user, but I have the impression that it is 

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:50.000
 colleague of my "friend" and "favorite". 

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:56.530
 I see that the comment is rather how to say ... 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:06.470
 it is hard to say that it is Nazi but that it is a channel of this "gentleman" and his interests 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.070
 rather, it does not bring me much. 

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:38.200
 Also again - as we have accepted, we block, and then we simply delete this comment - and that's what it was all about. 

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:43.270
 In principle, you can say after ptokach. 

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:54.730
 I hope that this movie will help normal people because even in the People's Poland, no one has healed the lice. 

00:02:55.133 --> 00:03:05.800
 Said Darek Kraśnicki from Wrocław, necessarily comment on the experience with this rather interesting group of Internet users. 

00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:11.870
 You can comment on both my blog and the YouTube channel. 

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:15.600
