number<00:00:02.610> 31<00:00:03.330> this<00:00:03.899> week<00:00:04.170> I'm<00:00:04.319> going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> be

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
number 31 this week I'm going to be

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.079 
number 31 this week I'm going to be
demonstrating<00:00:04.799> how<00:00:05.339> you<00:00:05.370> can<00:00:05.460> use<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.879> camera

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
demonstrating how you can use the camera

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.720 
demonstrating how you can use the camera
acts<00:00:06.470> to<00:00:07.470> photograph<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.010> popping<00:00:08.429> balloon

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
acts to photograph a popping balloon

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.959 
acts to photograph a popping balloon
using<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.510> microphone<00:00:09.840> sensor<00:00:10.580> so<00:00:11.580> before<00:00:11.940> I

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
using the microphone sensor so before I

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.419 
using the microphone sensor so before I
get<00:00:12.179> into<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.540> setup<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.990> wanted<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.370> explain<00:00:14.370> a

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
get into the setup I wanted to explain a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.400 
get into the setup I wanted to explain a
little<00:00:14.759> bit<00:00:15.030> about<00:00:15.240> popping<00:00:15.780> balloons<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
little bit about popping balloons and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.500 
little bit about popping balloons and
the<00:00:16.949> different<00:00:17.250> effects<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.670> can<00:00:17.850> get<00:00:18.119> by

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the different effects you can get by

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.939 
the different effects you can get by
filling<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> balloon<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.710> slightly

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
filling the balloon with just slightly

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.160 
filling the balloon with just slightly
different<00:00:20.400> things<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.449> one<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.840> filled

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
different things so this one is filled

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.400 
different things so this one is filled
with<00:00:23.000> mostly<00:00:24.000> air<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.140> little

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
with mostly air and then just a little

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.140 
with mostly air and then just a little
bit<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.619> water<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.220> that'll<00:00:26.490> create<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.789> mist

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
bit of water and that'll create a mist

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.700 
bit of water and that'll create a mist
when<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.480> pops<00:00:27.720> which<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> pretty<00:00:28.500> neat

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
when it pops which is a pretty neat

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.400 
when it pops which is a pretty neat
effect<00:00:29.039> I've<00:00:29.640> also<00:00:29.880> tried<00:00:30.480> filling<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.380> with

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
effect I've also tried filling it with

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.979 
effect I've also tried filling it with
just<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.800> little<00:00:31.920> bit<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.279> powder<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.820> then<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
just a little bit of powder and then the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.110 
just a little bit of powder and then the
more<00:00:34.140> messy<00:00:34.500> version<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.550> fill<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
more messy version is to fill the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
more messy version is to fill the
balloon<00:00:36.210> completely<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.110> water<00:00:37.290> which

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
balloon completely with water which

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.700 
balloon completely with water which
creates<00:00:37.860> neat<00:00:38.309> effect<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:40.110> prepared<00:00:40.530> for

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
creates neat effect but be prepared for

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.900 
creates neat effect but be prepared for
a<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:40.890> bit<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.190> mess<00:00:41.340> when<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.640> do<00:00:41.760> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
a little bit of mess when you do that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.360 
a little bit of mess when you do that
version<00:00:42.230> now<00:00:43.230> I'll<00:00:43.379> demonstrate<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.070> menu

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
version now I'll demonstrate the menu

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.979 
version now I'll demonstrate the menu
set<00:00:44.610> up<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.000> camera<00:00:45.300> acts<00:00:45.450> I'm<00:00:45.750> just

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
set up for the camera acts I'm just

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.270 
set up for the camera acts I'm just
holding<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> activate<00:00:46.770> button<00:00:46.800> down<00:00:47.250> while

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
holding the activate button down while

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.520 
holding the activate button down while
turning<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.300> reset<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.079> camera<00:00:49.320> acts

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
turning it on to reset the camera acts

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.779 
turning it on to reset the camera acts
to<00:00:49.800> its<00:00:49.950> factory<00:00:50.610> defaults<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:53.760> I

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
to its factory defaults and now all I

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.689 
to its factory defaults and now all I
need<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.600> plug<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.800> microphone

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
need to do is plug in a microphone

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.529 
need to do is plug in a microphone
sensor<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.960> sensor<00:00:57.989> port<00:00:58.559> number<00:00:58.800> one<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.539> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
sensor the sensor port number one and it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.200 
sensor the sensor port number one and it
flash<00:01:02.120> into<00:01:03.120> camera<00:01:03.840> flash<00:01:04.110> number<00:01:04.739> one<00:01:05.210> this

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
flash into camera flash number one this

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.310 
flash into camera flash number one this
is<00:01:06.479> what<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.979> microphone<00:01:07.979> sensor<00:01:08.430> looks<00:01:08.640> like

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
is what the microphone sensor looks like

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
is what the microphone sensor looks like
that's<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.770> all<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.340> need<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.790> for

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that's really all you need to do for

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.120 
that's really all you need to do for
setup<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.200> hit<00:01:13.320> activate<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
setup then you just hit activate and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679 
setup then you just hit activate and
it's<00:01:15.000> ready<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> go

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it's ready to go

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.690 
it's ready to go
the<00:01:16.110> reason<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.070> default<00:01:17.460> menu

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the reason is because the default menu

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.140 
the reason is because the default menu
settings<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.560> compatible<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:20.150> microphone

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
settings are compatible with microphone

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.740 
settings are compatible with microphone
sensor

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
sensor

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.170 
sensor
I'll<00:01:21.900> quick<00:01:22.350> go<00:01:22.560> through<00:01:22.830> those<00:01:23.040> though<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
I'll quick go through those though so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.179 
I'll quick go through those though so
I'm<00:01:24.299> device<00:01:24.630> number<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> flash

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
I'm device number one will be the flash

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.370 
I'm device number one will be the flash
and<00:01:26.610> sensor<00:01:27.570> port<00:01:27.810> number<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and sensor port number one is the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.660 
and sensor port number one is the
microphone<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.040> we're<00:01:29.159> saying<00:01:29.369> those<00:01:29.640> are

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
microphone so we're saying those are

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.380 
microphone so we're saying those are
interacting<00:01:31.280> delay<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.460> milliseconds<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.299> I'm

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
interacting delay in milliseconds so I'm

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.940 
interacting delay in milliseconds so I'm
going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.869> tweak<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.680> bit

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
going to have to tweak this a little bit

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.410 
going to have to tweak this a little bit
to<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> right<00:01:36.090> amount<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.460> delay<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
to get the right amount of delay but you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.929 
to get the right amount of delay but you
get<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.750> sort<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.110> by<00:01:40.579> experimentation<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
get that sort of by experimentation so

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.649 
get that sort of by experimentation so
if<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.750> taking<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.799> photograph<00:01:44.040> too<00:01:44.700> soon<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
if it's taking a photograph too soon you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.590 
if it's taking a photograph too soon you
will<00:01:46.159> increase<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> delay<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.360> too

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
will increase the delay and if it's too

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.560 
will increase the delay and if it's too
late<00:01:48.869> you'll<00:01:49.229> decrease<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.979> delay<00:01:50.420> but<00:01:51.420> we'll

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
late you'll decrease the delay but we'll

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.020 
late you'll decrease the delay but we'll
start<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:51.869> zero<00:01:52.259> also<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> microphone

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
start with zero also with a microphone

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.090 
start with zero also with a microphone
sensor<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.810> sound<00:01:55.259> travels<00:01:55.409> fairly

sensor because sound travels fairly

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.770 
sensor because sound travels fairly
slowly<00:01:56.430> through<00:01:56.850> air<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.600> actually

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
slowly through air you can actually

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.859 
slowly through air you can actually
fine-tune<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.700> timing<00:02:00.119> by<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.479> moving

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
fine-tune the the timing by just moving

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.429 
fine-tune the the timing by just moving
the<00:02:01.170> microphone<00:02:01.770> sensor<00:02:02.520> closer<00:02:03.210> or<00:02:03.570> near<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
pretty focus is not something we care

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.149 
pretty focus is not something we care
about<00:02:13.150> because<00:02:13.780> we're<00:02:14.440> not<00:02:14.590> actually<00:02:14.830> going

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
about because we're not actually going

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.550 
about because we're not actually going
to<00:02:15.220> be<00:02:15.280> attaching<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.970> camera<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.200> camera

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
to be attaching the camera to the camera

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.979 
to be attaching the camera to the camera
acts<00:02:17.650> it's<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.220> flash<00:02:18.629> we've<00:02:19.629> that<00:02:19.810> at

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
acts it's just the flash we've that at

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.680 
acts it's just the flash we've that at
no<00:02:20.280> trigger<00:02:21.280> type<00:02:21.610> with<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.239> microphone

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
sensor hi is fine trigger value is the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.930 
sensor hi is fine trigger value is the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
value where the camera acts will trigger

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.369 
value where the camera acts will trigger
and<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.180> can<00:02:31.330> see<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:31.569> fluctuating<00:02:31.900> quite<00:02:32.349> a

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
and you can see it's fluctuating quite a

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.229 
and you can see it's fluctuating quite a
bit<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.650> that's<00:02:32.709> because<00:02:33.069> I'm<00:02:33.190> talking<00:02:33.670> if<00:02:34.090> I

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
bit and that's because I'm talking if I

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.660 
bit and that's because I'm talking if I
snap<00:02:34.599> my<00:02:34.629> fingers<00:02:34.780> it'll<00:02:35.500> go<00:02:35.829> spike<00:02:36.160> up<00:02:36.340> over

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
snap my fingers it'll go spike up over

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.050 
snap my fingers it'll go spike up over
700<00:02:37.269> which<00:02:37.750> basically<00:02:38.110> means<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.819> I've<00:02:39.819> got

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
700 which basically means that I've got

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.800 
700 which basically means that I've got
a<00:02:40.090> good<00:02:40.299> value<00:02:40.540> here<00:02:40.750> for<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> trigger<00:02:41.829> high

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
a good value here for a trigger high

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.780 
a good value here for a trigger high
setting<00:02:43.810> with<00:02:44.200> power<00:02:44.500> doesn't<00:02:45.400> really<00:02:45.549> matter

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
setting with power doesn't really matter

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.559 
setting with power doesn't really matter
for<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.859> setup<00:02:47.940> that's<00:02:48.940> pretty<00:02:49.299> much<00:02:49.420> an

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
for this setup that's pretty much an

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.839 
for this setup that's pretty much an
overview<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.109> settings<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.950> we're<00:02:51.640> good

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
overview of the settings so we're good

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.150 
overview of the settings so we're good
to<00:02:52.030> go<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:53.019> department<00:02:53.590> all<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:53.739> need<00:02:54.010> to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
to go in that department all I need to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.490 
to go in that department all I need to
do<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.549> turn<00:02:55.540> on<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:57.209> photo<00:02:58.209> mode<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.379> do

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
do is turn on the photo mode and to do

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.110 
do is turn on the photo mode and to do
that<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.680> hit<00:02:59.859> the<00:02:59.980> activate<00:03:00.459> button<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.030> then

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
that I hit the activate button and then

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.690 
that I hit the activate button and then
when<00:03:02.019> I<00:03:02.049> hit<00:03:02.260> this<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.950> can<00:03:03.099> see<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.459> light

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
when I hit this you can see that light

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.309 
when I hit this you can see that light
goes<00:03:03.940> on<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.450> actually<00:03:04.930> means<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
goes on and that actually means that the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.559 
goes on and that actually means that the
flash<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:05.709> being<00:03:06.129> triggered<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:07.209> from<00:03:07.450> this

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
flash is being triggered so from this

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.000 
flash is being triggered so from this
angle<00:03:07.629> you<00:03:08.019> can<00:03:08.170> see<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.470> set<00:03:08.650> up<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.829> little

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
angle you can see the set up a little

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.130 
angle you can see the set up a little
bit<00:03:09.190> better<00:03:09.390> back<00:03:10.390> here<00:03:10.629> we<00:03:10.750> have<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.959> camera

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
bit better back here we have the camera

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.930 
bit better back here we have the camera
act<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.799> that's<00:03:12.010> ready<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.400> trigger<00:03:12.790> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
act and that's ready to trigger the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.920 
act and that's ready to trigger the
flash<00:03:14.700> right<00:03:15.700> here<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.120> microphone<00:03:16.660> and

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
flash right here is the microphone and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.550 
flash right here is the microphone and
that<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:18.000> close<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.389> balloon<00:03:19.630> so<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.109> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
that is close to the balloon so that the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.140 
that is close to the balloon so that the
sound<00:03:20.859> traveling<00:03:21.459> through<00:03:21.669> the<00:03:21.760> air<00:03:21.880> won't

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
sound traveling through the air won't

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.780 
sound traveling through the air won't
add<00:03:22.450> too<00:03:22.690> much<00:03:22.840> delay<00:03:23.340> over<00:03:24.340> here<00:03:24.549> we've<00:03:24.760> got

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
add too much delay over here we've got

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.170 
add too much delay over here we've got
the<00:03:25.660> camera<00:03:26.349> and<00:03:26.560> it's<00:03:26.799> set<00:03:27.280> up<00:03:27.310> fully<00:03:28.000> in

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
the camera and it's set up fully in

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.000 
the camera and it's set up fully in
manual<00:03:28.599> mode<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:29.079> pre<00:03:29.680> set<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.040> aperture<00:03:30.400> ISO

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
manual mode I pre set the aperture ISO

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.170 
manual mode I pre set the aperture ISO
shutter<00:03:33.010> speed<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:35.829> what<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.069> want<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.669> I<00:03:37.120> do

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
shutter speed to what I want and I do

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.610 
shutter speed to what I want and I do
have<00:03:37.389> the<00:03:37.480> shutter<00:03:37.690> speed<00:03:37.870> set<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.440> two

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
have the shutter speed set to two

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.559 
have the shutter speed set to two
seconds<00:03:39.099> right<00:03:39.220> now<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:39.669> I'll<00:03:40.060> have<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.389> turn

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
seconds right now so I'll have to turn

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.900 
seconds right now so I'll have to turn
off<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.930> lights<00:03:41.169> and<00:03:41.500> then<00:03:41.980> we<00:03:42.160> expect<00:03:42.609> that

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
off the lights and then we expect that

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.629 
off the lights and then we expect that
the<00:03:43.180> flash<00:03:43.569> will<00:03:43.959> light<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.859> scene<00:03:45.099> during

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
the flash will light the scene during

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.550 
the flash will light the scene during
those<00:03:45.910> two<00:03:46.239> seconds<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.780> exposure<00:03:46.870> otherwise

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
those two seconds of exposure otherwise

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.789 
those two seconds of exposure otherwise
it<00:03:47.769> would<00:03:47.859> just<00:03:48.040> be<00:03:48.190> black<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.780> over<00:03:50.349> here<00:03:50.590> is

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
it would just be black and over here is

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.270 
it would just be black and over here is
the<00:03:50.829> flash<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:53.260> going<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.530> be<00:03:53.620> activated

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
the flash and it's going to be activated

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.970 
the flash and it's going to be activated
by<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.519> camera<00:03:55.239> acts<00:03:55.590> now<00:03:56.590> I'll<00:03:56.739> turn<00:03:56.919> the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
by the camera acts now I'll turn the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.030 
by the camera acts now I'll turn the
camera<00:03:57.220> acts<00:03:57.549> on

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.490 

with<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.760> activate<00:04:02.150> button<00:04:02.230> now<00:04:03.230> whenever

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
with the activate button now whenever
