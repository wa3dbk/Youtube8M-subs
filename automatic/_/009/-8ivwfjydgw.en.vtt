that's<00:00:22.260> when<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.529> cold<00:00:22.740> anyway<00:00:23.510> let's<00:00:24.510> open

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
that's when it's cold anyway let's open

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:41.479 
that's when it's cold anyway let's open
it<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.019> find<00:00:25.289> out<00:00:25.470> what<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:40.219> and<00:00:41.219> always

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
it up and find out what is and always

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.190 
it up and find out what is and always
right<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.480> molder<00:00:43.820> para<00:00:44.820> morphix

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.840 

and<00:00:49.200> now<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.920> says<00:00:50.070> toys<00:00:50.489> are

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and now you can see it says toys are

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.010 
and now you can see it says toys are
free<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.690> three<00:00:52.050> years<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:53.870> go<00:00:54.870> like

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
free just three years and up go like

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.200 
free just three years and up go like
these<00:00:55.199> little<00:00:55.469> pictures<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.949> cars<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.520> stuff

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.789 

so<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.449> only<00:01:03.570> other<00:01:03.719> thing<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
so the only other thing in the in the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.080 
so the only other thing in the in the
pocket<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.420> sort<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:07.700> flour<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
pocket is just some sort of flour and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.600 
pocket is just some sort of flour and
other<00:01:09.659> sizing<00:01:10.080> products<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:11.180> team<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
other sizing products on a team are so I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.660 
other sizing products on a team are so I
think<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.450> actually<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.140> sea<00:01:19.380> by<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
think this is actually at sea by to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.130 
think this is actually at sea by to
shape<00:01:20.670> mud<00:01:23.119> cut<00:01:24.119> number<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.509> watch<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.840> cost

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
shape mud cut number and watch this cost

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:55.990 
shape mud cut number and watch this cost
I<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.619> was<00:01:25.710> only<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.310> couple<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.820> pounds

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.790 

so<00:01:57.000> I'll<00:01:57.090> show<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.330> how<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.990> compares<00:01:58.440> of

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
so I'll show you how this compares of

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.330 
so I'll show you how this compares of
the<00:01:59.130> other<00:01:59.670> size<00:01:59.940> compares<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:01.340> regular

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the other size compares to a regular

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:13.330 
the other size compares to a regular
size<00:02:02.580> C<00:02:02.970> by<00:02:03.180> 2<00:02:05.150> so<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:06.300> so<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.780> quite<00:02:06.960> big

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.699 

turns<00:02:14.340> okay<00:02:16.010> goes<00:02:17.010> up<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.340> molder<00:02:17.940> cheapness

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
turns okay goes up that molder cheapness

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:31.100 
turns okay goes up that molder cheapness
feel<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:29.010> see<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.000> saw<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.420> sir<00:02:30.720> scrum

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
feel to it and see I saw that sir scrum

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.820 
feel to it and see I saw that sir scrum
what's<00:02:31.350> up<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.660> as<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:36.930> see<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.350> shape

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
what's up so as you can see it shape

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:55.899 
what's up so as you can see it shape
shifts

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.100 

okay<00:02:56.909> so<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.239> didn't<00:02:57.510> really<00:02:57.840> go<00:02:57.959> well

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
okay so that didn't really go well

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.850 
okay so that didn't really go well
because<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:59.959> basically<00:03:00.959> solved<00:03:01.379> it<00:03:01.470> again<00:03:01.680> by

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
because I basically solved it again by

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.869 
because I basically solved it again by
accident

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.309 

maybe<00:03:05.879> I<00:03:06.000> wasn't<00:03:06.209> scrambling<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.049> in<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
maybe I wasn't scrambling it in the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.509 
maybe I wasn't scrambling it in the
right<00:03:07.890> way<00:03:07.920> I'm<00:03:08.220> not<00:03:08.400> sure<00:03:10.190> if<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.489> a

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
right way I'm not sure if this is a

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.460 
right way I'm not sure if this is a
two-by-two<00:03:12.000> shape<00:03:12.540> up<00:03:12.750> then<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.019> shouldn't<00:03:13.349> be

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
two-by-two shape up then it shouldn't be

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:34.460 
two-by-two shape up then it shouldn't be
that<00:03:13.500> easy<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:14.129> solve<00:03:32.930> yeah<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:33.959> don't<00:03:34.109> know<00:03:34.379> I'm

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
that easy to solve yeah I don't know I'm

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.500 
that easy to solve yeah I don't know I'm
not<00:03:34.530> sure<00:03:34.799> if<00:03:34.950> I'm<00:03:35.099> scrambling<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:36.090> properly

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
not sure if I'm scrambling it properly

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.319 
not sure if I'm scrambling it properly
or<00:03:36.629> not<00:03:36.660> but<00:03:37.370> yeah<00:03:38.370> I'll<00:03:38.609> have<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:38.940> after

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
or not but yeah I'll have to a after

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.789 
or not but yeah I'll have to a after
look<00:03:39.870> into<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.319> puzzle

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
look into this puzzle

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.949 
look into this puzzle
I<00:03:40.910> mean<00:03:41.910> I've<00:03:42.000> watched<00:03:42.180> some<00:03:42.359> videos<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.900> this

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
I mean I've watched some videos of this

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.839 
I mean I've watched some videos of this
puzzle<00:03:43.349> on<00:03:43.560> YouTube<00:03:44.040> before<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.549> know<00:03:44.670> before

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
puzzle on YouTube before you know before

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.280 
puzzle on YouTube before you know before
buying<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.660> see<00:03:45.810> if<00:03:45.870> it's<00:03:46.049> something

buying this to see if it's something

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.130 
buying this to see if it's something
that<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.470> wanted<00:03:47.000> but<00:03:48.000> I've<00:03:48.060> not<00:03:48.239> really<00:03:48.510> proper

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140
