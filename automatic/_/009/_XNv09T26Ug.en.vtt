and that's from one use of like sticking

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.920 
and that's from one use of like sticking
it<00:00:48.129> in<00:00:48.220> my<00:00:48.250> hair<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:48.820> I<00:00:49.450> didn't<00:00:49.660> even<00:00:49.720> have

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
it in my hair and I didn't even have

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.780 
it in my hair and I didn't even have
that<00:00:50.170> thick<00:00:50.379> of<00:00:50.500> hair<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:51.309> if<00:00:51.430> you<00:00:51.519> had<00:00:51.640> really

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
that thick of hair so if you had really

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.460 
that thick of hair so if you had really
thick<00:00:52.030> hair<00:00:52.300> you<00:00:52.750> can<00:00:52.900> imagine<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.290> this

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
thick hair you can imagine that this

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.040 
thick hair you can imagine that this
would<00:00:53.620> be<00:00:53.739> way<00:00:53.920> wider<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.600> you<00:00:55.629> only<00:00:55.839> get

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
would be way wider so you only get

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.410 
would be way wider so you only get
really<00:00:56.260> one<00:00:56.470> maybe<00:00:56.800> two<00:00:57.129> uses<00:00:57.550> out<00:00:57.699> of<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:57.970> so

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
really one maybe two uses out of that so

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.820 
really one maybe two uses out of that so

doesn't catch the light as easily so it

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.290 
doesn't catch the light as easily so it
