tip here for how to synchronize your

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.810 
tip here for how to synchronize your
audio<00:01:03.000> properly<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> do<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.830> clap<00:01:05.220> once

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
audio properly what I do is I clap once

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.710 
audio properly what I do is I clap once
and<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:08.490> show<00:01:08.520> up<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> spike<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and that will show up as a spike on the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020 
and that will show up as a spike on the
audio<00:01:10.140> track<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.799> my<00:01:10.950> editing<00:01:11.280> software<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
audio track in my editing software and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
audio track in my editing software and
then<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.990> easy<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.590> overlay<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.130> two

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
then it's really easy to overlay the two

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.580 
then it's really easy to overlay the two
tracks<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.720> other<00:01:15.900> thing<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
tracks one other thing that's kind of

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.620 
tracks one other thing that's kind of
cool<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.640> you're<00:01:17.759> using<00:01:17.909> your<00:01:18.119> phone<00:01:18.150> as

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
headphones and use the microphone on

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.690 
headphones and use the microphone on
your<00:01:24.119> headphones<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:26.159> microphone

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
your headphones as the microphone

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
your headphones as the microphone
instead<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> microphone<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> phone

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
instead of the microphone on the phone

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.569 
instead of the microphone on the phone
and<00:01:28.380> I'll<00:01:28.470> put<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.130> these<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.490> I'll

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and I'll put one of these in and I'll

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.340 
and I'll put one of these in and I'll
make<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:29.909> audio<00:01:30.180> clip<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
make a little audio clip of it so you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.200 
make a little audio clip of it so you
can<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.490> difference<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.970> audio

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
can see the the difference in the audio

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.520 
can see the the difference in the audio
quality<00:01:33.360> between<00:01:33.659> using<00:01:33.960> your<00:01:34.049> headphones

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
as the recorder and you can see a bit of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.359 
as the recorder and you can see a bit of
the<00:01:48.540> difference<00:01:48.899> between<00:01:48.930> using<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
