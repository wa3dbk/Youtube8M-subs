00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
than perhaps it should be or it could be

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.920 
than perhaps it should be or it could be
within<00:00:58.739> Destiny's<00:00:59.399> PvP<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.629> top<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.840> this

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
within Destiny's PvP and on top of this

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.599 
within Destiny's PvP and on top of this
no<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:01.620> spoken<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
no one is really spoken about or I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.250 
no one is really spoken about or I
haven't<00:01:02.969> heard<00:01:03.180> anyone<00:01:03.449> really<00:01:03.809> speaking

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
haven't heard anyone really speaking

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.560 
haven't heard anyone really speaking
about<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.799> more<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.369> all<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.820> how<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> kind

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
about the more it all and how the kind

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
about the more it all and how the kind
of<00:01:06.630> patch<00:01:06.810> may<00:01:07.049> affect<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.710> whether<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
of patch may affect it and whether it

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.370 
of patch may affect it and whether it
will<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.460> good<00:01:08.820> weapon<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.720> taken<00:01:10.140> King

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
will be a good weapon in the taken King

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170 
will be a good weapon in the taken King
so<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.310> actually<00:01:11.430> will<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> pretty

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so I think it actually will be a pretty

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.060 
so I think it actually will be a pretty
damn<00:01:12.630> good<00:01:12.689> weapon<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> taking<00:01:13.890> Kings

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
damn good weapon in the taking Kings

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.859 
damn good weapon in the taking Kings
crucible<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.640> firstly<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
crucible so firstly right now it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.260 
crucible so firstly right now it
performs<00:01:16.320> pretty<00:01:16.680> well<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.310> 55<00:01:17.909> crit

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
performs pretty well you get the 55 crit

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.520 
performs pretty well you get the 55 crit
damage<00:01:18.450> obviously<00:01:19.049> you've<00:01:19.170> got<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> high

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
damage obviously you've got the high

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
damage obviously you've got the high
rate<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.830> fire<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.670> tends<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> work<00:01:21.210> well<00:01:21.540> with

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
rate of fire it tends to work well with

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.480 
rate of fire it tends to work well with
the<00:01:21.750> high<00:01:22.080> agility<00:01:22.229> builds<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.100> kind<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the high agility builds and kind of the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.789 
the high agility builds and kind of the
straight<00:01:23.909> style<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.630> gunfight<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.650> can

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
straight style of gunfight in you can

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.530 
straight style of gunfight in you can
get<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> good<00:01:26.220> kind<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.580> strafe<00:01:26.850> movement<00:01:27.330> I'm

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.240 
get a good kind of strafe movement I'm
not<00:01:27.780> necessarily<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> best<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:28.979> some

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
not necessarily the best at it but some

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.130 
not necessarily the best at it but some
people<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.759> insanely<00:01:30.210> good<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
people are insanely good with the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.179 
people are insanely good with the
multi-tool<00:01:31.530> because<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> those

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
multi-tool because it's one of those

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
multi-tool because it's one of those
guns<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.970> takes<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.450> little<00:01:33.600> bit<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.810> skill<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
guns that takes a little bit of skill to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.679 
guns that takes a little bit of skill to
use<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:35.100> kind<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.490> more<00:01:35.729> skill<00:01:36.030> than<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.450> some

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
use or kind of more skill than have some

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.690 
use or kind of more skill than have some
of<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.840> other<00:01:36.990> well<00:01:37.650> performing<00:01:38.280> weapons

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
of the other well performing weapons

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.030 
of the other well performing weapons
within<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.600> crucible<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.650> duel<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
within the crucible but if you duel and

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.440 
within the crucible but if you duel and
all<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.369> your<00:01:41.490> shots<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.240> very

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
all of your shots you know it's very

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
all of your shots you know it's very
very<00:01:42.780> rewarding<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.770> pretty<00:01:43.950> effective

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
very rewarding and a pretty effective

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.609 
very rewarding and a pretty effective
weapon<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.210> general<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.079> that's<00:01:46.229> kind<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.470> why

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
weapon in general so that's kind of why

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.260 
weapon in general so that's kind of why
I<00:01:46.649> wanted<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> talk<00:01:47.100> about<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.850> little<00:01:48.090> bit

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
I wanted to talk about it a little bit

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.520 
I wanted to talk about it a little bit
because<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.780> said<00:01:48.899> before<00:01:49.020> no<00:01:49.380> one's

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
because like I said before no one's

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
because like I said before no one's
really<00:01:49.799> spoken<00:01:50.220> about<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:50.880> also

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
really spoken about the more it's also

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.149 
really spoken about the more it's also
in<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.869> weapon<00:01:52.200> patch<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.740> nothing

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
in the weapon patch there is nothing

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.800 
in the weapon patch there is nothing
specific<00:01:53.729> or<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.119> didn't<00:01:54.390> list<00:01:54.540> anything

specific during the preview that will be

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.789 
specific during the preview that will be
happening<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.200> multi-tool<00:01:58.649> in

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
happening to the multi-tool in

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.950 
happening to the multi-tool in
particular<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.850> Scout<00:02:00.149> rifles<00:02:00.360> are<00:02:00.689> having

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
particular but Scout rifles are having

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.780 
particular but Scout rifles are having
some<00:02:01.110> changes<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.740> general<00:02:02.280> which<00:02:02.610> will

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
some changes in general which will

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.550 
some changes in general which will
affect<00:02:03.090> PvP<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.899> they're<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> increase

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
affect PvP so they're going to increase

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.709 
affect PvP so they're going to increase
the<00:02:04.770> base<00:02:04.979> damage<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.850> medium<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.329> high<00:02:06.479> rate

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the base damage for medium to high rate

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.089 
the base damage for medium to high rate
of<00:02:06.750> fire<00:02:06.869> Scout<00:02:07.320> rifles<00:02:07.500> which<00:02:07.829> should

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
of fire Scout rifles which should

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.529 
of fire Scout rifles which should
include<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.550> mortal<00:02:08.940> because<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> pretty<00:02:09.420> high

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
include the mortal because a pretty high

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.750 
include the mortal because a pretty high
rate<00:02:09.569> Fire<00:02:10.020> Scout<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:11.340> won't<00:02:11.520> actually

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
rate Fire Scout this won't actually

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.610 
rate Fire Scout this won't actually
affect<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> time<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.660> kill<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
affect the time to kill in the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140 
affect the time to kill in the
crucible<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.310> you're<00:02:14.700> going<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.879> need<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
crucible so you're going to need the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.030 
crucible so you're going to need the
same<00:02:15.330> amount<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.690> shots<00:02:15.930> body<00:02:16.230> shots<00:02:16.530> crits<00:02:16.890> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
same amount of shots body shots crits to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280 
same amount of shots body shots crits to
actually<00:02:17.400> get<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.879> kill<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:18.659> it<00:02:18.810> will<00:02:19.019> have<00:02:19.260> a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
actually get a kill but it will have a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.259 
actually get a kill but it will have a
higher<00:02:19.680> create<00:02:20.040> higher<00:02:20.310> damage<00:02:20.670> which<00:02:21.030> means

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
higher create higher damage which means

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.509 
higher create higher damage which means
it<00:02:21.659> will<00:02:21.810> contribute<00:02:22.170> more<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.560> kills<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.190> will

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
it will contribute more to kills it will

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.220 
it will contribute more to kills it will
also<00:02:23.640> steal<00:02:24.060> kills<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.629> little<00:02:25.019> bit<00:02:25.110> easier

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
also steal kills a little bit easier

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.920 
also steal kills a little bit easier
which<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.620> always<00:02:25.769> fun<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.370> course<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.720> yeah

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
which is always fun of course so yeah

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.390 
which is always fun of course so yeah
that's<00:02:28.140> kind<00:02:28.409> of<00:02:28.500> one<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.980> changes<00:02:29.190> i

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
that's kind of one of the changes i

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.649 
that's kind of one of the changes i
think<00:02:29.790> it's<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:29.970> change<00:02:30.269> that's<00:02:30.390> going<00:02:30.510> to

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
think it's the change that's going to

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.210 
think it's the change that's going to
affect<00:02:30.930> them<00:02:31.049> all<00:02:31.170> at<00:02:31.290> all<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.890> most

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
affect them all at all the most

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.850 
affect them all at all the most
increased<00:02:32.730> magazine<00:02:33.269> size<00:02:33.540> for<00:02:34.440> all<00:02:34.560> base

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
increased magazine size for all base

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.039 
increased magazine size for all base
inventory<00:02:35.610> stats<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.480> probably<00:02:36.840> won't

inventory stats that probably won't

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.960 
inventory stats that probably won't
affect<00:02:37.349> them<00:02:37.440> all<00:02:37.530> at<00:02:37.620> all<00:02:37.799> reduce<00:02:38.640> final

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
affect them all at all reduce final

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.460 
affect them all at all reduce final
accuracy<00:02:39.390> when<00:02:39.569> firing<00:02:39.840> from<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.110> hip<00:02:40.200> so

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
accuracy when firing from the hip so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.780 
accuracy when firing from the hip so
they're<00:02:40.590> going<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.769> be<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:40.860> little<00:02:41.069> bit<00:02:41.340> less

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
they're going to be a little bit less

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.149 
they're going to be a little bit less
accurate<00:02:42.299> when<00:02:42.540> kind<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.959> hip<00:02:43.470> firing<00:02:43.799> in

accurate when kind of hip firing in
close<00:02:44.370> range<00:02:44.400> witness<00:02:45.060> isn't<00:02:45.299> necessarily

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
close range witness isn't necessarily

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.449 
close range witness isn't necessarily
especially<00:02:46.319> in<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.440> mall<00:02:46.590> at<00:02:46.709> all<00:02:46.890> isn't<00:02:47.400> a

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
especially in the mall at all isn't a

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.039 
especially in the mall at all isn't a
legitimate<00:02:48.000> way<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.180> play<00:02:48.569> with<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.870> gun

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
legitimate way to play with that gun

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.839 
legitimate way to play with that gun
anyway<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:49.920> going<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.069> boost<00:02:50.250> damage<00:02:50.670> by

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
anyway and it's going to boost damage by

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.940 
anyway and it's going to boost damage by
five<00:02:51.180> percent<00:02:51.510> against<00:02:51.870> AI<00:02:52.019> sets<00:02:52.470> your<00:02:52.590> PvE

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
five percent against AI sets your PvE

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.610 
five percent against AI sets your PvE
stuff<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.489> that's<00:02:53.609> all<00:02:53.910> good<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.359> well<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.260> in

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
stuff so that's all good as well so in

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.500 
stuff so that's all good as well so in
terms<00:02:55.829> of<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.040> mortal<00:02:56.459> nothing<00:02:56.940> negative<00:02:57.120> is

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
terms of the mortal nothing negative is

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.630 
terms of the mortal nothing negative is
happening<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.140> only<00:02:58.590> good<00:02:58.920> things<00:02:59.250> should

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
happening to it only good things should

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.490 
happening to it only good things should
be<00:02:59.670> happening<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.659> more<00:03:00.840> tits<00:03:00.989> also<00:03:01.319> that

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
be happening to the more tits also that

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.020 
be happening to the more tits also that
is<00:03:01.620> pretty<00:03:01.769> good<00:03:01.980> when<00:03:02.159> you<00:03:02.220> consider<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.790> lot

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
is pretty good when you consider a lot

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.000 
is pretty good when you consider a lot
of<00:03:03.120> other<00:03:03.269> things<00:03:03.510> are<00:03:03.659> being<00:03:03.900> changed<00:03:04.140> so

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
of other things are being changed so

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.710 
of other things are being changed so
effectively<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.609> gun<00:03:05.879> is<00:03:05.909> getting<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.450> little

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
effectively this gun is getting a little

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.110 
effectively this gun is getting a little
bit<00:03:07.079> a<00:03:07.290> little<00:03:07.379> bit<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.099> buff<00:03:08.459> but<00:03:08.909> what<00:03:09.060> you

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
bit a little bit of a buff but what you

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.180 
bit a little bit of a buff but what you
have<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.359> consider<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:10.049> more<00:03:10.379> that<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.859> other

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
have to consider is more that the other

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.039 
have to consider is more that the other
weapons<00:03:11.609> around<00:03:11.909> it<00:03:12.239> are<00:03:12.390> kind<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.900> being

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
weapons around it are kind of being

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.319 
weapons around it are kind of being
brought<00:03:13.379> back<00:03:13.590> into<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.099> balanced<00:03:14.579> spot<00:03:15.060> and

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
brought back into a balanced spot and

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.210 
brought back into a balanced spot and
perhaps<00:03:15.659> the<00:03:15.959> time<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.349> kill<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.040> crucible

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
perhaps the time to kill in the crucible

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.680 
perhaps the time to kill in the crucible
of<00:03:17.489> general<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:18.030> going<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.299> change<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.599> little

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
of general is going to change a little

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.940 
of general is going to change a little
bit<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:18.989> that's<00:03:19.139> why<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.319> think<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.680> more<00:03:19.799> it's

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
bit and that's why I think the more it's

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.920 
bit and that's why I think the more it's
all<00:03:20.069> will<00:03:20.190> become<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.639> more<00:03:21.180> legitimate<00:03:21.569> and

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
all will become a more legitimate and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.259 
all will become a more legitimate and
usable<00:03:22.380> weapon<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:22.919> the<00:03:23.280> taken<00:03:23.549> King<00:03:23.730> PvP

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
usable weapon in the taken King PvP

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.430 
usable weapon in the taken King PvP
which<00:03:24.389> is<00:03:24.510> great<00:03:24.750> because<00:03:24.900> i<00:03:25.079> think<00:03:25.139> it's<00:03:25.380> an

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
which is great because i think it's an

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.559 
which is great because i think it's an
absolutely<00:03:25.889> insane<00:03:26.370> weapon<00:03:26.819> it<00:03:27.000> already

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
absolutely insane weapon it already

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.229 
absolutely insane weapon it already
performs<00:03:28.139> pretty<00:03:28.680> damn<00:03:28.980> well<00:03:29.250> if<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:29.940> get<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
performs pretty damn well if you get the

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.640 
performs pretty damn well if you get the
kind<00:03:30.389> if<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.629> get<00:03:30.780> your<00:03:30.900> shots<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.500> you're

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
kind if you get your shots and you're

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.259 
kind if you get your shots and you're
pacing<00:03:31.889> right<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.549> you're<00:03:32.790> on<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:32.970> right

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
pacing right and you're on the right

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.270 
pacing right and you're on the right
kind<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.599> size<00:03:33.780> map<00:03:34.200> once<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.769> use<00:03:34.919> that<00:03:34.950> gun

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
kind of size map once you use that gun

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.970 
kind of size map once you use that gun
it<00:03:35.459> already<00:03:35.790> performs<00:03:36.299> very<00:03:36.569> well<00:03:36.660> in<00:03:37.019> pvp<00:03:37.799> and

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
it already performs very well in pvp and

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.920 
it already performs very well in pvp and
with<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.519> basically<00:03:38.940> effectively<00:03:39.720> being

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
with it basically effectively being

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.479 
with it basically effectively being
buffed<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.560> other<00:03:40.739> things<00:03:41.010> around<00:03:41.280> it

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
buffed and other things around it

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.309 
buffed and other things around it
becoming<00:03:41.760> slightly<00:03:42.000> less<00:03:42.329> powerful<00:03:42.599> I<00:03:42.930> think

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
becoming slightly less powerful I think

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.509 
becoming slightly less powerful I think
the<00:03:43.379> more<00:03:43.500> we<00:03:43.590> talk<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.980> going<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.340> be<00:03:44.430> an

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
the more we talk is going to be an

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.789 
the more we talk is going to be an
insanely<00:03:44.910> good<00:03:45.239> pvp<00:03:45.870> weapon<00:03:46.349> in<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> taken

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
insanely good pvp weapon in the taken

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.170 
insanely good pvp weapon in the taken
king<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.129> that's<00:03:47.280> kind<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.549> my<00:03:47.669> thoughts<00:03:47.940> on

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
king so that's kind of my thoughts on

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.360 
king so that's kind of my thoughts on
that<00:03:48.239> that's<00:03:48.810> kind<00:03:49.079> of<00:03:49.109> my<00:03:49.260> preview<00:03:49.769> or<00:03:49.949> at

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
that that's kind of my preview or at

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.640 
that that's kind of my preview or at
least<00:03:50.579> based<00:03:50.879> on<00:03:51.150> what<00:03:51.329> we<00:03:51.419> can<00:03:51.569> see<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:51.900> far<00:03:51.930> my

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
least based on what we can see so far my

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.020 
least based on what we can see so far my
reasons<00:03:53.069> for<00:03:53.160> thinking<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.790> more<00:03:53.910> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
reasons for thinking that the more it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.970 
reasons for thinking that the more it
all<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.389> going<00:03:54.599> to<00:03:54.629> perform<00:03:54.959> very<00:03:55.410> very<00:03:55.739> well

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
all is going to perform very very well

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.069 
all is going to perform very very well
inside<00:03:56.639> of<00:03:56.669> the<00:03:56.879> taken<00:03:57.209> king<00:03:57.389> but<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.870> course

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
inside of the taken king but of course

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.569 
inside of the taken king but of course
we<00:03:58.230> are<00:03:58.349> gonna<00:03:58.470> get<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.680> whole<00:03:58.919> bunch<00:03:58.949> of<00:03:59.370> new

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
we are gonna get a whole bunch of new

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.520 
we are gonna get a whole bunch of new
weapons<00:03:59.849> and<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.720> kind<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.139> big<00:04:01.319> part

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
weapons and that is kind of a big part

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.259 
weapons and that is kind of a big part
of<00:04:01.650> what<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.160> taken<00:04:02.459> king<00:04:02.609> is<00:04:02.699> about<00:04:02.970> so

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
of what the taken king is about so

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.670 
of what the taken king is about so
whether<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.840> want<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.139> use<00:04:04.319> these<00:04:04.500> weapons

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
whether you want to use these weapons

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.009 
whether you want to use these weapons
anymore<00:04:05.099> is<00:04:05.400> kind<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.209> different<00:04:06.660> thing<00:04:06.989> but

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
anymore is kind of a different thing but

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.349 
anymore is kind of a different thing but
it's<00:04:07.349> nice<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.829> see<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.250> weapons<00:04:09.030> which<00:04:09.209> you

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
keeping anything to take

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.429 
keeping anything to take
into<00:04:26.909> pvp<00:04:27.210> in<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.479> tanking<00:04:27.930> I've<00:04:28.229> got<00:04:28.409> a

into pvp in the tanking I've got a

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:29.600 
into pvp in the tanking I've got a
couple<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.830> multi<00:04:29.039> tools<00:04:29.219> I'm<00:04:29.400> definitely

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
couple of multi tools I'm definitely

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.730 
couple of multi tools I'm definitely
holding<00:04:30.030> onto<00:04:30.210> for<00:04:30.569> now<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.080> if<00:04:31.379> you've<00:04:31.530> got

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
holding onto for now and if you've got

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.409 
holding onto for now and if you've got
any<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:32.219> you<00:04:32.310> haven't<00:04:32.580> tried<00:04:32.789> it<00:04:32.819> definitely

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
any and you haven't tried it definitely

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.029 
any and you haven't tried it definitely
give<00:04:33.569> it<00:04:33.689> a<00:04:33.780> shot<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.289> I<00:04:34.650> think<00:04:34.710> you'll

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
give it a shot and I think you'll

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.529 
give it a shot and I think you'll
probably<00:04:35.250> see<00:04:35.520> how<00:04:35.759> it<00:04:35.909> could<00:04:36.090> only<00:04:36.270> get

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
probably see how it could only get

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.119 
probably see how it could only get
better<00:04:36.930> in<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.259> taken<00:04:37.560> king<00:04:37.710> so<00:04:37.830> there<00:04:37.979> you<00:04:38.039> go

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
better in the taken king so there you go

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.589 
better in the taken king so there you go
