00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.610
 Hello dear participants 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.929
 road traffic 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:16.580
 soon we will start the review and test 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.580
 radar detector street storm 9540 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.460
 please do not forget to fasten 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.670
 safety belt 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.070
 writes 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.360
 which ranges will include are included such 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.300
 off 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:40.210
 set the mode that the city decided 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.440
 City mode 2 in my works only 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.440
 on the arrow 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.240
 better and lived decided brightness 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.800
 So 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.970
 I also want to note that 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.190
 radar detector street storm 9540 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.700
 can 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.750
 edit 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.750
 basically everything 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.790
 radar detectors existing on 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.600
 Today in the Russian Federation 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.600
 what new like a robot 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.550
 so 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.800
 demand 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.909
 through 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.909
 350 meters to wear an arrow dummy 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.390
 I now understand editing 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.810
 happens by 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.810
 gps 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.040
 but 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.629
 Attention 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.629
 I love the speed saw 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.990
 but 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.980
 but 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.240
 but 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.660
 but 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.290
 by working with 3 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.630
 but 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.120
 but 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.980
 timati 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.220
 but 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.120
 but 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.520
 that is, it turns out the following if the base 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.260
 DPS any of the radar complexes 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.860
 marked initially triggered jeepies 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.850
 sensor and we see the display through how much 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.260
 meters will be 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:48.460
 radar complex if. don't stand on 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.950
 the card then the radar part is triggered and 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.260
 how 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.680
 past the arrow will not pass, respectively 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:00.040
 speed will not exceed and stay in 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.740
 good mood i think 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.880
 he Moscow there is no place where not 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.940
 are marked 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.300
 radar complexes arrow-st and even 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.300
 must 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.870
 we'll see 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.040
 karadar was with you my name is sergey 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.040
 good luck
