00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
to point out that it does not make the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.209 
to point out that it does not make the
end<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> did<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> exact<00:00:46.559> same<00:00:46.590> three<00:00:47.039> by

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
end like I did the exact same three by

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.729 
end like I did the exact same three by
three<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.480> put<00:00:49.260> eyes<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
three you know right here put eyes of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
three you know right here put eyes of
ender<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.190> them<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.460> no<00:00:51.120> portal<00:00:51.600> whatsoever

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
ender in them and no portal whatsoever

so it's pretty much just for decoration
purposes<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.809> stack<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.890> these

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
purposes you just stack them have these

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.790 
purposes you just stack them have these
little<00:00:56.219> gaps<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:56.969> yeah<00:00:57.329> that's<00:00:58.260> pretty

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
little gaps in there yeah that's pretty

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.979 
little gaps in there yeah that's pretty
much<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.520> it's<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.870> decoration

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
much it it's it's just for decoration

much it it's it's just for decoration
purposes<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.399> really<00:01:02.609> meant<00:01:02.760> for

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
extended to 40 blocks and length so if I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.720 
extended to 40 blocks and length so if I
walked<00:01:59.840> over<00:01:59.990> here<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.530> tell<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.010> works<00:02:01.400> and

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
this right here is 40 blocks now if I

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.780 
this right here is 40 blocks now if I
break<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.270> make<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:08.960> a<00:02:09.170> 41<00:02:09.770> block<00:02:10.040> you'll

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
break this and make it a 41 block you'll

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.730 
break this and make it a 41 block you'll
see<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.330> will<00:02:11.540> not<00:02:11.810> connect<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.410> even<00:02:12.650> if

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
before snapshot number Effra which one

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.160 
before snapshot number Effra which one
it<00:02:52.220> was<00:02:52.250> but<00:02:52.910> basically<00:02:53.060> ever<00:02:53.570> since<00:02:53.870> they

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
make clients and server liable to each

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.900 
make clients and server liable to each
other<00:02:57.440> or<00:02:57.500> like<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.130> had<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.310> use<00:02:58.519> a<00:02:58.550> server

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
other or like you had to use a server

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.479 
other or like you had to use a server
client<00:02:59.870> play<00:03:00.260> single<00:03:00.980> player<00:03:01.010> which<00:03:01.340> was

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
client play single player which was

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.390 
client play single player which was
stupid<00:03:01.870> they<00:03:02.870> change<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.350> boat<00:03:03.560> accidentally

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
stupid they change the boat accidentally

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.420

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
i'm not sure if it accelerates faster

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.060 
i'm not sure if it accelerates faster
than<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.160> used<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.489> but<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.860> accelerates<00:03:12.860> back

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
than it used to but I accelerates back

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.930 
than it used to but I accelerates back
to<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.340> way<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.610> was<00:03:13.640> at<00:03:14.180> least<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:15.940> reckon

flashy seizure procedure that was just
meant<00:06:27.460> for<00:06:27.610> debugging<00:06:28.030> and<00:06:28.390> to<00:06:28.840> be<00:06:28.930> honest<00:06:29.200> it

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
meant for debugging and to be honest it

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.760 
meant for debugging and to be honest it
was<00:06:29.470> kind<00:06:30.070> of<00:06:30.190> pointless<00:06:30.370> just<00:06:31.330> to<00:06:31.420> refresh

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770
