00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.609
 anda ya consabido rodrÃ­guez 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.470
 today a journalist visits us 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.389
 presenter and reporter that was made 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.280
 popular for his daring in the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.809
 21 days program now takes over 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.730
 connection samanta that is issued the games 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.070
 in four at twelve thirty the night or 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.190
 be that today we can see a strong 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.620
 applause for samantha villar 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.910
 has arrived has arrived with the face of 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.910
 asleep but pricked 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.989
 because my programs always always 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.520
 you can take advantage and the question a 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.660
 little bit forced because he does not ask 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.910
 many people through facebook is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.950
 because you left 21 days with the success that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.620
 they had exhaustion from exhaustion 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.900
 it's really physical and less psychological 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.430
 but but if a bowel was exhausted a 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.059
 quieter program and I came to this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.620
 which is worse because what differences there are 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.970
 between one and another 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.409
 I still have not seen samanta connection what 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.790
 fundamental is that in 21 days you live it 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.040
 in the first person and in samanta connection 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.629
 you are the companion of the one who lives in 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.070
 first person but in mind one day he 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.600
 shot in twenty-one days and that is rolled 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.310
 in five and you have to make an hour of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.200
 program equally the whole house all 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.390
 more compressed and we go more with the tongue 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.610
 today is 21 days there are many people who 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.870
 is curious to know what is the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.870
 every moment you remember 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.280
 I hope the rich among the rich 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.100
 it's the fifth season of connection 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.090
 I do not know if you're looking not 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.010
 we will say in search of a change 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.900
 professional but what format would you like 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.330
 present that I would have to vary 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.740
 right now at some point then all 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.119

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.159

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.560
 different bored my routine and 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.130
 repeat the things we already know how to do 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.960
 so 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.780
 at the moment of today the bell and 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.670

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.340

 schools 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.430

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.920
 they faced really explained the guys

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.660
 you are specialists in getting us from 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.270
 nerves with how good with you in 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.700
 general but particularly with certain 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.130
 phrases that you use those are phrases that give 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.840
 rabies phrases of boys and after 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.430
 guys pronounce jce towards us 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.990
 towards our couples because 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.580
 it's really that moment where you say 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.800
 look, I bite my tongue because if I do not 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.290
 we secretary as for example the 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.050
 famous phrase of I do not understand why you 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.880
 you have been angry to see 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.560
 first understandable first of the 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.290
 expert phrase 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.660
 but I do not understand why you're angry 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.090
 first of all I know perfectly well what 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.470
 you know but mainly what you do not 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.030
 I want to assume the 'mea culpa' and 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.120
 you have the right not to do it you can have 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.160
 another opinion but if you do not know why I 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.170
 angry do not understand it because no 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.980
 You will have heard me why and claritas 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.650
 when we get angry we are, look at these 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.900
 is that you are misapplying the subject a 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.519
 thing is I do not know why you're angry and 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.739
 the other one I do not understand why you're 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.300
 angry I can know why are you 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.370
 angry he has been angry because I have 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.890
 stayed with that friend of mine of all the 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.690
 life for example and the other is and not 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.319
 I understand why she has been a friend 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.319
 all lives 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.640
 because right now 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.170
 we are not going to discuss this to this but the 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.540
 problem is that if I tell you the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:11.989
 reason you have to understand it you can not 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:14.599
 share it but do not share them but if 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.940
 She explains the reasons if you have a 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.260
 face to face what is worth so yes 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.419
 I understand why you're angry goodbye 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.070
 Okay, so it's good, do not tell me they 're 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.550
 the system of giving the reason as lalo 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.550
 sweetie 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.090
 talking about what it puts me in the 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.370
 nerves is that suddenly your partner or you 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.620

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.760
 calling hysterical 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.280
 If you have a problem that costs you 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.650
 speak clearly and say it clearly exists 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.690
 you do not want to see the problem that you have 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.270
 no no no no no matter how much you tell it 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.610
 what are you going to understand I do not understand why 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.260
 you get angry sometimes we reach a point in 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:02.470
 that your partner your girl wants you to do 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.200
 what she is waiting for you to do 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.590
 but without telling him because he has 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:14.020
 to leave you 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:15.040
 he does not have a vacation here he is already 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.729
 because you also have to love 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.729
 point 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.509
 you do not know what you spend the money on 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.520
