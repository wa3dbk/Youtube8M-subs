that's not exactly the control scheme I
would<00:00:46.530> use<00:00:46.710> let's<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:49.309> all<00:00:50.309> right

games of all time I just playing it with
a<00:01:43.700> controller<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.420> almost<00:01:44.780> physically

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
a controller is almost physically

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:52.039 
a controller is almost physically
painful<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:46.039> me

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.039

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
come on a little closer hell

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.179

I'm seeing through the walls no wonder
graphical<00:02:05.520> glitching<00:02:05.939> probably<00:02:06.630> due<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
graphical glitching probably due to the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.009 
graphical glitching probably due to the
emulation<00:02:07.409> not<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.859> big<00:02:08.099> deal<00:02:08.750> alright<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.869> saw

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
emulation not a big deal alright I saw

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:16.100 
emulation not a big deal alright I saw
some<00:02:10.229> ammo<00:02:10.560> over<00:02:10.590> there<00:02:11.420> yeah<00:02:12.450> oh<00:02:13.879> I<00:02:15.110> was

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
trying to shoot the damn these guys are

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.820 
trying to shoot the damn these guys are
flickering<00:02:18.750> all<00:02:19.110> over<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.440> place<00:02:19.650> that's

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
flickering all over the place that's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.190 
flickering all over the place that's
trying<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.099> shoot<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.280> barrel<00:02:20.819> but<00:02:21.170> well<00:02:22.170> I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
trying to shoot the barrel but well I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.289

got it bad dog
okay<00:02:26.840> let's<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:28.640> how<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.700> hell<00:02:29.940> do<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.180> strafe

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
okay let's see how the hell do I strafe

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.309 
okay let's see how the hell do I strafe
in<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.110> Oh<00:02:31.760> see<00:02:32.760> right<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.120> see<00:02:33.269> left<00:02:33.510> okay<00:02:34.079> I

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
in this Oh see right and see left okay I

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.390 
in this Oh see right and see left okay I
guess<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.220> almost<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:37.220> tolerable<00:02:38.220> with

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
guess it's almost like a tolerable with

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.210 
guess it's almost like a tolerable with
it<00:02:40.940> damn<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.269> can<00:02:42.480> barely<00:02:42.780> see<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.049> RA<00:02:43.319> all

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
it damn I can barely see the RA all

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.620 
it damn I can barely see the RA all
right<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.640> emulation<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.390> maybe<00:02:45.540> I

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
right so the emulation and maybe I

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.589 
right so the emulation and maybe I
should<00:02:45.810> use<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.140> other<00:02:46.290> emulator<00:02:46.890> but

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
should use the other emulator but

00:02:47.599 --> 00:03:00.100 
should use the other emulator but
hopefully<00:02:48.599> you<00:02:49.380> don't<00:02:49.560> give<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> shit

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110

good<00:04:10.050> on<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.380> Nintendo<00:04:10.650> 64<00:04:10.680> trust<00:04:11.400> me<00:04:11.550> it

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
good on the Nintendo 64 trust me it

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.920 
good on the Nintendo 64 trust me it
looks<00:04:11.790> nothing<00:04:12.120> like<00:04:12.300> this<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.780> actual

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
looks nothing like this on the actual

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.750 
looks nothing like this on the actual
n64<00:04:15.500> using<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.560> project<00:04:16.920> 64<00:04:17.310> emulator<00:04:17.489> I

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
n64 using the project 64 emulator I

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.190 
n64 using the project 64 emulator I
probably<00:04:17.970> should<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.239> picked<00:04:18.570> movement<00:04:19.049> for

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
probably should have picked movement for

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.730 
probably should have picked movement for
this<00:04:19.290> because<00:04:19.530> it's<00:04:19.859> not<00:04:21.290> really<00:04:22.290> working<00:04:22.500> out

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
this because it's not really working out

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.730 
this because it's not really working out
too<00:04:23.010> well

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
too well

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:38.170 
too well
now<00:04:25.740> hell<00:04:27.020> let's<00:04:28.020> try<00:04:28.200> that<00:04:28.320> again

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.110 

other<00:04:39.110> than<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.560> really<00:04:39.590> obvious<00:04:40.400> fact<00:04:40.759> it

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
other than that really obvious fact it

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.640 
other than that really obvious fact it
is<00:04:41.360> a<00:04:42.009> fairly<00:04:43.009> impressive<00:04:43.550> game<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.330> they

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
is a fairly impressive game that they

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.960 
is a fairly impressive game that they
managed<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.740> pull<00:04:45.830> this<00:04:46.130> off<00:04:46.340> on<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.550> Nintendo

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
managed to pull this off on a Nintendo

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.210 
managed to pull this off on a Nintendo
64<00:04:47.199> and<00:04:48.199> then<00:04:48.440> they<00:04:48.530> actually<00:04:48.919> managed<00:04:49.190> to

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
64 and then they actually managed to

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.040 
64 and then they actually managed to
pull<00:04:49.340> off<00:04:50.770> um<00:04:51.770> quick<00:04:52.580> -<00:04:52.850> on<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.630> Nintendo<00:04:54.020> 64

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
pull off um quick - on the Nintendo 64

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.670 
pull off um quick - on the Nintendo 64
which<00:04:55.720> actually<00:04:56.720> shot<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.110> shit<00:04:57.259> enemy<00:04:57.560> it

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
which actually shot the shit enemy it

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.010 
which actually shot the shit enemy it
was<00:04:57.770> also<00:04:58.070> good<00:04:58.449> although<00:04:59.449> like<00:04:59.660> I<00:04:59.750> said<00:04:59.930> I'd

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
was also good although like I said I'd

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.230 
was also good although like I said I'd
much<00:05:00.199> rather<00:05:00.229> play<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.740> on<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.160> PC<00:05:01.820> with<00:05:02.210> a

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
much rather play it on the PC with a

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:10.570 
much rather play it on the PC with a
mouse

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:19.640

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.250 

that's<00:05:49.880> better<00:05:50.740> getting<00:05:51.740> used<00:05:51.950> to<00:05:52.010> this<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.250> bit

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
that's better getting used to this a bit

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.660 
that's better getting used to this a bit
this<00:05:54.260> is<00:05:54.320> a<00:05:54.470> better<00:05:54.710> controller<00:05:55.220> than<00:05:55.520> the

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
this is a better controller than the

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.960 
this is a better controller than the
Nintendo<00:05:56.150> 64<00:05:56.780> and<00:05:57.040> plus<00:05:58.040> having<00:05:58.280> strafe<00:05:58.760> on

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
Nintendo 64 and plus having strafe on

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.730 
Nintendo 64 and plus having strafe on
the<00:05:59.090> C<00:05:59.270> buttons<00:05:59.630> is<00:05:59.900> almost<00:06:00.200> like<00:06:00.320> having<00:06:00.530> dual

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
the C buttons is almost like having dual

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.460 
the C buttons is almost like having dual
analog<00:06:01.280> because<00:06:01.760> I<00:06:01.790> have<00:06:01.940> the<00:06:02.060> C<00:06:02.210> buttons<00:06:02.540> set

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
analog because I have the C buttons set

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.780 
analog because I have the C buttons set
to<00:06:03.650> an<00:06:03.770> analog<00:06:04.130> stick<00:06:04.990> so<00:06:05.990> that<00:06:06.020> actually

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
to an analog stick so that actually

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.060 
to an analog stick so that actually
improves<00:06:07.790> it<00:06:07.940> slightly<00:06:08.710> it's<00:06:09.710> like<00:06:09.800> playing

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
improves it slightly it's like playing

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.960 
improves it slightly it's like playing
Halo<00:06:10.520> only<00:06:10.850> without<00:06:11.090> all<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:11.450> you<00:06:11.990> know
