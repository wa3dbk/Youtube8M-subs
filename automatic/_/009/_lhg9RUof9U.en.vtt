method<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.160> P<00:00:08.370> linking<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:08.970> be<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.480> from

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
method of P linking you be going from

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.220 
method of P linking you be going from
strong<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.500> jab<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:12.269> what<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.630> does<00:00:12.929> is

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
strong to jab and this what this does is

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.049 
strong to jab and this what this does is
basically<00:00:13.469> gives<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.980> double<00:00:14.190> diem<00:00:14.610> puts<00:00:14.849> on

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
basically gives you double diem puts on

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.429 
basically gives you double diem puts on
your<00:00:15.240> strong<00:00:15.509> attack<00:00:17.720> input<00:00:21.080> what<00:00:22.080> everyone

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
your strong attack input what everyone

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.220 
your strong attack input what everyone
knows<00:00:22.619> about<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:22.949> was<00:00:23.689> one<00:00:24.689> thing<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.019> doesn't

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
knows about it was one thing it doesn't

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
like do is peel ink special attacks

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080 
like do is peel ink special attacks
because<00:00:28.140> obviously<00:00:28.349> if<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.490> commotion

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
because obviously if you do do commotion

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.569 
because obviously if you do do commotion
and<00:00:30.359> P<00:00:30.630> link<00:00:30.869> medium<00:00:31.349> punch<00:00:31.619> you're<00:00:32.340> gonna<00:00:32.460> be

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and P link medium punch you're gonna be

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.000 
and P link medium punch you're gonna be
getting<00:00:32.669> any<00:00:32.969> X<00:00:33.149> which<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:34.739> really

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
getting any X which you know not really

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.209 
getting any X which you know not really
useful<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> bit<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.829> PN

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
useful so what you can do is a bit of PN

King<00:00:38.520> look<00:00:38.730> from<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> strong<00:00:39.600> its<00:00:39.870> job<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
King look from a strong its job you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.670 
King look from a strong its job you
could<00:00:41.040> go<00:00:41.219> strong<00:00:41.730> back<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.239> shore<00:00:42.680> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
could go strong back to shore and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.770 
could go strong back to shore and
dysfunctions<00:00:44.340> exactly<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> same<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.270> new<00:00:45.450> EP

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
dysfunctions exactly the same as new EP

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.750 
dysfunctions exactly the same as new EP
linking<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.559> gives<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> double<00:00:47.340> input

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
linking it gives you the double input

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.690 
linking it gives you the double input
but<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.020> does<00:00:49.230> allow<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> pee

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
but what it does allow is for you to pee

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.180 
but what it does allow is for you to pee
link<00:00:50.969> special<00:00:51.449> attacks<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:51.930> well<00:00:52.039> this<00:00:53.039> is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
link special attacks as well this is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.770 
link special attacks as well this is
actually<00:00:53.399> pretty<00:00:53.940> useful<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.629> some

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
actually pretty useful for some

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.830 
actually pretty useful for some
characters<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.820> know<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> just

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
characters you know I like to do it just

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.439 
characters you know I like to do it just
generally<00:00:58.260> anyway<00:00:58.710> because<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.520> like<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.059> have

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
generally anyway because I like to have

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.180 
generally anyway because I like to have
make<00:01:00.690> sure<00:01:00.899> all<00:01:01.170> my<00:01:01.320> inputs<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.800> coming<00:01:02.039> out

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
make sure all my inputs are coming out

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.369 
make sure all my inputs are coming out
every<00:01:02.609> time<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.420> I'll<00:01:03.690> double<00:01:04.229> tap

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
every time like I'll double tap

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
every time like I'll double tap
everything<00:01:04.949> I'll<00:01:05.159> p<00:01:05.339> link<00:01:05.549> everything<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.030> can

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
everything I'll p link everything I can

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.990 
everything I'll p link everything I can
just<00:01:06.869> all<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> time<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.860> as<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.850> good

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
just all the time just as it's a good

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820 
just all the time just as it's a good
habit<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.530> makes<00:01:10.680> your

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
habit to be in because it makes your

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.270 
habit to be in because it makes your
execution<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:12.000> bit<00:01:12.119> better<00:01:13.280> one

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
execution just a little bit better one

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.070 
execution just a little bit better one
of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.430> cool<00:01:14.640> things<00:01:14.700> about<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.930> you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
of the cool things about this is you

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
of the cool things about this is you
actually<00:01:16.259> also<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.950> play<00:01:17.159> link<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.670> light

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
actually also get to play link the light

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
actually also get to play link the light
special<00:01:18.479> moves<00:01:18.659> don't<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.170> sappy<00:01:19.320> link<00:01:19.680> light

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
special moves don't get sappy link light

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.550 
special moves don't get sappy link light
nor<00:01:20.310> through<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.119> you'd<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.780> use<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
nor through this you'd have to use the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.050 
nor through this you'd have to use the
method<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.920> showed<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.340> before<00:01:23.460> which

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
method I showed you before which

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.679 
method I showed you before which
involves<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.080> P<00:01:25.350> linking<00:01:25.770> job<00:01:26.100> too<00:01:26.369> short<00:01:26.689> but

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
involves a P linking job too short but

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.390 
involves a P linking job too short but
you<00:01:27.810> will<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:27.990> able<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> pee<00:01:28.500> link<00:01:28.740> say<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> short

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you will be able to pee link say a short

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.390 
you will be able to pee link say a short
pass<00:01:29.880> Mackey<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.600> right<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.220> this

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
pass Mackey with right and to do this

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
pass Mackey with right and to do this
you<00:01:32.670> would<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:32.909> go<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.540> shorts<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:34.439> strong

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you would just go from shorts are strong

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.480 
you would just go from shorts are strong
and<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:34.979> would<00:01:35.790> get<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.290> double<00:01:37.290> short<00:01:38.040> input

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
and you would get a double short input

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.690 
and you would get a double short input
which<00:01:39.360> I'll<00:01:39.860> prioritizes<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.890> medium<00:01:41.430> punch

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
which I'll prioritizes the medium punch

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.060 
which I'll prioritizes the medium punch
because<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.450> special<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
because it's a special one of the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.920 
because it's a special one of the
downfalls<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.700> technique<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.299> characters

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
downfalls this technique is characters

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.440 
downfalls this technique is characters
like<00:01:46.110> sasa<00:01:46.409> gap<00:01:46.770> where<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.939> same

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
like sasa gap where they have the same

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.130 
like sasa gap where they have the same
motion<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.530> two<00:01:50.369> separate<00:01:50.880> movies<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.450> both

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
motion for two separate movies on both

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.039 
motion for two separate movies on both
punch<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.740> kick<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.479> look<00:01:54.600> at<00:01:54.810> his

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
punch and kick so you can look at his
