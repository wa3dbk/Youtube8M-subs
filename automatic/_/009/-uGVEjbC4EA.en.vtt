00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
to go all the way to the root so I'm

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.550 
to go all the way to the root so I'm
noticing<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.180> one<00:02:46.510> side<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.810> my<00:02:47.049> hair<00:02:47.320> is

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
noticing that one side of my hair is

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.949 
noticing that one side of my hair is
looking<00:02:48.100> at<00:02:48.340> thicker<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:49.030> side<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.450> already

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
looking at thicker the side that already

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.440 
looking at thicker the side that already
is<00:02:50.109> thicker<00:02:50.380> this<00:02:51.370> side<00:02:51.609> I<00:02:51.640> did<00:02:51.880> really<00:02:52.060> fast

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
is thicker this side I did really fast

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.380 
is thicker this side I did really fast
and<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.590> didn't<00:02:53.920> really<00:02:54.670> take<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.030> time<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.299> go

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
and I didn't really take the time to go

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.520 
and I didn't really take the time to go
all<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.510> way<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> route<00:02:55.959> seems<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.380> little

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
all the way to the route seems a little

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.349 
all the way to the route seems a little
bit<00:02:56.709> fuzzier<00:02:57.930> at<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.140> root<00:02:59.320> but<00:03:00.160> not<00:03:01.000> tight

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
bit fuzzier at the root but not tight

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.890 
bit fuzzier at the root but not tight
and<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.400> can<00:03:03.519> see<00:03:03.579> through<00:03:04.120> my<00:03:04.269> hair<00:03:04.660> more

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.300 
and so you can see through my hair more
on<00:03:04.989> this<00:03:05.109> side<00:03:05.350> because<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.709> can<00:03:05.859> see<00:03:06.100> this

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
on this side because you can see this

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.910 
on this side because you can see this
curls<00:03:06.760> are<00:03:06.819> kind<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.090> elongated<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.769> on

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920

side a lot springier tighter curls so
next<00:03:24.069> time<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.370> got<00:03:24.639> to<00:03:24.670> make<00:03:24.819> sure<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.090> do<00:03:25.269> I'm

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
next time I got to make sure I do I'm

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.809 
next time I got to make sure I do I'm
consistent<00:03:26.950> all<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.130> way<00:03:27.220> around<00:03:27.370> but<00:03:27.760> i'm

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
consistent all the way around but i'm

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.879 
consistent all the way around but i'm
getting<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:28.690> looked<00:03:28.930> at<00:03:29.109> it<00:03:29.139> stepped

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
getting the just looked at it stepped

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.220 
getting the just looked at it stepped
out<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.340> salon<00:03:30.780> look

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
out of the salon look

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.430 
out of the salon look
with<00:03:32.379> my<00:03:32.560> coils<00:03:33.330> for<00:03:34.330> me<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.659> important<00:03:35.230> thing

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
with my coils for me the important thing

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.369 
with my coils for me the important thing
is<00:03:35.650> for<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.920> ends<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.580> be<00:03:36.760> consistent<00:03:37.569> now

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
is for the ends to be consistent now

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.800 
is for the ends to be consistent now
right<00:03:38.620> here<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:39.430> had<00:03:40.860> really<00:03:41.860> straight<00:03:42.810> heat

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
right here I had really straight heat

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.020 
right here I had really straight heat
damaged<00:03:44.319> here<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.989> i<00:03:47.019> just<00:03:47.140> lopped<00:03:47.530> these<00:03:47.769> off

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
damaged here so i just lopped these off

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.330 
damaged here so i just lopped these off
so<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.150> can<00:03:49.269> see<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:50.470> ends<00:03:50.739> aren't<00:03:50.890> curled<00:03:51.220> at

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
so you can see the ends aren't curled at

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.820 
so you can see the ends aren't curled at
all<00:03:51.489> because<00:03:52.180> it's<00:03:53.110> kind<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.349> going<00:03:53.590> into<00:03:53.739> a

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
all because it's kind of going into a

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.920 
all because it's kind of going into a
wave<00:03:54.720> but<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.750> cut<00:03:56.290> off<00:03:56.410> like<00:03:56.650> three<00:03:56.890> inches

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
wave but I cut off like three inches

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.449 
wave but I cut off like three inches
basically<00:03:58.930> so<00:03:59.110> that<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.470> could<00:03:59.650> just<00:04:00.040> go<00:04:00.250> like

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
basically so that I could just go like

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.330 
basically so that I could just go like
this<00:04:00.700> with<00:04:00.970> my<00:04:01.150> hair<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.739> then<00:04:02.739> kind<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.069> blend

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
this with my hair and then kind of blend

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.750 
this with my hair and then kind of blend
in<00:04:03.549> so<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.540> cut<00:04:05.290> them<00:04:05.440> off<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:09.280> they<00:04:09.310> wouldn't<00:04:09.579> be

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
in so I cut them off so they wouldn't be

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.210 
in so I cut them off so they wouldn't be
long<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.660> stringy<00:04:10.930> sticking<00:04:11.709> out<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:12.160> the

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
long and stringy sticking out and the

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.400 
long and stringy sticking out and the
wind<00:04:12.400> would<00:04:12.519> blow<00:04:12.640> or<00:04:12.970> anything<00:04:13.329> so<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.170> want

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
wind would blow or anything so I want

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.189 
wind would blow or anything so I want
more<00:04:14.620> control<00:04:15.040> over<00:04:15.419> my<00:04:16.419> hair<00:04:16.690> when<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.019> wind

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
more control over my hair when the wind

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.860 
more control over my hair when the wind
blows<00:04:17.440> from<00:04:18.430> any<00:04:18.699> angle<00:04:19.289> to<00:04:20.289> look<00:04:20.470> consistent

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
blows from any angle to look consistent

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:36.300 
blows from any angle to look consistent
not<00:04:22.870> sure<00:04:23.050> freaking<00:04:34.830> something<00:04:35.830> good<00:04:36.010> all<00:04:36.280> the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
not sure freaking something good all the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.000 
not sure freaking something good all the
way<00:04:36.460> around<00:04:36.720> but<00:04:37.720> you<00:04:38.169> can<00:04:38.320> see<00:04:38.530> when<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.680> pull

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
way around but you can see when I pull

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.850 
way around but you can see when I pull
these<00:04:39.190> down<00:04:39.250> on<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.930> gives<00:04:44.139> another<00:04:44.380> shape<00:04:44.680> to

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
these down on it gives another shape to

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.959 
these down on it gives another shape to
the<00:04:44.979> air

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.629

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
but for me having it shrunk up a little

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.319 
but for me having it shrunk up a little
bit<00:04:53.789> it's<00:04:54.419> fine<00:04:55.159> because<00:04:56.159> it<00:04:56.489> stays<00:04:57.059> away<00:04:57.089> from

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:57.329 
bit it's fine because it stays away from

00:04:57.329 --> 00:05:01.699 
bit it's fine because it stays away from
rubbing<00:04:58.259> on<00:04:58.379> my<00:04:58.619> collar<00:04:59.549> of<00:04:59.909> any<00:05:00.119> shirts<00:05:00.709> so
