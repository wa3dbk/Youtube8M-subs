00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
was cute but it looked kind of plain to

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.580 
was cute but it looked kind of plain to
me<00:04:10.540> so<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:12.280> can<00:04:13.450> emboss<00:04:14.450> your<00:04:14.870> stocking<00:04:15.470> with

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
me so you can emboss your stocking with

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.120 
me so you can emboss your stocking with
the<00:04:15.800> same<00:04:16.040> snowflake<00:04:16.760> image<00:04:17.180> if<00:04:17.450> i<00:04:18.290> wanted<00:04:18.320> the

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
the same snowflake image if i wanted the

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.099 
the same snowflake image if i wanted the
raised<00:04:19.370> image<00:04:19.910> my<00:04:20.120> stocking<00:04:20.600> would<00:04:20.720> be<00:04:20.870> in<00:04:20.989> the

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
raised image my stocking would be in the

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.520 
raised image my stocking would be in the
other<00:04:21.230> direction<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.690> depending<00:04:24.289> on<00:04:24.380> what

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
other direction so you depending on what

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.230 
other direction so you depending on what
direction<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:25.100> want<00:04:25.280> your<00:04:25.400> stocking<00:04:25.789> facing

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
direction you want your stocking facing

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.580 
direction you want your stocking facing
then<00:04:26.390> you'd<00:04:26.539> have<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.810> put<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.080> inside<00:04:27.200> the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
then you'd have to put it inside the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.910 
then you'd have to put it inside the
full

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
full

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.880 
full
the<00:04:28.070> correct<00:04:28.370> way<00:04:28.840> but<00:04:29.840> that<00:04:30.080> adds<00:04:30.530> another

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
the correct way but that adds another

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.160 
the correct way but that adds another
dimension<00:04:31.010> to<00:04:31.520> your<00:04:31.640> stocking<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:32.870> what<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.050> did
