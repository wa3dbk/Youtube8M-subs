00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 Ah but in general we were made to 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.769
 structure of our team to very strong 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.259
 to shake with a touch like that 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.100
 in my view it does not matter that they 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.380
 say because according to my 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.480
 plans if we catch up so much in the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.640
 second as in the big final 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.730
 the jewel of zero then there is not much 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.730
 problem 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.460
 according to our plan has passion 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.670
 to win from zero to 10 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.860
 so perfect, it's never going to be more, but we 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.079
 it's working pretty much the people 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.550
 reached a level where I'm sure 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.989
 Can you tell who has the best bat 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.489
 lenny 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:57.329
 I was sure with who I had the best 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:01:00.690
 boat lenny the best lenny motto will 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.629
 want to come back in a little while the CEOE was 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.610
 only the defendant tried to start and so the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.320
 the network attentive to them can present the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.090
 neighborhood was up urgency too 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.780
 listening one tries to escape them today attentive 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.400
 to the shuttle was up dirt for metal 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.560
 coming as the breach for any item 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.560
 with this large amount of bees 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.110
 Dragon 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.110
 this time the next 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:49.030
 already do and then come back and still try 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:53.610
 Protect your backpack and more r 60 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.960
 oh, I just got it, it does not hit anyone 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.100
 it's getting busy 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.330
 improving in this respect and Olympia is 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.800
 probably the best player in terms 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.530
 server knowledge 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.259
 he is the play that understands most of the game and 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.860
 I 'm kidding a lot with him and we're 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.860
 is getting better 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.490
 the video ended up dying a good one and also 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.620
 Brazil and I remember the team here that already 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.130
 took two children against 0 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.780
 Can you play there? That's the new map. 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.340
 of dengue this year 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.230
 the lec gets from the house in the neighborhood 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.450
 capoeiras 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.150
 I think it's kind of super normal because 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.739
 simply those who are under pressure are 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.080
 people who play against me because he 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.840
 I already fucking imagine, I'm going to lose the law. 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:45.150
 I have to do so we have to 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:48.220
 do if simply just now 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.799
 what I would say has more vision of 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.650
 Everyone's game is the lesson 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.290
 there game vision so in the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.769
 with the team will be the fan is that there is more 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.769
 Lenny's notion did I would say that lap and 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:14.320
 now it worked out although I do not like it 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.110
 Much of this blog brings touch out of the game. 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.570
 only that in fact the toilet paper will 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.830
 be used to get to Chile by crying 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:26.290
 someone right there but she has cried 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.760
 innocence is no longer this is the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.760
 Greater controversial crowd 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.050
 I do not have the rain nor does it 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.540
 powers ordered 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.540
 with that they lose 180 thigh 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.480
 the hill scored and gave a second and now 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.040
 It's the nexus they 'll be able to lead to 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.480
 emia's win over hot 17 to 7 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.480
 sectional victory 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.569
 when it arrives in this collection of a medium 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.569
 easy 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.049
 you who are falling will fall the same 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.419
 doing here focused on doing the 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:23.570
 God's law can qualify for 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.570
 the semifinal of the Brazilian championship
