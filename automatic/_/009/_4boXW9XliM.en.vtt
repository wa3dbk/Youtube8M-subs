are the things we will do is to restart
production<00:01:46.030> in<00:01:46.599> forma<00:01:47.729> from<00:01:48.729> receiving<00:01:49.629> this

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:49.989 
production in forma from receiving this

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:53.279 
production in forma from receiving this
the<00:01:50.530> final<00:01:50.709> transfer<00:01:51.280> financement<00:01:51.819> and<00:01:52.289> we

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
the final transfer financement and we

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.380 
the final transfer financement and we
after<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.679> we<00:01:53.829> will<00:01:53.950> have<00:01:54.189> another<00:01:55.000> four

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
after that we will have another four

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.249 
after that we will have another four
month<00:01:55.599> of<00:01:55.810> ramp<00:01:56.110> up<00:01:56.289> so<00:01:56.679> from<00:01:57.429> now<00:01:57.969> we<00:01:58.509> will<00:01:58.959> be

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
month of ramp up so from now we will be

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.229 
month of ramp up so from now we will be
in<00:02:00.009> eight<00:02:00.280> months<00:02:00.459> from<00:02:00.759> now<00:02:00.789> we're

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:01.239 
in eight months from now we're

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.600 
in eight months from now we're
predicting<00:02:01.539> that<00:02:02.140> we<00:02:02.379> are<00:02:02.530> will<00:02:03.069> be<00:02:03.219> at<00:02:03.340> one

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
predicting that we are will be at one

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.539 
predicting that we are will be at one
hundred<00:02:03.729> percent<00:02:03.939> capacity<00:02:05.069> producing<00:02:06.069> 300

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
hundred percent capacity producing 300

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.440 
hundred percent capacity producing 300
tons<00:02:07.179> per<00:02:07.479> day<00:02:07.509> so<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.859> will<00:02:09.069> be<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.220> mean<00:02:09.549> of<00:02:09.579> 20

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
tons per day so it will be a mean of 20

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.670 
tons per day so it will be a mean of 20
to<00:02:10.720> 25<00:02:11.230> thousand<00:02:11.709> dollars<00:02:12.099> of<00:02:12.400> gold<00:02:12.640> per<00:02:12.970> year

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
to 25 thousand dollars of gold per year

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.349 
to 25 thousand dollars of gold per year
that's<00:02:14.680> our<00:02:15.959> starting<00:02:16.959> point<00:02:18.180> with<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
that's our starting point with the

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.770 
that's our starting point with the
profit<00:02:19.780> generated<00:02:20.019> in<00:02:20.709> two<00:02:21.489> thousand<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
profit generated in two thousand in the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.580 
profit generated in two thousand in the
year<00:02:23.260> i<00:02:23.470> will<00:02:24.099> start<00:02:24.630> drilling<00:02:25.630> campaign<00:02:26.019> to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
year i will start drilling campaign to

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.069 
year i will start drilling campaign to
extend<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.130> resource<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.849> we<00:02:28.540> are<00:02:28.660> we<00:02:28.900> will

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
extend the resource and we are we will

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.610 
extend the resource and we are we will
plan<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.799> double<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.519> size<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.150> moon

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
plan to double the size of the moon

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:41.559 
plan to double the size of the moon
that's<00:02:32.620> our<00:02:32.769> target<00:02:33.099> for<00:02:34.680> 2013-2014
