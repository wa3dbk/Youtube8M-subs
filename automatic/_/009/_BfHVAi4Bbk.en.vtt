00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
downstairs because I thought it was

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.350 
downstairs because I thought it was
gonna<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.560> UAV<00:01:50.070> or<00:01:50.280> might<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.909> SATCOM

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and I ended up throwing it down and now

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.039 
and I ended up throwing it down and now
this<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> low<00:01:54.090> key<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.450> can't<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
this is the low key that I can't get to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.359 
this is the low key that I can't get to
but<00:01:55.200> whatever<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> bot<00:01:55.890> match<00:01:56.070> anyway

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
but whatever it was a bot match anyway

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.730 
but whatever it was a bot match anyway
it<00:01:56.430> doesn't<00:01:56.670> matter<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.000> some<00:01:57.240> yeah<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.290> it's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it doesn't matter but some yeah so it's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
it doesn't matter but some yeah so it's
kind<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.549> constant<00:02:00.180> kind<00:02:01.049> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
kind of like this this constant kind of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.100 
kind of like this this constant kind of
hard<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.920> balance<00:02:02.420> thought<00:02:03.420> process<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
hard to balance thought process and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.929 
hard to balance thought process and
strategy<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.829> where<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.130> want<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.579> going

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
strategy to where you want to be going

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.819 
strategy to where you want to be going
on<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.479> offensive<00:02:06.659> side<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.409> things<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.770> you

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
then you also want to be on the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.630 
then you also want to be on the
defensive<00:02:10.920> side<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.129> things<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.550> to

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
which is kind of hard to do it's like

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.080 
which is kind of hard to do it's like
we're<00:02:25.920> playing<00:02:26.010> regular<00:02:26.459> bots<00:02:26.670> here<00:02:26.849> and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
we're playing regular bots here and

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.520 
we're playing regular bots here and
they're<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> little<00:02:27.359> bit<00:02:27.510> too<00:02:27.750> easy<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.439> know

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
they're a little bit too easy you know

they're a little bit too easy you know
they're<00:02:28.920> not<00:02:29.069> really<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.519> good<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.269> then

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
they're not really that good but then

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.580 
they're not really that good but then
when<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.629> move<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:30.959> from<00:02:31.139> the<00:02:31.260> regular

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590

you guys would be interested let me know
but<00:03:00.930> yeah<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.469> was<00:03:01.530> grind<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.159> would<00:03:02.370> love<00:03:02.609> to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
but yeah this was grind I would love to

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.949 
but yeah this was grind I would love to
see<00:03:02.909> it<00:03:02.969> in<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> regular<00:03:03.329> multiplayer<00:03:03.780> I

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
see it in the regular multiplayer I

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.659 
see it in the regular multiplayer I
doubt<00:03:04.379> we'll<00:03:04.590> ever<00:03:04.650> get<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.219> though<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.579> know

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
doubt we'll ever get it though you know

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.699 
doubt we'll ever get it though you know
it<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:06.540> seems<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.200> game<00:03:07.319> developers

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
it it seems like the game developers

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.110 
it it seems like the game developers
never<00:03:07.859> really<00:03:08.129> want<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.340> add<00:03:08.459> new<00:03:08.669> things<00:03:08.939> in

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
never really want to add new things in

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.119 
never really want to add new things in
because<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.810> dilutes<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.500> players<00:03:10.829> it

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
because it dilutes the players it

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.069 
because it dilutes the players it
spreads<00:03:11.489> them<00:03:11.669> out<00:03:11.790> less<00:03:12.269> people<00:03:12.510> will<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.900> in

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
spreads them out less people will be in

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.020 
spreads them out less people will be in
each<00:03:13.319> game<00:03:13.560> mode<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:14.010> because<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.579> that<00:03:14.730> you

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
each game mode and because of that you

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.849 
each game mode and because of that you
get<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.329> know<00:03:15.359> poor<00:03:15.810> connection<00:03:16.439> quality

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
get you know poor connection quality

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:17.899 
get you know poor connection quality
because<00:03:17.040> there's<00:03:17.159> not<00:03:17.250> as<00:03:17.400> many<00:03:17.489> hosts<00:03:17.760> to

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
because there's not as many hosts to

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:18.979 
because there's not as many hosts to
choose<00:03:18.090> from<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.449> things<00:03:18.629> like<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.810> so

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
choose from and things like that so

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.839 
choose from and things like that so
that's<00:03:19.650> why<00:03:19.889> it<00:03:19.949> always<00:03:20.040> seems<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.549> every

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
that's why it always seems that every

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.430 
that's why it always seems that every
time<00:03:21.000> they<00:03:21.090> add<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> game<00:03:21.449> mode<00:03:21.569> in<00:03:21.810> they<00:03:22.260> also

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
time they add a game mode in they also

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.349 
time they add a game mode in they also
take<00:03:22.769> one<00:03:22.949> away<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.699> don't<00:03:23.970> know<00:03:24.030> love<00:03:24.269> it

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
take one away so I don't know love it

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.640 
take one away so I don't know love it
