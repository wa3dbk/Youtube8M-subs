00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
towards the top of the earlier about big

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.910 
towards the top of the earlier about big
mental<00:00:47.070> thing<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.460> Italians<00:00:48.440> our<00:00:49.440> speech<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
mental thing for Italians our speech and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.790 
mental thing for Italians our speech and
halftime<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.399> know<00:00:50.670> was<00:00:51.350> from<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> coaches

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
halftime you know was from the coaches

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.930 
halftime you know was from the coaches
and<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:52.980> kept<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.370> said<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.699> know<00:00:53.789> we

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and it kept in there we said you know we

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
and it kept in there we said you know we
can<00:00:54.090> actually<00:00:54.180> win<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:55.500> thinking

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
can actually win this and I'm thinking

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.010 
can actually win this and I'm thinking
you<00:00:55.890> know<00:00:56.180> if<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.329> actually<00:00:57.420> think<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:57.899> in

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
you know if you actually think it out in

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.299 
you know if you actually think it out in
your<00:00:58.109> head<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.410> know<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.559> should<00:00:58.770> actually

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
your head you know you should actually

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
your head you know you should actually
half<00:00:59.579> way<00:00:59.730> they're<00:00:59.879> losing<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.899> should

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
half way they're losing so you should

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.709 
half way they're losing so you should
actually<00:01:01.230> know<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.980> you're<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.250> win

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
actually know that you're going to win

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.600 
actually know that you're going to win
so<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> think<00:01:03.899> mentally<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.530> was<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> mean<00:01:05.400> City

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
so I think mentally it was a mean City

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.830 
so I think mentally it was a mean City
then<00:01:05.760> obviously<00:01:05.909> after<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.299> yellow<00:01:06.420> card<00:01:06.689> it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
then obviously after the yellow card it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.630 
then obviously after the yellow card it
just<00:01:07.100> just<00:01:08.100> fell<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> -<00:01:09.360> correct<00:01:09.570> sir

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
just just fell to - correct sir
