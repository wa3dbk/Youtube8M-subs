00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello how are you all welcome to the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.779
 video number 42 of the wake pc channel 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.210
 tips and in this video I want to show you the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.059
 process to find images 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.130
 duplicates in our computer with the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.340
 so that we can eliminate or move them 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.710
 to another place to save space 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.350
 on our hard drive for this then 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.720
 We will use a free program 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.779
 called vice pex is a very easy program 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.929
 and very fast and use function from 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.250
 windows xp deceased 7 and what can 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.250
 download from their official website 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.840
 and they continue these processes of downloading 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.880
 select any of these links 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.270
 and the program starts to download 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.270
 automatically 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.260
 we follow the installation processes 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.629
 like any other program 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.039
 when we started the program first thing 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.659
 what we have to do then is 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.549
 add folders and disk 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.320
 some partition that we want to start 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.940
 look for duplicate images for that 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.670
 here we have this explorer 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.680
 it's very easy to use we select it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.840
 what folder do we want and we simply 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.430
 we click on this button to add it 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.720
 the same with partitions 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.150
 once we have 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.370
 Add to folders can 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.490
 ignore some of them if we do not want 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.220
 I do the search, I recommend it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.290
 that the disk is selected only 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.160
 where are the photographs in order 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.800
 that I'm not going to delete some photos 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.780
 and some images of the operating system 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.150
 ready once done this then 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.240
 we click on the play button and the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.950
 program begins to do 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.200
 start looking for the images 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.750
 on the left side of the program we 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.610
 we find all the images that 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.860
 he will find all the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.740
 duplicate images and here we have 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.119
 several options how to see them or 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.860
 eliminate them 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.019
 we can do it manually simply 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.890
 clicking on what images we want 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.630
 start to eliminate if we want and as 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.819
 there are many images then we can 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.400
 say that the program for us to auto 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.530
 select and leave us only one 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.590
 copy of each of the images 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.959
 repeated he chooses them with base 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.050
 which has better resolution and that of 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.110
 better size you can enable or 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.569
 disable these criteria based on 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.210
 which the program makes the selection and 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.220
 once it is established in the selection 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.410
 can do a visualization of the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.050
 image as such 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.430
 as you can see, that is pixilated and this is 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.350
 it is of better resolution once we have 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.630
 this then we simply add the 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.780
 Move or delete button in this case 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.980
 I'm going to delete an image 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.980
 here I have 3 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.470
 and simply click on the button 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.470
 delete let's say in ok 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.340
 and the program removes only leaves the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.950
 of higher resolution so that we are not going to 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.989
 delete the best images that we 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.540
 we have and in this way very simple 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.450
 We can delete all the photos and 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.670
 duplicate images that we have in 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.659
 our computer with this program 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.939
 free up here this video and we 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.939
 we see in the next tutorial
