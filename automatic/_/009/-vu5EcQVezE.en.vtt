00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:31.040 

135<00:00:24.230> 135<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.449> go<00:00:30.599> through<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.929> it's

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
135 135 and you just go through and it's

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.600 
135 135 and you just go through and it's
really<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.380> space<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.830> put<00:00:32.040> between<00:00:32.160> those

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
really the space you put between those

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
really the space you put between those
and<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.180> listen<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> lot<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.809> Bob<00:00:34.050> Marley

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and if you listen to a lot of Bob Marley

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.229 
and if you listen to a lot of Bob Marley
you<00:00:34.469> hear<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.800> everywhere<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.120> we

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you hear that everywhere so now if we

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
you hear that everywhere so now if we
want<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.510> learn<00:00:42.600> our<00:00:42.660> 2<00:00:42.989> minor<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.649> our

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
want to learn our 2 minor we have our

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.430 
want to learn our 2 minor we have our
two<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.390> goes<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.719> minor<00:00:46.050> third

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
two and then it goes to a minor third

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.520 
two and then it goes to a minor third
which<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.950> three<00:00:47.940> frets<00:00:48.239> offered<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.469> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
which is three frets offered so we go to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.330 
which is three frets offered so we go to
first<00:00:50.340> fret<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> fourth<00:00:50.969> fret<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> have

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
first fret the fourth fret so you have

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.360 
first fret the fourth fret so you have
one<00:00:53.640> minor<00:00:54.120> third<00:00:54.449> 5<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.800> pattern<00:00:56.070> will

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
one minor third 5 and that pattern will

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.709 
one minor third 5 and that pattern will
stay<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> same<00:00:56.789> through<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> whole<00:00:57.480> base

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
stay the same through the whole base

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.490 
stay the same through the whole base
that's<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.289> minor<00:00:58.530> triad<00:01:03.080> if<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that's your minor triad if we go to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.770 
that's your minor triad if we go to
major<00:01:04.769> we'd<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> skip<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
major we'd have to skip up to here so to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510 
major we'd have to skip up to here so to
make<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.110> easier<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.710> your<00:01:10.860> fingers<00:01:11.189> will

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
make that easier on your fingers will

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.910 
make that easier on your fingers will

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
start here's our 5 triad and we just go

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.469 
start here's our 5 triad and we just go
to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.159> whole<00:01:14.310> bin<00:01:14.490> string<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.150> one

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
to the whole bin string it's just one

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.510 
to the whole bin string it's just one
fret<00:01:16.229> back<00:01:16.850> 135<00:01:22.250> remember<00:01:23.250> our<00:01:23.369> fifth

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
fret back 135 remember our fifth

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.140 
fret back 135 remember our fifth
interval<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:25.430> or<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.880> could<00:01:27.030> do

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
interval is right there or you could do

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:38.730 
interval is right there or you could do
it<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.479> three<00:01:28.229> strings

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.380 

so<00:01:39.740> now<00:01:39.890> we<00:01:39.950> have<00:01:40.070> our<00:01:40.430> three<00:01:40.760> triads<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.270> we

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
so now we have our three triads and we

00:01:41.390 --> 00:02:03.630 
so now we have our three triads and we
can<00:01:41.540> start<00:01:41.750> bumping<00:01:41.960> them

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:22.480
