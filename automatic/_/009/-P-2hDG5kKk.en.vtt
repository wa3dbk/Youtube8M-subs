where you want to bring the brand and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.830 
where you want to bring the brand and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
where you want to go you have to be very

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.600

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
very consistent in your approach you

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.820 
very consistent in your approach you
also<00:01:31.849> said<00:01:32.149> recently<00:01:32.690> it<00:01:33.289> would<00:01:33.470> be<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.649> mistake

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
also said recently it would be a mistake

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.490 
also said recently it would be a mistake
to<00:01:34.340> reduce<00:01:34.789> the<00:01:35.000> brand<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.599> what<00:01:35.780> we<00:01:36.020> have<00:01:36.229> done

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
to reduce the brand to what we have done

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.279 
to reduce the brand to what we have done
I'm<00:01:37.429> wondering<00:01:37.789> what<00:01:38.149> you<00:01:38.270> meant<00:01:38.509> by<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.750> and

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
I'm wondering what you meant by that and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.469 
I'm wondering what you meant by that and
also<00:01:39.739> perhaps<00:01:40.009> it's<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.789> clear<00:01:40.970> indication

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
also perhaps it's a clear indication

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.380 
also perhaps it's a clear indication
that<00:01:41.630> brand<00:01:42.140> diversity<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:42.890> needed<00:01:43.310> why<00:01:43.759> now<00:01:44.030> I

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
that brand diversity is needed why now I

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.130 
that brand diversity is needed why now I
think<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.950> would<00:01:46.550> be<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.729> mistake<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.209> to<00:01:47.780> reduce

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
think it would be a mistake to to reduce

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.210 
think it would be a mistake to to reduce
this<00:01:48.289> only<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.679> that<00:01:48.830> because<00:01:49.819> we<00:01:50.179> have<00:01:50.360> such<00:01:50.929> a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
this only to that because we have such a

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.070 
this only to that because we have such a
potential<00:01:52.220> here<00:01:52.429> such<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.729> vast<00:01:53.300> creativity

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
potential here such a vast creativity

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.880 
potential here such a vast creativity
here<00:01:54.349> I<00:01:54.950> think<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.539> brand<00:01:56.810> is<00:01:57.080> is<00:01:57.410> just

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
here I think the the brand is is just

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.100 
here I think the the brand is is just
what<00:01:58.310> you've<00:01:58.459> seen<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:58.700> far<00:01:58.940> is<00:01:59.390> just<00:01:59.720> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
what you've seen so far is just the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.809 
what you've seen so far is just the
basis<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.739> what<00:02:00.979> we're<00:02:01.130> set<00:02:01.340> out<00:02:01.489> to<00:02:01.700> do

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
basis of that what we're set out to do

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.710 
basis of that what we're set out to do
for<00:02:02.090> us<00:02:02.869> in<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.229> future<00:02:03.729> we<00:02:04.729> I<00:02:05.060> said<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.569> in

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
for us in the future we I said that in

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.240 
for us in the future we I said that in
the<00:02:05.810> context<00:02:06.319> I<00:02:06.410> believe<00:02:06.679> in<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.979> Motor<00:02:07.160> Show

of Paris where we showed a concept car a

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.030 
of Paris where we showed a concept car a
show<00:02:10.459> car<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.060> stuck<00:02:11.420> at<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.660> four<00:02:11.900> door<00:02:12.110> and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
show car that stuck at the four door and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.369 
show car that stuck at the four door and
we<00:02:13.190> were<00:02:13.340> asked<00:02:13.760> by<00:02:13.910> doing<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.080> I

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
we were asked by doing this and and I

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.500 
we were asked by doing this and and I
just<00:02:15.560> exploited<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.430> in<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.670> way<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.209> said

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
just exploited it in the way that I said

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.890 
just exploited it in the way that I said
this<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.800> also<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.340> viable<00:02:19.970> way<00:02:20.330> for<00:02:20.540> us<00:02:20.720> an

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
this is also a viable way for us an

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.800 
this is also a viable way for us an
incredible<00:02:21.380> way

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
incredible way

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.020 
incredible way
anything<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:22.349> do<00:02:22.560> has<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.459> authentic

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
anything that we do has to be authentic

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.900 
anything that we do has to be authentic
it<00:02:24.270> has<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.780> be<00:02:24.930> recognized<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.280> Lamborghini

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
it has to be recognized as a Lamborghini

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.620 
it has to be recognized as a Lamborghini
product<00:02:27.480> from<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.500> first<00:02:28.709> site<00:02:28.920> and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
product from the first site and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.720 
product from the first site and
therefore<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.930> believe<00:02:31.380> yes<00:02:31.800> we<00:02:32.310> can<00:02:32.430> do<00:02:32.520> more

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
therefore I believe yes we can do more

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.910 
therefore I believe yes we can do more
and<00:02:32.790> we're<00:02:33.569> set<00:02:34.080> out<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.380> do<00:02:34.500> more

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and we're set out to do more

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.250

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.229 
now does Lamborghini move into a new
market<00:02:37.440> what<00:02:37.830> are<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.010> steps<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.730> think

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
market what are the steps I think

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.570 
market what are the steps I think
they're<00:02:39.480> we<00:02:40.170> need<00:02:40.440> first<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.040> all<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> good

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
they're we need first of all a good

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.360 
they're we need first of all a good
understanding<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.420> market<00:02:43.069> but<00:02:44.069> that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
understanding of the market but that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.089 
understanding of the market but that
does<00:02:44.700> not<00:02:44.730> mean<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.569> will<00:02:45.739> cater<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
does not mean that we will cater to the

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.800 
does not mean that we will cater to the
market<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.670> special<00:02:48.090> way<00:02:48.239> what<00:02:48.660> does<00:02:48.780> that

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
market in a special way what does that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.710 
market in a special way what does that
mean<00:02:49.110> we<00:02:49.349> won't<00:02:49.530> do<00:02:49.830> products<00:02:50.459> for<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:51.030> market

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
mean we won't do products for a market

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.729 
mean we won't do products for a market
