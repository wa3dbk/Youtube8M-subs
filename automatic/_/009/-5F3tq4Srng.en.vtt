00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.750
 uncomfortable to do something so that your 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:13.350
 head was on the body and playing on the shoulder 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:16.250
 were on these to be pinching faith 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.830
 here I am stealing a lung not 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.710
 exactly the face cook of course 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.860
 dumbbells that she feared were zakrakami to 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.090
 and put brother not messing with yours to 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.420
 good vegans and so let's raise 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.010
 mts neatly 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:41.530
 satellite company hold them in front of the chest 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.530
 we picked up and start making management 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.670
 but 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.520
 on make exercise demobilization omit 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.740
 fingers again chest and gently lower 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.320
 on the floor 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.480
 This form-let is now possible to meet with 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.640
 wash your hands immediately rise 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:24.700
 so I ended up in a dumbbell bench press about me 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.100
 lying they are good this exercise is good 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.450
 acts on the muscles when you do 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.740
 right as I am to you now 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:37.200
 showed muscles at this time stretch 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:40.660
 stretch and after a while 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.150
 not pretty quick muscle existence 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.580
 do you absorb fiber stretched 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.160
 such that we want and then later 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.440
 for a while they narrow down and 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:03:00.860
 im reduced to gaining its mass 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.670
 it becomes more elastic more 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.090
 massive 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.090
 this form on your body is such a field 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.630
 it was a congenital bench press dumbbell 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.100
 I repeat 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:23.680
 and I advise newcomers to do without or 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.330
 approaches 10 15 hole 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.820
 if when did you approach you 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.700
 shortness of breath has begun that is to you today 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.100
 shat whether it has made between the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.990
 approach the 200 minute exchanges try 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.840
 refrain capillaries you made 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.970
 Vlad approach will rest for two or three minutes so 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.360
 what is the approach rested plus 3 minus a 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.980
 here is an assistant to do something else 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.520
 have every approach the same 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.680
 exercise 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.760
 but for example one has already produced 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.580
 stand doing 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.310
 already from the stars on mode to lead where 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.569
 that is, already on the biceps started the game on 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.700
 muscle and now a month to do 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:07.180
 extreme on biceps post exercise press up 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.180
 3 0 ground will cut need to sit on a chair 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.959
 right foot should be a little bit 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:24.949
 side of here we take a boa leg should 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:30.830
 be even further where that is around at 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:33.169
 here it is degrees 50 60 now even 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.130
 back to the finals was such an attention 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.600
 here is the twisted to make it very 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.330
 felt uncomfortable becomes 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.370
 Usually, so that the back was straight 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.350
 so that the muscles themselves would raise 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.440
 lowered splines but because when you 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.990
 take 8 kilograms of metal grams 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.070
 rocky you are physically straining your muscles 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.550
 tense up 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.020
 if you will be so very lexan to 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.970
 just get hurt 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.400
 so try when you understand 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.060
 some load boy we have a draw 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.940
 shouted 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.979
 try to keep straight to take into account 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:15.940
 as yours is in east they understand 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:19.570
 dumbbell we put our hand on our knee 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.800
 here and now we do another exercise 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.110
 separation we put on this knee and 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.320
 make in different 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.320
 so we start 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.479
 but 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:57.120
 so we finished the exercise now again 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:01.059
 to be a dumbbell also moves straight 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.960
 put it down put it shake 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:05.620
 hands-legs 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.189
