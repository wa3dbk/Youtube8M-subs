00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.830
 activity to swim and c we have main 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.309
 plates which these greenhouses does 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.650
 things are wolves mites but let 's go see 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.549
 what did we get in half 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.549
 of today 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.300
 so system 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.300
 2 nickname fence 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.870
 which comes on the drum filter yes 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.390
 he unisono intake is of course very bad 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.230
 it can be seen and then respectively sclera 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.970
 which closes our faucet and intake 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.000
 comfortable which also closes our tap 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.500
 this we drain but the drain pipe 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.460
 the fact that falls from the bar banniki 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:05.070
 sewer is our drum drum nick 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.610
 secured by a heel which 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.200
 220 you turn on electronics 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.780
 triggered gear mechanism which 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.940
 turn turns on the drum and again 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.740
 washing this drum respectively 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.479
 everything goes immunization 210 tubes from us 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.950
 out of the drum to parallel 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.490
 tracks come be able angel tank with us 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.850
 approximately one and a half vat him 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.700
 there is a bio download at the moment 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.549
 absent 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.560
 oxygen sprayers of this type or 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.409
 may be of a different type depending on 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.010
 logical features which in geyser 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.360
 us mode 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.020
 do not mix its loading pure water 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:01.320
 drawn from the drainage point of the fence 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.910
 through the pipe to the pump with moni with a minimum 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.680
 power consumption pump is very 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:11.480
 economical use funny 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:15.830
 reduction 110 water output goes into the reservoir 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.300
 respectively from the drum filter 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.790
 one of the crystals here and melancholy peace 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.450
 track skin this track is coming to 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.040
 the pool 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.610
 we will approach now thoughts so what 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.040
 provides and peaceful track here 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.920
 is mounted. skimmer surface 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.850
 water intake that takes bio foil from 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.850
 surface ponds floating debris 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.330
 pieces of not eaten form 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:49.050
 respectively on the approximate route 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:53.850
 bottom enters the drum. fence of 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:58.920
 pussy depths peaceful. fence with 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:02.590
 surface drum nick skirts 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.080
 water outlet and compressor which will 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.330
 installed in a similar mode but 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:14.170
 will be this place that is 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:16.830
 you build all this beauty is necessary for 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.830
 to given 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:26.280
 hydrobionts are not afraid of this word in 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.410
 particulars such here 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.980
 magic fish 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:37.709
 felt as comfortable as possible 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.920
 was the most effective 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:45.630
 filtration systems and with quality 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.270
 auto maintenance mode 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.260
 this sector 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.200
 filtration systems already available 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.150
 sponge drum filter has absolutely 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.840
 clear crystal clear water of this 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.920
 us asagi 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.270
 my favorite water is this pond 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.040
 processed processes with 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.910
 by special means therefore transparent here 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.190
 missing let's say the quarantine period 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.030
 it is absolutely adequate water condition 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.549
 even more 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.500
 a day ago she was with transparency up 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:23.790
 4 meters is not absolutely authoritative 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.790
 statement here we have asagi to hack 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.960
 gorgeous female 60 centimeters 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:38.240
 great great color 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.240
 well and on it we finish
