00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello I'm doing this video for 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.870
 show a pigeon that I just 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.830
 rescue that has the entangled in the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.960
 legs on both legs 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.920
 I just rescue him to do just 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.920
 a few minutes 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.370
 what you have in reality is 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.560
 hair 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.840
 but not only that they are tangled 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.030
 the fingers all the toes of the legs 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.460
 but also the two legs are 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.190
 tied to each other 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.570
 fortunately, he can catch it today 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.060
 it's the first time I see her in the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.230
 herd to which I feed and good 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.960
 it's the first time I'm going to do 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.450
 a video in which I'm going to record then 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.770
 the whole process of removing the threads like this 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.630
 that is going to become a very video 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.840
 long that I'll probably cut it 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.150
 after good you first gather all the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.540
 material that you need mainly 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.410
 Betadine to prevent infections 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.380
 light to cut 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.760
 can be any type of scissors a 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.120
 nail clipper that can be any 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.120
 size 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.900
 what else 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.510
 well I have other instruments here 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.780
 that they serve me a lot to need color 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.780
 as well 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.850
 good tape and a lot of things that 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.290
 I have here so she is very nervous 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.320
 then you put it on a clean towel 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.030
 paws up and covers the head of 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.010
 so that she is not so nervous anymore 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.460
 not the pressure is much the chest because 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.460
 It could be dangerous 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.740
 once you put it on top 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.439
 you start to inspect the area 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.680
 to see what it's about good here is 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.310
 pretty obvious what it's about 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.350
 you cut the hair or the threads that are 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.660
 holding the two legs one against the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.390
 another one and then choose one of the two 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.460
 paws to start working 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.200
 well it's going to be a pretty long process 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.200
 this poor video 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.670
 that is to say 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.920
 it is always a video is a very very long 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.500
 well in any case I better go to 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.270
 explain 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.870
 when the hair is entangled in the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.790
 fingers like in this case then 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.670
 entangled in virtually every 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.670
 fingers on three of the four fingers of 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.400
 this leg and tangled left America 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.210
 also on three of the four fingers of 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.250
 the other leg you have to go lifting 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.230
 the threads that are stuck that are 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.040
 embedded embedded in reality in the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.990
 skin 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.350
 little by little with a file of preference 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.180
 with a metal file you raise them 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.010
 and as you raise them 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.350
 you can cut or with a scissors 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.590
 what can this be a scissor for 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.130
 cut baby lines or cut them 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.870
 little by little with a nail clipper 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.790
 it's a long process and it has to have 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.130
 very careful not to hurt the dove 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.840
 to show her fingers once 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.760
 you finish removing all the threads or 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.200
 all the hair as in this case 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.110
 because it's about hair what has 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.900
 a scratched disinfect the paws with 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.820
 betadine never use alcohol 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.490
 because it is something very very strong in this 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.230
 has is a soft product that has a 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.060
 power disinfectant in motion 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.190
 it's very powerful, you have to 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.120
 You can also use the one from 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.129
 aloe vera that is also very good and 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.930
 After that good rest and you let 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.599
 you continue with the procedure I will do 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.430
 a video later about the pigeon 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.750
 when you have removed the signs because 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.019
 if it's not going to be an order too 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.019
 long
