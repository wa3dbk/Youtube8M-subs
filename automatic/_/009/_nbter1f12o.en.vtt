00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.820
 good kids how are you doing today we have 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.500
 a new efe news that mostly 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.450
 will deal with harlem since the last 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.829
 that we have known about battlefield 4 is the 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.150
 patch of the other day on the ct that already 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:11.619
 we commented in the teacher video to 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.509
 mere of the other day in which to summarize 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.219
 a little been some fixes to the net 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.630
 code were retouched enough weapons has 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.160
 there were several francs that were 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.810
 has modified the fall of bullets are 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.130
 has modified the cadence and good in 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.539
 General, many weapons have been retouched 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.039
 both in its operation and in its 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.539
 animations since many need 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.789
 arrangements to coordinate the time of 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.289
 animation with the animation itself apart 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.820
 of that we have not received too much more 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.349
 about battlefield 4 so let's focus 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.640
 in Harlem that from the first two 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.560
 weeks of play did not lend 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.030
 too much attention to the game thing of the 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.640
 I have something to tell you later 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.710
 apart from that forgive me for having the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.240
 voice a little weird the truth is that I have 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.680
 a few days bad and good then 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.240
 I hope you do not bother much but 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.680
 well let's go fast I want to be a 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.060
 little brief first since yesterday 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.110
 we were able to start enjoying the 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.580
 first patch that you saw that has 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.960
 introduced of which I also spoke to you 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.880
 a couple of weeks ago when it was announced 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.590
 to refresh our memory a little bit 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.940
 have been solved of a few books 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.770
 and several weapons that have been retouched 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.300
 they were previously broken from the moment of 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.860
 The one I like the most has been the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.210
 have lacquer fear 10 that the truth is that 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.530
 it was necessary although it follows me 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.490
 looking like I told you a few ago 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.990
 days on twitter 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.939
 specialization of armor follow the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.259
 garden game is going to be unbalanced 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.880
 so for now I think they have 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.200
 left work very half-way I hope 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.759
 that the community will continue calling for 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.130
 remove this accessory so brightly 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.570
 designed apart from that the other arrangement 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.250
 where I focused the other day was the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.200
 of tc that is supposed to be a 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.610
 little better while I write this video 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.020
 I have not tried the mode yet but 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.970
 result should be reflected in what 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.170
 that you are seeing part of that to the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.939
 part the patch ad that is 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.259
 published in bat the former deputy a note 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.520
 in which it is said that in May it is going to 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.259
 introduce something that in principle 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.850
 had confirmed it would not be but that 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.920
 it looks like a rectification and it's going to 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.690
 start the ct for hard line for the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.490
 that you are very new and do not yet know of 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.810
 what is basically the ct is an environment 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.590
 of tests until now exclusive for 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.940
 the premium ones 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.770
 well I do not know how they will do it in harden but 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.850
 instead of exclusive premium 4 in which 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.229
 you try the new thing that is going to 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.640
 introduce in the final game in their 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.470
 previous states so we can give 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.060
 feedback about what is going to 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.890
 enter so everything is fine and 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.360
 good to tinker a little and 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.920
 basically also to put the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.539
 long teeth to the rest of the community 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.189
 and talking about putting long teeth 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.229
 in the case of harlem it seems that we are going to 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.490
 brand new strong enough is from cti ya 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.170
 let's try one of the new ones 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.940
 maps that will bring the first dlc leave it 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.890
 in criminal activity that in fact already 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.970
 supposes a news by itself and of the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.500
 which I guess we'll start 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.210
 very soon if we take into account that 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.310
 They want us to try one of the maps 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.870
 in fact the one that has not announced what 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.430
 soon enough this first dlc 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.590
 is one of the things that are attributed to 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.970
 the apparent failure of hard line and by 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.440
 much that I feel sorry for myself and all that 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.360
 you want there is one thing that I can not deny 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.830
 and they are the statistics in the numbers and 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.600
 it is clear that there is more 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.250
 people when instead of 4 you have almost 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.110
 2 years in hard line that has a month and 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.660
 half the truth is that it does not leave much 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.280
 place to doubts apart from that also 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.020
 there are other things that confuse me and it is 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.990
 which has been the best-selling game in 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.300
 March and April both in the UK and 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.910
 eeuu that the truth is that it is something that 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.380
 get enough out of me let's go that is not 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.110
 I understand if you have bought it so many 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.430
 people because nobody has stayed 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.840
 The truth is that I have no idea why 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.730
 what the game has lost the bellows so 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.230
 fast but good I hope you will climb in 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.640
 a near future at the moment when 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.260
 leave no information on the dlc 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.940
 I will try to cover it and obviously 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.590
 I will continue to cover the patches and what 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.380
 arise but the truth is that it surprises me 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.910
 a lot that has been deflated so fast 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.020
 and good kids that would be all for efe 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.550
 news of today I hope that I have you 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.470
 liked and as always we do in 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.720
 bcn I am going to ask your opinion and 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.790
 something tells me that you want to think like you 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.739
 it seems that the first patch works 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.299
 announced the ct and here comes the plate 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.129
 today's strong you think that garden has 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.989
 unsuccessful you are more positive 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.659
 if you think it's going to come back I hope to see it 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.579
 all in comments so nothing said 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.299
 I say goodbye 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.299
 goodbye kids
