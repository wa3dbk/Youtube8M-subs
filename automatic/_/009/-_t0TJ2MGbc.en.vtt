00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.780
 why is it important to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.740
 preserve sharks in what way even 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.719
 essential 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.030
 is not it just because 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.910
 it's a great joy to swim 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.600
 with them a great happiness or pay a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.570
 serenity 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.130
 is that only for that then 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.880
 all those who do not dive take advantage of it 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.390
 no no they are indispensable for 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.740
 two reasons the first we know 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.280
 like all the animals on this planet 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.460
 who live interdependently who are 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.590
 defined by their ties the beings 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.570
 living are defined by the links that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.210
 weave with other species and with 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.120
 the middle whenever one of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.219
 it disappears it's all these links 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 who are torn and therefore 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.600
 the whole web of life that is fraying 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.149
 and we are part of this law which 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.030
 live by depending on the sharks we 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.840
 we defend ourselves we are neither 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.909
 related directly or indirectly but 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.720
 there is a reason that seems to me more 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.490
 important and I would say who is order 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.909
 philosophical 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.640
 if all of a sudden we had to think 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.680
 in a way to know what is useful 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.630
 and useless on this planet will be found 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.960
 obviously that sharks are 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.509
 particularly cumbersome that sometimes 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.409
 even a cause of the death of a certain 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.289
 many of them 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.030
 it would be like useless hockey we eliminate 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:38.210
 but where to place the cursor 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.000
 can we stop in this 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.950
 ranking dutil and useless we will see 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.569
 quickly that other animals are not 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.969
 especially useful and we will put them in 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.099
 the useless ones and we will eliminate them and where 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:54.179
 are we going to stop is what is that 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.899
 am I useful and that's where 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.719
 what is danger 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.509
 however on the other hand if all of a 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.689
 blow we know how to make room for 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.219
 dangerous sharks to bulky at all 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.439
 what we do not want today 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.629
 to everything we do not know about 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.790
 tiny to what we will not know 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.530
 never if we know how to make room for 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.930
 all this to elephants and whales 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.420
 so then we remember the place to 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.480
 each of us to each of us 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.790
 us with all these differences and 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.099
 that's where it's essential 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.920
 to see that it's the shark that is 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.409
 our rampart so preserve it and we 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.819
 can all live in harmony at 9 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.819
 billion on this planet
