it fits deeper onto the head than I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.160 
it fits deeper onto the head than I
would<00:01:17.280> figure<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.729> would<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.180> by<00:01:18.330> looking<00:01:19.020> at

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
would figure it would just by looking at

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.350 
would figure it would just by looking at
it<00:01:19.350> because<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.799> mean<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:20.939> looks<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.150> one

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it because I mean it just looks like one

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
it because I mean it just looks like one
of<00:01:21.420> those<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.659> would<00:01:21.750> sit<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:21.990> top<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.290> your

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
of those that would sit on top of your

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.690 
of those that would sit on top of your
head<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.710> give<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.009> mushroom<00:01:23.310> effect

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
head and give you that mushroom effect

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.990 
head and give you that mushroom effect
but<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:23.970> not<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.450> bad<00:01:24.659> with<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> helmet

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
but it's not that bad with this helmet

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.240 
but it's not that bad with this helmet
the<00:01:27.000> strap<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.439> standard<00:01:28.740> d-ring

strap<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.850> would<00:01:30.180> probably<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
strap I would probably go with a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.710 
strap I would probably go with a
quick-release<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.490> me<00:01:32.729> because<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
quick-release if it was me because the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.679 
quick-release if it was me because the
strap<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.200> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.860> long<00:01:35.420> that's<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> good

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
strap is kind of long that's the good

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.960
