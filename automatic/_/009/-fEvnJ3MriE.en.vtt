00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and there we are and putting up a nest

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.180 
and there we are and putting up a nest
box<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.240> easy

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.620

whether you buy or build a nest box

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
whether you buy or build a nest box
there's<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:24.990> couple<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.350> simple

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
there's a couple of simple

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.490 
there's a couple of simple

characteristics you want to look for you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.140 
characteristics you want to look for you
want<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.740> make<00:02:28.890> sure<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.550> there<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.910> not<00:02:30.120> a

great for monitoring all species because

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.070 
great for monitoring all species because
you<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:06.989> look<00:03:07.170> right<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:09.390> box<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.900> made

of three quarter inch rough cut wood

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.490 
of three quarter inch rough cut wood
it's<00:03:12.000> important<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.420> have<00:03:12.540> rough<00:03:13.110> cut<00:03:13.320> wood

it's important to have rough cut wood

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.400 
it's important to have rough cut wood
because<00:03:14.040> many<00:03:14.760> species<00:03:15.090> need<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.989> rough<00:03:16.170> cut

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
because many species need the rough cut

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.170 
because many species need the rough cut
so<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:17.130> young<00:03:17.370> can<00:03:17.580> grip<00:03:17.790> onto<00:03:17.970> the
