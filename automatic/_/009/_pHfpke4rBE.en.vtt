00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 its ascent along the east coast 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.200
 today we find ourselves speaking on 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.290
 rather real how to modify or create a 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.540
 texture pack minecraft 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.760
 so these pack textures is going to be everything 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.880
 simple so we will start 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.849
 first you can either create a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.519
 easter texture in default minecraft 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.619
 so that's hue advice to that 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.649
 you too want to change it's not 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.320
 it 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.710
 so here is my last kraft divers 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.440
 was the files to change 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:49.739
 land there are some net land where 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.809
 look for a job you have to click 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.469
 on the records and there you have some 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.640
 images you can change 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.469
 that's good, but we're going to do it 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.369
 on two sections not different from one 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.330
 side in India and especially the server of 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.400
 world only plays I write so with a 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.700
 mix of bread textures 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.990
 and I would like to modify it by adding 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.220
 fix on fuck the state 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.820
 so I explain to you how to do 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:32.370
 so we can motivate a lot of things 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:36.300
 so weapons the items so that's it 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.770
 that's all but me now what 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.830
 I am interested in is to change 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.860
 land so land is what if 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.280
 you develop the game is worth in so 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.430
 number 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:58.890
 lille since I have land so that's it 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:02.220
 it is the field of 2.2 playful on not 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.400
 that I write is that of trams 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:10.399
 so I would like to take the table of 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.629
 kraft and put it on my development 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:18.349
 so to do this you already have to do both 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:20.329
 open files with 5 points is so 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.470
 full net point will need to download I 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.470
 would like to become in the description 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:34.909
 Here it was so open there for simon 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.950
 people's textures I will then open 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.950
 our textures not the same 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.629
 so here is the little diminished by pressing 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.879
 on ctrl all this leaves you well 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:56.500
 often in the corner what interests me is 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.500
 the case of fears 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:11.810
 so that's ok so to select 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:16.060
 of a kraft code yes I do not know the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:19.579
 three on mym so from a point of view 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.599
 rectangle we will try well this is 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:29.209
 the whole corner so it's a drama on 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:33.170
 the other one is now that his lands 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.090
 was bent selection we will 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.190
 on your private sector were at 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:50.150
 it's going to hurt and so 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:54.500
 well the place and take one have then 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.790
 burned his fruit so that's normal he 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:03.019
 just have to go here pixelated masters 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:07.639
 alas no longer be here once 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:13.879
 you have a room to take 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:15.440
 the little rectangle to click next and 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.930
 I just realized that I did 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.699
 in fact to see them there is not everything 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.729
 in fact the same colors so the group 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:25.610
 I will make a flash to us but it's ok 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:33.710
 go back because once again 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:37.520
 and here you are 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.740
 the director and so now 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.740
 I copied do not occupy diot 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.680
 so it's pretty accurate foot 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:11.760
 the deputy of size and here and there you 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.640
 can see that you will have your table 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.340
 kraft 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.290
 you can do that with chrisitan all 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:25.290
 the blocks in gt open 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.440
 so if you're really not bad at all 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.510
 it can do a lot of things 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:39.830
 so once it's over we click 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:47.910
 on his recorded ok we can leave 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:54.570

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.010
 things after you do that for all the 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:08.750
 stays or outright you slip them 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:11.340
 job salary files will be so here's it 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:15.480
