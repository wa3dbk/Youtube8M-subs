00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.080
Yeah! Japano Bitches go on bitchy adventures!

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.020
Really bitchy!

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.040
Japano Bitches!

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.940
Sloppily drawn, sloppily animated, totally flat anime crap!

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.040
Japano Bitches!

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.960
Episode 11: A Boring Rainy Day

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.100
Rainy days are so boring!

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.160
We could play with your cat Puschi.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.100
No, she's still a little shy. She hasn't even touched her food yet.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.000
What is this shit?! This is hamster food!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.760
Aww, Puschi can be so stupid sometimes.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.820
Here, kids, I made you something to eat!

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.880
Thanks, okasan!

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.980
Thanks, Wake's okasan! ... Okasaan... Okasann...

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.540
I'm turning on the TV...

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.220
And that's it for today from Exploding Boobs!

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.140
The News

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.580
The mysterious knife killer is on the loose. He is extremely dangerous and is very likely to stand behind you at this moment.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.300
Here, I brought you some carrots to nibble on.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.980
Oh dear, a blackout. Please check the fusebox in the basement.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.680
In the basement...?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.560
Wake, take your hair out of my face!

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.660
But I'm standing over here! Oh, here's a flashlight!

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.860
Oh damn, the battery is dead! Oh, here is the fusebox...

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.760
What are you doing by the plant?

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.520
Okasan, what happened?! Okasan? Okasan!

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.160
Oh no, Wake's okasan! Okasaan.. Okasann!

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.140
What are you screaming at, love, I just wanted to bring you some tomato soup and dropped the pot!

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.080
I am so clumsy!

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.240
Stop making us food!

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.280
Don't you know that the mysterious knife killer is on the loose?

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
The mysterious knife killer? You mean... him?!

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.840
That is just a chair with a pullover on top!

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.500
We're really jumpy today I guess...

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.240
Yeah, that's it about the Japano Bitches!

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.820
And the boring rainy day.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.580
Absolutely nothing exciting happened. What a boring, rainy day.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.360
Boring, boring, boring.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.080
Sorry that this episode was so boring for you.
