00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello how about this time 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.099
 I will show how to connect our ipod 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.740
 iphone or ipad to our speakers 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.500
 good computer what the horns 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.410
 they need to have their charger in advance 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.500
 with regulator is very important that brings 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.869
 the regulator and that is not simply the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.920
 charger because in this way we could 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.790
 get to damage our device 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.650
 good what we will do is connect the what 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.350
 What we will do first is connect 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.810
 the regulator or charger as you want 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.410
 tell 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.210
 well here already connected the regulator to the 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.410
 electric current now what we will do 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.240
 will connect this part to the speaker 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.450
 control horn that is what brings the 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.550
 controls and good as you can see it 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.530
 find in this part what we will do 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.150
 will be plugging it 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.460
 and good 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.700
 in this other horn to which not three 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.170
 controls will simply bring this cable 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.360
 is the input what we do will be 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.090
 plug it into the control horn or to the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.039
 of command 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:18.210
 we will simply connect it and well this 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:20.930
 it would be all just this other cable 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.550
 that brings the control horn 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:29.180
 what is the hearing aid input 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.950
 the one commonly brought all 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.440
 that would be forgiveness for that would be this 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.530
 and well once done that what we will do 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.250
 will lower the volume 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.520
 and turn on the speaker 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.929
 you have done that to me 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.890
 learn the ipod and connect this cable 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.140
 from hearing aid to ipad 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.290
 well once here we can upload the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.110
 volume 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.570
 and as one can see hear the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.570
 speakers keeping 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.610
 is a genius and well how can you see 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.040
 is how the ipod connects or 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.630
 any other type of device here 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.630
 play the music 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.560
 well as you can see it works 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.830
 correctly something that needs to be said is 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.410
 that when we connect the speaker to the ipod 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.569
 it must have the volume a bit low 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.290
 so that we do not damage the 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:45.569
 device with light current what 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.849
 which will not be so necessary and we have the 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.220
 regulator but if they simply have the 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.640
 charger if it is advisable to lower the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.380
 good volume that would be all I hope that 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.380
 you liked it and until next time
