00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
days but if you look in the back it has

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.130 
days but if you look in the back it has
sort<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.859> curved<00:00:32.420> back<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.960> mean

definitely<00:00:34.320> makes<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.040> comfortable<00:00:35.850> enough

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
definitely makes it comfortable enough

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.150 
definitely makes it comfortable enough
to<00:00:36.360> hold<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> phone<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
to hold but because it's not a phone you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.680 
to hold but because it's not a phone you
would<00:00:38.219> use<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.520> landscape<00:00:38.969> mode<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.300> seems<00:00:39.570> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
would use in landscape mode it seems a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.690 
would use in landscape mode it seems a
little<00:00:39.870> bit<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:41.040> seems<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.430> bit<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.579> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
little bit that it seems like a bit of a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.880 
little bit that it seems like a bit of a
waste<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.210> put<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.719> ergonomic<00:00:43.290> contoured

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
waste to put in this ergonomic contoured

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
doesn't look particularly sharp they're

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.369 
doesn't look particularly sharp they're
viewing<00:03:55.060> angles<00:03:55.510> are<00:03:55.690> it's<00:03:55.959> pretty

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
viewing angles are it's pretty

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:57.539 
viewing angles are it's pretty
reflective<00:03:56.590> screen<00:03:56.920> actually<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.489> the

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
reflective screen actually so the

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.160 
reflective screen actually so the
viewing<00:03:57.819> angles<00:03:58.090> aren't<00:03:58.239> great<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:58.989> that's

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
viewing angles aren't great but that's

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.750 
viewing angles aren't great but that's
my<00:03:59.290> biggest<00:03:59.500> problem<00:03:59.950> is<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.129> resolution<00:04:00.400> is

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
my biggest problem is the resolution is

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.720 
my biggest problem is the resolution is
just<00:04:01.060> not<00:04:01.239> great<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:03.069> hectic<00:04:03.430> buttons

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
just not great so the hectic buttons

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.530 
just not great so the hectic buttons

skin<00:04:43.330> over<00:04:43.690> gingerbread<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.590> think

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
skin over gingerbread I think

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.740 
skin over gingerbread I think
gingerbreads<00:04:45.280> great<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:45.700> think<00:04:45.729> we<00:04:46.479> really

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
gingerbreads great and I think we really

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.529 
gingerbreads great and I think we really
could<00:04:46.930> have<00:04:46.960> used<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.380> space<00:04:47.590> here<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:49.180> we've

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
could have used the space here so we've

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.240 
could have used the space here so we've
gone<00:04:49.690> over<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:50.050> design<00:04:50.440> we've<00:04:50.710> gone<00:04:50.889> over<00:04:50.919> the

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
gone over the design we've gone over the

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.890 
gone over the design we've gone over the
keyboard<00:04:51.639> and<00:04:52.030> just<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.300> general<00:04:52.450> speed

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
keyboard and just the general speed

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.140 
keyboard and just the general speed
battery's<00:04:53.830> low<00:04:54.010> but<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.430> put<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:54.849> in<00:04:54.910> with<00:04:55.120> a

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
battery's low but I put it in with a

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.670 
battery's low but I put it in with a
pretty<00:04:55.389> low<00:04:55.539> battery<00:04:55.840> well<00:04:56.200> because<00:04:56.380> I<00:04:56.500> just

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
pretty low battery well because I just

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.909 
pretty low battery well because I just
took<00:04:56.740> it<00:04:56.830> out<00:04:56.950> of<00:04:57.039> the<00:04:57.099> box<00:04:58.139> so<00:04:59.139> I<00:04:59.169> think<00:04:59.320> that

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
took it out of the box so I think that

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.500 
took it out of the box so I think that
pretty<00:05:00.190> much<00:05:00.280> covers<00:05:00.550> everything<00:05:01.090> but<00:05:01.360> we're

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
pretty much covers everything but we're

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.029 
pretty much covers everything but we're
taking<00:05:01.960> reviewing<00:05:02.410> it<00:05:02.470> at<00:05:02.590> home<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:02.950> you

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
taking reviewing it at home so you

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.080 
taking reviewing it at home so you
should<00:05:03.250> see<00:05:03.520> our<00:05:03.550> full<00:05:04.120> review<00:05:04.330> pretty<00:05:04.840> soon
