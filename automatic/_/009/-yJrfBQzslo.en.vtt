00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
difficulty spike so be ready for that
the<00:01:58.590> game<00:01:58.800> is<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> single-player<00:01:59.399> 2d

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the game is a single-player 2d

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.240 
the game is a single-player 2d
side-scroller<00:02:00.660> with<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.899> twist<00:02:01.200> while<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.100> can

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
side-scroller with a twist while you can

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.620 
side-scroller with a twist while you can
only<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.550> forward<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.060> backwards<00:02:03.450> through

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
only go forward and backwards through

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.480 
only go forward and backwards through
each<00:02:03.720> level<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.440> levels<00:02:04.740> actually<00:02:04.890> exist<00:02:05.369> in

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
each level the levels actually exist in

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.029 
each level the levels actually exist in
3d<00:02:05.940> space<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.869> some<00:02:07.080> paths<00:02:07.289> may<00:02:07.470> wrap<00:02:07.710> around

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
3d space so some paths may wrap around

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.350 
3d space so some paths may wrap around
and<00:02:08.220> take<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.429> outside<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.149> path<00:02:09.330> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
and take you outside of the path you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420 
and take you outside of the path you
were<00:02:09.539> originally<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.259> well<00:02:10.830> as<00:02:11.009> interact

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
were originally on as well as interact

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.130 
were originally on as well as interact
with<00:02:11.580> objects<00:02:12.000> outside<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.630> path<00:02:12.870> I

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
with objects outside of that path I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.809 
with objects outside of that path I
thought<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.010> was<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> really<00:02:14.430> cool<00:02:14.610> feature

thought this was a really cool feature
and<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.180> really<00:02:15.360> gave<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.630> game<00:02:15.780> some<00:02:16.019> depth

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and it really gave the game some depth

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:30.380 
and it really gave the game some depth
and<00:02:16.470> kept<00:02:16.680> things<00:02:16.860> interesting
