so one of the most important things is
setting<00:00:07.319> up<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.620> ins<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.040> outs<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.280> your

setting up the ins and outs of your

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.790 
setting up the ins and outs of your
audio<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.300> can<00:00:09.480> record<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.139> hear<00:00:10.650> play

back<00:00:11.010> correctly<00:00:12.650> well<00:00:13.650> okay<00:00:14.009> we<00:00:14.190> got<00:00:14.400> our<00:00:14.610> loop

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
back correctly well okay we got our loop

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.630 
back correctly well okay we got our loop
track<00:00:15.570> set<00:00:15.990> up<00:00:16.139> for<00:00:16.619> our<00:00:16.770> metronome<00:00:17.130> because

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
track set up for our metronome because

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.519 
track set up for our metronome because
the<00:00:17.760> metronome<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.359> really<00:00:18.720> boring<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the metronome is really boring and a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.779 
the metronome is really boring and a
loop<00:00:19.770> track<00:00:20.039> isn't<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.400> little<00:00:20.580> bit<00:00:20.670> more

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
loop track isn't a little bit more

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.080 
loop track isn't a little bit more
exciting<00:00:21.150> now<00:00:21.779> we're<00:00:21.960> gonna<00:00:22.080> focus<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:23.090> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
exciting now we're gonna focus on the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.849 
exciting now we're gonna focus on the
track<00:00:24.390> inputs<00:00:25.340> because<00:00:26.340> track<00:00:27.119> input<00:00:27.599> is

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
track inputs because track input is

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.580 
track inputs because track input is
different<00:00:28.859> than<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.939> actual<00:00:30.480> hardware<00:00:31.109> input

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
different than the actual hardware input

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.500 
different than the actual hardware input
that<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.700> configured<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that you have configured for the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.209 
that you have configured for the
software<00:00:33.870> within<00:00:34.170> GarageBand<00:00:34.920> there's<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
software within GarageBand there's a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.639 
software within GarageBand there's a
difference<00:00:35.489> between<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> two<00:00:36.030> because<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
difference between the two because the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.580 
difference between the two because the
software<00:00:38.129> configuration<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.590> telling

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
software configuration is telling

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.590 
software configuration is telling
GarageBand<00:00:41.160> okay<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.700> want<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> use<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
GarageBand okay I want to use this

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.029 
GarageBand okay I want to use this
device<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.460> my<00:00:44.460> ins<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.239> outs<00:00:45.649> now<00:00:46.649> after<00:00:46.920> that

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
device as my ins and outs now after that

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430 
device as my ins and outs now after that
once<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.520> set<00:00:47.670> up<00:00:47.730> your<00:00:47.820> track<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
once you set up your track you have to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590 
once you set up your track you have to
make<00:00:49.649> sure<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.579> specific<00:00:51.090> track<00:00:51.390> that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
make sure that the specific track that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.930 
make sure that the specific track that
you're<00:00:51.690> recording<00:00:52.129> has<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.399> correct<00:00:53.640> input

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
you're recording has the correct input

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.799 
you're recording has the correct input
within<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.780> track<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.590> let's<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.829> ahead<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
within that track so let's go ahead and

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.849 
within that track so let's go ahead and
add<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.870> track<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.289> know<00:00:58.410> how<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
add a track we know how to do that

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.630 
add a track we know how to do that
bottom<00:00:59.550> left<00:01:00.359> hand<00:01:00.480> corner<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.309> real<00:01:02.309> track

my<00:01:37.470> audio<00:01:37.770> interface<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.400> using<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> now

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
my audio interface that I'm using so now

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.130 
my audio interface that I'm using so now
I<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> option<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.790> choosing<00:01:42.140> either

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
I have the option of choosing either

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.219 
I have the option of choosing either
input<00:01:43.500> 1<00:01:43.950> or<00:01:44.189> input<00:01:44.909> 2<00:01:45.180> from<00:01:45.810> my<00:01:45.960> audio

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229

interface<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:47.070> use<00:01:47.759> both<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.119> them<00:01:48.390> at<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
interface or use both of them at the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.499 
interface or use both of them at the
same<00:01:48.720> time<00:01:49.110> they<00:01:49.290> make<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> stereo<00:01:49.979> track<00:01:50.509> now

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
same time they make a stereo track now

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.639 
same time they make a stereo track now
since<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.110> my<00:01:52.320> guitar<00:01:52.710> hooked<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.759> it

since I have my guitar hooked up to it
I'm<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.100> select<00:01:56.280> 2<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.329> have

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
I'm going to select 2 because I do have

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.350 
I'm going to select 2 because I do have
the<00:01:57.840> guitar<00:01:58.140> cable<00:01:59.100> plugged<00:01:59.340> into<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.850> input

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the guitar cable plugged into the input
