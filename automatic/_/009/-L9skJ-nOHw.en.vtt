00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
slow down he had so much damage at that

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.370 
slow down he had so much damage at that
time<00:03:32.090> he'd<00:03:32.239> already<00:03:32.359> got<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.630> hexdrinker<00:03:32.900> the

time he'd already got the hexdrinker the
brutalizer<00:03:33.859> I<00:03:34.250> think<00:03:34.700> he<00:03:34.790> was<00:03:34.910> well<00:03:35.090> on<00:03:35.120> his

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
brutalizer I think he was well on his

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.580 
brutalizer I think he was well on his
way<00:03:35.359> to<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.660> last<00:03:35.930> whisper<00:03:36.109> in<00:03:36.319> there<00:03:36.470> as<00:03:36.560> well

he'd<00:03:37.280> go<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.400> lot<00:03:37.639> of<00:03:37.700> damage<00:03:37.849> and<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.150> just<00:03:38.359> think

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
he'd go a lot of damage and I just think

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.909 
he'd go a lot of damage and I just think
he<00:03:38.599> completely<00:03:38.959> formed<00:03:39.200> by<00:03:39.290> surprise<00:03:39.620> and
