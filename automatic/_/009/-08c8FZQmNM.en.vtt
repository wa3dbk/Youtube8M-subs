00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
it's an interesting taken I think it's a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.069 
it's an interesting taken I think it's a
cool<00:00:44.010> different<00:00:44.280> type<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.789> beer<00:00:45.090> targeted<00:00:45.960> at

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
cool different type of beer targeted at

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.110 
cool different type of beer targeted at
probably<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> craft<00:00:46.890> beer<00:00:47.070> drinker<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
probably the craft beer drinker with the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.220 
probably the craft beer drinker with the
you<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.510> always<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.780> barrel<00:00:49.110> aged

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
they're marketing geniuses if you look

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.830 
they're marketing geniuses if you look
at<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.340> bottle<00:00:53.670> when<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:53.910> cold<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.480> eyes<00:00:54.600> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the skull turned green which is kind of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.450 
the skull turned green which is kind of
sweet<00:00:56.550> actually<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.800> beer<00:00:58.980> has<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> speak
