00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.150
 a greeting to youtubers and readers of 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.779
 hdblog yes i changed windows background 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.250
 10 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.380
 No, I know you're not asking 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 but I changed the background because I liked it 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.259
 plus the blue the green of the blue are not 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.559
 so we are on color blind 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.590
 windows 10 technical preview bild 9800 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.309
 79 which is microsoft's third baked one 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.980
 since he introduced windows 10 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.900
 presents several innovations that range 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.129
 from the application bar in the center 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.540
 notifications for folder effects 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.979
 indeed of the windows 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.580
 we have even better on the internet 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.890
 explorer on the low start that though 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.519
 not written I noticed a lot more 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.159
 reactive under any circumstances 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.860
 a new entry in the dedicated pc settings 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.780
 to the file manager 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.510
 an official apology to the noises of 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.570
 background that he could hear 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.450
 you remember microphone also sucks 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.410
 we also have news regarding 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.140
 the home folder and let's start right away from the 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:30.040
 application bar before we had the two 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:34.780
 icons the one for the search button let's say 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:38.490
 so is the task view for desktops 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.430
 virtual or for a tight tab 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.310
 now we can right- click 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.140
 on the bar remove one or both 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.990
 options I removed some more virtual ones in 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.910
 how much I never use the center 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.100
 notifications has been moved here on the side 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.710
 right instead of left here 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.320
 dart you see is I find it very much 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.840
 more functional, much more comfortable 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.660
 performance and system stability 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.550
 have been visibly improved with 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.920
 the introduction of bugfixes and corrections 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.060
 to avoid blockages and system crashes 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.040
 I had slowdowns at most 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.810
 problematic but not 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.180
 but also sporadic I never had 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.310
 windows 10 crash 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.659
 sincerely the effects of the folders 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.739
 have been improved as far as 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.950
 it's about minimization 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.280
 the enlargement of the folders what that 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.780
 you can't see why not fully 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.030
 why register on this 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.859
 computer eats resources then eats 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.480
 fluidity you see my computer is 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.069
 probably slower than in 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.159
 actually I do n't see it when I don't 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.049
 register we have new icons for 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.680
 folders both for normal folders and 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.680
 for those that have elements we say 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.030
 video plus audio video and stuff like that 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.370
 and similar items we have a new icon 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.019
 that appears when we 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.599
 we choose by clicking different on one 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.049
 pinto home folder when 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.120
 we do the folder we have 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.489
 decided to anchor on the home screen 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.980
 will always remain visible no matter 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.720
 how many other folders 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:21.030
 we will open these folders 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.560
 still there will always remain there internet 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:31.159
 explorer has been improved and for 10 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:35.299
 percent of windows 10 tests comes 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:39.000
 a new engine will be introduced 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.799
 new engine called and which I don't 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.409
 you are also because I don't use the internet 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.239
 explorer as you see but chrome however 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.459
 there is an improvement on the internet 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.220
 explorer has also appeared this photo 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.370
 smile that allows you to send feedback 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.280
 about the use of this browser 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.939
 whether the feedback is positive or not 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.870
 negative plus we finally have 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:06.720
 the cover rather we say the support 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.000
 of the mkv format directly is 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.060
 operational without having to resort to codecs 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.440
 external memories 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:18.070
 kv in particular video format that 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.680
 brings so much quality in little space but 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.750
 also asks for a certain setting of 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.910
 codec to be product without 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.540
 problems or without having it for example 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.100
 black screen and the audio that is 7 behind 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.810
 or you wo n't see the videos but 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.600
 you will only hear the audio happened to me 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.940
 several times on windows 7 and I'll do one 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.550
 try predict like on windows 10 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.260
 this functionality has finally been 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.740
 implemented by default 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.660
 let's move on to something else even though I don't think there is 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.970
 be practically annihilated to make you 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.680
 note a new entry in pc 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.440
 settings concerning the file manager 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.500
 as I say that I take the names of 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.190
 storage i suns or rather it shows us the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.470
 our connected drives that they are 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.510
 usable or not 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.889
 how much memory they are using on the 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.240
 total and we can choose the location 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.130
 default for saving 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.640
 our future files but from me 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.830
 remains as disks c or as costs 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.750
 hard disk I don't know if this could be 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.030
 changed to others in computers with andria 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.130
 disk I have two so I should be able to 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.979
 choosing my baby is clearly not so 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.590
 and there is nothing else then I add only that 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.390
 I had a problem with the restart at 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.340
 confirmation of this reasoning 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.850
 build as there is no table that I have 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.310
 had to do a little operation 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:43.040
 surgical with task manager or ctrl 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.920
 alt canc 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.930
 switch boozer and then booted from 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.940
 logon screen 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.760
 apart from this installation then went 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.490
 yes with no problem 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.830
 there was a little re no notification 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.020
 or if the above written text to 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.880
 notification and therefore could not understand 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.520
 what it was but it was a stuff for 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.890
 reactivate essential micro soft security 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.450
 and yes I know I have to see an antivirus 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.730
 but this we're operating I'm using 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.250
 just so as fun sometimes so 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.110
 an antivirus I really would n't be 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.850
 more than that I wanted to add that if 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.280
 I haven't already said it but I think so 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.110
 the performances are however 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.060
 greatly improved we are operating 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.680
 it's faster and less awkward than 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.870
 debunk first two technical previews 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.910
 sign that microsoft is following 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.180
 however, the feedback they receive 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:35.680
 issued through a specific program e 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:40.310
 that now also a sort of variant 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:43.430
 what a meeting I'll show you right away 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.180
 call it accidents, here it is called 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:50.090
 insider 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:52.580
 abb is a hate or better evolution 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.530
 say an expansion of the program 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.920
 initial windows feedback where 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.860
 we can find the announcements news 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:05.090
 which leaves Microsoft among its insiders 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.440
 and of the steps to do to do then 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.080
 to be confirmed 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.570
 through appropriate windows I have already done 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.990
 all so I already gave my ok ho 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:18.140
 also given the opinion on this build 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:20.180
 here if you click appears on 

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:25.100
 I had forgotten this message to no 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:27.380
 to put it because I was still doing it 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.210
 by harvey so i didn't want to 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.090
 see how he behaved and then give 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.650
 the vote sincerely from 5 even more 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.680
 of the other even more than the other 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.870
 technical preview now I don't know if al 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.460
 number pointed out but if you why not 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.640
 I had notification if you want you want to ad 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.980
 be at notification disappears magic for 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.470
 this video and everything we feel for the 

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.480
 indeed you will see me for the next one 

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.400
 review that could be 

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.190
 definitely for the new build of 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.820
 windows 10 then a greeting from fabio e 

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.820
 to the next
