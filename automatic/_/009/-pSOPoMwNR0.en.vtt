00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
got a pretty good first pass for the

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.040 
got a pretty good first pass for the
lip-sync<00:06:15.740> as<00:06:15.890> well<00:06:16.160> so<00:06:16.790> we're<00:06:17.090> almost<00:06:17.330> into

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
lip-sync as well so we're almost into

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.590 
lip-sync as well so we're almost into
the<00:06:18.320> homestretch<00:06:18.710> we<00:06:19.490> still<00:06:19.790> need<00:06:20.000> to<00:06:20.210> work<00:06:20.419> a

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
the homestretch we still need to work a

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.680 
the homestretch we still need to work a
little<00:06:20.750> bit<00:06:20.930> with<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.290> character's<00:06:21.740> head<00:06:21.770> and

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
little bit with the character's head and

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.450 
little bit with the character's head and
probably<00:06:23.690> finesse<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.229> animation<00:06:24.830> just<00:06:25.220> a

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
probably finesse the animation just a

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.940 
probably finesse the animation just a
bit<00:06:25.729> but<00:06:26.510> just<00:06:26.780> remember<00:06:27.229> when<00:06:27.440> you<00:06:27.620> animate

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
bit but just remember when you animate

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.070 
bit but just remember when you animate
dialogue<00:06:28.640> particularly<00:06:29.360> after<00:06:29.690> you've

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
dialogue particularly after you've

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.570 
dialogue particularly after you've
animated<00:06:30.560> the<00:06:30.650> character<00:06:31.100> it's<00:06:31.310> always<00:06:31.550> a

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
animated the character it's always a

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.170 
animated the character it's always a
good<00:06:31.729> idea<00:06:31.820> to<00:06:32.419> create<00:06:33.200> a<00:06:33.500> camera<00:06:34.220> locked<00:06:34.700> to

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
good idea to create a camera locked to

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.080 
good idea to create a camera locked to
the<00:06:35.390> character's<00:06:35.900> head<00:06:36.260> and<00:06:36.669> then<00:06:37.669> just<00:06:37.970> go

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
the character's head and then just go

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.020 
the character's head and then just go
ahead<00:06:38.120> through<00:06:38.870> animate<00:06:39.770> the<00:06:39.950> lip-sync<00:06:40.550> make

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
ahead through animate the lip-sync make

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.380 
ahead through animate the lip-sync make
sure<00:06:41.360> it<00:06:41.660> matches<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:42.800> body<00:06:43.070> in<00:06:43.520> terms<00:06:44.210> of

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
sure it matches the body in terms of

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.050 
sure it matches the body in terms of
where<00:06:44.630> the<00:06:44.900> mouth<00:06:45.320> positions<00:06:45.919> are<00:06:46.130> and<00:06:46.400> then

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
where the mouth positions are and then

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.800 
where the mouth positions are and then
you<00:06:47.210> can<00:06:47.300> go<00:06:47.450> through

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
you can go through

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.100 
you can go through
and<00:06:47.930> do<00:06:48.139> your<00:06:48.350> final<00:06:48.650> pass
