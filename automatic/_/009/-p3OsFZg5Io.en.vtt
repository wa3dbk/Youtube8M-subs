 into the water 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.440
 TransFair printing process 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.249
 You will see 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.539
 how easy it is to create different shapes and shapes 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.539
 Coat surfaces 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.230
 the detector transfer pressure 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.440
 is a versatile and amazingly simple process 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.140
 for forgiveness complex had three-dimensional objects 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.650
 our proven concept innovatively thought-out process steps 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.970
 opens up completely new possibilities for you 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.170
 Experience the pioneering technology 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 a fascinating coating process 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.630
 Expand your work spectrum and use this amazing 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.900
 Technology he will use them for a wide variety of applications 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.900
 flexible and cost-effective to create unique design 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.770
 Refined by the water transfer printing processes become their components to the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.770
 Eye catcher for every viewer 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.110
 dapd which is the component according to material, it is primed first 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.929
 dried 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.929
 and then fled 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.190
 A high-quality base varnish forms the basis for optics colorful 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.190
 Longevity of the decor 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.300
 our wide assortment of different think coach offers them one 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.300
 extensive selection for every taste 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.069
 with the water-soluble side of the film is placed on the water 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.469
 because the film is soaked the prescribed time 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.209
 follows the activation 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.219
 Who activator will solve the rehearsal? I'll do it on film and for the liquid 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.629
 the choir father 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.659
 the previously submitted carrier layer on the underside holds the film 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.679
 together 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.959
 in this depth victories in front 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.090
 The film can then immerse itself perfectly then around the components 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.949
 Put on form and make optimal contact with the base color Steiner 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.969
 for a perfect surface coating 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.039
 ideal is also one 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:55.939
 we guarantee you our full automatic diving with individual 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.939
 adjustable diving speed 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.199
 After diving, you can easily and quickly recover the basin of the lattice 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.569
 clean in which they turn on the water circulation 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.859
 So they have clean water for the next day 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.259
 After dipping, place the component in the borehole 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.509
 fen 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.730
 Dr made of stainless steel mosque visits for it 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.429
 that their components 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.429
 to be cleaned gently 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:46.339
 Finally, a clear intention is applied to the component 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.069
 and gives in the Corvette final still approx
