 beauty here is the game Rodrigo and welcome 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.960
 One more new video today, I 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.210
 I wanted to tell you 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.740
 one more video from the episode series 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.170
 lost 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.869
 the episode of the application today is about 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.609
 mickey mouse and a magic mirror 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.160
 We do not know if this episode is 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.130
 true if there really is 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.719
 really happened on television but the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.570
 story is scary 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.610
 I'll tell you the year it was 1998 he 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.379
 was playing only on a Saturday of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.390
 while my parents are going to do the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.600
 of the month when I came across a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.649
 old cassette box 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.300
 curiously opening the box for 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.910
 find a bunch of old 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.840
 vhs recorded with different programs and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.670
 movies 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.409
 however only the stack tape has 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.920
 some attention because of the face 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.580
 She called me a magic mirror. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.799
 on the cover was mickey mouse with donald 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.450
 goofy and clay 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.159
 there was something different about their 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.710
 cover facial expressions 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.450
 donald had a very depressed look and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.409
 was sitting on the floor holding 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.070
 own legs 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.520
 the athlete was on top of the boat and pitt 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.570
 had a very angry look at the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.030
 fist in the air and 16 to 4 missing pitt 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.100
 was hanging on the outside of the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.650
 boat with both hands on the rails 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.470
 trying to get up and if I was with 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.180
 very depressed look but despite 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.170
 all this and who it was that really calls 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.610
 my attention 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.360
 he was sitting on a pile of 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.240
 Hay to smile and was the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.040
 outside on the back of the hay. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.390
 who was holding a large expense with 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.250
 something taking care of him I was younger as 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.350
 This happened and everything was black and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.469
 white so much ends when the movie then 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.239
 I had no idea what could be 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.340
 I really wanted to watch it then. 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.620
 I closed the box and ran to the basement. 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.200
 I put the cassette tape 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.569
 and it start for about two minutes 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.290
 episode is left with a black screen with 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.720
 sounds and waves rising up is then a 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.580
 picture of me that appears on the screen and I 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.010
 I had never seen those pictures before 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.000
 he was holding his arms in the middle of 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.890
 a skull and crossbones with a 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.870
 smile on face 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.569
 then it disappears and the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.599
 title finally emerged began with 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.569
 a good day with a clay boat being 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.060
 pulled by him to the harbor and boat 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.709
 I was very nervous until it was also current 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.599
 the barn and start yelling at the map 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.670
 has no reason and for simply 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.060
 push out of the way car 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.799
 causing the athlete to fall into the water 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.260
 kisses twists for 12 seconds and shows 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.819
 Goofy running out of the barn 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.849
 only this time when he runs to 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.349
 ba went to grab this script for 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.209
 phones , making it 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.909
 iron pile fell from the roof holding 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.430
 bafo athlete walking up to him the camera 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.680
 included in demonstrating use of potatoes 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.180
 a disturbing expression of hate that 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.239
 I've never seen it before 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.040
 I had never seen him before when he 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.569
 arrives until a lot of iron it stays 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.519
 distressed for a few seconds 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.739
 then a text appears saying 10 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.959
 minutes ago the screen changes to me in 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.389
 a hill with donald looking goofy 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.700
 for the mirror all three are with 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.739
 an expression of fear on their faces and 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.569
 who comes near the mirror and a thunderbolt 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.449
 hit the style watch glass flipping 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.530
 towards the three of them stay to 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:47.190
 behind are good 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.489
 donald start forwarding back 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.019
 to fall into the historic hill again 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.310
 Do you hear a laugh? 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.010
 the screen shows the broken mirror 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.290
 again you see the broken glass 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.040
 they broke the one that broke down on the floor 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.780
 and mirror track strongly black 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.870
 very dark on tape everything came back to 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.060
 normal in that it looks round and goofy 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.459
 going down the mountain then running 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.739
 mick looks back at the mirror but 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.720
 when does the great love and bh 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.269
 pulled in and a few seconds 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.940
 then I got out of there a more macabre version 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.640
 destroyed of Sunday that his clothes more 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.340
 torn and he is almost a beast with eyes 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.480
 of the challenged screen changes 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.520
 to show the athlete 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.140
 he is running down a hill and 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.570
 ends up stumbling on a rock and fell in 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.300
 direction to the city 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.910
 now you see everything cut out and 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.980
 bleeding then it is dragged by 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.290
 Someone but you can not see who it is 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.910
 the scene changes to show the interior of the 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.700
 barn where you can find a mickey 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.990
 macabre the mirror when he jumps in 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.960
 in front of the mirror a bright light 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.610
 reveals a hooded figure was a 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.280
 version one more donald face 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.470
 soon after the version ends of the goofy 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.720
 Mirror Series every day start 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.060
 walk in a circle and it begins to 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.220
 in the spotlight with the few 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.530
 shortly after all you can see are 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.700
 low whispers and step by about 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.490
 five minutes 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.530
 then the screen shows the words 15 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.410
 minutes later and shows the goofy 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.510
 covered by a dripping dark liquid 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.280
 scattered everywhere you endow in 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.070
 a bar with a torch 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.530
 all three way to the middle of the area 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.510
 all look intensely at screen like 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.090
 if they had been watching me and 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.860
 walk on days in my direction 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.140
 while walking their eyes stayed 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.360
 bigger and more penetrating to 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.280
 five claw tips on the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.890
 drop dollars showing only the 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.020
 teeth and lots of foam a buzzing back 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.700
 but this time it was much higher 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.100
 You could see the city burning in the 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.020
 screen background a title was also 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.990
 behind them and there was the name engraved on the 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.750
 book joÃ£o bafo de oz the earth tremble 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.700
 a little until the oa depends on what 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.190
 depends the tombs can flames in a 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.840
 black hand came out from inside I jumped 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.420
 My chair pushes tv out of the 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.060
 cupboard making place arm on the floor and 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.580
 stop if the video with which the character 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.140
 came on the screen but the club was 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.280
 touching my mind at rest that 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.490
 day 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.650
 o All others in the email box 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.870
 everything so that he was not obliged to 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.800
 finish watching those voices 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.960
 tapes 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.940
 the last thing I remember having 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.380
 seen before burning the tapes is the cover 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.630
 of mickey mouse video 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.830
 he was different this time showed 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.110
 a photo of the macabre characters 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.030
 walking toward me 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.740
 you will never forget that your 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.830
 smiles and macabre looking expressions 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.200
 fixedly for me that vision invade 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.620
 Mentions to this day my parents my friends 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.660
 Never 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.460
 he never believed whenever he spoke 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.410
 about my experience for them 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.419
 unfortunately there is no way to prove 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.919
 the opposite but in a way I'm 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.050
 happy that thing is destroyed 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.300
 now 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:57.449
 good guys ended this lost episode 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.770
