have<00:00:20.460> some<00:00:20.640> GPSS<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> button<00:00:21.660> syringe<00:00:22.080> when

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
have some GPSS in a button syringe when

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.939 
have some GPSS in a button syringe when
I<00:00:22.230> press<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.470> button

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
emissive devices but you've probably

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.010 
emissive devices but you've probably
seen<00:01:29.939> them<00:01:30.090> before<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.689> not<00:01:30.840> they're

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
spaceships pretty often then there is

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.710 
spaceships pretty often then there is
that's<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> timer<00:01:41.420> then<00:01:42.420> there's<00:01:42.600> this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
