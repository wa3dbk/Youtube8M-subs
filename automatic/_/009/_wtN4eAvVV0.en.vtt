00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.840
 two 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.840
 ah 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.840
 or the people who said was given the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.710
 opportunity to teach how to make a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.710
 very easy knot 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.730
 since we always have totally 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.730
 untangle the backpack 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.470
 guys this way of keeping the laugh is 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.510
 a very common way very little problems 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.350
 people know how to do it correctly already 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.830
 that many times is too much currency to 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.480
 Sometimes too much is missing, he's always never 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.239
 we are left the way we want 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.500
 a very easy and practical way is the 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.530
 next the two ends of the soybean be 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.070
 I do not know how to speak or half and then not 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.000
 will beat this other bent tip that 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.000
 we will also feed it, that is to say 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 we will have 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.690
 1 2 3 4 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.570
 once this is done, it is released 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.280
 one of the cables 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.390
 yes 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.790
 then until the middle is not down if not 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.260
 we passed the doubles 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.890
 we always talk about him 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.550
 and sensuality the same horse had 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.550
 been previously 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:34.000
 guys for every fold has its leaves 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.000
 It's going to be the same number of months 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.540
 we achieved one more time 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.780
 and he worked more so that he went 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.060
 to waste space 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.500
 and we started like this if we started to roll 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.820
 simple and to the mind 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.820
 we adjust a little 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.790
 party like seeing things exactly the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.020
 amount to be able to roll all the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.240
 eyes once done this for where I am 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.110
 untie they do not have to do is pass 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.110
 by the ears 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.800
 keep in mind that this will depend 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.800
 a lot of activities and sarasola 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.700
