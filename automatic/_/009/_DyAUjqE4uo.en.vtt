them and it was really making the
outside<00:00:42.570> black<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.079> no<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:43.290> could<00:00:43.379> really

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
outside black and no one could really

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.080 
outside black and no one could really
see<00:00:43.829> why<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.100> wasn't<00:00:44.430> gonna<00:00:44.640> make<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> out

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
trying to get my head around that um I

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.740 
trying to get my head around that um I
think<00:05:59.610> this<00:05:59.730> card<00:05:59.970> is<00:06:00.090> going<00:06:00.240> to<00:06:00.330> be<00:06:00.420> played

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
think this card is going to be played

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.340 
think this card is going to be played
during<00:06:01.050> your<00:06:01.860> main<00:06:01.980> phase<00:06:02.160> one<00:06:02.460> I<00:06:03.390> think

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
during your main phase one I think

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.680 
during your main phase one I think
that's<00:06:04.500> it<00:06:04.650> I'd<00:06:05.250> I<00:06:05.280> think<00:06:05.730> it<00:06:05.850> will<00:06:06.240> only<00:06:06.360> last

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
that's it I'd I think it will only last

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.450 
that's it I'd I think it will only last
for<00:06:06.810> that<00:06:07.020> turn<00:06:07.320> then<00:06:07.950> if<00:06:08.070> you<00:06:08.130> control<00:06:08.400> a

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
for that turn then if you control a

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.190 
for that turn then if you control a
beast<00:06:08.700> warrior<00:06:08.880> type<00:06:09.120> Boojum<00:06:09.480> on<00:06:09.630> stamp<00:06:09.960> and

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
beast warrior type Boojum on stamp and

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.470 
beast warrior type Boojum on stamp and
your<00:06:10.590> opponent<00:06:11.010> controls<00:06:11.310> and<00:06:12.090> your

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
your opponent controls and your

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.450 
your opponent controls and your
opponent's<00:06:12.840> monsters<00:06:13.260> are<00:06:13.770> more<00:06:14.070> than<00:06:14.220> your

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
opponent's monsters are more than your

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.370 
opponent's monsters are more than your
monsters<00:06:14.940> the<00:06:15.330> neither<00:06:15.570> player<00:06:15.840> can<00:06:15.990> use

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
monsters the neither player can use

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.000 
monsters the neither player can use
spell<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.040> trap<00:06:17.130> cards<00:06:17.670> into<00:06:18.170> the<00:06:19.170> interior

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
spell and trap cards into the interior

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.560 
spell and trap cards into the interior
opponents<00:06:20.640> next<00:06:21.000> end<00:06:21.150> face<00:06:21.570> so<00:06:22.440> i<00:06:23.150> think<00:06:24.150> that

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
opponents next end face so i think that

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.190 
opponents next end face so i think that
means<00:06:25.400> you<00:06:26.400> can<00:06:26.610> then<00:06:26.760> someone<00:06:27.180> more<00:06:27.390> Boojum

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
means you can then someone more Boojum

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.600 
means you can then someone more Boojum
bees<00:06:28.380> warrior-type<00:06:28.710> monsters<00:06:29.190> or<00:06:29.310> whatever

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
bees warrior-type monsters or whatever

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.600 
bees warrior-type monsters or whatever
afterwards<00:06:30.410> swarm<00:06:31.410> the<00:06:31.560> field<00:06:31.770> going<00:06:32.400> for<00:06:32.580> a

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
afterwards swarm the field going for a

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.280 
afterwards swarm the field going for a
tax<00:06:32.880> and<00:06:33.210> not<00:06:33.390> having<00:06:33.570> to<00:06:33.750> worry<00:06:33.810> about<00:06:33.990> your

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
tax and not having to worry about your

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.170 
tax and not having to worry about your
point<00:06:34.470> of<00:06:34.560> spell<00:06:34.740> trap<00:06:34.980> card<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:35.460> think<00:06:36.030> that's

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
point of spell trap card I think that's

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.700 
point of spell trap card I think that's
what<00:06:36.390> it's<00:06:36.510> getting<00:06:36.690> at<00:06:36.900> because<00:06:37.350> there<00:06:37.560> are

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
what it's getting at because there are

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.440 
what it's getting at because there are
many<00:06:37.920> spell<00:06:38.160> and<00:06:38.280> trap<00:06:38.370> cards<00:06:38.790> in<00:06:38.910> the<00:06:39.090> bujin

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
many spell and trap cards in the bujin

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.399 
many spell and trap cards in the bujin
thing<00:06:39.690> that<00:06:39.840> I<00:06:39.870> really<00:06:40.110> gonna

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
thing that I really gonna

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:42.739 
thing that I really gonna
play<00:06:40.589> all<00:06:40.769> of<00:06:40.919> this<00:06:41.069> one<00:06:41.369> but<00:06:41.729> you<00:06:42.599> can

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:42.749 
play all of this one but you can

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:44.719 
play all of this one but you can
possibly<00:06:42.869> play<00:06:43.319> that<00:06:43.529> beforehand<00:06:44.249> before<00:06:44.399> you

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
possibly play that beforehand before you

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:46.669 
possibly play that beforehand before you
play<00:06:44.969> this<00:06:45.179> and<00:06:45.389> go<00:06:45.449> into<00:06:45.599> an<00:06:45.809> XYZ<00:06:46.139> like<00:06:46.469> that

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:46.679 
play this and go into an XYZ like that

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:48.679 
play this and go into an XYZ like that
but<00:06:47.489> I<00:06:47.550> think<00:06:47.610> that's<00:06:47.909> what<00:06:48.059> this<00:06:48.149> card<00:06:48.389> going

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:48.689 
but I think that's what this card going

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:51.259 
but I think that's what this card going
out<00:06:48.839> I<00:06:49.080> don't<00:06:49.979> see<00:06:50.279> it<00:06:50.309> get<00:06:50.550> much<00:06:50.729> play<00:06:50.969> if<00:06:51.149> I'm

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:51.269 
out I don't see it get much play if I'm

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:53.269 
out I don't see it get much play if I'm
honest<00:06:51.599> it<00:06:51.809> just<00:06:52.080> doesn't<00:06:52.619> seem<00:06:52.830> like<00:06:53.069> the

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:53.279 
honest it just doesn't seem like the

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.649 
honest it just doesn't seem like the
type<00:06:53.459> of<00:06:53.489> card<00:06:53.819> that's<00:06:53.969> going<00:06:54.149> to<00:06:54.239> get<00:06:54.389> much

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:54.659 
type of card that's going to get much

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:57.259 
type of card that's going to get much
play<00:06:54.899> I<00:06:54.929> think<00:06:55.219> maybe<00:06:56.219> you'll<00:06:56.550> run<00:06:56.909> one<00:06:57.149> of

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:57.269 
play I think maybe you'll run one of

00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:00.139 
play I think maybe you'll run one of
them<00:06:57.389> and<00:06:57.599> if<00:06:58.589> you<00:06:59.099> need<00:06:59.369> to<00:06:59.580> run<00:06:59.759> it<00:06:59.879> your
