00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 welcome dear comrades i'm paulina you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.270
 guide on carbines for the middle distance 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.069
 battlefield 4 carbine enough 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.929
 interesting class gunsmiths assault 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.090
 rifles for rogue and eat like 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.230
 at least three carbines which excel in 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.570
 this is more than the rest 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.460
 you burst subclass wanna be like 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.230
 attack aircraft and if to express more 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.960
 objectively carbines for medium 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.400
 distances first will 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 ak-12 which many label 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.160
 warrant karabiner which kills everything and everyone 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.529
 at any distance it is not so yes about 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.210
 12 there is a magic switch button 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.940
 its in cut-off mode by three 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.100
 patron and at the same time he starts to beat as much 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.440
 750 shots per minute but here I want 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.770
 say what is the actual rate of fire 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.140
 it's about 600 80 shots a minute before we 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.629
 we shoot a little more precisely we press on the mouse a little 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.140
 more often but whether all this is relevant 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.260
 after listening to the guide to the end you will understand why 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.110
 specifications 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.270
 yes nothing special deck we have them 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.370
 strong srednichok catching only 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.070
 lowest in class horizontal 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.539
 recoil tactics but actual 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.549
 rate of fire allows us to be in 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.330
 thicker events but better stay away 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.280
 so it will be better module 1 faucet lens 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 for two cats on the trunk of nothing 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.799
 or flame arrester curve or short 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.020
 handle recoil around 12 good can 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.970
 say low unnecessary and spoil everything 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.979
 there will be a good golden curve 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.080
 lived for those who like to shoot bursts 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.000
 well, or put a short if you do not 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.220
 bang lover 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.909
 Now consider the next device type 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.310
 95b and this bad thing there is nothing 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.060
 good if you for some reason with 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.610
 run him 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.320
 and getting pleasure from it means 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.790
 are you either a chinese representative 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.700
 either the communist party or you 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.149
 Strange enough fetish reinforcements 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.490
 my very characteristics from good 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.369
 t95 divided to 12 lowest 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.850
 horizontal return and now from 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.770
 bad lowest rate of fire 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.930
 the longest recharge in class is 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.899
 long tactical classroom recharge and 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.700
 bad accuracy if beat automatic 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.740
 fire it will be possible to nerve square 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.759
 disorder and deterioration 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.549
 accuracy so run the fire devils 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.709
 tactic simple run out merchants in the name of 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.720
 your stats run don't need to be in 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.120
 the epicenter of events is not always your skill 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.480
 will pull you up to be neat 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.319
 you will be happy modules sight in 1 degree 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.000
 Lens two acres is on the table or anything 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.400
 flame arrester and posts short handle 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.650
 I explain nothing on the table simply because 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.810
 that the recoil performance is satisfactory 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.569
 and if you opened the flame arrester not 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.030
 feel free to leave it short 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.109
 the hilt will give a bonus of accuracy which 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.280
 we need fields 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:48.590
 Well, the third barrel will be the same m4 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.989
 which only makes sput but make 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.840
 off at 800 shots per minute 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.030
 that's equivalent to 730 and shot minute 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.220
 auto mode with speed 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.560
 not a hole you can give solid and on 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.870
 close distances and about on average so far 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.790
 your mouse will not die but not from the pros 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.040
 only good rate of fire but also 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.590
 almost the highest bullet speed almost 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.810
 highest tactical recharge and 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.870
 the fastest recharge in class minus 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.639
 and cons is recoil and horizontal and 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.120
 vertical and recoil first shot 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:22.370
 They would throw a terrible chair in different 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.340
 parties if we were not limited 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.609
 firing cutoff on three rounds therefore 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.139
 all this is critical enemy tactics can 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.389
 keep at medium distances 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.579
 and it is possible and in the near if you have 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.579
 corresponding skill but if it is not 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.769
 know something you know that give up m4 or 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.980
 through the blood sweat and tears build up 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.260
 skill modules of sight awards a certain lens 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.379
 for 2 moles put a compensator on the table 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.239
 I explain the curved handle to 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.310
 the table does not brake on the sides after each 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.930
 queue put compensator and curve 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.540
 the hilt will save you from strong recoil 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.669
 up after the first shot and since 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.780
 we shoot bursts first shot at 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:04.699
 we will be every 2 conclusion I want 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.609
 explain why ak-12 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:10.849
 and type 95 I called not the best 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:14.840
 Basque arms m4a are simple 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:17.000
 when we run every 12 birds 95 you 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.729
 pulls your skill Skill games 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.400
 when he is so much km-4 your skill grows and 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.910
 you pass some test sometimes 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.950
 difficulties may arise 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.960
 and why do they not overcome a 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.510
 when we overcome all difficulties we 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.730
 we get great still a with great 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.910
 skill comes great value 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.910
 kills with you was paul he's the end of communication
