here today to talk to you about the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.549 
here today to talk to you about the
environment<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.540> environment<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.380> an

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
environment the environment is an

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.049 
environment the environment is an
important<00:00:14.040> thing<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.490> need<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.880> preserve

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
important thing that we need to preserve

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.050 
important thing that we need to preserve
if<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:16.109> are<00:00:16.260> careful<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.400> destroy<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
if we are careful we can destroy the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.529 
if we are careful we can destroy the
environment<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:19.310> that<00:00:20.310> happens<00:00:20.820> then<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
environment and that happens then the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.540 
environment and that happens then the
polar<00:00:21.810> bears<00:00:22.109> won't<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.560> any<00:00:22.769> place<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.369> live

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
polar bears won't have any place to live

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.210 
polar bears won't have any place to live
and<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.779> happens<00:00:25.199> then<00:00:25.650> all<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.039> zoos

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
and if that happens then all the zoos

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.580 
and if that happens then all the zoos
will<00:00:26.490> become<00:00:26.699> approximately<00:00:27.390> 25%<00:00:28.170> more

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
will become approximately 25% more

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.410 
will become approximately 25% more
boring<00:00:29.039> because<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:29.789> will<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:29.939> no<00:00:30.210> more

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
boring because there will be no more

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.780 
boring because there will be no more
polar<00:00:30.750> bears<00:00:31.080> because<00:00:31.710> everybody<00:00:32.309> knows<00:00:32.520> when
