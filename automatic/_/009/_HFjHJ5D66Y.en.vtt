00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.160 
type of music to play with overall the
concept<00:02:07.159> seems<00:02:07.490> like<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:07.790> unique<00:02:08.149> idea<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:09.049> the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
concept seems like a unique idea but the

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.080 
concept seems like a unique idea but the
apps<00:02:09.319> themselves<00:02:09.530> which<00:02:10.280> are<00:02:10.459> ultimately<00:02:10.880> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
apps themselves which are ultimately the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.240 
apps themselves which are ultimately the
main<00:02:11.239> feature<00:02:11.510> here<00:02:11.870> aren't<00:02:12.530> as<00:02:12.709> engaging<00:02:13.130> as

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
main feature here aren't as engaging as

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.340 
main feature here aren't as engaging as
we<00:02:13.550> would<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:13.790> hoped

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
we would have hoped

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.310 
we would have hoped
the<00:02:14.740> content<00:02:15.130> is<00:02:15.220> short<00:02:15.520> for<00:02:15.730> younger<00:02:16.330> kids<00:02:16.450> so

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
the content is short for younger kids so

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.200 
the content is short for younger kids so
it<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.590> simple<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.070> engaging<00:02:18.400> but<00:02:18.970> we<00:02:19.060> think

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
it is simple and engaging but we think

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.240 
it is simple and engaging but we think
older<00:02:19.570> children<00:02:19.900> will<00:02:20.140> tire<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.800> content

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
older children will tire of the content

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.520 
older children will tire of the content
quickly<00:02:21.490> in<00:02:21.850> addition<00:02:22.480> each<00:02:22.870> game<00:02:23.140> requires

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.350 
quickly in addition each game requires
you<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.860> download<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.280> different<00:02:24.550> app<00:02:24.850> which

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
you to download a different app which

you to download a different app which

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340
