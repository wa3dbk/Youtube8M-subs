00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.990
 hi how about i am triforce and here to 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.639
 continuation will be very brief with 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.430
 this video I just want them 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.290
 demonstrate the speed of the ett he will be 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.990
 who in the city of mexico am here 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.770
 in the warrior colony and we're going to do 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.870
 tests with a nexus 4 that we have here 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.530
 and we have here also a samsung galaxy 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.529
 s3 a model 747 that is the one that is 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.719
 compatible with telcel with the lte network 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.480
 telcel and they will be able to find more or 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.070
 less in about two weeks already in the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.870
 telcel customer service center no 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.120
 I have the least idea of ​​the price I think 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.640
 that beyond will cost between 10 11 thousand 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.530
 weights and it is assumed that the nexus is also 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.999
 will reach Mexico at the end of the year by 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.480
 there for Christmas a little after 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:52.539
 Christmas 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.249
 there is no idea of ​​the price but good 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.039
 does this team remember that it sells 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:59.829
 as a team that is not lte but without 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.140
 But here with a hidden menu you can 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.239
 activate and it works at 100% and at 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.640
 perfection without any problem 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.990
 with the lte network of the set then as not 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.430
 I love myself I do not want to expand here 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.250
 a lot in this video is just a 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.990
 demonstration of both teams 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.070
 I will quickly open the applications 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.070
 in each of the two 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.280
 there's how you can quickly see the two 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.030
 they say it and I went up with that they have in 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.830
 the 4g network you find the 4g network then 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.590
 let's open here the speed this we are going to 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.480
 see here also the spirit est we are going to 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.970
 start tests these for example is 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.200
 the screen that inhabits 63 megabytes of 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.550
 lower the nexus 4 by 21.94 of his life and 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.930
 here I had neither the galaxy s3 44 x 26 and its 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.930
 life every now again 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.640
 46 are lowered in nexuses 4 against 38 in 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.950
 The Samsung Galaxy S3 against 12 of its 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.950
 life and here against 15 do it again 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.090
 remaining as you can actually see the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.110
 they say that the nexus 4 does not 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.700
 has the amplifiers say 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.220
 needed the necessary antenna blah blah 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.690
 blah blah rolls so blown by the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.420
 style but they really see that it's not 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.160
 true here it works totally that what 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.330
 are checking is not connected to 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.730
 know a wifi network 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.980
 We fight forgiveness both are connected to 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.840
 the network the third as I'm just going to 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.030
 check the good ones entering the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.010
 options on both phones about the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.100
 device been here equal to settings 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.980
 about the device and state 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.290
 there's how you can see both connected to 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.830
 the network lte of the electric saying 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.600
 fake and steele 13 the number that says there 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.100
 I usually have no idea what it means 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.310
 but well they are connected to the 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.210
 network here the power shows less 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.220
 69 and here minus 74 but quickly 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.140
 let's do another test simply 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.750
 for 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.980
 demonstrated again in the variety by 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.230
 how can you see the speed pretty 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.200
 stable is supposed to be this place where 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.819
 I'm not officially covered but 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.219
 well 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.319
 and that proves I went outside I 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:31.810
 I'm going to walk several blocks even 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.249
 several kilometers around and continues 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.719
 with 4g coverage then well if 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.870
 you have the opportunity to acquire a 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:44.290
 check a 6.0 chip that is basically 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.280
 this hopefully they know here is good 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.710
 the new version 6.0 that is for teams 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.720
 exclusive for equipment lte 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.540
 you can here the center of attention to 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.120
 client this is the really is a little 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.910
 complicated the truth is a bit 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.230
 complicated that they come to you this 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.230
 chip as 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.379
 since telcel is how can you say 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.659
 how are you being very fussy about 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.549
 his with his new network and nothing else wants 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.880
 occupy it with equipment purchased with 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.780
 them but well then there 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.150
 fortunately I found a 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:26.960
 executive not very clown not very 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.960
 not very suck to me he made the change of 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.320
 chip that had previous 5.0 to this chip 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.190
 lte fast to show there so that the 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.190
 focus the camera 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:43.800
 there you can see it says there lte del 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.810
 pse and version 6.0 then machine will 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.139
 I say this because many think that 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.229
 magic art by putting a chip 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:56.250
 these to your galaxy nexus to your motorola 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.840
 droid will be your xperia that galaxy note a 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.759
 new balance think that it is already going to 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.770
 turn on your computer in lte is 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:05.220
 totally false is totally a lie 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.349
 it has to be an exclusive model with 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.849
 capabilities in this case as you can see 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:16.139
 this galaxy s3 is not a and 9.300 is a 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:19.650
 model and clearly says there and 747 there 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.960
 they are seeing it and then the nexus 41 is 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.750
 come in Mexico as I tell you nothing more 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.360
 because supposedly nothing else is 3g but 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.360
 thankfully you can activate your here 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.250
 chip on its internal chip release the lt and 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.289
 works perfectly as you can see 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.869
 how he had seen here 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.809
 without any type of programs quickly 

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:42.419
 I want to make a comparison with a 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:44.099
 network with a 3g team to see the 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.680
 It differs a lot from being good and what is 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:49.080
 the difference as it is the difference to 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.089
 that they are going to see him make team 3g a 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.819
 lesson or two equal connected from the sel 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:55.499
 but running on the 3g network to the truth 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.169
 there it is in final wii 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:06:00.809
 base that I finish I do not know why activate the 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.229
 wifi but as you can see even in 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:06.400
 wifi is less the connection to the 4g I'm 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.440
 deactivating 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.270
 once it connects to the network there is 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.270
 now it is already in 3g 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.830
 and the average speed really does not 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:24.680
 spend 8 mb are watching it 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:27.259
 castilla 9 towards passed 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.910
 so it's a miracle this kind of 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.969
 connection under three good examples here 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.279
 is working 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.529
 the rise but it really is very little 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:37.569
 goes from 1.5 something a lot has reached 2 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.869
 megas the discharge high yes it is enough 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:42.789
 good 9.40 but on average really not 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:45.219
 I'm going to cheat you on average 5 or 6 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.179
 no more of that, because right now 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:49.179
 can yes that is very well the 

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:53.039
 3g connection and here have comparison with 

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:56.199
 the 4g are 56 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:07:00.169
 Quickly back as you can go 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:02.599
 pretty constant pretty good 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.330
 and that would practically be everything 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:08.779
 then this was the nexus 4 samsung 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.370
 galaxy s3 lte trampously mexico but 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:12.620
 Well, the two three will soon arrive 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.289
 Weeks this supposedly also goes 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.909
 to arrive after Christmas hopefully in 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.770
 When you hear about the cost of 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:22.039
 availability and so as the step 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.139
 at cost and it would be everything 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:27.169
 I am triforce this video is for 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:29.820
 android mx dot net and see you up 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.820
 the next 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.529
 yes 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.039
 do not 

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:36.039
 ah
