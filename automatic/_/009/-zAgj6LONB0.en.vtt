00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello to you, life hacking channel . not 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.120
 and today we will deal with you 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.830
 phone firmware sony xperia sola 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.630
 he's called sony xperia t 27th 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.640
 his problem is banal to you now 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.380
 I will try to demonstrate at 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.710
 turning on it hangs on the screen saver 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.880
 and actually this procedure is repeated 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.430
 to infinity 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.099
 just want to talk about what 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.840
 there are pictures of them this phone who is on you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.759
 hanging and nothing can be done 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.800
 because the battery is whether 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.280
 removable then it turns off such 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.010
 key combinations press the key 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.219
 power and hold down the volume key 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.219
 up 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:55.700
 This combination turns off our phone and 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.710
 after which we will start the firmware so 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.910
 first you need to download the driver 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.970
 under flashtool 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.010
 as well as the flash drive itself for your slim 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.650
 the system in this case is windows and 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.530
 firmware itself 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.630
 we unpack archive driver's USB stick 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.570
 I personally unpacked it to my discipline. 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.520
 delicious burma chair and run 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.560
 depending on your digit capacity 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.250
 I have an operating system 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.410
 windows 7 32-bit and I run 32-bit 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.619
 installer release mode 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.619

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.649

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.350

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.869
 either windows vista but we will now 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.970
 run in compatibility mode with 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.350
 some benefits are not 3 stand bait and also 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.420

 stopping repeatedly will pop up 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.319
 Different frame can say because I 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.119
