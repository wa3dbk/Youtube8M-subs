00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.670
 I bring you how to record for example 7 GB 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.740
 in a split 4.7 gigabytes is very 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.049
 easy and effective what they have to do 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.420
 is to download a program called from 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.240
 amón tools mit this program serves to 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.890
 mount virtual units the link of the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.769
 program I will leave them in the description 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.140
 of the video once they have the program 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.449
 on your pc they will go to the right show 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.179
 Hidden icons and the icon will appear 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.130
 of amón tools lippe if it does not appear 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.140
 they will have to start the program again 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.329
 and when the window comes out they go to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 general options and check the box 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.320
 use general agent in the area of 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.570
 notification 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.600
 they will right click on the icon 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.950
 dt virtual devices but without 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.210
 disk 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.210
 mount image 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.370
 here look for the image of the game that they are going to 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.430
 record in the divide if you want to record 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.460
 a video movie or those things does not 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.650
 missing that they do this in my case I'm going to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.860
 record a game the 'assassin's creed' 2 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.860
 they put it open and the image will be mounted 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.119
 well now do not do anything close the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.340
 picture if something comes up and that now 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.040
 they have to download the latest program 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.930
 this will be the basic the engine of all the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.240
 that will do all the work to record at 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.130
 split the melbourne in rome 12 les 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.330
 I will leave the link in the description of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.340
 video to download it 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.340
 already having the program open it 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.540
 once opened we will have several 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.450
 options for dvd cd blu ray in my case 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.970
 it's green tea we'll also have several 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.640
 options for copies recording videos 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.000
 music etcetera but I will select the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.330
 first dvd-rom of efe to record my 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.330
 game 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.150
 in multi session we will check the box 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.629
 without multi session but disagree is 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.629
 possible 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.660
 now we will go to 0 discs go 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.200
 check the box activate uned or 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.200
 shoot 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.590
 now they mark activate smart fit and once 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.590
 done that they give it to new 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.210
 you will see this on the right you can 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.050
 see the iso image that I have mounted with 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.050
 gray tools gray 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.709
 and as you can see it weighs 6.34 gigabytes and what 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.709
 DVD recording is 4.7 gigabytes 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.600
 they open it by double clicking 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.400
 when all the files come out 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.600
 they select everyone and drag them 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.600
 until the blank part 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.780
 here it will begin to process and it will start 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.239
 to divide the iso in the bottom to 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.370
 the left will tell you when you 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.650
 need for recording in my case 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.379
 they are two but one appears to me because 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.540
 has to finish processing in the 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.920
 another part that I forgot to tell you 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.410
 they have to select must of 54.7 gb 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.920
 before doing the procedure like this 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.110
 divided into pure pieces of 4.7 gigabytes 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.860
 well I'll cut the video and follow it 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.080
 when it is finished processing 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.180
 good has already finished processing and 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.090
 we have everything ready to start 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.800
 Record 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.680
 how they see busy duties 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.680
 well now if you get to record now 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.410
 now they go to configuration 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.650
 in recording speed they choose the 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.570
 minimum they have if they choose the maximum 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.850
 throw reading errors when putting the 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.720
 dvd and not serve anything that's why it 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.540
 recommended 4x to 6x I tried with 8 x and I 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.630
 worked well do not go over 8 x if 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.970
 It can be 4x or less better if they want 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.020
 they also have more options to put 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.000
 names date and ready so give 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.730
 to record I will not do it because I do not have 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.980
 duties the last ones he spent recording 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.550
 this same game last night that's why I give it 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.550
 cancel 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.010
 well now I will explain to you put in 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.440
 record and start recording you do not 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.630
 touch nothing until they ask for the DVD 2 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.880
 when I ask them that, it will open to the 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.890
 record company remove the DVD but not what 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.500
 they can let it cool a minute 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.690
 when they have removed that DVD they close it 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.970
 the label put the second dvd and 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.130

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.440
