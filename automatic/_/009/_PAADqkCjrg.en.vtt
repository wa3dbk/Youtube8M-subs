just<00:01:30.079> like<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.409> oops<00:01:30.679> like<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.670> last<00:01:32.329> step

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:32.599 
just like that oops like that last step

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:35.199 
just like that oops like that last step
we<00:01:33.349> put<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.799> stitch<00:01:34.069> back<00:01:34.459> on<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.849> left-hand

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
we put the stitch back on the left-hand

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.330 
we put the stitch back on the left-hand
needle<00:01:35.349> well<00:01:36.349> that<00:01:36.649> was<00:01:36.740> almost<00:01:36.889> lost<00:01:37.189> up

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
needle well that was almost lost up

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.580 
needle well that was almost lost up
here's<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.639> last<00:01:37.789> step<00:01:37.999> is<00:01:38.240> turning<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.560> that

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
here's the last step is turning so that

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.529 
here's the last step is turning so that
was<00:01:39.859> the<00:01:40.009> wrap<00:01:40.189> this<00:01:40.759> is<00:01:40.969> the<00:01:41.090> turn<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:41.450> you

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
was the wrap this is the turn and you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.929 
was the wrap this is the turn and you
can<00:01:41.689> see<00:01:41.929> that<00:01:42.499> we've<00:01:42.679> used<00:01:42.950> our<00:01:43.159> yarn<00:01:43.429> to<00:01:43.700> sort

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
can see that we've used our yarn to sort

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.550 
can see that we've used our yarn to sort
of<00:01:43.999> secure<00:01:44.719> these<00:01:44.899> two<00:01:45.109> stitches<00:01:45.439> together

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
of secure these two stitches together

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.999 
of secure these two stitches together
even<00:01:45.979> though<00:01:46.039> we<00:01:46.130> turned<00:01:46.340> around<00:01:46.459> right<00:01:46.819> here

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
even though we turned around right here

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.469 
even though we turned around right here
so<00:01:49.009> what<00:01:49.609> does<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.819> look<00:01:49.909> like<00:01:49.969> when<00:01:50.270> we<00:01:50.329> need

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
so what does it look like when we need

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.690 
so what does it look like when we need
to<00:01:50.599> wrap<00:01:50.749> and<00:01:50.959> turn<00:01:51.079> on<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.319> purl<00:01:51.560> side<00:01:51.859> let's

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
to wrap and turn on the purl side let's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.239 
to wrap and turn on the purl side let's
go<00:01:52.969> find<00:01:53.299> out<00:01:53.479> we<00:01:53.929> use<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.229> same<00:01:54.469> sequence<00:01:55.039> so

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
go find out we use the same sequence so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.309 
go find out we use the same sequence so
I'm<00:01:55.490> just<00:01:55.609> going<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.789> purl<00:01:56.090> over<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.109> last

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
I'm just going to purl over to the last

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:09.210 
I'm just going to purl over to the last
two<00:01:57.529> stitches

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.339 

okay<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.390> there<00:02:11.510> were<00:02:11.599> four<00:02:11.840> steps<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.260> we

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
okay so there were four steps that we

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.080 
okay so there were four steps that we
did<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:13.489> first<00:02:13.760> one<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.230> slip<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.410> stitch

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
did the first one is slip the stitch

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.220 
did the first one is slip the stitch
from<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.120> left<00:02:17.360> needle<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.900> right<00:02:17.989> needle

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
from the left needle to the right needle

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.850 
from the left needle to the right needle
like<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.360> next<00:02:20.360> move<00:02:20.930> your<00:02:21.080> yarn<00:02:21.230> from<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
like that next move your yarn from the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.449 
like that next move your yarn from the
opposite<00:02:22.220> side<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.060> let's<00:02:23.690> see<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:25.190> shouldn't

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
opposite side so let's see it shouldn't

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.680 
opposite side so let's see it shouldn't
have<00:02:25.550> been<00:02:25.610> in<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.790> back<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.090> was<00:02:26.239> purling<00:02:26.540> okay

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
have been in the back I was purling okay

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.670 
have been in the back I was purling okay
it<00:02:26.750> needs<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.989> stay<00:02:27.170> in<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.349> front

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
it needs to stay in the front

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.490 
it needs to stay in the front
alright<00:02:28.610> slip<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.150> stitch<00:02:29.390> move<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.200> yarn<00:02:30.319> to

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
alright slip the stitch move the yarn to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.190 
alright slip the stitch move the yarn to
the<00:02:30.650> opposite<00:02:31.099> side<00:02:31.310> just<00:02:32.180> like<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.540> put<00:02:33.049> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
the opposite side just like that put the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.339 
the opposite side just like that put the
stitch<00:02:33.410> back<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.720> turn<00:02:35.720> your<00:02:35.900> work<00:02:35.930> around

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349

needle<00:03:25.989> move<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.139> yarn<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.530> other<00:03:27.680> side

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
needle move the yarn to the other side

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.740 
needle move the yarn to the other side
of<00:03:28.010> your<00:03:28.100> work<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:28.790> from<00:03:29.030> back<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.239> front<00:03:29.510> in

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
this case put the stitch back like that

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.220 
this case put the stitch back like that
now<00:03:34.310> turn<00:03:34.609> your<00:03:34.730> work<00:03:34.880> around<00:03:35.139> it's<00:03:36.139> really

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
that simple there we go let's go again

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.039 
that simple there we go let's go again
on<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.100> pro<00:03:40.280> side<00:03:40.489> now<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.090> need<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.900> move<00:03:41.989> my

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
on the pro side now I need to move my

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.360 
on the pro side now I need to move my
yarn<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.470> front<00:03:42.530> because<00:03:42.889> I'm<00:03:42.980> purling

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
yarn to the front because I'm purling

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.099 
yarn to the front because I'm purling
okay<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:44.019> so<00:03:45.019> will<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.319> if<00:03:45.349> you're<00:03:45.650> purling

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
okay and so will you if you're purling

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.509 
okay and so will you if you're purling
okay<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.410> you<00:03:48.739> can<00:03:48.889> see<00:03:49.069> these<00:03:49.190> rows<00:03:49.489> are

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
okay and you can see these rows are

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.099 
okay and you can see these rows are
going<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.790> go<00:03:49.910> faster<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:50.389> faster<00:03:50.540> as<00:03:50.810> we<00:03:50.959> have

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
going to go faster and faster as we have

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.020 
going to go faster and faster as we have
fewer<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:51.980> fewer<00:03:52.069> stitches<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.670> knit<00:03:52.700> which

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
fewer and fewer stitches to knit which

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.970 
fewer and fewer stitches to knit which
is<00:03:53.150> always<00:03:53.329> fun<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:54.230> nice<00:03:54.380> thing<00:03:54.560> about<00:03:54.620> short

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
is always fun the nice thing about short

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.330 
is always fun the nice thing about short
rows<00:03:55.540> okay<00:03:56.540> wrap<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.959> turn<00:03:57.170> yarn<00:03:57.950> stays<00:03:58.190> in

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
rows okay wrap and turn yarn stays in

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.819 
rows okay wrap and turn yarn stays in
the<00:03:58.400> front<00:03:58.579> for<00:03:58.730> now<00:04:00.609> transfer<00:04:01.609> that<00:04:01.730> stitch

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
the front for now transfer that stitch

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.039 
the front for now transfer that stitch
move<00:04:03.829> you're<00:04:03.980> on<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.220> other<00:04:04.340> side

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
move you're on to the other side

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.460 
move you're on to the other side
transfer<00:04:06.049> it<00:04:06.139> back<00:04:06.349> and<00:04:06.669> turn<00:04:07.669> around<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:09.380> I

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
transfer it back and turn around and I

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.600 
transfer it back and turn around and I
have<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.620> move<00:04:09.739> on<00:04:09.889> to<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.190> back<00:04:10.310> because<00:04:10.489> I'm

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
have to move on to the back because I'm

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.600 
have to move on to the back because I'm
knitting<00:04:11.709> so<00:04:12.709> basically<00:04:13.250> what<00:04:13.459> we've<00:04:13.579> just

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
knitting so basically what we've just

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.790 
knitting so basically what we've just
done

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
done

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.430 
done
is<00:04:15.100> we've<00:04:15.430> knitted<00:04:15.850> about<00:04:16.360> four<00:04:16.870> more<00:04:17.140> rows

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
is we've knitted about four more rows

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.979 
is we've knitted about four more rows
here<00:04:17.769> in<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.040> middle<00:04:18.340> there<00:04:19.239> on<00:04:19.450> either<00:04:19.600> side

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
here in the middle there on either side

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.320 
here in the middle there on either side
you<00:04:20.290> can<00:04:21.070> see<00:04:21.250> how<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.430> knitting<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:22.000> shorter

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
you can see how the knitting is shorter

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.600 
you can see how the knitting is shorter
over<00:04:22.540> here<00:04:22.780> than<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.560> is<00:04:23.680> right<00:04:23.830> here<00:04:24.010> that's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
over here than it is right here that's

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.100 
over here than it is right here that's
because<00:04:24.730> we<00:04:24.910> kept<00:04:25.180> on<00:04:25.360> knitting<00:04:25.720> we<00:04:25.810> knitted

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
because we kept on knitting we knitted

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.240 
because we kept on knitting we knitted
and<00:04:26.230> turned<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:26.560> knitted<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:26.890> turn<00:04:27.070> like

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
and turned and knitted and turn like

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.670 
and turned and knitted and turn like
that<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:27.970> it's<00:04:28.120> taller<00:04:28.480> right<00:04:28.750> there<00:04:28.990> so<00:04:29.650> let's

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
that so it's taller right there so let's

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.320 
that so it's taller right there so let's
just<00:04:29.950> picture<00:04:30.400> this<00:04:30.520> rim<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.030> can<00:04:31.150> see<00:04:31.270> it

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
just picture this rim and you can see it

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.520 
just picture this rim and you can see it
was<00:04:31.450> starting<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.720> get<00:04:31.840> like<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.020> little<00:04:32.140> cup

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
was starting to get like a little cup

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.500 
was starting to get like a little cup
there<00:04:32.830> if<00:04:33.010> we<00:04:33.610> were<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:33.820> keep<00:04:33.970> going<00:04:34.180> or

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
there if we were to keep going or

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.760 
there if we were to keep going or
there's<00:04:34.720> not<00:04:34.840> much<00:04:34.990> rather<00:04:35.170> to<00:04:35.350> go<00:04:35.500> but<00:04:35.680> we

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
there's not much rather to go but we

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.080 
there's not much rather to go but we
would<00:04:35.890> have<00:04:36.010> more<00:04:36.220> and<00:04:36.370> more<00:04:36.430> of<00:04:36.640> a<00:04:36.730> little<00:04:36.880> a

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
would have more and more of a little a

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.110 
would have more and more of a little a
little<00:04:37.600> dome<00:04:37.840> so<00:04:38.680> if<00:04:38.800> you<00:04:38.890> can<00:04:39.070> imagine<00:04:39.310> if<00:04:39.760> you

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
little dome so if you can imagine if you

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.820 
little dome so if you can imagine if you
just<00:04:40.150> do<00:04:40.420> short<00:04:40.690> rows<00:04:40.810> on<00:04:40.990> one<00:04:41.230> side<00:04:41.470> like<00:04:41.500> if

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
just do short rows on one side like if

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.400 
just do short rows on one side like if
you<00:04:41.920> knit<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.310> here<00:04:42.640> and<00:04:42.820> then<00:04:43.510> turn<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:43.900> then

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
you knit to here and then turn and then

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.110 
you knit to here and then turn and then
to<00:04:44.560> here<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:44.980> then<00:04:45.160> turn<00:04:45.370> under<00:04:45.700> here<00:04:45.940> and

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
to here and then turn under here and

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.670 
to here and then turn under here and
then<00:04:46.270> turn<00:04:46.510> you're<00:04:47.140> going<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.320> have<00:04:47.440> it's

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
then turn you're going to have it's

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.500 
then turn you're going to have it's
going<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.890> grow<00:04:48.190> like<00:04:48.580> this<00:04:48.880> right<00:04:49.240> your

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
going to grow like this right your

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.580 
going to grow like this right your
knitting<00:04:49.780> is<00:04:49.870> going<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.050> get<00:04:50.140> taller<00:04:50.380> and

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
knitting is going to get taller and

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.290 
knitting is going to get taller and
taller<00:04:50.710> on<00:04:50.950> this<00:04:51.160> side<00:04:51.340> it's<00:04:51.910> not<00:04:52.090> really

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
taller on this side it's not really

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.150 
taller on this side it's not really
going<00:04:52.420> to<00:04:52.480> grow<00:04:52.660> over<00:04:52.810> on<00:04:52.990> this<00:04:53.170> side<00:04:53.230> same

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
going to grow over on this side same

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.800 
going to grow over on this side same
with<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.370> other<00:04:54.520> way<00:04:54.640> if<00:04:54.850> you<00:04:55.360> do<00:04:55.540> it<00:04:55.570> on<00:04:55.660> both

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
with the other way if you do it on both

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.240 
with the other way if you do it on both
sides<00:04:56.080> like<00:04:56.200> we<00:04:56.380> did<00:04:56.560> it's<00:04:56.710> going<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:56.920> grow<00:04:57.100> in

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
sides like we did it's going to grow in

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.240 
sides like we did it's going to grow in
the<00:04:57.340> middle<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:57.880> make<00:04:58.300> like<00:04:58.480> a<00:04:58.510> hump<00:04:58.810> shape<00:04:59.250> so

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
the middle and make like a hump shape so

stitch two and knit two together and the
wrap<00:05:50.590> is<00:05:50.770> disguised<00:05:51.160> and<00:05:51.430> now<00:05:52.090> it's<00:05:52.300> pretty

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
wrap is disguised and now it's pretty

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.080 
wrap is disguised and now it's pretty
obvious<00:05:52.960> you<00:05:53.020> can<00:05:53.260> see<00:05:53.440> that<00:05:53.620> um<00:05:53.890> there's<00:05:54.850> more

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
obvious you can see that um there's more

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.400 
obvious you can see that um there's more
rows<00:05:55.300> over<00:05:55.540> here<00:05:55.690> than<00:05:55.840> there<00:05:55.960> are<00:05:55.990> here<00:05:56.290> which

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
rows over here than there are here which

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.380 
rows over here than there are here which
is<00:05:56.530> why<00:05:56.650> this<00:05:56.710> gets<00:05:57.040> stretched<00:05:57.280> a<00:05:57.430> tiny<00:05:57.640> bit<00:05:57.850> so

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
is why this gets stretched a tiny bit so

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.330 
is why this gets stretched a tiny bit so
let's<00:05:58.540> do<00:05:58.660> it<00:05:58.750> one<00:05:58.870> more<00:05:58.930> time<00:05:59.260> knit<00:05:59.919> over<00:05:59.950> to

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
let's do it one more time knit over to

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.050 
let's do it one more time knit over to
the<00:06:00.430> wrap<00:06:01.260> there<00:06:02.260> it<00:06:02.410> is<00:06:02.669> put<00:06:03.669> the<00:06:03.790> stitch<00:06:03.970> on

we should have a little funny shape if

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.709 
we should have a little funny shape if
we<00:06:30.039> did<00:06:30.189> it<00:06:30.280> right<00:06:30.639> see<00:06:31.120> how<00:06:31.210> it's<00:06:31.360> nice<00:06:31.479> and
