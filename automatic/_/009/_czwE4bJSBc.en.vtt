my<00:03:13.000> point<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.510> view<00:03:13.569> but<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.680> system

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
my point of view but it's the system

because now it's also inscribed that we
work<00:04:15.670> all<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.000> time

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
work all the time

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.690 
work all the time
no<00:04:17.080> it's<00:04:17.260> also<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.620> result<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.220> push<00:04:18.519> up

idea in my mind when I changed from
science<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.610> dance<00:04:34.920> but<00:04:35.920> then<00:04:36.100> would<00:04:37.060> you<00:04:37.210> die

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
science to dance but then would you die

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.530 
science to dance but then would you die
