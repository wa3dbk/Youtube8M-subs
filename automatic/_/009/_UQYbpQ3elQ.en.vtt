00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
soil sweet so it doesn't get any

bacterial growth in it and then what

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.450 
bacterial growth in it and then what
you'll<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.680> decide<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you'll want to do is decide where the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
you'll want to do is decide where the
front<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.060> box<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.810> because<00:01:16.290> that's

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
front of your box is because that's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.859 
front of your box is because that's
where<00:01:16.890> those<00:01:17.340> petunias<00:01:17.759> are<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.509> spill

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
where those petunias are going to spill

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.109 
where those petunias are going to spill
over<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:20.040> I've<00:01:20.430> put<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:21.500> potting<00:01:22.500> soil<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.400> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
over so I've put some potting soil in to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.270 
over so I've put some potting soil in to
the<00:01:24.270> box<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.850> I'm<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.360> put<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.280> petunias

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
around if they tend to be a little bit

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.390 
around if they tend to be a little bit
of<00:01:31.530> rootbound<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.820> loosen<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> roots

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
of rootbound do loosen up the roots

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.330 
of rootbound do loosen up the roots
these<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.790> spread<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.659> grow<00:01:37.340> pretty

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
these will spread and grow pretty

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.670 
these will spread and grow pretty
quickly<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.329> also<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.020> play<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.320> kind

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.480 
quickly but I also like to play it kind
of<00:01:40.770> intensively<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.970> maybe<00:01:42.960> put<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.490> petunias

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
of intensively so maybe put the petunias

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.179 
of intensively so maybe put the petunias
every<00:01:45.020> three<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> four<00:01:46.350> inches<00:01:46.770> apart<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
every three to four inches apart and

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.510 
every three to four inches apart and
along<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.430> edges<00:01:50.880> here<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.720> box<00:01:52.340> put<00:01:53.340> one

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
along the edges here of the box put one

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.160 
along the edges here of the box put one
more<00:01:53.729> over<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:56.509> I've<00:01:57.509> got<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:57.990> so

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
more over here and I've got one more so

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.109 
more over here and I've got one more so

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
might as well stick that one in to see

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.639 
might as well stick that one in to see
let's<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.630> one<00:02:00.810> up<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.200> front<00:02:01.469> and
