00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.490
 what companies like nomen or how bright 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.979
 subcontracted to extractor and so that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.200

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.100
 wild rice to take the other 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.810
 day someone uploaded a photo to twitter of

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.799
 a sack of wild rice to the mercadona of 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.690
 Albacete a supermarket where you also 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.820
 You can find dozens of products 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.009
 homemade yes yes 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.920
 let's analyze home and they're 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.640
 bad supermarket is an oxymoron is like 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.490
 eternal instant frozen croquettes 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.039
 homemade precooked badly mal de la base 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.590
 houses do not produce and politicize 2,500 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.659
 Extra virgin fried tomato kettles 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.789
 home if you have a parking that puts 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.679
 truck entry operators 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.590
 that's an industry if you have a plate 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.420
 and a gray shutter that's the garage of 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.560
 a house but if there are chimneys of 20 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.229
 meters throwing water vapor 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.450
 it's probably an industry and the 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.440
 industries do by definition things 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.319
 industrial not homemade a trick if you see 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.120
 well three packages bound together by a cardboard 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.319
 a plastic that puts more than three 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.180
 indivisible 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.159
 that has not been done by a grandmother that has 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.109
 done the industry no matter how much you put 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.209
 done by the grandmother because the grandmothers 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.549
 they are not in the industries if you see 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.769
 someone in an operator that looks like a 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.439
 grandmother with glasses with the robe and a 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.730
 folder in the hand in an industry 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.769
 It is probably an operator who has 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.079
 fired who has put on he has dressed 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.790
 of Mrs. doubtfire because they have 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.739
 fired or that man has had to 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.079
 do something bad but the grandmothers do not 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.150
 they know what chloramine t is they do not know 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.819

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.379
 babies or a grandmother in an industry and 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.180
 eye 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.280
 doubt her because they do not know and I see it 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.680
 that chloramine t or the miseries of 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.109
 casein if you want homemade food to 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.209
 our grandmothers from a tupper and if you 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.049
 You see the Chinese risk is changed for a 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.049
