00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
okay this is our Prowler and it's a 93

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.410 
okay this is our Prowler and it's a 93
and<00:00:04.529> for<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.710> second<00:00:05.100> year<00:00:05.190> in<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.400> row<00:00:05.430> I've

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
and for the second year in a row I've

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.720 
and for the second year in a row I've
broken<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.899> spring<00:00:07.319> going<00:00:07.950> up<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.370> mining

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
broken a spring going up to the mining

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.350 
broken a spring going up to the mining
claims<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.179> back<00:00:09.330> now<00:00:10.170> while<00:00:11.090> mining<00:00:12.090> claim

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
claims and back now while mining claim

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.640 
claims and back now while mining claim
road<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:13.549> flat-out<00:00:14.549> horrible<00:00:15.360> brutal<00:00:16.230> Road<00:00:16.410> at

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
road is flat-out horrible brutal Road at

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.060 
road is flat-out horrible brutal Road at
the<00:00:17.100> same<00:00:17.279> time<00:00:18.350> yeah<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.770> shouldn't<00:00:19.980> be

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the same time yeah we shouldn't be

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.920 
the same time yeah we shouldn't be
breaking<00:00:20.369> Springs<00:00:20.580> every<00:00:20.939> year<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.779> think

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
breaking Springs every year so I think

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.859 
breaking Springs every year so I think
that<00:00:22.350> because<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> trailers<00:00:23.400> what<00:00:23.970> 18<00:00:24.420> 19

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
that because the trailers what 18 19

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.259 
that because the trailers what 18 19
years<00:00:25.170> old<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:26.430> we've<00:00:26.580> got<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.090> just

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
years old and what we've got is just

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.390 
years old and what we've got is just
Springs<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:27.990> reached<00:00:28.230> their<00:00:28.529> working

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
Springs that have reached their working

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.490 
Springs that have reached their working
life<00:00:29.609> span<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.179> since<00:00:30.779> I've<00:00:30.960> always<00:00:31.260> thought

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
life span and since I've always thought

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.080 
life span and since I've always thought
they<00:00:31.740> were<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.890> little<00:00:32.130> underrated<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.790> begin

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
they were a little underrated to begin

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.530 
they were a little underrated to begin
with<00:00:33.800> now's<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.010> time<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.309> change<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
with now's the time to change and I

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.330 
with now's the time to change and I
think<00:00:36.809> rather<00:00:37.050> than<00:00:37.200> throwing<00:00:37.590> bits<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
think rather than throwing bits and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
think rather than throwing bits and
pieces<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.750> I've<00:00:39.870> been<00:00:40.050> doing<00:00:40.379> is

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
pieces or what I've been doing is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.040 
pieces or what I've been doing is
throwing<00:00:41.160> leaves<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:41.730> them<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.090> rebuilding

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
throwing leaves at them and rebuilding

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.049 
throwing leaves at them and rebuilding
them<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.280> time<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> start

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
them I think it's time just to start

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.319 
them I think it's time just to start
from<00:00:45.180> scratch<00:00:45.510> Oh<00:00:46.850> show<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.910> how<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> go

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
from scratch Oh show you how I go

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.510 
from scratch Oh show you how I go
through<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.680> my<00:00:49.800> Springs<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
through that so here my Springs is a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160 
through that so here my Springs is a
problem<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.510> they<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.899> said<00:00:52.050> too

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
problem I have as they just said too

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.830 
problem I have as they just said too
many<00:00:52.320> miles<00:00:52.500> trailers<00:00:53.160> 18<00:00:53.579> years<00:00:53.789> old<00:00:54.000> they

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
many miles trailers 18 years old they

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.180 
many miles trailers 18 years old they
have<00:00:55.110> reached<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.739> end<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.920> their<00:00:56.010> working

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
have reached the end of their working

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
have reached the end of their working
life<00:00:56.460> span<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:58.079> problems<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.530> them

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
life span so I have problems with them

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.529 
life span so I have problems with them
slamming<00:00:59.190> into<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> bump<00:00:59.640> stops<00:00:59.910> any<00:01:00.239> time

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
slamming into the bump stops any time

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.270 
slamming into the bump stops any time
the<00:01:00.840> road<00:01:00.989> gets<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.320> even<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.100> bit

the Sapphire mine this is the one I
broke<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.060> managed<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.720> piece<00:01:10.049> her<00:01:10.229> together

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
broke I managed to piece her together

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.210 
broke I managed to piece her together
and<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.250> home<00:01:11.430> by<00:01:12.090> stacking<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.830> cj5<00:01:13.830> Jeep

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220

and get it home by stacking up cj5 Jeep
Deep<00:01:14.460> Springs<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.080> took<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> two

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
Deep Springs and so I took the two

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.859 
Deep Springs and so I took the two
broken<00:01:17.100> parts<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.880> two<00:01:18.030> broken<00:01:18.299> leaves<00:01:18.600> out

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
broken parts the two broken leaves out

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.700 
broken parts the two broken leaves out
the<00:01:18.900> bottom<00:01:19.320> two<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.490> stacked<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.180> 3<00:01:21.710> CJ

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the bottom two and and stacked up 3 CJ

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.380 
the bottom two and and stacked up 3 CJ
leaves<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.310> worked<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.060> exact

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
leaves which worked out to be the exact

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.390 
leaves which worked out to be the exact
same<00:01:24.420> height<00:01:24.689> bolted<00:01:25.680> them<00:01:25.770> together<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.250> by

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
same height bolted them together and by

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.109 
same height bolted them together and by
god<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.790> worked

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
god it worked

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.050 
god it worked
but<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.140> isn't<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.530> strong<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.729> axle

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
but it isn't as strong and so the axle

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.700 
but it isn't as strong and so the axle
is<00:01:30.119> sagging<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.020> ended<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.439> only<00:01:31.560> one

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
is sagging and I ended up with only one

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
is sagging and I ended up with only one
inch<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.310> travel<00:01:32.490> before<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.060> slammed<00:01:33.329> into<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
inch of travel before I slammed into the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.899 
inch of travel before I slammed into the
bump<00:01:33.780> stop<00:01:34.460> my<00:01:35.460> goal

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
bump stop my goal

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.670

these<00:01:36.090> are<00:01:36.210> 3,500<00:01:36.900> pound<00:01:37.049> axles<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.829> they're

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
these are 3,500 pound axles so they're

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.170 
these are 3,500 pound axles so they're

spring<00:01:49.770> will<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> 2,000<00:01:50.880> pound<00:01:50.970> spring<00:01:51.740> you

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
spring will be a 2,000 pound spring you

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.990 
spring will be a 2,000 pound spring you
know<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:53.070> put<00:01:53.250> these<00:01:53.430> Springs<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:53.880> these

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
know they put these Springs in these

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.340 
know they put these Springs in these
trailers<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.930> right<00:01:55.200> at<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
trailers and they are right at the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.109 
trailers and they are right at the
ragged<00:01:55.619> edge<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.399> if<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.700> machine<00:01:56.939> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
ragged edge and so if this machine is

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.700 
ragged edge and so if this machine is
eight<00:01:57.390> thousand<00:01:57.840> pounds<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.350> put<00:01:58.590> eight

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
eight thousand pounds they put eight

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.770 
eight thousand pounds they put eight
thousand<00:01:59.130> pounds<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.490> Springs<00:01:59.759> under<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
thousand pounds of Springs under it the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.469 
thousand pounds of Springs under it the
axle<00:02:01.170> tubes<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.759> usually<00:02:02.759> pretty<00:02:02.939> strong<00:02:03.299> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
axle tubes are usually pretty strong and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.410 
axle tubes are usually pretty strong and
talking<00:02:03.840> people<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.399> working<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.700> trailers

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
talking people and working on trailers

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.479 
talking people and working on trailers
and<00:02:06.600> different<00:02:06.930> types<00:02:07.170> over<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> years<00:02:07.710> one

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
and different types over the years one

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.530 
and different types over the years one
thing<00:02:08.670> I've<00:02:08.789> noticed

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
thing I've noticed

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.630 
thing I've noticed
they'll<00:02:10.869> use<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.080> same<00:02:11.410> size<00:02:11.620> axle<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.190> on

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
they'll use the same size axle to on

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.880 
they'll use the same size axle to on
laut<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.540> axles<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.350> actual<00:02:14.650> weight

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
laut of axles and the actual weight

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.000 
laut of axles and the actual weight
limit<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.850> decided<00:02:16.570> by<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.960> spring<00:02:17.320> for

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
limit is decided by that spring for

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.090 
limit is decided by that spring for
instance<00:02:18.310> you'll<00:02:18.460> have<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:19.950> 25-foot<00:02:20.950> trailer

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
instance you'll have a 25-foot trailer

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.750 
instance you'll have a 25-foot trailer
and<00:02:21.520> 35<00:02:22.480> foot<00:02:22.750> trailer<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:24.460> two<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.730> them

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
and 35 foot trailer and the two of them

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.500 
and 35 foot trailer and the two of them
will<00:02:24.970> be<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:26.470> same<00:02:26.710> axle<00:02:27.550> tubes<00:02:27.790> but<00:02:28.330> with

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
will be on the same axle tubes but with

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.840 
will be on the same axle tubes but with
very<00:02:28.900> different<00:02:29.350> springs<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.490> can<00:02:30.640> tell

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
very different springs and you can tell

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.610 
very different springs and you can tell
that<00:02:31.030> when<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.810> go<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.080> replace<00:02:32.440> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
that when you go and replace the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.870 
that when you go and replace the
bearings<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.100> they're<00:02:33.220> all<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> same<00:02:33.520> part

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
bearings and they're all the same part

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.000 
bearings and they're all the same part

4000 pound springs to it is not

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.570 
4000 pound springs to it is not
necessarily<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> catastrophe<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.460> it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
necessarily the catastrophe that it

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.640 
necessarily the catastrophe that it
might<00:02:39.730> seem<00:02:40.030> I'm<00:02:40.690> not<00:02:40.900> putting<00:02:41.290> any<00:02:41.410> more

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
might seem I'm not putting any more

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.040 
might seem I'm not putting any more
weight<00:02:41.860> in<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.130> trailer<00:02:42.550> I'm<00:02:43.450> just<00:02:43.690> putting<00:02:43.990> a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
weight in the trailer I'm just putting a

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.320 
weight in the trailer I'm just putting a
little<00:02:44.290> stronger<00:02:44.590> shoe<00:02:44.950> underneath<00:02:45.400> her<00:02:45.670> so

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
little stronger shoe underneath her so

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.580 
little stronger shoe underneath her so
that<00:02:46.600> with<00:02:47.170> look<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.890> get<00:02:48.340> another<00:02:48.550> 18<00:02:49.000> years

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that with look I get another 18 years

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.580 
that with look I get another 18 years
out<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.800> running<00:02:50.980> gear<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.870> again<00:02:53.170> it

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
out of the running gear so again it

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.680 
out of the running gear so again it
isn't<00:02:53.740> going<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.160> four<00:02:54.370> thousand<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.270> overload

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
isn't going to four thousand to overload

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.090 
isn't going to four thousand to overload
it<00:02:55.750> you're<00:02:56.230> not<00:02:56.320> changing<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.830> weight<00:02:57.010> in

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
it you're not changing the weight in

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.800 
it you're not changing the weight in
your<00:02:57.220> trailer<00:02:57.460> just<00:02:58.390> putting<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.660> little

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
your trailer just putting a little

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.320 
your trailer just putting a little
stronger<00:02:59.050> stuff<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.700> don't<00:03:00.820> want<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.150> go<00:03:01.240> to

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
stronger stuff you don't want to go to

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.530 
stronger stuff you don't want to go to
five<00:03:01.570> or<00:03:01.990> even<00:03:02.020> forty<00:03:02.890> five<00:03:03.100> because<00:03:03.880> then

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
five or even forty five because then

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.090 
five or even forty five because then
it'll<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.960> bounce<00:03:05.200> around<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.740> ride<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.070> a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
it'll just bounce around and ride like a

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.220 
it'll just bounce around and ride like a
tank<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:07.210> actually<00:03:07.360> know<00:03:07.630> somebody<00:03:07.900> who

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
tank and I actually know somebody who

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.230 
tank and I actually know somebody who
had<00:03:08.440> dramatically<00:03:09.310> overloaded<00:03:09.910> Springs

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
had dramatically overloaded Springs

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.390 
had dramatically overloaded Springs
actually<00:03:10.930> hole<00:03:11.320> overloaded<00:03:11.830> axle<00:03:12.160> sent

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
actually hole overloaded axle sent

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.210 
actually hole overloaded axle sent
underneath<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.420> big<00:03:13.720> fifth<00:03:14.200> wheel<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.650> you

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
underneath a big fifth wheel and you

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.800 
underneath a big fifth wheel and you
follow<00:03:15.550> them<00:03:15.730> down<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.060> road<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.600> you'd

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
follow them down the road and you'd

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.960 
follow them down the road and you'd
actually<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:17.200> air<00:03:17.440> below<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.130> tires<00:03:18.489> those

actually see air below the tires those

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.150 
actually see air below the tires those
Springs<00:03:19.330> weren't<00:03:19.570> flexing<00:03:19.989> at<00:03:20.200> all<00:03:20.410> they<00:03:21.040> were

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
Springs weren't flexing at all they were

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.460 
Springs weren't flexing at all they were
too<00:03:21.370> big<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.900> just<00:03:22.900> want<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.140> go<00:03:23.230> up<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.440> little

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
too big I just want to go up a little

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.150 
too big I just want to go up a little
step<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:25.080> if<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.260> bought<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.500> brand<00:03:26.680> new<00:03:26.890> 5th

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
step and if I bought a brand new 5th

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.550 
step and if I bought a brand new 5th
wheel<00:03:27.370> very<00:03:28.180> first<00:03:28.630> thing<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.989> would<00:03:29.170> do<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.470> it

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
wheel very first thing I would do to it

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.979 
wheel very first thing I would do to it
is<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:30.580> upload<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.300> Springs<00:03:32.820> 500<00:03:33.820> pounds<00:03:34.750> if<00:03:34.840> I

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
is I upload the Springs 500 pounds if I

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.100 
is I upload the Springs 500 pounds if I
could<00:03:35.260> because<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:37.209> know<00:03:37.300> you<00:03:37.360> just<00:03:37.660> run<00:03:37.930> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
could because you know you just run the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.900 
could because you know you just run the
right<00:03:38.320> at<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.590> ragged<00:03:38.830> edge<00:03:39.100> these<00:03:39.580> are<00:03:39.820> the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
right at the ragged edge these are the

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.830
