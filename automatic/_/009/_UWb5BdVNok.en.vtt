it<00:01:17.370> sure<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.790> then<00:01:18.690> for<00:01:18.990> how<00:01:19.110> simple<00:01:19.620> and<00:01:19.770> easy

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
it sure is then for how simple and easy

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.760 
it sure is then for how simple and easy
it<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.190> we<00:01:21.120> cannot<00:01:21.660> make<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> single<00:01:22.470> mistake

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it is we cannot make a single mistake

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.480 
it is we cannot make a single mistake
can't<00:01:23.730> miss<00:01:23.940> this<00:01:24.060> chance<00:01:24.200> right<00:01:25.490> understand

can't miss this chance right understand
this<00:01:26.610> guy's<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.780> fail<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:29.220> is

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
this guy's if we fail here this is

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.820 
this guy's if we fail here this is
simple<00:01:29.670> task<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.120> fail<00:01:30.330> this<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:31.440> don't<00:01:31.650> get

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
simple task if we fail this we don't get

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.340 
simple task if we fail this we don't get
a<00:01:31.860> second<00:01:32.250> chance<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.960> how<00:01:33.960> some<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.260> this

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
a second chance for how some of this

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.340 
a second chance for how some of this
plan<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.620> let's<00:01:35.310> carry<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.760> perfectly

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
plan is let's carry it out perfectly

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.870 
plan is let's carry it out perfectly
let's<00:01:37.350> show<00:01:37.590> these<00:01:37.770> guys<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.370> there<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
let's show these guys that there is a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.540 
let's show these guys that there is a
reason<00:01:39.360> why<00:01:39.510> we<00:01:39.540> exist<00:01:40.190> even<00:01:41.190> if<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.400> don't

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
reason why we exist even if we don't

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.680 
reason why we exist even if we don't
know<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:41.730> that<00:01:41.820> purpose<00:01:42.030> is

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
know what that purpose is
