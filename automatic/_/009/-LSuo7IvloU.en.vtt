 assembly work that we're going to see 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.580
 now in detail 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.859

 calmon went to bottle i5 processor 4430 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.180
 It's cooled down and four of the cooler 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.040
 master 161 120v of the staff speak to have 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
 cure is not doing in overclock pose 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.120
 on the chaotic locking bracket does not 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.129
 knows what to do and wants to do with 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.350
 The gang left the aesthetic is beautiful and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.870
 let the process is cooled has more 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.510
 silence less noise then there are several 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.280
 benefits is not only a rule it has to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.910
 to do a quiet overclock on the computer 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.449
 folks 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.829
 then there with 120 and the chilled chamber 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:03.840
 and memory are 8 gb of memory twice 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.240
 4 way the ideal in red color 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.530
 line and go crazy the two combs each 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.939
 with 4 gb motherboard gigabyte hp 81 mh 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.979
 video card one gtx 750 and asus 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.560
 in this case the mother of asus with a fan 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 beautiful does not need extra power 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.909
 in the source then it helps to get a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.509
 assembly cleaner everything else in the source 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.939
 she put the cooler master x 2 550 votes 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.400
 quietly holding the no configuration 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.200
 need more source than that and this 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.000
 source has five year warranty on 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.579
 Brazil all sources can come out 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 with five years giving greater security 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.009
 the more the better the guarantee for all 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.990
 customers and everyone else is more 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.060
 best of all, let's just say so is the galley 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.680
 put of front and dvd cd burner 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.570
 pattern so you can see that 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.640
 was mounting was very nice and 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.040
 then you can make the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.210
 4 assembly healing already a bit difficult 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.200
 but we always do the best 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.990
 possible

 we have trained technicians with high 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.380
 courses to make the assembly is not 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.360
 anyone can do an assembly 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.069
 never in this pattern in the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.760
 sakineh's office and courses
