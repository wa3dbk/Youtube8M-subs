00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
same dimensions in a long lengthwise

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.020 
same dimensions in a long lengthwise
direction<00:00:48.410> but<00:00:48.920> what<00:00:49.100> we've<00:00:49.280> done<00:00:49.460> is<00:00:49.610> we<00:00:49.760> push

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
direction but what we've done is we push

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.510 
direction but what we've done is we push
down<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.449> front<00:00:50.690> hood<00:00:51.379> down<00:00:51.649> about<00:00:52.010> 35

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
down the front hood down about 35

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.720 
down the front hood down about 35
millimeters<00:00:53.180> reefs<00:00:54.020> down<00:00:54.260> about<00:00:54.559> 38<00:00:55.129> back

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
millimeters reefs down about 38 back

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.779 
millimeters reefs down about 38 back
here<00:00:56.030> we're<00:00:56.210> down<00:00:56.329> 35<00:00:57.160> so<00:00:58.160> we<00:00:58.250> made<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.579> car

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
here we're down 35 so we made the car

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.090 
here we're down 35 so we made the car
sleeker<00:00:59.359> and<00:00:59.570> then<00:00:59.989> we've<00:01:00.109> also<00:01:00.260> widened<00:01:01.010> it

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
sleeker and then we've also widened it

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.459 
sleeker and then we've also widened it
so<00:01:01.370> we're<00:01:01.550> thirty<00:01:01.789> nine<00:01:02.030> millimeters<00:01:02.600> wider

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
so we're thirty nine millimeters wider

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.770 
so we're thirty nine millimeters wider
in<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.920> rear<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:04.910> we've<00:01:05.269> taken<00:01:05.300> out

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
in the rear so we've taken out
