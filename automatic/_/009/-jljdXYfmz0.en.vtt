button<00:01:29.579> positioning<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.390> moved<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.750> back<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
button positioning so we moved it back a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.170 
button positioning so we moved it back a
half<00:01:31.380> an<00:01:31.590> inch<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:32.280> really<00:01:32.520> provide<00:01:32.820> easier

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
half an inch to really provide easier

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.840 
half an inch to really provide easier
access<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.380> made<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> three<00:01:34.950> zone<00:01:34.979> RGB

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
access and then we made a three zone RGB

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.080 
access and then we made a three zone RGB
so<00:01:36.180> now<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> logo<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.799> DPI<00:01:38.159> indicator<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
so now the logo the DPI indicator in the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.060 
so now the logo the DPI indicator in the
scroll<00:01:39.420> wheel<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.960> each<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.439> independently
