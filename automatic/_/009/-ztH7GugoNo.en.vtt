00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.719
 instead of batista70phone today there 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.090
 I present nokia thrissur tag which is not 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.520
 nothing else we say a buzzer 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.680
 evolved to look for example of 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.119
 objects that we have dispersed let's go now 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.400
 to turn it on it will sound ok now 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.010
 we turned it on we associated it 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.349
 via bluetooth and since we don't have the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.780
 connection n.psi and we have it then 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.030
 downloaded from the market 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.340
 windows phone store nokia thresher tar 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.230
 because it's absolutely free we go 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.870
 to start it 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.879
 as you can see the sensor is connected 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.160
 we have the possibility also of 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.510
 change the various settings which 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
 we are connected 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.649
 if you want you can safely e 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.469
 change the name or you can 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.809
 change the icon I had chosen the 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.539
 keys because most likely it 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.100
 you will link to keys or can 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.890
 also be that you will put it connected 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.540
 to the suitcase or or not even the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.369
 your girlfriend to look for it, oh well 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.310
 I'm joking now 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:18.640
 ok now we have connected it what happens 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.780
 when we look for it we start and issue a 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.490
 sound 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.340
 oh well if we have it around the house 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.680
 we can easily find if not 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.520
 is detected for any reason 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.770
 because it is driven by p or because we call it 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.310
 so off-screen when it happens we go 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.310
 to turn it off 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.530
 ok off in a moment it will appear that not 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.140
 is connected requires of is impossible 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.970
 find this sensor so we can 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.220
 go around looking for it 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.470
 or quietly open the map 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.079
 and friends i will show you last time 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.729
 our sensor has been associated where 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.899
 we were and we show them that 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.250
 we were here now through the we can 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.820
 go and he shows us where 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.009
 positioned our sensor for example 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.410
 let's start let's say go on foot and 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.170
 let's go and look for it quietly 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.580
 as you can see he has positioned himself there 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.340
 instructions or via navigation e 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.460
 chain link and tells us where the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.560
 our buzzer so you will have 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.350
 always the possibility of finding it in 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.460
 if it is lost, it is on 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:34.300
 search through the sound we go to 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:37.010
 turn it back on, now a moment and it will come 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.230
 automatically found you saw me 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.810
 I'm going to click and the sound of a 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.360
 so that I can find it as you see a 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.130
 we say buzzer very evolved with the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.100
 possibility of finding it again in the event that 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.870
 either off-screen or even turned off with 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.209
 this ended talare side
