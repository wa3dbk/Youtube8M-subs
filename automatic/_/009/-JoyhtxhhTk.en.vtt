00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
may easily be one of the worst games in

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.729 
may easily be one of the worst games in
just<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.239> history<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.810> yep<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.320> just<00:02:41.560> broke

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
just the history and yep I just broke

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.920 
just the history and yep I just broke
that<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.790> here<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.090> throw<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.299> smoke<00:02:43.570> grenade<00:02:43.630> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
give myself the tactical advantage

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.920 
give myself the tactical advantage
because<00:02:45.820> they<00:02:45.970> can't<00:02:46.180> see<00:02:46.390> me<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:46.660> can't

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.240 
because they can't see me and I can't
see<00:02:46.989> them<00:02:47.260> which<00:02:47.440> means<00:02:47.650> I'm<00:02:47.860> pretty<00:02:48.010> much
