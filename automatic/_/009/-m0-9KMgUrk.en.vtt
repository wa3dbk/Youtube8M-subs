get more power and consistency on my
serve<00:00:15.100> so<00:00:15.670> let's<00:00:15.879> review<00:00:16.119> the<00:00:16.750> video<00:00:16.990> of<00:00:17.140> his

serve so let's review the video of his
serve<00:00:17.529> and<00:00:17.800> see<00:00:17.920> what<00:00:18.100> we<00:00:18.220> can<00:00:18.369> do<00:00:18.460> to<00:00:18.580> help<00:00:18.670> him

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.079 

so<00:00:36.989> I'm<00:00:37.079> looking<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.559> Seth's<00:00:37.980> video<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.910> his

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.089 
so I'm looking at Seth's video of his

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.149 
so I'm looking at Seth's video of his
serve<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.839> his<00:00:39.960> question<00:00:40.260> asking<00:00:40.739> how<00:00:40.859> I<00:00:40.980> get

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
serve and his question asking how I get

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.569 
serve and his question asking how I get
more<00:00:41.370> power<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> consistency<00:00:42.649> Seth<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.920> think

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
more power and consistency Seth I think

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.430 
more power and consistency Seth I think
it's<00:00:44.729> a<00:00:44.850> pretty<00:00:45.030> good<00:00:45.120> looking<00:00:45.510> motion<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.289> do

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it's a pretty good looking motion you do

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160 
it's a pretty good looking motion you do
some<00:00:46.620> things<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.100> think<00:00:47.159> very<00:00:47.519> well<00:00:48.170> most

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
some things I think very well most

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.569 
some things I think very well most
importantly<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.800> think<00:00:49.949> you're<00:00:50.250> tossing

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
importantly I think you're tossing

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.939 
importantly I think you're tossing
action<00:00:51.359> is<00:00:51.510> very<00:00:51.809> good<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.409> keep<00:00:52.769> your

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
action is very good you really keep your

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.060 
action is very good you really keep your
right<00:00:53.190> hand<00:00:53.390> being<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.539> lefty<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.320> there<00:00:55.769> very

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
right hand being a lefty up there very

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.799 
right hand being a lefty up there very
well<00:00:56.159> but<00:00:56.850> where<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.359> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.690> make

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
well but where I see you can make

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.130 
well but where I see you can make
improvements<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:59.180> your<00:01:00.180> racket<00:01:00.600> position

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
improvements is your racket position

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.009 
improvements is your racket position
right<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> middle<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.369> your<00:01:02.489> swing<00:01:03.019> your

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
right in the middle of your swing your

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.679 
right in the middle of your swing your
leg<00:01:04.559> position<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.309> little<00:01:05.430> bit<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.360> start

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
leg position a little bit as you start

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.249 
leg position a little bit as you start
your<00:01:06.810> load<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.500> then<00:01:08.310> you're<00:01:08.490> unloading<00:01:09.270> up

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
your load and then you're unloading up

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.040 
your load and then you're unloading up
into<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> ball<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:12.060> last<00:01:12.300> thing<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.840> in

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
into the ball and the last thing is in

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.169 
into the ball and the last thing is in
slow<00:01:13.350> motion<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.039> can<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.880> your

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
slow motion you can really see that your

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.749 
slow motion you can really see that your
head<00:01:15.450> drops<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.080> little<00:01:16.200> bit<00:01:16.350> early<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.130> those

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
head drops a little bit early so those

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.490 
head drops a little bit early so those
are<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> four<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.600> areas<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
are the four little areas I think that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.559 
are the four little areas I think that
you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.799> tweak<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.429> you<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.759> really<00:01:21.149> get<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
you can tweak and you will really get a

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.870 
you can tweak and you will really get a
lot<00:01:22.049> more<00:01:22.110> power<00:01:22.500> especially<00:01:23.190> coming<00:01:23.759> from

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
lot more power especially coming from

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.969 
lot more power especially coming from
the<00:01:24.030> legs<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.810> will<00:01:25.470> get<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.799> bit

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the legs and you will get a little bit

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
the legs and you will get a little bit
more<00:01:26.069> consistency<00:01:26.940> because<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.360> think<00:01:27.569> by

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
more consistency because I think by

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.620 
more consistency because I think by
keeping<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.110> head<00:01:28.319> up<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.860> by<00:01:29.700> getting<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
keeping your head up and by getting the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.210 
keeping your head up and by getting the
rack<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.289> better<00:01:31.440> position<00:01:31.679> it<00:01:32.159> will

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
rack in a little better position it will

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.370 
rack in a little better position it will
give<00:01:32.399> you<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.580> more<00:01:32.940> consistent<00:01:33.360> contact<00:01:34.020> point

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
give you a more consistent contact point

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.499 
give you a more consistent contact point
so<00:01:35.009> let's<00:01:35.190> break<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.429> down<00:01:35.610> starting<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
so let's break it down starting with the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.600 
so let's break it down starting with the
the<00:01:36.810> racket<00:01:37.229> work<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.979> you'll<00:01:38.100> notice<00:01:38.459> in

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the racket work and if you'll notice in

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.219 
the racket work and if you'll notice in
the<00:01:38.729> slow<00:01:38.940> motion<00:01:38.970> again<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.720> start<00:01:40.020> down

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the slow motion again you start down

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.830 
the slow motion again you start down
here<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.979> once<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> get<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.390> about<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.719> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
here and once you get to about in this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.779 
here and once you get to about in this
position<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.530> sort<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.799> break<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.280> racket

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
position you sort of break the racket

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.020 
position you sort of break the racket
the<00:01:44.820> swing<00:01:45.469> into<00:01:46.469> that<00:01:46.770> abbreviated<00:01:47.430> motion

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the swing into that abbreviated motion

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.630 
the swing into that abbreviated motion
which<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.359> fine<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:49.770> face<00:01:50.039> starts<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
which is fine but your face starts to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370 
which is fine but your face starts to
open<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:51.450> soon<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> racket<00:01:52.229> face

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
open and as soon as the racket face

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.370 
open and as soon as the racket face
opens<00:01:53.039> you<00:01:53.969> could<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.359> the<00:01:54.509> elbow<00:01:54.869> starts<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
opens you could see the elbow starts to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.529 
opens you could see the elbow starts to
come<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> little<00:01:55.920> bit<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.149> I'd<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
come in a little bit and so I'd like to

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.690 
come in a little bit and so I'd like to
see<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.020> experiment<00:01:58.829> trying<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.310> keep<00:01:59.490> your

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
see you experiment trying to keep your

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.029 
see you experiment trying to keep your
palm<00:01:59.939> down<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:00.509> bit<00:02:00.689> longer<00:02:01.020> even<00:02:01.770> if

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
palm down a little bit longer even if

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.270 
palm down a little bit longer even if
it's<00:02:02.250> abbreviated<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.740> one<00:02:04.740> way<00:02:04.859> to<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.130> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it's abbreviated and one way to do that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.969 
it's abbreviated and one way to do that
is<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.640> practice<00:02:06.090> starting<00:02:06.659> with<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.679> in

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
is just practice starting with just in

being able to unload up into the court

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.850

people I'm gonna serve but what you do
very<00:03:41.299> well<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.720> you're<00:03:41.900> great<00:03:42.260> with<00:03:42.409> your<00:03:42.530> toss

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
and you're tossing arm so if you can

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.170 
and you're tossing arm so if you can
just<00:03:45.470> remind<00:03:46.099> yourself<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.730> try<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.060> keep

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
your chest up at that toss a little

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.729 
your chest up at that toss a little
longer<00:03:49.400> so<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.909> head<00:03:50.120> can<00:03:50.359> be<00:03:50.389> there<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.959> think

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
longer so the head can be there I think

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.229 
longer so the head can be there I think
