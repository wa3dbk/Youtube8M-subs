00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.080
 original sneakers bastan 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.559
 but the thing 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.980
 some chord to 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.410
 I did not even have to write 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.210
 I'm going to me I'm missing the air how much 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.580
 they doubted this and I do not find you 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.730
 here you should feel in fast is a 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.309
 error maybe I do not choose what I feel 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.140
 that sometimes I get cold you are such heat 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.750
 Once I say that you do not care 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.800
 I'm lying maybe the barriers 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.770
 they create doubts 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.230
 maybe the words do not help maybe 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.180
 everything if tomorrow nothing press 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.850
 time difference we were already missing 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.010
 it also hurts what I need 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.220
 Maybe what you need is another 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.780
 thing maybe I told myself that such 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.449
 had not met a woman so 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.700
 wonderful maybe all this what 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.130
 imagined maybe the magic that I saw 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.140
 never existed maybe with you I have not 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.210
 could go and holding hands maybe 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.460
 it's impediment I never cared 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.619
 biden maybe think too much maybe 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.830
 everything I think in the end is a mistake 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.930
 the letters for love had never been dedicated 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.210
 to save himself a little while he wrote 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.549
 one million 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.729
 should think in negative maybe not 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.500
 forget the fact that they are not me maybe they 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.110
 the barriers departed maybe all 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.659
 rub them once nothing so heart 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.280
 once I have your look engraved maybe in 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.020
 the moment that after kissing me 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.390
 you looked maybe it was not a crush 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.780
 first clue but maybe it was the arrow 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.810
 that faster nail 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.659
 the barriers create doubts maybe the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.940
 words do not help maybe a whole and 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.490
 tomorrow nothing maybe unlike the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.490
 time was enough for us too, you are what 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.690
 I need maybe what you need 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.330
 be something else 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.710
 maybe I told myself that maybe 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.140
 I had met a woman so 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.750
 wonderful that I frequented places 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.910
 for seeing you maybe seeing you made me 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.100
 feel idiot I see myself and I feel 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.830
 lucky to meet you give me I feel 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.380
 lucky to brush your mouth maybe you 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.780
 you are such a precious light and at the same time 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.850
 they realize what you're worth can not 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.830
 being is something I never expected such 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.630
 Once you are the firefly that lights my 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.540
 valley maybe this works maybe 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.709
 Maybe the barriers did not work 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.590
 they create doubts 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.680
 maybe the words do not help maybe 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.630
 everything if tomorrow nothing really makes a difference 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.630
 of time we were already lacking schools 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.740
 I need Alberto that you need already 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.200
 another thing 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.610
 maybe I told myself that maybe 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.490
 I had met a woman of the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.860
 wonderful of before I for nothing and you 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.380
 change maybe I would take the same 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.570
 every decision because maybe we keep 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.030
 forward maybe the great history to the 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.910
 end was never written really I want 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.720
 maybe I hate you 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.720
 perhaps
