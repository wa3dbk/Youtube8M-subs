00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.960
 generic 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:19.460
 finally Ceylon bridges not bah then 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:22.109

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.119
 hello everyone capsule 17 we 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.990
 this is him lionel hi stéphane and we 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.990
 starts in germany on tuesday 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.000
 but if kim for these beautiful words 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.170
 let people pay artists 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.879
 according to their good will 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.290
 not sure that everyone likes it 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.760
 was expecting mega bloks is finally that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.930
 he introduced us to low boom 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.579
 for the moment the project is not 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 actually launch officially 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.719
 this is a demo on which we do not 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.250
 found that the term kim music the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.690
 service should look like a mix 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.129
 between spotify and itunes 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 we can listen to music in 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.609
 streaming or upload titles to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.809
 see the demo we say that also 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.820
 some pieces of myspace donations 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.899
 for the moment we can not test any 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.369
 other functions of the site 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.990
 if the whole presents rather well 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.790
 difficult to make a judgment for 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.170
 the moment we hope that this platform 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.700
 will point the tip of his nose this year 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.260
 still and that it will offer added value 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.189
 compared to others but that's it 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.430
 to check 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.430
 cya 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.450
 welcome to next car game new game 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.440
 degling cars from the studio 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.660
 finnish bug byrs 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.460
 in the program 24 vehicles on the screen 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.560
 completely destructible just like a 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.120
 much of the scenery the star 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.660
 besides graphics it's physics 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.530
 of the game the next car games is always 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.450
 developing but we can also 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.760
 try in early access he proposes 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.250
 already arenas for wrinkling of the sheet 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.200
 a circuit on land another on the road 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.940
 to test the steering is crumpled from 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.260
 sheet metal so obviously all this is going to be 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.910
 update as and when 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.470
 weeks to come while waiting for you 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.820

 technological and mumuse with 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.350
 the impressive engine of the game 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.100
 we knew it google has fun at 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.509
 implement many functions 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.130
 hidden in its applications 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.049
 here is for example what happens 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.060
 when you tap tilt in the engine of 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.220
 search a little more consistent 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.379
 by typing 12 values ​​roll one gets one 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.450
 full tour 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.950
 go again for the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.319
 nostalgic of the web just tap 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.150
 google and ninety nine nights and hop on 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.620
 go back the gamers are not 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.720
 not left behind since we write zerg 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.880
 rush the page suffered a frantic attack 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.560
 who will have to try to contain the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.299
 side of google images there is a breakage 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.630
 bricks that pays tribute to old games 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.530
 atari and google translate is same 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.000
 able to beatbox 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.380
 I think it's a good thing 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.540
 youtube we can change laffont of the site 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.920
 by typing certain keywords or playing at 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.500
 little games for that just 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.500
 click on the video is to type 1980 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.230
 and the best for the end which is what 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:01.930
 happens when you tap sweet harlem 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:03.670

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.010
 broken edge sends us click in the 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.570
 life of two characters shea and vela 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.370
 so she is promised a sacrifice 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.990
 for the sake of his village he is 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.680
 raised alone in a large ship that 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.450
 serves as a mom then 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.130
 artistically it's very pretty we play 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.900
 look like nothing and we think back after the fact 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.370
 the universe and history unfolds to 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.480
 through dialogues that are rather 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:44.890
 well written and well translated and for this 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.780
 which is on the point'n'click side we would have 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.220
 liked a little more object to harvest but 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.180
 good for a reintroduction of the kind 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.100
 it is rather successful 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.360

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.260
 to go around is a bit light 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.260

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.300
 a screenshot every click that he 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.920
 performed on his computer 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.990
