00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.530
 Welcome to the preview video 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.179
 from for speed shift the megavideo the 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.610
 preview version is really very much 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.900
 you have to say that you are far advanced 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.730
 there you get a lot 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.880
 Try and now we have it here 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.830
 the same time in the audi r8 set and 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.430
 race through London as we thought 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.140
 there are no graphics 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.120
 more interesting route than London exactly 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.410
 and we are also in the cockpit here 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.180
 There is a natural perspective there 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.370
 so much to see you can see 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.649
 here the cockpit of the speedometer and co 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.329
 not just for the sake of it 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.429
 but that's really back to yourself 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.629
 also move and the rocker degrees 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.670
 do something shortly 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.010
 the fingers move the switches on 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.149
 handlebars and we'll take a quick look 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.100
 Beyond the bridge and have 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.100
 of course, lay the track 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.679
 he misses him wrong , he tells 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.550
 also what happens if we stop at the 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.229
 crashed crash 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.359
 So it is totally blurred 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.370
 black and white, it's just like that 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.109
 can not do anything like that in 23 seconds 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.780
 to see properly and that's what you want 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.850
 avoid too much the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.470
 guardrail as a bouncer is now using 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.220
 Here are the outside perspective as well 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.840
 already a bit 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.210
 Damage is always seen too 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.310
 even further and I have to say 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.380
 my life perspective is still 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.970
 the bumpers view because easy 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.950
 the speed is best red 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.990
 or is it with you thomas yes so one 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.610
 can also be best for the opponents 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.649
 somehow look on his legs 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.070
 what's on it what sticker on it 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.540
 are 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.759
 So I like the bumpers too 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.229
 perspective then but for 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.640
 eye of course have in the video 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.700
 also often a different perspective 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.259
 chosen of course offers such a camera 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.080
 from the cockpit or from behind 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.880
 a little closer or any variant 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.280
 bonnet that is not quite so 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.470
 firmly the choice easy one looks so beautiful 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.140
 the reflection on the bonnet of the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.819
 environment mapping yes so in the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.800
 environment I must say it looks already 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.909
 very pretty 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.319
 spectators move even when they are 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.530
 should stand on the roadside 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.539
 So the damage model is not 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.020
 reference suspicious but it is 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.819
 Of course you can already say for 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.770
 2009 very timely here in the 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.299
 repetition also see natural as 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.130
 just great the cars from their 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.690
 direct insight here will be synonymous again 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.780
 pulled on the steering wheel they are the 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.070
 rocker right the navi so pulls 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.170
 It feels really good 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.500
 really as if you really are in such a 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.820
 real audi a8 sits and here i have to 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.040
 also say the newspapers are beautiful 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.660
 cut beautiful camera angles 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.069
 as I said, raced across the bridge and 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.920
 we missed the track somehow 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.780
 you can also see the tires on the left 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.629
 They fly through the area 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.530
 so if they mature on the roadside 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.459
 started 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.510
 yes and what would actually be a racing game 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.340
 without the nordschleife 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.230
 that is also our speed shift 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.769
 here ferrari lamborghini about the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.799
 nordschleife 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.900
 You can see here at the tacho he is out of focus 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.389
 that means the faster you drive 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.389
 get our look through the track 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.560
 at tempo 250 and is called the tables 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:12.810
 That's why he becomes equal 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:16.019
 out of focus and the crash anyway so the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.280
 Opponents are also aggressive here 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.659
 try each other too 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.519
 overtake right now a shock away 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.199
 I have to say it may be cheese 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.909
 piece too easily through the area 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.669
 flown so is already one 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:30.870
 a few kilos so a race car 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:32.870
 but of course that also happens 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.159
 which sometimes stay here 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.310
 but we do a lot I think so too 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.140
 good so speed must 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.440
 say it's really over there is true 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.540
 also nothing here and there exactly you speak 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.190
 it is the google is in the last 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.530
 years always the problem if you do not 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.970
 plays but you notice a new one here 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.040
 team new engine 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.350
 we have value from the very beginning 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.480
 put that one this time 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.520
 a city ​​can realize the frame rate 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.140
 and it just does not show it completely 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.680
 final but almost final version already 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.920
 very well 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.640
 synonymous to slow motion and that is 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.640
 really cool 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.830
 It is a technically perfect need 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.150
 for speed and it is indeed necessary 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.030
 Almost uncharacteristically it was said that 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.500
 last parts really not technically 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.810
 flawless were there was always here 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.460
 and there stuttering and the racing game who 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.570
 wants to have already stuttering and because of that 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.820
 This is really fun 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.190
 Of course you have to say so too 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.380
 overall, the graphics do not quite reach 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.940
 the quality of the gran turismo so 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.720
 I already have a bit of potential in that 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.950
 next year available respectively 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.360
 potential was gran turismo then 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.520
 just the whole topping can yes 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.520
 which is of course five years
