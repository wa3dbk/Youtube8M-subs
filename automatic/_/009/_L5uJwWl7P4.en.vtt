00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.360
 and what we are going through 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.250
 best the desert in Tucson in Arizona 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.110
 with the walk that the patrol 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.760
 border does with the means of 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.800
 national and international communication 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.620
 so that they know the reality of this 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.190
 border that becomes more and more 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.190
 dangerous 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.110
 can appreciate 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.790
 the roughness of the terrain a lot of rock a lot 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.810
 desert many ridges 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.810
 many thorns 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.140
 and truly an inclement sun 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.659
 it is here where many people are left without 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.659
 Do not even get to your final destination 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.540
 art people comment that the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.450
 one of the main causes that the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.500
 people die is because of the feet because 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.500
 they walk a long time 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.590
 feel as if they were walking on embers 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.940
 then many people are already very tired 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.680
 He has slept little hard and they feel a lot 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.320
 temptation to lie down then it 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.690
 they lie down and can no longer get up 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.640
 them rested and everything then the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.020
 sun is very very strong and the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.020
 temperature at 49 degrees 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.869
 the shadow 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.940
 his name is therefore chaco that works 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.520
 for a newspaper from mexico called 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.320
 reform reform 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.910
 ok you are here is also the tour the 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.100
 today but you already know this border 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.380
 I know the border of the Mexican side and 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.100
 I have talked with people attending 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.100
 the migrants 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.210
 the first time you're here in the of 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.600
 this side because as you thought 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.600
 travel 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.050
 they say that the majority is difficult to the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.810
 people who never walk on all the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.640
 people who come from cities the people who 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.640
 comes from the south that does not know the desert
