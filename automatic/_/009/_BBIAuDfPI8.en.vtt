00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.330
 I could not avoid this champion so much 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.250
 accumulates as it has overwhelming power 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.320
 and a tremendous snowball effect that 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.980
 you can hardly ignore this does 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.180
 what good to this day if he should die 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.279
 in the first levels full not 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.410
 represents a real problem his cv 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.970
 is not so powerful you can do different 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.890
 easily with champions who have 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.050
 distance skills like mor of 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.850
 keyser swing or center followed is a 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.129
 melee champion must be more 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.809
 astute and calculate well your cool down already 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.120
 that in an exchange of damage no doubt 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.010
 you will lose because of your pale waterfall your 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.810
 that shield of the balls from 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.940
 level 6 its mechanics intensify 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.980
 style to call if a cross connects you 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.870
 you must be prepared for the beating already 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.670
 that his combo revolves around that 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.829
 skill if Diana goes crazy and 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.329
 He decides to use his last without a previous one. 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.010
 likely that you can beat him in a 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.229
 exchange depending on the champion who 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.700
 you carry but commonly Vienna does not do that 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.140
 unless you want to reach someone 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.570
 to give him the last blow or to 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.520
 escape if you are badly stopped and it connects you 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.530
 an acknowledgment is worth using flash I do not doubt it 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.690
 remember that the target has a snobbish 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.940
 pretty rude so you will not want 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.340
 feed her in team battles is 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.890
 important that you make your rival adeca stack 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.640
 which will be the target of bullseye and the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.259
 white of diana you understand the white of 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.789
 a tank or a support must 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.619
 take care to avoid the damage to 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.810
 neutralize the target input and so 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.460
 can use it correctly in the game 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.229
 late I recommend confrontations of 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.090
 destination front will do where the carry 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.189
 is in the back for 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.630
 avoid the target step with that should 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.819
 of being enough to finish the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.770
 eclipse of this champion enlighten me with 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.909
