00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.580
 supplements broke the e10 and fight the mine and 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.400
 on self-esteem 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.440
 the euro has more famous supplements 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.320
 food is nothing more than protein 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.869
 of whey and essential criminals 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.670
 is a great option for those who train because 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.869
 favors lean mass gain and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.269
 maintenance of the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.699
 another positive point is the society that 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.980
 with only half or carve can give 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.660
 that family in the middle of the afternoon 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 if your goal is to gain lean mass 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.579
 and always use a source of 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.680
 carbohydrates as well as the carbohydrate 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.050
 replenish spent energy as protein goes 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.379
 be free to enter into the music 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.390
 sea and is nothing more than an acronym 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.489
 in English for me our chain 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.410
 they are the ones that are most 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.600
 present in the muscle and therefore 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.670
 first to be spent to avoid 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 loss of lean mass gives us a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.109
 amount calculated in accordance with your 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.500
 weight just before and after the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.690
 Physical Activity Fights Glutamine 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.369
 essential amino acid for the practice of 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.540
 physical activity but is not exclusive 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.520
 for athletes 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.770
 contrary to what many people think 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.689
 does not bring strength or resistance 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.970
 Some say but I did not feel anything. 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.430
 taking glutamine and not to feel 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.530
 even glutamine acts directly 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.330
 on the wall of the intestine causing 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.250
 the micro-speed is redone 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.570
 thereby increasing the contact surface 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.100
 of food 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.009
 improved absorption of vitamins 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.970
 minerals favoring recovery 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.729
 post workout and immunity restricted use 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.590
 carbohydrate is the main source of 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.479
 energy for our body and motorcycle 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.820
 discipline is nothing more than a source 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 pure carbohydrate for both those who want 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.430
 lose weight and who wants to win 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.950
 lean mass 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.360
 the carbohydrate is essential but calm there 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.790
 Let's do it by steps 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.280
 lose weight who wants to lose weight should 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.259
 not only the quantity at 16 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.600
 carbohydrate consumption schedule 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.909
 This is because for a punch scene 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.899
 there needs to be like that is the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.000
 lean mass 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.340
 therefore carbohydrate consumption should be 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.170
 be preferably before training 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.239
 that way we will provide energy 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.539
 for physical activity presenting the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.969
 more 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.959
 after training, the intake should be 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.819
 be moderate 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.890
 together a source of lean protein 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.200
 Dinner tonight. 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.659
 we should reduce to the maximum so this 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.670
 meal spoke of light physical activity 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.409
 already for those who want to gain lean mass 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.720
 carbohydrate should be present in all 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.700
 meals as well as for those who want 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.590
 lose weight he owes to bach inheritance 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.959
 physics to provide energy for the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.840
 training and soon after along with the protein 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.400
 lean to replenish energy spent and leave 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.010
 the free amino acids to enter the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.290
 musician there is no contraindication but the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.700
 ideal is to implement with carbohydrates 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.620
 only the athletes spends a 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.209
 amount of calories during 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.040
 training and tests 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.989
