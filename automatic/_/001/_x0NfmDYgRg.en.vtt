00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.360 
the square isn't I'm looking for that
spot<00:02:19.430> all<00:02:19.610> right<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:20.120> think<00:02:20.600> yes<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.990> found<00:02:21.200> it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
spot all right I think yes I found it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.650 
spot all right I think yes I found it
and<00:02:22.370> then<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.670> can<00:02:22.790> start<00:02:23.000> working<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.630> your

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
and then you can start working on your

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.960 
and then you can start working on your
drawing<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.400> if<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.490> don't<00:02:25.640> like<00:02:25.700> this

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
drawing and if you don't like this

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.760 
drawing and if you don't like this
shadow<00:02:26.570> here<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:26.990> could<00:02:27.140> also<00:02:27.320> move<00:02:27.710> the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
shadow here you could also move the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.720 
shadow here you could also move the
Kleenex<00:02:28.370> box<00:02:28.820> like<00:02:29.380> away<00:02:30.380> kind<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.370> like<00:02:31.550> that

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
Kleenex box like away kind of like that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
Kleenex box like away kind of like that
and<00:02:32.000> then<00:02:32.150> do<00:02:32.420> shadow<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.900> not<00:02:33.459> there<00:02:34.459> anymore

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
and then do shadow is not there anymore

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.710 
and then do shadow is not there anymore
all<00:02:35.750> right<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.320> that's<00:02:36.500> how<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:36.980> film<00:02:37.459> I'll<00:02:38.390> just

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
all right so that's how I film I'll just

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.520 
all right so that's how I film I'll just
do<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.080> flashback<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:41.990> think<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.410> good

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
do a flashback so I think it's a good

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.250 
do a flashback so I think it's a good
way<00:02:42.740> um<00:02:43.310> keeps<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.270> camera<00:02:44.450> steady<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.110> a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
way um keeps the camera steady and a

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.080 
way um keeps the camera steady and a
buff<00:02:45.500> would<00:02:46.010> have<00:02:46.430> been<00:02:46.760> better<00:02:47.060> if<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.840> had<00:02:47.870> a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
buff would have been better if I had a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.480 
buff would have been better if I had a
an<00:02:50.090> entirely<00:02:50.750> plastic<00:02:51.560> ruler<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.100> then<00:02:52.370> I

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
an entirely plastic ruler and then I

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.890 
an entirely plastic ruler and then I
just<00:02:52.550> start<00:02:53.110> doing<00:02:54.110> my<00:02:54.200> tutorial<00:02:54.770> la<00:02:54.980> la<00:02:55.040> la

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
just start doing my tutorial la la la

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.230

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
picture and you want to like half the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.620 
picture and you want to like half the
camera<00:03:18.230> filming<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:19.100> whole<00:03:19.250> picture<00:03:19.489> all<00:03:20.209> you

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
camera filming the whole picture all you

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.350 
camera filming the whole picture all you
have<00:03:21.050> to<00:03:21.230> do<00:03:21.380> is<00:03:21.620> stack<00:03:21.980> more<00:03:22.310> things<00:03:22.610> up<00:03:22.880> and

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
have to do is stack more things up and

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.290 
have to do is stack more things up and
then<00:03:23.540> put<00:03:23.660> your<00:03:23.870> ipod<00:03:24.050> on<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:25.489> really<00:03:26.060> high

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
then put your ipod on that really high

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.150 
then put your ipod on that really high
stack<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.989> then<00:03:27.170> i'll<00:03:27.440> probably<00:03:27.769> film

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
stack and then i'll probably film

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.240 
stack and then i'll probably film
everything<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:29.720> that's<00:03:29.900> another<00:03:30.200> way<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.500> kind

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
everything so that's another way to kind

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.970 
everything so that's another way to kind
of<00:03:31.340> focus<00:03:31.700> your<00:03:32.000> camera<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.720> if<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:33.830> won't

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
of focus your camera and if you won't

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.460 
of focus your camera and if you won't
need<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.550> even<00:03:34.940> closer<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.810> picture<00:03:36.170> like

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
need it even closer to the picture like

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.280 
need it even closer to the picture like
such<00:03:36.709> as<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:37.100> you<00:03:37.400> could<00:03:38.090> just<00:03:38.300> get<00:03:38.720> smaller

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
such as this you could just get smaller

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.820 
such as this you could just get smaller
things<00:03:39.620> other<00:03:40.489> than<00:03:40.670> Kleenex<00:03:41.300> boxes<00:03:41.830> for

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
things other than Kleenex boxes for

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.979 
things other than Kleenex boxes for
example<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:44.380> tape<00:03:45.380> roller<00:03:46.660> no<00:03:47.660> that's<00:03:47.840> right

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
example a tape roller no that's right

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.280 
example a tape roller no that's right
here<00:03:48.200> put<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.590> balance<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.280> ruler<00:03:49.610> then<00:03:50.570> it's

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
here put the balance the ruler then it's

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.820 
here put the balance the ruler then it's
pretty<00:03:51.590> close<00:03:51.830> so<00:03:52.900> find<00:03:53.900> things<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.560> your

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830
