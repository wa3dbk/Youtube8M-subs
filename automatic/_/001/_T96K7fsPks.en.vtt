and it imports it really quickly and
then<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.690> adds<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.110> library<00:02:18.650> that's<00:02:19.400> a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
then it adds it to a library that's a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.490 
then it adds it to a library that's a
parallel<00:02:20.060> library<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.690> what's<00:02:20.900> on<00:02:21.050> your<00:02:21.290> book

collection on your iBooks app now the
difference<00:02:24.020> here<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.860> can't<00:02:25.130> really

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
difference here is that you can't really

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.000 
difference here is that you can't really
change<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.849> font<00:02:26.120> sizes<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.780> as<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.739> notice

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
pages of the PDF which can get a little

tremendously large file it's not the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.900 
tremendously large file it's not the
greatest<00:02:45.620> for<00:02:46.010> large<00:02:46.220> files<00:02:46.549> if<00:02:46.790> you're

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
greatest for large files if you're

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.430 
greatest for large files if you're
reading<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.239> novel<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.810> regard<00:02:48.170> although

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
another nice thing about PDF files is

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.160 
another nice thing about PDF files is
they'll<00:02:52.519> retain<00:02:52.880> all<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.239> their<00:02:53.810> color<00:02:54.080> and
