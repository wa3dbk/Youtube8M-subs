00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.170
 of materials 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:43.010
 We started by marking the pieces as 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.050
 indicate in the mold remember that 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.420

 leave the link that takes them direct 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.400
 since we have our parts marked 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.160
 We are going to sew them on our machine 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.800
 we are going to sew over the whole line that 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.290
 we mark we are going to sew it completely 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.210
 we will not leave any opening 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.260
 same we do with the other pieces the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.170
 we know all 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.150
 the line that we mark without leaving any 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.850
 opening I'm going to sew them and right now 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.670
 I show what the next step is 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.100
 and almost all my pieces now we're going 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.100
 to remove the excess cloth as 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 they saw things and everything about all 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.049
 lines without leaving any opening if you 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.049
 we cut the excess fabric 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.770
 I already cut all my pieces now for 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.930
 flip it over what we are going to do as in 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.550
 the other videos we are going to make one 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.000
 opening 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.740
 let's open the piece in this way and 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.040
 we are going to do a small here 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.040
 opening 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.550
 to turn it over and so we're going to do it 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.379
 with all the other pieces we make 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.379
 a small opening and flipping it 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.730
 since it flips all my pieces like that 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.520
 they're going to look like these and now we're going 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.830
 to fill them all we are going to fill 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.620
 very well and since we have filled 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.170
 let's close the opening that 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.800
 we did the sewing needle the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.800
 other 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.500
 since we fill our pieces we 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.650
 are going to stay like this now what we are going to 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.760
 to do is to accommodate him the little one to see 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.720
 more or less where will we be 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.830
 to put his eyes 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.830
 more or less there 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.850
 now yes with a black dot marker 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.850
 fine we will mark your eyes 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.299
 i 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.350
 i 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.350
 and 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.910
 i 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.500
 since dry the acrylic paint now yes 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.790
 let's start to put together our 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.270
 little chicken or cock like they want 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.830
 leave you can decorate it to your liking 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.290
 I'm going to use some things that 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.660
 I have at home to decorate it for 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.130
 you can do it to your liking let 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.130
 to start hitting 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:13.159
 that's how we have the little chicken to 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.710
 hang it with one with a bit of tail 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:19.389
 We paste it on the part of the mouse 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.389
 back and we can no longer hang 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.880
 also his hoop to hang the napkin 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.850
 from the kitchen I hope you liked it 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.620

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.210

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.090
 have subscribed to the channel to do so for 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.940
