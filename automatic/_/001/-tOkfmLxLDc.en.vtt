00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.430
 I am launching a large series of lessons and reviews 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.590
 are dedicated to the sketch inga 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.410
 and I will begin by defining what is 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.060
 sketching in drawing this technique 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:32.240
 quick sketch pattern can be called 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.240
 sketch different sketches and sketches 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:43.350
 unfinished drawings and here 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.620
 those of their own world and red folder directions 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.290
 cheng understand their ideas 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 on paper in a different way visualization of ideas 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.300
 for them sketching 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.870
 this is the stage of the image creation 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.360
 the future of the subject or scene whether 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.780
 futuristic landscape or creation 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.810
 some kind of image for promotional purposes 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.389
 example create an image pretty and 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.459
 customers who may be worth 

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:14.310
 somewhere in the mall in front of the showcase 

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:16.799
 she made flow she is pleased and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.499
 happy I'm she rushing to say about 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.469
 this girlfriends and so on and we 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:24.200
 it turns out 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:28.889
 gradually scored from the small . 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 create your sketch image where we pass 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:34.270
 emotions and moods 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.000
 the sketch is made to be as accurate as possible 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.250
 fix the image of the object medicine and 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.689
 pass in the mountain proportions of rockets 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.000
 movements convey a mood example what 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.619
 concerns the dynamics here most often 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.229
 and what I see 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.170
 hehehehehehehe days who have cars 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.299
 For example, we create the image and to the award on 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.579
 which product besides us we take 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:04.060
 immediately recognize the a-silhouette 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:04.810
 got it a truck or a capable machine or 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.709
 for example , 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.630
 again back to the previous sheet and 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.299
 let's talk about the image of a fun family 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.599
 who spend time together ride 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:20.019
 roller skate party features a sketch in 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.599
 that this is a quick drawing this is not 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.380
 means we do it in half a minute 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.500
 for a minute this is what you owe 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:34.840
 lie some period of time 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:37.480
 put your idea on paper 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.359
 these small sketches that is, we 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.120
 We work quickly Well it's not in a hurry case 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:46.299
 in order to pass exactly 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.790
 convey your ideas on paper for this 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.040
 one more visit in chaton features that 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.370
 sketch does not fix but if desired 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.010
 move still Donetsk I clean more 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.920
 until you realize that before 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:06.519
 your meeting words says everything that you 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:08.650
 wanted to say for example let's say here 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.410
 this one to delirious and painted several times 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.200
 until 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.750
 because of the noise of what's up seems 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.080
 completed was to say everything I wanted 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.350
 imagine 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.320
 and last 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.300
 In my opinion this is so special and 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.100
 the sketch is that he needs to stay 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.770
 put the most important things minimal 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.880
 means it is black and white graphics or 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.030
 color suit 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.930
 Chornovil graphics we make such 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.810
 large strokes 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.230
 large strokes are thin we have 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:47.490
 turned into an image released something 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.490
 discussing example color graphics 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.120
