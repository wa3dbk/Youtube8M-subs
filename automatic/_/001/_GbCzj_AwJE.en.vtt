 I'm waiting 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.860
 Oil-based durable acrylic and corresponding features are 1 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:58.910
 High-gloss paint that can be applied directly from above the rust 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:03.500
 Workability succeeds because it is finished by one-time coating 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.850
 3 Special cooperation rust inhibitor suppresses the progress of rust 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.720
 Protects the material from rusting for a long time 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.720
 4Weather resistance is good by adoption of special evil dragon resin 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.800
 Oil-based high-durability acrylic and a mechanism that the sun can be applied directly from above the rust 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.240
 4 minutes 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.240

 Oily coupe regular holiday from the top of rust 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:42.150
 When painting for acrylic resin, a rusted iron plate is covered with a special rust inhibitor and synthetic resin 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.530
 When drying, the special rust inhibitor that has a large specific gravity moves downward 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.530
 Cover the rust that has occurred in Akiramen 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:06.140
 After drying, it has a long-lasting effect due to the effect of a special anticorrosion material that prevents moisture from entering and further covers rust 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.140
 Suppress the occurrence of new rust 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:17.450
 Since oil-based high-durability acrylic and its response are excellent in durability, it will last longer if it is painted once 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.340
 Anti-corrosion effect planning experiment of oil-based highly durable acrylic and sun 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.769
 Paint the paint on the iron plate where rust has occurred in advance 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.629
 If you look at the course put in a testing machine you see that by suppressing the rust
