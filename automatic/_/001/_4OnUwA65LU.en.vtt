today<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.189> flat<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.759> doesn't<00:01:20.970> look<00:01:21.090> like

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
today it's flat this doesn't look like

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.880 
today it's flat this doesn't look like
there's<00:01:21.600> any<00:01:21.780> wind<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> roughness<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
there's any wind so the roughness is

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.200 
there's any wind so the roughness is
going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> factor<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> be

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
type thing we're on a two cycle and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.800 
type thing we're on a two cycle and
we're<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.150> against<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.420> more<00:01:30.570> powerful

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.050 
of it as far as an hour class because I
think<00:03:46.650> we<00:03:46.709> were<00:03:46.769> part<00:03:46.949> up<00:03:47.069> ahead<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.910> guys

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
think we were part up ahead of the guys

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.849 
think we were part up ahead of the guys
we're<00:03:48.239> racing<00:03:48.599> against<00:03:48.780> two<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.440> achieve<00:03:49.709> that

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
we're racing against two to achieve that

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.680 
we're racing against two to achieve that
so<00:03:50.129> I<00:03:50.459> think<00:03:50.669> we<00:03:50.879> still<00:03:51.060> end<00:03:51.209> up<00:03:51.269> with<00:03:51.329> a<00:03:51.480> post

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
so I think we still end up with a post

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.740 
so I think we still end up with a post
from<00:03:52.489> two-stroke<00:03:53.489> national<00:03:53.940> championship<00:03:54.480> so

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
from two-stroke national championship so

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.009 
from two-stroke national championship so
I'm<00:03:55.440> happy<00:03:55.680> with<00:03:55.859> that<00:03:56.150> but<00:03:57.150> all<00:03:57.599> in<00:03:57.750> all<00:03:57.810> this

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
I'm happy with that but all in all this

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.979 
I'm happy with that but all in all this
is<00:03:58.079> a<00:03:58.260> huge<00:03:58.560> success<00:03:58.739> this<00:03:59.099> event<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.549> I<00:04:00.150> think

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
is a huge success this event and I think

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.869 
is a huge success this event and I think

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
we really set the mark here for the

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.760 
we really set the mark here for the
future<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.209> this<00:04:03.449> type<00:04:03.659> of<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.900> venue
