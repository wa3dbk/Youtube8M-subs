00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.780 

normally<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.540> game<00:01:51.810> isn't<00:01:52.020> designed<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:53.520> be

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
normally this game isn't designed to be

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.170 
normally this game isn't designed to be
played<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.420> far<00:01:54.810> away<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> we'll<00:01:56.969> move<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
played this far away so we'll move a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.859 
played this far away so we'll move a
little<00:01:57.420> closer<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.409> through<00:01:58.619> that

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
little closer just to get through that

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.770 
little closer just to get through that
the<00:02:00.869> first<00:02:01.200> level<00:02:02.159> stuff<00:02:02.579> here

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.970 

it's<00:02:06.780> kind<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:06.990> weird<00:02:07.170> right<00:02:07.470> but<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:07.920> so

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
it's kind of weird right but that's so

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.100 
it's kind of weird right but that's so
funny<00:02:11.300> right<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:12.420> your<00:02:12.570> chest<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
funny right now your chest is a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
funny right now your chest is a
pulsating<00:02:13.770> I'm<00:02:14.310> being<00:02:14.550> shown<00:02:14.760> yeah<00:02:22.010> it'd<00:02:23.010> be

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
pulsating I'm being shown yeah it'd be

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.340 
pulsating I'm being shown yeah it'd be
easier<00:02:23.430> if<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:23.670> move<00:02:23.970> closer<00:02:24.300> but<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.110> looks

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
easier if I move closer but it looks

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.120 
easier if I move closer but it looks
cooler<00:02:26.150> when<00:02:27.150> you're<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.600> shot<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.260> it's

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
cooler when you're in the shot so it's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.250 
cooler when you're in the shot so it's
going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.370> struggle<00:02:29.610> through<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.260> archery

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
skip through the tutorial stuff see

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.460 
skip through the tutorial stuff see
touch<00:04:37.419> screen

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.650 

OOP<00:04:43.470> too<00:04:44.190> close<00:04:45.260> and<00:04:46.260> then<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:47.580> found<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.510> if

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
OOP too close and then I found that if

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.520 
OOP too close and then I found that if
you<00:04:48.780> put<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.139> on<00:04:49.290> spear<00:04:50.220> it's<00:04:50.700> kind<00:04:50.820> of<00:04:50.940> cool

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
you put it on spear it's kind of cool

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.810 
you put it on spear it's kind of cool
and<00:04:52.530> then<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:52.889> can<00:04:53.040> actually<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:53.400> think<00:04:53.460> move

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
and then you can actually I think move

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:02.210 
and then you can actually I think move
it<00:04:54.650> around<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:01.440> then<00:05:01.470> we'll<00:05:01.620> do<00:05:01.740> another<00:05:01.770> shot

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
it around and then we'll do another shot

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.830 
it around and then we'll do another shot
from<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.550> side<00:05:02.760> of<00:05:02.790> your<00:05:03.060> life<00:05:03.240> it<00:05:03.540> definitely

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
from the side of your life it definitely

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.379 
from the side of your life it definitely
looks<00:05:04.110> cool<00:05:04.350> when<00:05:04.470> it's<00:05:04.620> like<00:05:04.830> kind<00:05:05.100> of

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
looks cool when it's like kind of

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:13.760 
looks cool when it's like kind of
floating<00:05:06.389> in<00:05:06.480> front<00:05:06.660> of<00:05:06.840> it<00:05:12.260> yeah<00:05:13.260> it's<00:05:13.440> topic

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
floating in front of it yeah it's topic

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.140 
floating in front of it yeah it's topic
it<00:05:13.980> loses<00:05:14.160> a<00:05:14.370> little<00:05:14.610> bit<00:05:14.790> when<00:05:14.940> you<00:05:15.000> move

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
it loses a little bit when you move

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.850 
it loses a little bit when you move
sideways<00:05:15.450> and<00:05:15.840> probably<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.410> lighting<00:05:16.710> in

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
sideways and probably the lighting in

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:25.960 
sideways and probably the lighting in
here<00:05:16.890> isn't<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.750> super<00:05:18.750> great<00:05:18.900> there<00:05:19.230> you<00:05:19.350> go

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.300 

put<00:05:26.970> some<00:05:27.150> stars<00:05:27.450> on<00:05:27.750> there

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.550 

okay<00:05:33.310> so<00:05:33.400> that's<00:05:33.610> pretty<00:05:33.820> weird<00:05:34.410> let's<00:05:35.410> see

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
okay so that's pretty weird let's see

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:48.590 
okay so that's pretty weird let's see
what<00:05:35.680> else<00:05:35.710> we<00:05:36.010> can<00:05:36.040> do<00:05:36.280> here

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.900 

I<00:05:48.660> got<00:05:49.590> up<00:05:49.680> closer<00:05:50.100> I<00:05:50.340> guess<00:05:52.700> yeah<00:05:53.700> if<00:05:53.790> you<00:05:53.880> like

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
I got up closer I guess yeah if you like

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.730 
I got up closer I guess yeah if you like
the<00:05:54.120> sideways<00:05:54.600> stuff<00:05:54.900> works<00:05:55.260> better<00:05:55.560> when

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
the sideways stuff works better when

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:11.959 
the sideways stuff works better when
it's<00:05:55.920> closer<00:05:58.970> we<00:05:59.970> can<00:06:00.090> try<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.300> meat<00:06:00.510> x

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.609 

now<00:06:12.569> let<00:06:12.659> me<00:06:12.719> turn<00:06:12.899> them<00:06:13.110> back<00:06:13.229> a<00:06:13.289> little<00:06:13.469> bit

00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:13.619 
now let me turn them back a little bit

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:14.869 
now let me turn them back a little bit
if<00:06:13.829> you<00:06:13.949> want<00:06:14.099> to<00:06:14.159> move<00:06:14.249> forward<00:06:14.309> so<00:06:14.789> I'm

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:14.879 
if you want to move forward so I'm
