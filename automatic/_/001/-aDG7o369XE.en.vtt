00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
decided to get a little creative and but

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.910 
decided to get a little creative and but
I<00:01:27.479> could<00:01:27.720> eliminate<00:01:27.960> some<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> problems

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
involved with that and actually ended up

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.899 
involved with that and actually ended up
creating<00:01:30.900> more<00:01:31.229> problems<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:32.070> hindsight<00:01:32.579> yes

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
creating more problems in hindsight yes

because<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> chassis<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> lift<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
because the chassis was on the lift and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.749 
because the chassis was on the lift and
we<00:02:01.259> had<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.829> at<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> certain<00:02:02.340> height<00:02:02.549> to

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
we had to have it at a certain height to

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.850 
we had to have it at a certain height to
be<00:02:02.880> able<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> balance<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.649> had<00:02:04.770> this

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
be able to balance it is if you had this

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.010 
be able to balance it is if you had this
whole<00:02:04.979> snowball<00:02:05.399> effect<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.149> we

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
whole snowball effect going on we

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.719 
whole snowball effect going on we
actually<00:02:07.380> had<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> raise<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.129> rear<00:02:08.310> end<00:02:08.550> which

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
actually had to raise the rear end which

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.700 
actually had to raise the rear end which
was<00:02:08.819> fully<00:02:09.119> assembled<00:02:09.660> already

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
was fully assembled already

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.910 
was fully assembled already
into<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> chassis<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:13.470> doesn't<00:02:13.650> sound

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
into the chassis now that doesn't sound

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.560 
into the chassis now that doesn't sound
like<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.190> much<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:14.970> rear<00:02:15.180> ends<00:02:15.420> got

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
like that much but this rear ends got

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.060 
like that much but this rear ends got
away<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.870> don't<00:02:16.080> know<00:02:16.290> 300<00:02:16.680> pounds<00:02:16.950> or

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
away I don't know 300 pounds or

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.190 
away I don't know 300 pounds or
something<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:18.960> trying

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
something like that so you know trying

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.840 
something like that so you know trying
to<00:02:19.260> muscle<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.710> into<00:02:19.920> place<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.760> know

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
to muscle it into place with you know

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.670 
to muscle it into place with you know
our<00:02:21.060> weakling<00:02:21.450> muscles<00:02:21.870> isn't<00:02:22.200> necessarily

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
our weakling muscles isn't necessarily

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.730 
our weakling muscles isn't necessarily
the<00:02:22.950> best<00:02:23.130> idea<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.750> how<00:02:25.050> Currie<00:02:25.410> or

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
the best idea this is not how Currie or

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.830 
the best idea this is not how Currie or
my<00:02:26.010> chiropractor<00:02:26.760> recommends<00:02:27.270> installation

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
my chiropractor recommends installation

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.900 
my chiropractor recommends installation
of<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.990> nine-inch<00:02:28.380> rear<00:02:28.440> end<00:02:28.800> even<00:02:29.460> been<00:02:29.670> pack

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
of a nine-inch rear end even been pack

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.120 
of a nine-inch rear end even been pack
has<00:02:30.120> other<00:02:30.300> ideas<00:02:33.410> we<00:02:34.410> went<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.680> install<00:02:34.980> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
has other ideas we went to install the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.100 
has other ideas we went to install the
front<00:02:35.370> drive<00:02:35.730> shaft<00:02:35.760> first<00:02:36.510> which

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
front drive shaft first which

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.610 
front drive shaft first which
theoretically<00:02:38.010> should<00:02:38.160> be<00:02:38.520> okay<00:02:39.350> got<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.500> all

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
theoretically should be okay got it all

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.320 
theoretically should be okay got it all
in<00:02:40.650> there<00:02:40.830> things<00:02:41.340> are<00:02:41.490> looking<00:02:41.760> great

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
in there things are looking great

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.780 
in there things are looking great
you<00:02:42.480> know<00:02:42.600> anyhow<00:02:43.590> go<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.860> put<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> rear<00:02:44.580> one

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
you know anyhow go to put the rear one

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.430 
you know anyhow go to put the rear one
in<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.240> realize<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.810> wasn't<00:02:46.020> going<00:02:46.320> in

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
in and realize that it wasn't going in

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.810 
in and realize that it wasn't going in
so<00:02:46.590> we<00:02:46.680> ended<00:02:46.800> up<00:02:46.890> pulling<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.280> whole<00:02:47.459> system

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
so we ended up pulling the whole system

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.150 
so we ended up pulling the whole system
out<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.000> assembling<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.080> bench<00:02:49.320> we

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
out and assembling it on the bench we

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.880 
out and assembling it on the bench we
realized<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.730> there's<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.209> pork<00:02:51.750> seal<00:02:52.200> inside

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
realized that there's a pork seal inside

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.600 
realized that there's a pork seal inside
the<00:02:53.040> splines<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.630> secondary<00:02:55.170> shaft<00:02:55.610> that

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the splines of the secondary shaft that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.790 
the splines of the secondary shaft that
was<00:02:56.760> kind<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.030> holding<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.750> up<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.200> we<00:02:58.620> took

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
was kind of holding it up so we took

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.980 
was kind of holding it up so we took
that<00:02:58.860> apart<00:02:59.340> assembled<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.660> bench<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
that apart assembled it on the bench and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.570 
that apart assembled it on the bench and
then<00:03:01.110> assembled<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.620> all<00:03:01.740> as<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.040> unit<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.459> the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
then assembled it all as one unit in the

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.170 
then assembled it all as one unit in the
car<00:03:03.470> at<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.800> pace<00:03:05.070> we<00:03:05.490> could<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.910> more<00:03:06.150> than

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
car at this pace we could have more than

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.600 
car at this pace we could have more than
a<00:03:06.330> rolling<00:03:06.720> chassis<00:03:06.930> if<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:07.560> tried<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:08.370> could

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
a rolling chassis if we tried we could

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.790 
a rolling chassis if we tried we could
have<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:09.030> running<00:03:09.480> chassis<00:03:09.930> we<00:03:10.350> only<00:03:10.530> need<00:03:10.770> a

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
have a running chassis we only need a

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.699 
have a running chassis we only need a
couple<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.280> key<00:03:11.520> things<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:12.720> would<00:03:13.200> be<00:03:13.350> four

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
couple of key things this would be four

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.280 
couple of key things this would be four
