let's take a look at the chum stick in

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.330 
let's take a look at the chum stick in
action<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:50.540> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.560> chum<00:01:52.829> stick<00:01:52.950> is

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
action as you can see the chum stick is

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.550 
action as you can see the chum stick is
oriented<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.259> upright<00:01:55.259> vertical

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
oriented in the upright vertical

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.319 
oriented in the upright vertical
position<00:01:56.310> with<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.119> bait<00:01:57.469> suspended<00:01:58.909> up<00:01:59.909> off

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
position with the bait suspended up off

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.950 
position with the bait suspended up off
the<00:02:00.540> bottom<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> rocks<00:02:02.960> this

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the bottom and out of the rocks this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
the bottom and out of the rocks this
gives<00:02:04.290> us<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.770> ability

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
gives us the ability

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.400 
gives us the ability
to<00:02:06.509> work<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.229> bank<00:02:07.470> as<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:09.720> move<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.170> chum

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
to work the bank as we move the chum

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.809 
to work the bank as we move the chum
stick<00:02:11.209> across<00:02:12.209> them<00:02:12.569> up<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.620> notice<00:02:14.370> how<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
stick across them up and notice how the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.490 
stick across them up and notice how the
chum<00:02:15.209> stick<00:02:15.440> easily<00:02:16.440> slides<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.580> out<00:02:17.730> of

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
chum stick easily slides in and out of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.559 
chum stick easily slides in and out of
the<00:02:19.500> sharp<00:02:19.800> crevices<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.580> rocks<00:02:20.700> as<00:02:21.180> we

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
the sharp crevices of the rocks as we

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.800 
the sharp crevices of the rocks as we
move<00:02:21.810> across<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.230> bottom<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:24.450> allows<00:02:24.780> us

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
move across the bottom this allows us

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.640 
move across the bottom this allows us
again<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:26.100> cover<00:02:26.400> more<00:02:26.700> territory<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.650> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
again to cover more territory and to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:41.270 
again to cover more territory and to
locate<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.790> track<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.450> catch<00:02:30.930> more<00:02:31.230> fish<00:02:40.280> so

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
locate a track and catch more fish so
