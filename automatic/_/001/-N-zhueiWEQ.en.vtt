devices and that side of the industry

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.740 
devices and that side of the industry
have<00:02:50.590> become<00:02:50.950> huge<00:02:51.370> now<00:02:52.150> we're<00:02:52.390> trying<00:02:52.630> to

will be categories of products that will

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.680 
will be categories of products that will

to develop even more categories in the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.220 
to develop even more categories in the

future that's one major focus of Sony

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.520 
future that's one major focus of Sony
it's<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.160> big<00:03:15.460> future<00:03:15.880> strategy<00:03:16.510> clearly<00:03:17.380> I'm

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
it's a big future strategy clearly I'm

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.199 
it's a big future strategy clearly I'm
not<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.740> only<00:03:18.070> one<00:03:18.370> who's<00:03:18.550> been<00:03:18.730> reading<00:03:18.940> the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
not the only one who's been reading the

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.720 
not the only one who's been reading the
22<00:03:19.660> immutable<00:03:19.840> laws<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.410> marketing<00:03:21.070> where<00:03:21.610> it

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
22 immutable laws of marketing where it

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.760 
22 immutable laws of marketing where it
states<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.720> best<00:03:22.990> product<00:03:23.560> does<00:03:23.740> not

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
states that the best product does not

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.310 
states that the best product does not

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.449 
users mind wins
hence<00:03:28.720> Sony<00:03:29.440> should<00:03:29.680> not<00:03:29.830> try<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.100> compete

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
hence Sony should not try and compete

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.340 
hence Sony should not try and compete
with<00:03:30.490> Samsung<00:03:31.209> they<00:03:31.660> should<00:03:31.870> create<00:03:32.170> their

with Samsung they should create their

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.040 
with Samsung they should create their
own<00:03:32.380> category<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.430> be<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> first<00:03:34.240> brand<00:03:34.720> in
