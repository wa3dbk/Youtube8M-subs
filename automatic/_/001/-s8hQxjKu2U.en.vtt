Georgia we all pulled out the motor way
faster<00:00:26.630> than<00:00:26.660> expected<00:00:27.410> by<00:00:27.890> using<00:00:28.309> teamwork

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:29.059 
faster than expected by using teamwork

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.960 
faster than expected by using teamwork
and<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:30.020> lot<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.349> already<00:00:30.710> previous<00:00:31.430> experience

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
and a lot of already previous experience

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.860 
and a lot of already previous experience
with<00:00:32.029> 240s

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
with 240s

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.080 
with 240s
we<00:00:33.320> ripped<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:33.739> motor<00:00:33.920> out<00:00:34.130> really<00:00:34.730> quickly

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
we ripped the motor out really quickly

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.020 
we ripped the motor out really quickly
so<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.809> next<00:00:36.079> step<00:00:36.380> after<00:00:36.590> that<00:00:36.920> is<00:00:37.370> to<00:00:37.640> remove

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030
