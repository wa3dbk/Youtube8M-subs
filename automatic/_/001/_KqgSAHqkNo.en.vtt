this<00:00:46.800> little<00:00:46.979> fella

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.310 

there<00:01:10.189> are<00:01:10.280> two<00:01:10.460> ways<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:11.119> install<00:01:11.390> shadow

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
there are two ways to install shadow

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.200 
there are two ways to install shadow
pickups<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.340> first<00:01:13.549> ways<00:01:13.759> you<00:01:13.939> can<00:01:14.090> do<00:01:14.180> it

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
pickups and the first ways you can do it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.240 
pickups and the first ways you can do it
externally<00:01:14.990> which<00:01:15.140> means<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:15.470> can<00:01:15.619> sit<00:01:15.890> it<00:01:16.070> in

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
externally which means you can sit it in

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.899 
externally which means you can sit it in
the<00:01:16.340> soundhole

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
the soundhole

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.580 
the soundhole
and<00:01:17.180> have<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.600> cable<00:01:18.079> that<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.229> attach<00:01:18.560> that

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
and have a cable that you attach that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.469 
and have a cable that you attach that
comes<00:01:18.979> out<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.280> sound<00:01:19.490> hole<00:01:19.670> for<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.240> really

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
comes out the sound hole for a really

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.660 
comes out the sound hole for a really
quick<00:01:20.750> installation<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:22.220> other<00:01:22.430> way<00:01:22.610> to

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
quick installation the other way to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.670 
quick installation the other way to
install<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.060> shadow<00:01:23.270> acoustic<00:01:23.750> pickup<00:01:24.110> is<00:01:24.500> to

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
install the shadow acoustic pickup is to

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.020 
install the shadow acoustic pickup is to
drill<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.920> hole<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.340> bottom<00:01:25.729> of<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.939> guitar

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
drill a hole in the bottom of the guitar

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.350 
drill a hole in the bottom of the guitar
and<00:01:26.509> insert<00:01:27.289> a<00:01:27.530> stereo<00:01:28.189> end<00:01:28.429> pin<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.210> it's

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
and insert a stereo end pin so it's

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.880 
and insert a stereo end pin so it's
permanently<00:01:29.780> in<00:01:29.899> place<00:01:29.929> in<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.500> guitar<00:01:30.799> and

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
permanently in place in the guitar and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.800 
permanently in place in the guitar and
the<00:01:30.979> sound<00:01:31.189> hole<00:01:31.340> now<00:01:32.000> both<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.539> these

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
the sound hole now both of these

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.929 
the sound hole now both of these
procedures<00:01:33.020> are<00:01:33.590> really<00:01:34.159> quick<00:01:34.429> really

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
procedures are really quick really

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.510 
procedures are really quick really
simple<00:01:35.210> not<00:01:36.049> a<00:01:36.079> problem<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.530> do<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.189> don't

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
simple not a problem to do so don't

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:49.730 
simple not a problem to do so don't
panic<00:01:37.700> about<00:01:37.909> DIY<00:01:38.329> skills

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.000 

as<00:01:50.740> you<00:01:51.520> can<00:01:51.700> probably<00:01:51.880> see<00:01:52.360> here<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.770> SH

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
as you can probably see here the SH

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.880 
as you can probably see here the SH
one-for-one<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.550> powered<00:01:54.880> by<00:01:55.090> two<00:01:55.510> of<00:01:55.630> these

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
one-for-one is powered by two of these

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.830 
one-for-one is powered by two of these
three<00:01:56.890> volt<00:01:57.280> cell<00:01:57.730> batteries<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.390> they're

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
three volt cell batteries and they're

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.090 
three volt cell batteries and they're
environmentally<00:01:59.200> friendly<00:01:59.650> which<00:01:59.770> is<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.920> nice

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
environmentally friendly which is a nice

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.340 
environmentally friendly which is a nice
touch<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:00.610> they<00:02:00.940> last<00:02:01.150> for<00:02:01.450> ages<00:02:01.900> which<00:02:02.200> is

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
touch and they last for ages which is

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:15.440 
touch and they last for ages which is
really<00:02:02.710> handy

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.670 

so<00:02:16.450> basically<00:02:16.900> if<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.140> want<00:02:17.320> crisp

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
so basically if you want crisp

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.670 
so basically if you want crisp
articulate<00:02:18.670> single-coil<00:02:19.510> type<00:02:19.930> bright

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
articulate single-coil type bright

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.550 
articulate single-coil type bright

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
acoustic tones the sh-1 for one is a

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.730 
acoustic tones the sh-1 for one is a
reliable<00:02:24.190> workhorse<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.060> pickup<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.740> bring

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
reliable workhorse of the pickup I bring

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.400 
reliable workhorse of the pickup I bring
you<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.220> SH<00:02:27.670> 330<00:02:28.240> from<00:02:28.540> shadow<00:02:28.750> pickups

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
you the SH 330 from shadow pickups

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.370 
you the SH 330 from shadow pickups
this<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.800> passive<00:02:30.570> single<00:02:31.570> coil<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:32.260> a

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
this is a passive single coil in a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.530 
this is a passive single coil in a
beautiful<00:02:33.040> maple<00:02:33.430> case<00:02:34.030> which<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.510> think

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
beautiful maple case which I think

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:48.420 
beautiful maple case which I think
probably<00:02:35.200> adds<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> tone<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:47.440> 330<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.280> one

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
probably adds to the tone the 330 is one

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.540 
probably adds to the tone the 330 is one
of<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.580> world's<00:02:48.790> most<00:02:49.030> popular<00:02:49.390> passive

single coil pickups for acoustic guitars

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.680 
single coil pickups for acoustic guitars
it's<00:02:52.990> really<00:02:53.500> really<00:02:53.950> simple<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.460> insert<00:02:54.850> and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
it's really really simple to insert and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.950 
it's really really simple to insert and
here<00:02:55.960> is<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.080> video<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.440> me<00:02:56.680> doing<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.900> you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
here is a video of me doing this as you

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.170 
here is a video of me doing this as you
can<00:02:59.140> see<00:02:59.410> it's<00:02:59.950> just<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.160> very<00:03:00.340> quick<00:03:00.460> flick

can see it's just a very quick flick

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.690 
can see it's just a very quick flick
into<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.480> hole<00:03:01.660> twist<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.710> in<00:03:02.800> place<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.370> away

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
into the hole twist it in place and away

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.430 
into the hole twist it in place and away
you<00:03:03.730> go
