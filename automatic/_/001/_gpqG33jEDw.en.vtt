head<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.400> dimmer<00:01:52.580> control<00:01:53.030> plus<00:01:53.299> this<00:01:53.540> light

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
head of dimmer control plus this light

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.859 
head of dimmer control plus this light
is<00:01:53.870> only<00:01:53.990> one<00:01:54.200> color<00:01:54.440> temperature<00:01:55.090> they<00:01:56.090> skews

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
is only one color temperature they skews

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.810 
is only one color temperature they skews
blue<00:01:57.200> like<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.590> lot<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:57.920> LED<00:01:58.250> lighting<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:58.760> I

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
blue like a lot of LED lighting so I

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.940 
blue like a lot of LED lighting so I
wanted<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.180> way<00:01:59.330> I<00:01:59.570> wanted<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.290> light<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.710> allow

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
wanted a way I wanted a light to allow

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.100 
wanted a way I wanted a light to allow
me<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.250> change<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.820> color<00:02:02.060> temperature<00:02:02.299> but<00:02:03.080> I

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
me to change the color temperature but I

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.390 
me to change the color temperature but I
also<00:02:03.260> didn't<00:02:03.500> want<00:02:03.560> one<00:02:03.799> of<00:02:03.830> those<00:02:04.040> huge

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
also didn't want one of those huge

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.960 
also didn't want one of those huge
lights<00:02:04.760> like<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.150> 96<00:02:05.720> or<00:02:05.869> 126<00:02:06.740> LED<00:02:07.130> lights<00:02:07.369> are

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
lights like the 96 or 126 LED lights are

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.149 
lights like the 96 or 126 LED lights are
pretty<00:02:08.299> big<00:02:08.659> I<00:02:09.049> didn't<00:02:09.679> want<00:02:09.799> to<00:02:09.860> have<00:02:09.979> all

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
pretty big I didn't want to have all

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.420 
bright give you plenty of illumination I
think<00:02:52.870> for<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.350> purpose<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.890> want<00:02:54.160> and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
think for the purpose that I want and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.000 
think for the purpose that I want and
you<00:02:55.240> can<00:02:55.360> also<00:02:55.510> dim<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.470> can<00:02:56.680> find<00:02:56.920> a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
you can also dim it so I can find a

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.130 
you can also dim it so I can find a
happy<00:02:57.250> medium<00:02:57.420> when<00:02:58.420> I'm<00:02:58.570> running<00:02:58.960> around

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
happy medium when I'm running around

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.680 
happy medium when I'm running around
with<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.710> so<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.280> people<00:03:00.310> aren't<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.660> know

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
with this so that people aren't you know

face as I blind them I can actually

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.480 
face as I blind them I can actually
maybe<00:03:04.720> control<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.590> put<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.430> a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
maybe control this and put it in a

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.790 
maybe control this and put it in a
decent<00:03:06.700> spot<00:03:07.170> another<00:03:08.170> nice<00:03:08.410> thing<00:03:08.440> about

decent spot another nice thing about

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.430 
decent spot another nice thing about
this<00:03:09.490> light<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.720> comes<00:03:10.930> with<00:03:11.230> these

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
this light is that it comes with these

this light is that it comes with these
color<00:03:11.950> temperature<00:03:12.460> plates<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.180> a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
color temperature plates this is a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.410 
color temperature plates this is a
tungsten<00:03:14.290> it's<00:03:15.100> an<00:03:15.190> orange<00:03:15.460> plate<00:03:15.790> they'll

tungsten it's an orange plate they'll

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.730 
tungsten it's an orange plate they'll
change<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.840> color<00:03:17.020> temperature<00:03:17.260> as<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.620> can

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
change the color temperature as you can

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.860 
change the color temperature as you can
see<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:18.070> goes<00:03:18.280> kind<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.090> from<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.420> blue

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
see it goes kind of from the blue

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.530 
see it goes kind of from the blue
typical<00:03:20.680> normal<00:03:20.980> LED<00:03:21.430> lights<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.060> more<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.480> a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
typical normal LED lights and more of a

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.360 
typical normal LED lights and more of a
white<00:03:22.750> because<00:03:23.230> I've<00:03:23.410> white<00:03:23.680> balance<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.250> to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
white because I've white balance it to

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.310 
white because I've white balance it to
the<00:03:25.060> tungsten<00:03:25.360> color<00:03:25.720> temperature

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
the tungsten color temperature

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.980 
the tungsten color temperature
interestingly<00:03:27.130> if<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.270> hold<00:03:28.450> up<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.750> harbor

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
interestingly if you hold up the harbor

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.530 
interestingly if you hold up the harbor
freight<00:03:29.380> tools<00:03:29.410> light<00:03:30.160> as<00:03:30.430> well<00:03:30.700> which<00:03:31.510> is

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
freight tools light as well which is

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.050 
freight tools light as well which is
very<00:03:31.690> blue<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:32.980> put<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.459> front<00:03:33.490> it

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
very blue and you put this in front it

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.440 
very blue and you put this in front it
works<00:03:34.360> also<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:35.530> theory<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:36.670> could<00:03:36.940> get

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
works also so in theory you could get

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.880 
works also so in theory you could get
some<00:03:37.780> CTO<00:03:38.500> gel<00:03:38.700> cut<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:39.790> out<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.060> fit<00:03:40.270> this<00:03:40.510> and

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
some CTO gel cut it out to fit this and

this shape here cut the gel out in that
shape<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.580> then<00:03:54.640> maybe<00:03:54.850> spray<00:03:55.270> glue<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.660> on<00:03:55.780> it

this<00:05:38.880> weekend<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:40.440> if<00:05:40.620> anything<00:05:40.980> goes<00:05:41.130> wrong

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
this weekend and if anything goes wrong

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.160 
this weekend and if anything goes wrong
with<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.610> I'll<00:05:41.730> definitely<00:05:42.330> let<00:05:42.900> everyone

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
with it I'll definitely let everyone

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.800 
with it I'll definitely let everyone
know<00:05:43.290> but<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:43.770> think<00:05:44.130> it's<00:05:44.310> a<00:05:44.400> great<00:05:44.550> option<00:05:45.180> for

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
know but I think it's a great option for

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.200 
know but I think it's a great option for
a<00:05:46.380> decent<00:05:46.920> price<00:05:47.340> you<00:05:47.640> know<00:05:47.730> eighteen<00:05:48.090> to

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
a decent price you know eighteen to

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.090 
a decent price you know eighteen to
twenty<00:05:48.450> dollars<00:05:48.570> isn't<00:05:48.960> bad<00:05:49.260> and<00:05:49.620> again<00:05:50.070> I

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
twenty dollars isn't bad and again I

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.800 
twenty dollars isn't bad and again I
mean<00:05:50.280> I<00:05:50.430> like<00:05:50.610> kind<00:05:50.850> of<00:05:50.910> the<00:05:51.000> profile<00:05:51.480> of<00:05:51.630> this

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
mean I like kind of the profile of this

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.670 
mean I like kind of the profile of this
how<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.080> whole<00:05:52.260> thing<00:05:52.470> looks<00:05:52.740> because

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
how the whole thing looks because

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.050 
how the whole thing looks because
typically<00:05:55.680> these<00:05:55.980> LED<00:05:56.370> lights<00:05:56.400> that<00:05:56.730> you<00:05:56.880> get

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
typically these LED lights that you get

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.750 
typically these LED lights that you get
are<00:05:57.180> just<00:05:57.300> giant<00:05:57.920> in<00:05:58.920> the<00:05:59.040> ninety<00:05:59.280> six<00:05:59.310> of<00:05:59.700> the

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
are just giant in the ninety six of the

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.080 
are just giant in the ninety six of the
120<00:06:00.210> 126<00:06:01.140> LED<00:06:01.590> lights<00:06:01.830> are<00:06:02.010> pretty<00:06:02.190> big<00:06:02.460> this

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
120 126 LED lights are pretty big this

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.140 
120 126 LED lights are pretty big this
is<00:06:03.300> a<00:06:03.330> little<00:06:03.600> smaller<00:06:04.880> which<00:06:05.880> I<00:06:06.060> actually

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
is a little smaller which I actually

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.970 
is a little smaller which I actually
like<00:06:06.510> because<00:06:06.720> I<00:06:06.900> think<00:06:06.930> it<00:06:07.110> fits<00:06:07.320> well<00:06:07.470> with

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
like because I think it fits well with

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.730 
like because I think it fits well with
my<00:06:08.340> PVC<00:06:09.180> stabiliser<00:06:09.810> rig<00:06:10.110> so<00:06:10.350> I<00:06:10.380> think<00:06:10.650> I'm
