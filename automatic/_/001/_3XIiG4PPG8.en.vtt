00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
this it would give you the same amount

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.449 
this it would give you the same amount
of<00:03:10.079> storage<00:03:10.319> as<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.590> chest<00:03:11.010> but<00:03:11.220> you're<00:03:11.340> gonna

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
of storage as a chest but you're gonna

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.129 
of storage as a chest but you're gonna
be<00:03:11.640> using<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.150> little<00:03:12.299> bit<00:03:12.480> more<00:03:12.630> wood<00:03:12.930> to

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
be using it a little bit more wood to

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.860 
be using it a little bit more wood to
get<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.680> sweet<00:03:14.069> look<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.670> great<00:03:15.299> now<00:03:15.840> I

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
get that sweet look of the great now I

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.780 
get that sweet look of the great now I
guess<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.739> reason<00:03:16.889> why<00:03:17.069> I<00:03:17.100> really<00:03:17.489> like<00:03:17.639> this

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
guess the reason why I really like this

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.309 
guess the reason why I really like this
is<00:03:18.000> when<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.239> open<00:03:18.569> it<00:03:18.630> it's<00:03:18.810> almost<00:03:19.079> like

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
is when you open it it's almost like

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.199 
is when you open it it's almost like
you're<00:03:19.440> opening<00:03:19.889> up<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.250> piece<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.819> tree

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
you're opening up a piece of a tree

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.180 
you're opening up a piece of a tree
trunk<00:03:21.569> it's<00:03:21.989> like<00:03:22.200> hidden<00:03:22.590> treasures<00:03:23.010> are

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
trunk it's like hidden treasures are

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.830 
trunk it's like hidden treasures are
inside<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.700> this<00:03:23.819> that'd<00:03:24.299> be<00:03:24.329> pretty<00:03:24.630> sweet

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
inside of this that'd be pretty sweet

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.080 
inside of this that'd be pretty sweet
now<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.530> next<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.920> these<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.489> obsidian

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
now the next of these is the obsidian

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.180 
now the next of these is the obsidian
site<00:03:27.510> now<00:03:28.079> all<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.380> have<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.530> do<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.799> crafters

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
site now all you have to do the crafters

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.710 
site now all you have to do the crafters
is<00:03:29.400> put<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.849> chest<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.359> middle<00:03:30.599> and

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
is put a chest in the middle and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.420 
is put a chest in the middle and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
surround it with a whole heap in town of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.520 
surround it with a whole heap in town of
obsidian<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.720> will<00:03:33.959> provide<00:03:34.319> you

obsidian and this will provide you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.620 
obsidian and this will provide you

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
extreme blast protection so this is

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.839 
extreme blast protection so this is
rated<00:03:37.349> for<00:03:37.380> at<00:03:37.709> least<00:03:37.889> a<00:03:38.099> thousand<00:03:38.489> creepers

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.909 
rated for at least a thousand creepers
before<00:03:39.450> it'll<00:03:39.599> explode<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.349> it<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.620> pretty

there to show you guys how to craft this
now<00:05:03.030> all<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.240> have<00:05:03.270> to<00:05:03.450> do<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.660> craft<00:05:03.870> this<00:05:03.990> is

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
now all you have to do to craft this is

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.780 
now all you have to do to craft this is
put<00:05:04.380> a<00:05:04.410> chest<00:05:04.680> in<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.950> middle<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.310> have<00:05:05.550> a

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
put a chest in the middle and have a

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.570 
put a chest in the middle and have a
wheel<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.510> iron<00:05:06.840> ingots<00:05:07.320> around<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:07.950> now<00:05:08.430> this

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
wheel of iron ingots around it now this

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.580 
wheel of iron ingots around it now this
is<00:05:08.640> stackable<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.900> could<00:05:10.050> also<00:05:10.080> have<00:05:10.470> it

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
is stackable and you could also have it

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.470 
is stackable and you could also have it
in<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.860> normal<00:05:11.190> chest<00:05:11.430> size<00:05:11.670> and<00:05:11.970> it's<00:05:12.090> still

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
in the normal chest size and it's still

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.780 
in the normal chest size and it's still
a<00:05:12.540> massive<00:05:13.350> inside<00:05:13.890> so<00:05:14.190> that's<00:05:14.370> pretty<00:05:14.610> sweet

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
a massive inside so that's pretty sweet

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.450 
a massive inside so that's pretty sweet
now<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.690> next<00:05:15.900> of<00:05:16.170> these<00:05:16.320> is<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.830> item<00:05:17.220> tower

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
now the next of these is the item tower

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.330 
now the next of these is the item tower
now<00:05:17.760> perhaps<00:05:18.090> this<00:05:18.570> is<00:05:18.720> probably<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.500> biggest

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
now perhaps this is probably the biggest

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.580 
now perhaps this is probably the biggest
of<00:05:20.760> these<00:05:20.940> storage<00:05:21.270> capabilities<00:05:22.020> because<00:05:22.230> it

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
of these storage capabilities because it
