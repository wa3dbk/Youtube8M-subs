form of makeup that I wore at that time

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.900

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
was I didn't feel comfortable with that

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.960 
was I didn't feel comfortable with that
I<00:03:11.970> thought<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.390> looked<00:03:12.720> ugly<00:03:12.959> without<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.459> I

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
I thought I looked ugly without it now I

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.660 
I thought I looked ugly without it now I
think<00:03:15.540> even<00:03:15.780> not<00:03:16.500> even<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.920> as<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.070> young<00:03:17.400> girl

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
think even not even just as a young girl

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.539 
think even not even just as a young girl
but<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.150> women<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:18.870> can<00:03:19.320> get<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:19.920> trap<00:03:20.280> of

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
but as women we can get in this trap of

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.670 
but as women we can get in this trap of
feeling<00:03:21.060> inadequate<00:03:21.510> when<00:03:22.019> we<00:03:22.170> don't<00:03:22.410> have

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
feeling inadequate when we don't have

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.050 
feeling inadequate when we don't have
these<00:03:23.299> extra<00:03:24.299> you<00:03:24.930> know<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.650> extra<00:03:26.130> stuff<00:03:26.370> ok

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
these extra you know this extra stuff ok

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.210 
these extra you know this extra stuff ok
now<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.720> mentioned<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.620> another<00:03:28.739> video

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
while back now I think so if it does

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.949
