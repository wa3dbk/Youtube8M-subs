like<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.399> said<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.149> agree<00:00:51.649> overall<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
like I said we can all agree overall the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.799 
like I said we can all agree overall the
game<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.760> fluid<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:54.660> clean<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.350> NBA

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
game is not as fluid and as clean as NBA

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.360 
game is not as fluid and as clean as NBA
2k15<00:00:57.809> even<00:00:58.410> though<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.100> some

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
2k15 even though I think there are some

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.040 
2k15 even though I think there are some
things<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.760> life<00:01:00.090> may<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> little<00:01:00.870> bit

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
things that life may do a little bit

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.660 
things that life may do a little bit
better<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.379> know<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.739> far<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.129> I've<00:01:02.340> said<00:01:02.520> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
better you know as far as I've said it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.880 
better you know as far as I've said it
before<00:01:02.699> ball<00:01:03.300> tangibility<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.260> rebounding

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
before ball tangibility and rebounding

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.580 
before ball tangibility and rebounding
and<00:01:04.979> things<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.630> both<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.930> problems

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and things like that both have problems

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.480 
and things like that both have problems
but<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.549> when<00:01:08.850> 2k<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:10.020> well<00:01:10.799> NBA<00:01:11.130> live

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
but I think when 2k up well NBA live

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.570 
but I think when 2k up well NBA live
when<00:01:12.299> NBA<00:01:12.570> live<00:01:12.840> 15<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.740> know<00:01:13.890> gets<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.400> right

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
when NBA live 15 you know gets it right

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.609 
when NBA live 15 you know gets it right
they<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.299> pretty<00:01:15.360> decent<00:01:15.780> job<00:01:16.080> replicating

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
they do a pretty decent job replicating

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.910 
they do a pretty decent job replicating
those<00:01:17.310> areas<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:19.140> would<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> touch

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
those areas I think would be a touch

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.359 
those areas I think would be a touch
above<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.090> opinion<00:01:21.420> 2k15<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:23.070> overall

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
above in my opinion 2k15 but overall

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.660 
above in my opinion 2k15 but overall
2k15<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.659> definitely<00:01:25.200> better<00:01:25.890> game<00:01:26.250> more

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
2k15 is definitely better game more

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.149 
2k15 is definitely better game more
polished<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.810> more<00:01:28.020> fluid<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.829> know<00:01:28.950> there's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
polished the more fluid you know there's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.520 
polished the more fluid you know there's
many<00:01:29.369> things<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.790> could<00:01:30.030> say<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
many things you could say but as you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.679 
many things you could say but as you
look<00:01:31.560> at<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.700> ask<00:01:33.060> yourselves

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
look at this and you know ask yourselves

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
look at this and you know ask yourselves
you<00:01:33.990> know<00:01:34.110> does<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.560> look<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.829> basketball

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
you know does this look like basketball

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.450 
you know does this look like basketball
under<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.630> hood<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.170> know<00:01:37.530> take<00:01:37.890> away<00:01:38.159> some

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
under the hood you know take away some

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.210 
under the hood you know take away some
of<00:01:38.490> these<00:01:38.700> stiffness<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.659> some<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> you

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
