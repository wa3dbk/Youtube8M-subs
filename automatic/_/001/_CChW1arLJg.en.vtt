00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
is this some sort of genetic engineering

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.320 
is this some sort of genetic engineering
no<00:05:00.450> it<00:05:00.780> is<00:05:00.930> not<00:05:01.140> I<00:05:01.200> made<00:05:01.590> sure<00:05:02.010> that<00:05:02.340> these<00:05:03.000> are

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
that for thousands of years was cut off

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.730 
that for thousands of years was cut off
from<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.790> other<00:05:24.050> normal<00:05:25.050> processes<00:05:25.710> of

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
you're accusing me of pawning off

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.900 
you're accusing me of pawning off
something<00:05:42.810> that<00:05:42.960> isn't<00:05:43.169> quite<00:05:43.760> copacetic<00:05:44.760> I'm

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
something that isn't quite copacetic I'm

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.610 
something that isn't quite copacetic I'm
telling<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:45.300> it's<00:05:45.450> exactly<00:05:45.930> what<00:05:46.110> it<00:05:46.200> is<00:05:46.229> all

right<00:05:46.680> so<00:05:46.800> these<00:05:47.070> are<00:05:47.130> not<00:05:47.340> genetically

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
right so these are not genetically

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.670 
right so these are not genetically
engineered<00:05:48.240> chickens<00:05:48.600> not<00:05:48.990> as<00:05:49.140> far<00:05:49.350> as<00:05:49.470> I<00:05:49.620> know

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
engineered chickens not as far as I know

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.080 
engineered chickens not as far as I know
that's<00:05:50.250> not<00:05:50.550> dead

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
that's not dead

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.730 
that's not dead
god<00:05:54.090> damn<00:05:54.720> well<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.229> haven't<00:05:55.380> heard<00:05:55.500> anything
