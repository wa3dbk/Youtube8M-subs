and below here I've got my graphics card

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.170 
and below here I've got my graphics card
this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.100> pretty<00:01:02.309> new<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> newest

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
this is pretty new it's the newest

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.920 
this is pretty new it's the newest
addition<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> my<00:01:03.780> pc<00:01:04.199> um<00:01:05.150> it's<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.390> asus

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
addition to my pc um it's a asus

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.840

directcu<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.130> 780<00:01:08.670> ti<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.409> awesome

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
directcu to 780 ti and it's a awesome

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.170 
directcu to 780 ti and it's a awesome
card<00:01:11.850> um<00:01:12.409> actually<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:14.040> think<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
card um actually I think one of the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.440 
card um actually I think one of the
fastest<00:01:15.659> 78<00:01:16.080> TI<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.380> out<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:16.770> now<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.450> then

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
fastest 78 TI is out right now and then

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.289 
fastest 78 TI is out right now and then
next<00:01:19.200> I've<00:01:19.409> got<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:20.040> power<00:01:20.369> supply<00:01:20.720> my<00:01:21.720> corsair

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
next I've got my power supply my corsair

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.460 
next I've got my power supply my corsair
ax850<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:26.250> psu<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.210> probably<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:28.439> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
ax850 I and this psu is probably one of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.980 
ax850 I and this psu is probably one of
the<00:01:28.650> best<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.130> market<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.900> reason<00:01:30.900> I

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the best on the market and reason I

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.810 
the best on the market and reason I
think<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:31.950> literally<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
think that is is because literally the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.510 
think that is is because literally the
fan<00:01:33.090> does<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.810> spin<00:01:34.200> even<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.220> playing

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
fan does not spin even when playing

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240 
fan does not spin even when playing
games<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.240> fan<00:01:36.450> does<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.900> spin<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.409> that's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
games the fan does not spin and that's

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
games the fan does not spin and that's
pretty<00:01:38.610> cool<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> quiet<00:01:40.079> pc

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
pretty cool because I have a quiet pc

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.899 
pretty cool because I have a quiet pc
and<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.610> does<00:01:41.880> help<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:44.009> actually<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and that does help and I actually have a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.060 
and that does help and I actually have a
course<00:01:45.240> our<00:01:45.450> cable<00:01:45.810> kit<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> bought

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
course our cable kit that I bought

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.910 
course our cable kit that I bought
separately<00:01:47.700> from<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> power<00:01:48.299> supply<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
separately from the power supply and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.160 
separately from the power supply and
that's<00:01:49.920> these<00:01:50.310> red<00:01:50.610> cables<00:01:51.079> speaking<00:01:52.079> of

got to 120 gig solid state drives top 12

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.740 
got to 120 gig solid state drives top 12
samsung<00:02:06.990> 840<00:02:07.590> SSD<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.090> bottom<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.450> to

think<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> HyperX<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> little<00:02:14.280> bit<00:02:14.400> faster

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
think the HyperX is a little bit faster

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.410 
think the HyperX is a little bit faster
