think<00:07:35.849> on<00:07:36.060> saturday<00:07:36.509> i<00:07:36.539> think<00:07:36.750> the<00:07:36.870> shops<00:07:37.740> have

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:37.889 
think on saturday i think the shops have

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:39.890 
think on saturday i think the shops have
already<00:07:38.130> gotten<00:07:38.460> their<00:07:38.639> bets<00:07:38.849> in<00:07:39.060> at<00:07:39.660> the

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 
already gotten their bets in at the

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.350 
already gotten their bets in at the
higher<00:07:40.110> price<00:07:40.139> and<00:07:41.009> because<00:07:41.880> the<00:07:41.970> number<00:07:42.180> was

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 
higher price and because the number was

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.510 
higher price and because the number was
higher<00:07:42.539> than<00:07:42.750> than<00:07:43.080> where<00:07:43.320> it<00:07:43.349> is<00:07:43.470> now<00:07:43.650> and<00:07:43.860> i

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 
higher than than where it is now and i

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.430 
higher than than where it is now and i
would<00:07:44.699> think<00:07:45.030> that<00:07:45.360> it<00:07:45.810> might<00:07:45.900> creep<00:07:46.199> back<00:07:46.410> up
