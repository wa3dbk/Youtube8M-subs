those hair pulling moments perhaps the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.230 
those hair pulling moments perhaps the
greatest<00:02:00.659> lesson<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.860> many<00:02:02.040> me<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.969> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
greatest lesson in so many me is that of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.530 
greatest lesson in so many me is that of
thinking<00:02:03.960> backwards<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.909> key<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
thinking backwards that is the key to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.589 
thinking backwards that is the key to
your<00:02:06.810> success<00:02:07.069> you<00:02:08.069> see<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.459> reminds<00:02:09.270> me<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> lot

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
your success you see it reminds me a lot

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.720 
your success you see it reminds me a lot
of<00:02:09.629> an<00:02:09.810> organic<00:02:10.170> synthesis<00:02:10.920> problem<00:02:11.340> if<00:02:11.520> you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
of an organic synthesis problem if you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.680 
of an organic synthesis problem if you
start<00:02:12.000> at<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> beginning<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.050> get<00:02:13.260> no

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
start at the beginning you get no

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.810 
start at the beginning you get no
we're<00:02:13.840> fast<00:02:14.140> starting<00:02:15.070> at<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> end<00:02:15.460> however

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
we're fast starting at the end however

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.260 
we're fast starting at the end however
you<00:02:16.270> plan<00:02:16.660> your<00:02:16.960> moves<00:02:17.550> progressively<00:02:18.550> take

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
you plan your moves progressively take

you plan your moves progressively take
this<00:02:19.510> puzzle<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.140> need<00:02:20.800> lastly<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.850> teleport

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
this puzzle you need lastly to teleport

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.020 
this puzzle you need lastly to teleport
but<00:02:22.960> before<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:24.010> distract<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.730> before

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
but before that to distract and before

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.870 
but before that to distract and before
that<00:02:25.060> fly<00:02:25.930> with<00:02:26.710> that<00:02:26.890> combination<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.610> mind

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
that fly with that combination in mind

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.880 
that fly with that combination in mind
you<00:02:28.180> now<00:02:28.450> know<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.750> sequence<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.470> power-ups

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
you now know the sequence of power-ups

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.840 
you now know the sequence of power-ups
and<00:02:30.280> can<00:02:30.790> plan<00:02:31.090> your<00:02:31.510> path<00:02:31.870> this<00:02:32.830> lesson<00:02:33.640> of

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
and can plan your path this lesson of

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.060 
and can plan your path this lesson of
thinking<00:02:34.450> backwards<00:02:34.840> through<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.500> puzzles

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
thinking backwards through the puzzles

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.030 
thinking backwards through the puzzles
is<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.370> hard<00:02:36.850> learned<00:02:37.270> one<00:02:37.630> for<00:02:37.990> one<00:02:38.260> important

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
is a hard learned one for one important

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.880 
is a hard learned one for one important
reason<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:40.240> puzzles<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.110> large<00:02:41.380> part<00:02:41.710> are

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
reason the puzzles in large part are

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.460 
reason the puzzles in large part are
skippable<00:02:42.490> most<00:02:43.240> of<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.660> really<00:02:43.960> tough

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
skippable most of the really tough

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.950 
skippable most of the really tough
puzzles<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.460> you<00:02:45.910> can<00:02:46.120> sink<00:02:46.480> your<00:02:46.690> teeth

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
puzzles that you can sink your teeth

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.260 
puzzles that you can sink your teeth
into<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.740> get<00:02:47.950> an<00:02:48.040> idea<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.640> how<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.910> actually

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
into and get an idea of how to actually

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.990 
into and get an idea of how to actually
think<00:02:49.780> backwards<00:02:50.050> through<00:02:50.560> these<00:02:50.680> problems

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
think backwards through these problems

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.570 
think backwards through these problems
you<00:02:52.000> don't<00:02:52.210> actually<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.290> do<00:02:53.980> those<00:02:54.280> to

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
you don't actually have to do those to

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.270 
you don't actually have to do those to
be<00:02:54.700> able<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.030> progress<00:02:55.240> in<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.020> game<00:02:56.160> just<00:02:57.160> to

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
be able to progress in the game just to

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.690 
be able to progress in the game just to
get<00:02:57.430> things<00:02:57.760> like<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.410> extra<00:02:59.410> abilities<00:03:00.070> or

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
get things like the extra abilities or

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.200 
get things like the extra abilities or
the<00:03:01.060> costumes<00:03:01.690> now<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.890> do<00:03:03.220> have<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.640> say<00:03:03.970> that

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
the costumes now I do have to say that

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.110 
the costumes now I do have to say that
if<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.480> want<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.810> good<00:03:05.080> chance<00:03:05.560> at<00:03:05.950> beating<00:03:06.670> the

if you want a good chance at beating the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.450 
if you want a good chance at beating the
game<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.900> really<00:03:08.470> need<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.860> go<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.160> get<00:03:09.310> all

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
game you really need to go and get all

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.200 
game you really need to go and get all
those<00:03:09.640> collectables<00:03:10.270> but<00:03:10.810> it's<00:03:10.960> not<00:03:11.110> 100%

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
those collectables but it's not 100%

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.330 
those collectables but it's not 100%
necessary<00:03:13.210> and<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.380> both<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.770> good<00:03:14.800> and

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
necessary and this is both a good and

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.640 
necessary and this is both a good and
bad<00:03:16.270> thing<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:17.050> if<00:03:17.170> you're<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.470> type<00:03:17.620> of

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
bad thing you see if you're the type of

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.770 
bad thing you see if you're the type of
person<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:18.310> get<00:03:18.430> frustrated<00:03:19.060> easily<00:03:19.330> this<00:03:19.720> is

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
person to get frustrated easily this is

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.900 
person to get frustrated easily this is
nice<00:03:20.200> because<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.220> can<00:03:21.250> just<00:03:21.459> press<00:03:21.880> forward

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
nice because you can just press forward

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.790 
nice because you can just press forward
and<00:03:22.600> be<00:03:22.660> like<00:03:22.810> well<00:03:23.020> I'll<00:03:23.170> come<00:03:23.320> back<00:03:23.530> for<00:03:23.770> it

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
and be like well I'll come back for it

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.240 
and be like well I'll come back for it
later<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:25.060> at<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.540> same<00:03:25.750> time<00:03:26.260> you're

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
later but at the same time you're

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.280 
later but at the same time you're
missing<00:03:27.670> out<00:03:27.820> on<00:03:27.850> an<00:03:28.150> important<00:03:28.630> lesson<00:03:28.989> that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
missing out on an important lesson that

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.550 
missing out on an important lesson that
will<00:03:29.560> help<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:30.040> later<00:03:30.340> on<00:03:30.550> in<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.450> levels<00:03:31.810> so

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
will help you later on in the levels so

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.680 
will help you later on in the levels so
you<00:03:32.590> do<00:03:33.130> shoot<00:03:33.489> yourself<00:03:33.910> in<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.030> foot<00:03:34.330> just<00:03:34.540> a

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
you do shoot yourself in the foot just a

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.870 
you do shoot yourself in the foot just a
little<00:03:34.720> bit<00:03:35.290> by<00:03:35.500> skipping<00:03:35.950> these<00:03:36.070> puzzles<00:03:36.550> but

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
little bit by skipping these puzzles but

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.520 
little bit by skipping these puzzles but
I<00:03:37.120> guess<00:03:37.330> it's<00:03:37.540> better<00:03:37.690> than<00:03:37.810> giving<00:03:38.080> up<00:03:38.350> on

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
I guess it's better than giving up on

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.130 
I guess it's better than giving up on
the<00:03:38.650> game<00:03:38.800> entirely<00:03:39.720> now<00:03:40.720> some<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:40.989> the

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
the game entirely now some of the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.410 
the game entirely now some of the
puzzles<00:03:41.290> are<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:41.980> fun<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.610> interesting<00:03:43.090> to

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
puzzles are so fun and interesting to

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.850 
puzzles are so fun and interesting to
play<00:03:43.600> through<00:03:43.840> I'm<00:03:44.019> considering<00:03:44.620> playing

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
play through I'm considering playing

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.220 
play through I'm considering playing
through<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.190> game<00:03:45.220> again<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.870> don't<00:03:46.930> see

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
through the game again and I don't see

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.229 
through the game again and I don't see
that<00:03:47.350> many<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:48.040> know<00:03:48.160> walkthroughs<00:03:49.030> out

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
that many you know walkthroughs out

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.840 
that many you know walkthroughs out
there<00:03:49.480> so<00:03:49.750> who<00:03:50.260> knows<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:50.860> if<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.430> think<00:03:51.670> you'd

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
there so who knows if if you think you'd

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.509
