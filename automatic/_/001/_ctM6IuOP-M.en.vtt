00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.390
 of genius and this first feature film 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.030
 realized with almost amateur means 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.070

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.580
 extraterrestrials land on earth 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.739
 in order to harvest the raw material 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.809
 for now intergalactic fast food 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.160
 that is to say the man happily a 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.379
 small group of daredevil has 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.390
 organized to defeat their project to 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.970
 the origin of acts is two of the heads 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.500
 short films but peter jackson is going 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.540
 decide to extend the duration 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.790
 filming took place on weekends and 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.590
 will span four years with a budget 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.750
 derisory he will cumulate the caps 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.990
 directors writers producers 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.330
 same actors brief a beautiful text is a 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.700
 amateur movie but jackson will push 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.110
 the exercise very far away he will manufacture 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.880
 himself the machine to cities 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.979
 necessary for shooting with three ends 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 of string and will take care of the effects 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.760
 specials and masks of the aliens who 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.860
 he will cook in the bitter sweet oven 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.689
 he will play two roles in his film he 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.700
 will even fight these two characters 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.450
 revealing an impressive mastery 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.219
 editing 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.829
 then he never did school 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.320
 cinema the result is a movie with 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.329
 explosive sheep you eat age of 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.020
 vomit aliens cut to 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.539
 chain saw 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.850
 short a gem gore upmanship 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.219
 as enjoyable as loathsome movie 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.380
 will be noticed at the Cannes festival and 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.119
 Jackson did not stop there so well 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.250
 at first glance the filmography 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.289
 of peter jackson seem to go in 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.600
 every way there in horror films 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.119
 completely delirious a trashy parody 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.429
 of the muppet show a documentary stream on 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.689
 a fictional filmmaker an epic trilogy 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.640
 heroic fantasy 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.890
 and yet all these films are animated 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.810
 by the same themes of bad taste to 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.940
 king kong we find his passion for 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.100
 cinema and the love of monsters 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.960
 marginalized and especially has never 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.120
 dropped his handyman side that has him 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.790
 allowed to take advantage of every penny 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.770
 of a budget but that glaris allowed 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.690
 to experience things never seen at 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.030
 cinema like a son and a fight to 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.160
 digital control in one-shot camera 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.200
 convention reuse from virtually all 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.210
 the blockbusters since the Lord of 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.550
 rings obviously since bad taste 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.710
 peter jackson and progressed ornament 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.240
 but he never deviated from his passions 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.670
 and as jy 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.800
 self-taught he is now part of the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.140
 club of the inventors of those who like 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.060
