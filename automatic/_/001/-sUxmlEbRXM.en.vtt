 In this video we show the pvp-mode in the DAX 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.779
 in this mode, you do not fight against the dax-curve threat, rather, it is 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.800
 That's why his heroes fight against those of other players 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.170
 this happens 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.789
 detached from the campaign 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.650
 in a so-called arena 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.350
 Unlike the co-op mode, the pvp mode is not a foregone conclusion 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.710
 available 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.490
