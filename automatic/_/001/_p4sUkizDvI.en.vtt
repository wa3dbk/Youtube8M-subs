worst that can happen to him in the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.520 
worst that can happen to him in the
fighters<00:04:22.600> when<00:04:22.810> they<00:04:22.900> scored<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.350> knockdown

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
fighters when they scored the knockdown

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.680 
fighters when they scored the knockdown
because<00:04:24.490> they<00:04:24.729> thought<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.060> was<00:04:25.180> just<00:04:25.510> going

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
because they thought it was just going

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.659

to keep happening and they thought about

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.640 
to keep happening and they thought about
all<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.150> punting<00:04:28.660> land<00:04:28.870> is<00:04:29.020> not<00:04:29.260> how<00:04:29.500> they

all the punting land is not how they
said<00:04:29.919> enough<00:04:30.160> so<00:04:30.669> they<00:04:30.820> got<00:04:31.120> away<00:04:31.270> from<00:04:31.449> the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
said enough so they got away from the

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.930 
said enough so they got away from the
game<00:04:31.900> works<00:04:32.199> wow<00:04:32.680> just<00:04:33.010> like<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.400> old<00:04:33.550> timers

of<00:04:34.330> for<00:04:34.570> punch<00:04:34.870> combination<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:42.370> body

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
of for punch combination the body

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.510 
of for punch combination the body
snatchers<00:04:43.110> right<00:04:44.110> away<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.949> look<00:04:45.220> to<00:04:45.400> the

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
head I had a hurt a little give and take

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.060 
head I had a hurt a little give and take
and<00:04:49.090> here<00:04:49.300> comes<00:04:49.539> the<00:04:49.690> left<00:04:49.900> hand

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.719 

shop<00:04:56.070> there<00:04:56.340> he<00:04:56.940> was<00:04:57.210> able<00:04:57.389> to<00:04:57.660> get<00:04:57.900> up<00:04:58.729> last

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
shop there he was able to get up last

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:23.740 
shop there he was able to get up last
time<00:05:00.030> now<00:05:00.900> he<00:05:00.960> goes<00:05:01.320> down<00:05:01.620> again

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.440 

so<00:05:24.200> now<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.590> question<00:05:25.130> becomes<00:05:25.430> after<00:05:26.270> that

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
so now the question becomes after that

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.870 
so now the question becomes after that
knockdown<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:27.230> he<00:05:27.320> has<00:05:27.590> got<00:05:27.800> enough<00:05:28.070> how<00:05:28.610> does

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
knockdown and he has got enough how does

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.850 
knockdown and he has got enough how does
he<00:05:29.030> survive<00:05:29.480> so<00:05:30.230> what<00:05:30.440> are<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:30.650> ways<00:05:30.800> he

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
he survive so what are the ways he

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.010 
he survive so what are the ways he
survives<00:05:31.490> as<00:05:31.730> if<00:05:31.880> he's<00:05:32.030> been<00:05:32.240> taught<00:05:32.540> have

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
survives as if he's been taught have
