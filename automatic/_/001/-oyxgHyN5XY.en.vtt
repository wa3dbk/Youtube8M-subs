00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
all right so I took the coffee can I

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.140 
all right so I took the coffee can I
punch<00:00:56.740> the<00:00:57.040> hole<00:00:57.280> in<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:58.090> side<00:00:58.300> over<00:00:58.600> here<00:00:58.720> I

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
punch the hole in the side over here I

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.760 
punch the hole in the side over here I
started<00:01:01.150> by<00:01:01.300> drilling<00:01:01.540> a<00:01:01.750> hole<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.230> then

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
started by drilling a hole and then

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.450 
started by drilling a hole and then
punched<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.520> with<00:01:03.760> an<00:01:04.540> awl<00:01:04.780> like<00:01:05.080> this<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
punched it with an awl like this and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.630 
punched it with an awl like this and
then<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:07.840> punch<00:01:08.140> this<00:01:08.410> through<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:08.980> that's

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
then I punch this through and that's

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.960 
then I punch this through and that's
about<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.150> size<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.660> my<00:01:11.050> copper<00:01:11.410> pipe<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
about the size of my copper pipe the

valve which just controls the air flow I

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.390 
valve which just controls the air flow I
took<00:01:37.690> off<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.170> can<00:01:38.380> punch<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.800> hole<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.220> put

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
took off you can punch the hole in put

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.520 
took off you can punch the hole in put
the<00:01:39.520> pipe<00:01:39.729> in<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.210> then<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.720> line<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.350> whole

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
the pipe in and then I line the whole

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.140 
the pipe in and then I line the whole
thing<00:01:41.800> with<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.640> cement<00:01:44.400> so<00:01:45.400> now<00:01:45.759> I'm<00:01:45.910> going<00:01:46.090> to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
thing with a cement so now I'm going to

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.790 
thing with a cement so now I'm going to
wait<00:01:46.300> for<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.690> cement<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.110> dry<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.410> little<00:01:47.619> bit

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
wait for the cement to dry a little bit

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.510 
wait for the cement to dry a little bit
and<00:01:48.100> then<00:01:48.759> I<00:01:49.000> will<00:01:49.060> bury<00:01:49.660> this<00:01:49.960> in<00:01:50.259> my<00:01:51.130> saying

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
and then I will bury this in my saying

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.030 
and then I will bury this in my saying
furnace

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.040 

okay<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:58.760> here<00:01:59.660> is<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.520> furnace<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:02.480> have<00:02:02.900> the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
okay so here is the furnace I have the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.080 
okay so here is the furnace I have the
pipe<00:02:03.290> coming<00:02:03.530> out<00:02:03.710> here<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:04.250> well<00:02:04.760> if<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:04.940> can

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
pipe coming out here and well if you can

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.010 
pipe coming out here and well if you can
see<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.420> but<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:05.660> use<00:02:06.020> some<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.970> cement<00:02:11.840> and

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
see it but I use some this a cement and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.570 
see it but I use some this a cement and
mortar<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:13.330> clog<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.570> hole<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.960> side<00:02:15.200> and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
mortar to clog the hole in the side and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.220 
mortar to clog the hole in the side and
touch<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:16.850> with<00:02:17.060> some<00:02:17.210> sand<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.020> it

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
touch it up with some sand so that it

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.920 
touch it up with some sand so that it
wouldn't<00:02:18.470> leak<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:18.980> then<00:02:19.670> this<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.540> just<00:02:20.570> a

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
wouldn't leak and then this is just a

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.560 
wouldn't leak and then this is just a
ring<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.350> raise<00:02:21.530> my<00:02:21.800> height<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.430> have<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
ring to raise my height I have the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.470 
ring to raise my height I have the
coffee<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:24.290> here<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:26.060> lined<00:02:26.360> with

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
coffee can here and it's lined with

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.710 
coffee can here and it's lined with
cement<00:02:26.990> it's<00:02:27.380> kind<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.800> hard<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.040> see<00:02:28.340> but<00:02:28.720> it's

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
cement it's kind of hard to see but it's

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.220 
cement it's kind of hard to see but it's
buried<00:02:30.170> there<00:02:30.440> because<00:02:30.910> my<00:02:31.910> previous

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
buried there because my previous

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.320 
buried there because my previous
furnaces<00:02:33.230> blowy<00:02:33.980> they<00:02:34.430> gave<00:02:34.610> out<00:02:34.820> was<00:02:35.120> that

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
furnaces blowy they gave out was that

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.280 
furnaces blowy they gave out was that
the<00:02:35.540> coffee<00:02:35.810> can<00:02:36.230> had<00:02:37.690> basically<00:02:38.690> disinterred

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
the coffee can had basically disinterred

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.500 
the coffee can had basically disinterred
it<00:02:39.440> broke<00:02:39.740> down<00:02:40.010> over<00:02:40.280> having<00:02:40.760> repeat<00:02:41.209> fires

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
it broke down over having repeat fires

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.500 
it broke down over having repeat fires
my<00:02:42.320> first<00:02:42.590> one<00:02:42.800> was<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.040> paint<00:02:43.400> can<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:44.000> lasted

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
my first one was a paint can that lasted

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.630 
my first one was a paint can that lasted
me<00:02:44.660> three<00:02:44.990> melts<00:02:45.410> my<00:02:45.980> second<00:02:46.370> one<00:02:46.459> was<00:02:46.580> a

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
me three melts my second one was a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.440 
me three melts my second one was a
coffee<00:02:46.880> can<00:02:47.240> that<00:02:47.480> lasted<00:02:47.870> me<00:02:47.959> nine<00:02:48.200> melts<00:02:48.620> so

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
coffee can that lasted me nine melts so

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.570 
coffee can that lasted me nine melts so
I'll<00:02:50.450> be<00:02:50.660> firing<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:51.380> one<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.770> before<00:02:52.130> too

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
I'll be firing in this one up before too

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.270 
I'll be firing in this one up before too
long<00:02:52.790> here<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.239> we'll<00:02:54.170> see<00:02:54.410> how<00:02:54.560> many<00:02:54.620> melts<00:02:55.190> I

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
long here and we'll see how many melts I

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.520 
long here and we'll see how many melts I
can<00:02:55.489> do<00:02:55.640> with<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.120> cement<00:02:56.630> lining<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.320> will

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
can do with the cement lining that will

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.710 
can do with the cement lining that will
reinforce<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.520> kind<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.500> metal<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:02.150> my

pan which is a fairly thin metal you can
still<00:03:10.760> see<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.150> hole<00:03:11.330> punched<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.050> side

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
still see the hole punched in the side

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.539 
still see the hole punched in the side
that<00:03:14.049> blasted<00:03:15.049> me<00:03:15.170> about<00:03:15.440> three<00:03:15.860> melts<00:03:16.310> before

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
that blasted me about three melts before

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.680 
that blasted me about three melts before
it<00:03:16.910> gave<00:03:17.120> out<00:03:17.769> this<00:03:18.769> is<00:03:19.700> my<00:03:20.000> version<00:03:20.060> two
