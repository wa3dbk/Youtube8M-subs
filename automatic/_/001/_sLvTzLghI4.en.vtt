 the store then nedele 190 dollars 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.860
 interesting specimen 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.020
 let's see what he himself 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.540
 presents and as always a mini-review 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.920
 because on super reviews i just have 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:47.450
 no time so the phone we have is not 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.670
 so I understand the flip cover than it will come to me 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.470
 phone cost and of course 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.270
 8 cores plus 5 inch display and 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.810
 principle on the characteristics and should 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.980
 be good so the phone itself 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:07.460
 equipment we have headphones 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:10.280
 Intra channel Potter cable is here 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.729
 charging well, and actually our charging under 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.180
 our 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.470
 There is an adapter and so this is clear 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:23.659
 remove it, too, choose the phone itself 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.630
 Here is such a flip case is the phone itself 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.909
 us black pasted here 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.920
 protective film here it is scratch by 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.590
 protective film someone probably yes me 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.409
 tested so the phone key to 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.420
 we are on the phone let's probably 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.760
 I got it out of the case I will show you externally 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.350
 because not everyone will go flip 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.890
 cover 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.500
 That's how it looks like cubot 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.030
 camera 8 megapixel rear camera 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.920
 5 megapixel front camera 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:01.810
 so now let's see the brightness here 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:04.880
 the sun just shines so screen and brightness 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.170
 brightness is not at all here so it will be better 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.620
 Already here is better matrix father 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.180
 Now I will tell you exactly the resolution 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.590
 resolution like and here I am not mistaken 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.870
 up to 1280 by 720 5 inches in principle 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.269
 the phone is very thin 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:30.519
 here we have a headphone jack 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:32.379
 then we have micro usb charging 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.840
 On the left side we have a volume rocker 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.260
 there is nothing on the bottom on the right side 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.629
 turn on and unlock the phone in 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.819
 Basically, the phone is convenient and all the buttons are all 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.780
 get ahead three sensory 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.540
 as it should be for the phone itself to 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.219
 interface first impression is nothing 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.450
 brakes worth some interesting 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.980
 the shell is probably necessary to cover all 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.680
 still 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.010
 light now i'm testing it antutu not 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.040
 on mark multitouch and already tell you 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.889

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.620
 mini mini review will be on this phone 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:16.359
 because I believe that in principle for 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.840
 $ 190 less more or less Kubot 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:23.200
 came up with a phone that's starting now 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.709

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.329

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.780
 phone cubot x6 cool machine for 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.169
 I'll tell you my money now about 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.879
 more precisely its characteristics will tell that 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.879
 this device is 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:45.220
 let's start with antutu right after all 8 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.409
 nuclear is show twenty seven thousand 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.459
 three hundred fifty two points 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.690
 worth galaxy s4 to hara hara 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.599
 characteristics in general, we have 8 leaders 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:00.190
 android worth 422 video accelerator mali 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:02.470
 450 mb hd resolution of 1280 by 720 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.739
 13 megapixels of cameras are written on 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.280
 In fact 8 megapixel camera back and 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.319
 front 5 megapixels 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.200
 16 gigabytes we have flash drive 1 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.120
 gigabyte ram 8 ida works 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.320
 this is a frequency of 1 of 7 gigahertz 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.300
 320 pixel density that's what 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.669
 from the direction sensor sensors there 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.590
 proximity sensor lighting sensor but 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.200
 all the main sensors to eat with us 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.620
 let's go on in nenamark 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.220
 here of course I was impressed with the result 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.260
 63 and one frame per second I don't even remember 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.600
 probably the maximum numbers 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.030
 showed this phone which is generally me 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.630
 I was in the review of course it 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:51.669
 I liked it here in multitouch, we have 5 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:53.470
 touches here 6 no longer goes 5 touches what 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.510
 we generally say on the phone about 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.610
 camera camera is really 8 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.790
 megapixels make good photos 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.030
 also shoot a good video too 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.729
 at 8 megapixels really pulls with 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.990
 focusing 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.360
 no problem at all, everything is focused 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.860
 also I liked the front camera on 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.169
 5 megapixels she also has 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.710
 focusing on photos is not that very 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.410
 surprised 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.950
 I usually did not come across a telephone and even 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.080
 with an 8 megapixel camera there were phones 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.729
 tested the front and focus not 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.479
 was in the same phone there 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.930
 With regards to external dynamics external 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:34.180
 speaker and above average 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.850
 decent sound is audible low above 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.850
 medium between medium and high 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.430
 In general, I did not like the phone 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.900
 I will say that with these characteristics 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.320
 will go on this phone absolutely everything 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.990
 8th game keep resolution 1 gigabyte 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.680
 RAM basically everything 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.870
 excellent battery here i didn't say 2200 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.300
 A milliamp phone will be enough for you 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:02.430
 head on the day but still think until the morning 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.050
 to pull so basically good 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.740
 sensations from this phone if you take 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.440
 its price 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.080
 190 dollars for an eight-core phone 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.790
 formerly resolution and 16 gigabytes 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.770
 the flash drive is also 5 inches 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.230
 It seems to me not bad therefore guys from 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.290
 I recommend to turn yourself on the phone 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.980
 this attention if anyone is focused on 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:28.530
 these numbers are for she and that money 190 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.440
 dollars 200 dollars 180 dollars here 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:34.530
 look at this phone is not bad 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.510
 I liked all the devices quite well 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:50.130
 until 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:50.130
