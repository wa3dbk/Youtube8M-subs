got<00:05:34.210> a<00:05:34.240> lot<00:05:34.389> of<00:05:34.770> information<00:05:35.770> on<00:05:35.889> that<00:05:36.190> stuff

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
got a lot of information on that stuff

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.540 
got a lot of information on that stuff
but<00:05:37.539> yeah<00:05:37.690> very<00:05:38.020> very<00:05:38.289> neat<00:05:38.500> very<00:05:38.830> smooth

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
but yeah very very neat very smooth

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.749 
but yeah very very neat very smooth
clean<00:05:39.969> this<00:05:40.629> does<00:05:40.870> run<00:05:41.139> on<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.830> art<00:05:42.069> runtime

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
clean this does run on the art runtime

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.330 
clean this does run on the art runtime
environment<00:05:43.330> instead<00:05:43.569> of<00:05:43.750> delek<00:05:44.469> which<00:05:45.099> is

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
environment instead of delek which is

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.200 
environment instead of delek which is
smoother<00:05:46.330> and<00:05:46.449> a<00:05:46.509> lot<00:05:46.659> faster<00:05:47.169> for<00:05:47.529> sure<00:05:48.210> here

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
smoother and a lot faster for sure here

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.700 
smoother and a lot faster for sure here

like<00:06:35.919> I<00:06:36.009> said<00:06:36.159> everything<00:06:36.580> is<00:06:36.699> very<00:06:37.300> nice<00:06:37.509> runs

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
like I said everything is very nice runs

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.209 
like I said everything is very nice runs
very<00:06:38.020> smooth<00:06:38.289> there's<00:06:38.529> another<00:06:38.770> transition

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
very smooth there's another transition

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:40.920 
very smooth there's another transition
you<00:06:39.370> can<00:06:39.460> see<00:06:39.610> the<00:06:39.699> anytime<00:06:40.360> you<00:06:40.479> close<00:06:40.690> an<00:06:40.810> app

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
you can see the anytime you close an app

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.839 
you can see the anytime you close an app
that<00:06:40.960> kind<00:06:41.259> of<00:06:41.289> like<00:06:41.409> wipes<00:06:42.039> off<00:06:42.310> the<00:06:42.550> screen

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
that kind of like wipes off the screen

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.329 
that kind of like wipes off the screen
so<00:06:43.569> so<00:06:44.169> far<00:06:44.379> from<00:06:44.529> what<00:06:44.620> I've<00:06:44.800> seen<00:06:44.830> fully
