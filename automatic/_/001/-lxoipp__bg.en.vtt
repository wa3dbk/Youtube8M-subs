very<00:02:46.700> high<00:02:46.970> level<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.480> mean<00:02:47.810> when<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.350> slide

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
very high level I mean when you slide

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.400

your<00:02:49.070> fingers<00:02:49.400> inside<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.410> inside

silky<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:56.140> one<00:02:57.140> thing<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.380> do<00:02:57.440> like<00:02:57.709> about<00:02:57.770> this

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
silky and one thing I do like about this

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.000 
silky and one thing I do like about this
silhouette<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.140> most<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.470> upper<00:03:00.770> is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
silhouette is that most of the upper is

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.360 
silhouette is that most of the upper is
covered<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.180> suede<00:03:02.740> which<00:03:03.740> is<00:03:03.920> really<00:03:04.190> hard<00:03:04.310> to

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
covered in suede which is really hard to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.460 
covered in suede which is really hard to
find<00:03:04.550> nowadays<00:03:04.760> because<00:03:05.150> trainers<00:03:05.660> tend<00:03:06.170> to

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
find nowadays because trainers tend to

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.250 
find nowadays because trainers tend to
