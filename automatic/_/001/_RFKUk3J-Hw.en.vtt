00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.340
 seme hi 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.960
 horizontal bar 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.720
 made of leather with metal 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.770
 hook produced in Russia 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.050
 Here comes such a cardboard box 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.630
 the box has recently become a little 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.880
 worse 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.570
 comes to some buyers 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.410
 pasted here this seam pasted 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:43.269
 manufacturer defect principle no matter what 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:46.660
 It does not affect the cries themselves to be here and so 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:50.440
 sold in pairs of course made of 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.370
 skin as already said the difference between 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:58.930
 right and left there is this here gutter 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:02.190
 with overlap should be like this 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.809
 accordingly it is for the left hand because 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.860
 that in the opposite direction if to the right it 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:14.039
 putting it erases not very comfortable here 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.039
 here are the pants 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.770
 neat little rather big 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.280
 principle universal and fit on 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.680
 any hand is black 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:32.060
 white stitching from the ramp with velcro hook 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.420
 on 3 klepka from the back side he is not 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.560
 laid but in principle does not rub not 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.080
 come do not rub at all 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:46.689
 it does not even feel on the arm sit 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.689
 conveniently fastens easily 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.820
 convenient to do as experienced 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.630
 athletes and beginners 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:05.350
 convenient because it does not load so much 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.340
 brush and so tired hands are experienced 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.170
 athletes at the time of injury 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.540
 really helps a lot 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:20.770
 reduce the load allows you to engage not 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:26.040
 lose its shape crossbar diameter 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:29.950
 or the rod is declared by the manufacturer to 40 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.000
 Well, respectively, on the horizontal bar on any 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.000
 you can probably do 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.900
 take off is also easy over time 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.100
 on personal experience, I can say that 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.670
 a little under and erased inside 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.590
 the part is not wiped at all but smudge 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.680
 it becomes not as beautiful as 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.540
 new is my new cries 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.650
 there is also a sample 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:07.240
 last year's old her here is all too 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:13.510
 most but the skin is a little better you see 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:15.660
 she measured it became less on 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.520
 millimeter 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:25.150
 here it is more rough 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.990
 Respectively more durable well these 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.990
 good too 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.690
 such a model is interesting come in 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.310

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.310
 perry is really helpful and necessary i 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.390
