00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.170

 the ham slip is a cover as has 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.250
 commented our partner Javier weighs 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.590
 60 grams 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.100
 which is not going to affect much our 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.840
 our load 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.140
 and we have a very simple we will see it to 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.970
 continuation itself what the slip is not 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.729
 it stops being a tube a simple tube 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.549
 waterproof and at each end has a 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.310
 finish with a pressure lock and a 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.430
 piece of string to be able to adjust it to 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.289
 each end 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.549
 we take all the ham slip and we do it 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.560
 as well as as a package in which 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.299
 we can pierce the fingers and now 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.470
 here it is because we are going to put the tape of 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.600
 the hammock 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.210
 we have placed through these strings 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.620
 we have passed the hanbok slip and now in 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.850

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.850
 let's follow it 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.310

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.689
 pick up for having taken us out already 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.970

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.520
 rods to make it flexible and now 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.880
 choosing from one end we will look towards 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.880
 the other 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.680

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.879

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.109
 needles that do not damage the mosquito net 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.390
 that a part can be hooked 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:28.670
