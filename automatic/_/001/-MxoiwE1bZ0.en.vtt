00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:14.810
 and keep up the general impressions 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.850
 say I liked the car 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.580
 and absolutely like in all 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.710
 aspects in terms of management and with 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.530
 point of view of electronic systems and how 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.590
 she behaves on the road she is on 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.680
 surprise frisky for little 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.730
 SUV whose engine is only 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.890
 two and two liters 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.649
 it's hard to expect him to have 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.229
 some kind of dynamics she he has us without 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.300
 problems kept to bury scooters on 

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:42.469
 overtaking 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.079
 kickdown tangible really 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.799
 presses in the seat acceleration to hundreds of 9 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.309
 half seconds for diesel 2 and 2 liters 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:54.129
 Yes, in general, this is an excellent indicator 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.199
 trunk freelander opens 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.139
 special button by the way he 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.429
 also locked with central locking 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:03.440
 inside there is a special wand she 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.979
 can beautiful pirate 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.960
 and close the load the seat folds down 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.520
 Shelves themselves can be easily selected 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.980
 not enough to press a small button 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.230
 Here it is actually all so small 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.490
 joke 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.620
 can we put here now 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.270
 I show you how to fold the seat to sit 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.100
 take it up completely you can 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.750
 get a flat floor and this is done 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.380
 quite simply there is a little here 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.990
 tongue 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.850
 pull the front seats for him 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.510
 well done bottom I'm not done 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.940
 like this 10 button click on it once 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.560
 sidushka formed like this is the same 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.060
 can be done with the second seat in 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.860
 the result is a large trunk 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.180
 which is completely calm down the stairs 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.750
 snowboarding 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.330
 and something else is a little person like one 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.860
 of the participants of our expedition Rome can 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.440
 here even sleep full length interesting 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.300
 aspect about how much fuel 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.220
 there are diesel cars I was very 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.950
 interesting and so I even specifically 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.660
 created a spreadsheet in excel and 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.440
 along the route along our course 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.120
 the expedition recorded every refueling 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.030
 the passport says that this diesel 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.220
 freelander seats in city mode 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.440
 eleven and a half liters we have 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.220
 fact turned out during the expedition 13 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:26.690
 we refueled a little each 450 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.190
 kilometers at 50 baht at the same time 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.239
 him at 68 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.180
 so there is enough stock for the proton machine 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.400
 diesel which is now in my opinion 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.100
 like 95 gasoline but it still turns out 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.590
 quite economical and on track 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.840
 reasonableness of the speeds allowed guests 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.910
 In Russia, fuel consumption is certainly less 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.739
 what contributes to the cruise control 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.780
 here is not adaptive how manifested but 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.480
 quite ordinary conveniently controlled with 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.400
 two buttons you can set the desired 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.100
 speed lower it raise right 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.910
 buttons do not touch the pedal off 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.290
 Cruise control 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.690
 or return to programmed 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:08.060
 speed number 2 should be ours on 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.130
 our equipment remained so 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.730
 called a speaker and she's on one basin and 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.380
 inch relatively low due to 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.800
 this car holds the road better 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.709
 speed but it is clear that I somehow pits 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.739
 potholes and again I would not climb 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.610
 somewhere far away from the roads but if only 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.880
 there dry sand 1 machine to press without 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.030
 problems about the glove compartment too 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.859
 It opens with a simple push lock 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.930
 place there by the way quite a few here 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.150
 For example, I strongly advise you to pass the instruction 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.780
 read so to say that she is not small 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.340
 and so the Russians love to read the instructions 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.320
 This is the case when you need to read 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.549
 mass of subtleties mass of nuances 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.730
 driving with his 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.160
 hand I give the menu buttons on the settings 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.489
 the machine itself there is even small 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.700
 hand and well, for example about the keychain 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.040
 regular freelander keychain 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.320
 on when wet jora faith contains such 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.570
 here's a silver thing 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.639
 it turns out she shifts her can 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.410
 take off and inside the key is discovered here 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.420
 for me it was absolutely not obvious 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.579
 with this key you can make 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.590
 a lot of things including open the car 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.720
 if suddenly she stopped responding 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.670
 There are still such things that can be 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.480
 twist the key itself is removed 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.310
 Here is the construction and 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.889
 dashboard in hybrid freelancer 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.950
 there are also classic scales with 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.630
 arrows and there is also a screen on 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.790
 which shows the main information 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.360
 about car including level 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.120
 fuel where the scales at the top of the scale 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.430
 it means the tank is filled up gradually us 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.410
 need going down 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.240
 when gasoline freelander ends 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.520
 gives the inscription in Russian 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.470
 quite understandable and offers on its 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.140
 navigation system to get directions 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:04.480
 to the nearest gas station interesting lights 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.480
 he has like running lights they say goodbye 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.820
 auto shine on the road that passed 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.500
 just the place was visible linzivannaya 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.990
 optics that shines well 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.820
 near and far and angel eyes 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.910
 which just adds aesthetics and 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.110
 again add noticeably stinger 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.610
 outside now hear that car 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.620
 a little bit practice is normal for 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.390
 diesel while inside this sound 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.810
 absolutely not audible and soundproofing 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.810
 good
