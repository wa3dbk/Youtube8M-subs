00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello there is an anteater from today 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.000
 release and den will be why resettlement 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.190
 ants were originally bought or 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.910
 your uterus should live in 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.969
 an incubator 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.830
 that's how it looks like a test tube or large 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.529
 a syringe filled with partial water and 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.320
 plugged cotton main thing check to 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.199
 the water did not flow through the grip ie 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.970
 for vata to hold water 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.310
 from time to time you will have to relocate 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.300
 your colony and side incubators are new and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.100
 water replenishment and replacement trays 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.940
 done it just needs to connect two 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.280
 incubator 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.950
 it is desirable to darken the short tube 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.010
 new incubator and wait uterus loves 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.680
 darker place, and it will encourage her and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.200
 hence all marks of relocation and 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.050
 that this process usually shows me from 5 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.690
 up to 30 minutes with robinson time 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.460
 cramped in the incubus you will need them 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.890
 move to small exactly in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.570
 little form is done all the same 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.440
 I only need to be lightly 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.260
 moistened 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.330
 and then there is already looking at their resettlement 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.400
 will it be seen whether to add water or 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.770
 No, however, Formica and they are much 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.080
 reluctant to relocate so you can still 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.090
 so to speak darken the incubator lamp 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.259
 or flashlight but by no means 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.170
 sunshine 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.420
 I overpowered my colony of 50 pieces not 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.460
 reading decay somewhere dayforka and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.229
 which I showed in the last issue 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.210
 size does not have to match 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.159
 the size of the colony that is small 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.350
 colony small fin large in 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.810
 big is not worth it because 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.240
 if you relocate a small colony 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.790
 big fund you will have a lot of empty 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.759
 cameras whose garbage will accumulate 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.500
 who can mold 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.689
 further when your k.o. grows up and his 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.450
 it will be possible to relocate below more 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.729
 however if you want to leave the colony 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.479
 Formica available you can not 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.670
 relocate 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.740
 of course with time they will be cramped 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.850
 but morality and begin to control 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.250
 the birth rate of the colony is so tolerable 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.380
 with you still dare letters of heaven from 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.900
 one format to another then cook 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.770
 wait for Moravia is extremely reluctant to leave 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.530
 your home 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.080
 even if much worse than new 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.790
 not to wait a month or worse if 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.239
 they will become these two nests 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.580
 In addition to the above methods, you can 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.800
 somewhat not to relocate to write 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.010
 moisturize formakari or vice versa day 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.290
 relocating it and moistening is also possible 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.920
 occasionally taps the old 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.170
 for miku 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.330
 However, if you have ants and so 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.890
 constantly scared the amount of neighbors like 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.920
 it is not worth me 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.080
 when my ants began to live intimately I 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.880
 decided to make them a bigger hut and piece 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.250
 after all them there 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.650
 did moistened moved before your 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.580
 eyes and in the description of the link to how i 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.440
 case forms and on the relocation process itself 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.660
 relocation of seam somewhere around four days from May 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.630
 the fact that I almost did not darken the nest and 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.880
 shooting and not for brighter because really 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.910
 there was nothing but fireflies and does not interfere with 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.860
 sleep on lack of water and cramped did 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.410
 its business even if most 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.750
 Ants moved uterus pedestrian and 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.489
 all collapse dragged but small 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.980
 a group of workers does not want any 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.769
 move then they can safely throw 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.049
 on and well that's all if you liked the release 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.450
 like subscribe to the channel 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.910
 on twitter I enter the group conquest 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.910
 questions communicate all the best
