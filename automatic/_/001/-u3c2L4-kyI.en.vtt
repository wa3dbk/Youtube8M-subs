Einstein<00:02:16.959> nice<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.620> see<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:18.280> what<00:02:18.549> are<00:02:18.670> you

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
Einstein nice to see you what are you

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:34.729 
Einstein nice to see you what are you
doing<00:02:18.819> more<00:02:20.129> well<00:02:21.129> did<00:02:21.519> you<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.950> was

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.180 

well<00:02:35.739> he<00:02:36.129> keeps<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:37.049> complex<00:02:38.049> process<00:02:38.680> of

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
well he keeps a complex process of

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.699 
well he keeps a complex process of
wibbly-wobbly<00:02:39.879> time<00:02:40.420> science<00:02:41.049> which<00:02:41.349> if<00:02:41.590> I

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
wibbly-wobbly time science which if I

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.289 
wibbly-wobbly time science which if I
told<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.190> I'd<00:02:42.280> have<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.610> come<00:02:42.790> inside<00:02:42.940> your

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
told you I'd have to come inside your

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.770 
told you I'd have to come inside your
head<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.599> your<00:02:43.690> raises<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.319> can't<00:02:45.180> no<00:02:46.180> it's<00:02:46.510> it's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
head in your raises I can't no it's it's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.259 
head in your raises I can't no it's it's
it's<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.430> do<00:02:48.489> anything<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.030> sonic

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
it's a it can do anything the sonic

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.789 
it's a it can do anything the sonic
screwdriver<00:02:49.360> really<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.110> could<00:02:50.260> lock<00:02:50.470> doors

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
screwdriver really it could lock doors

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.509 
screwdriver really it could lock doors
it<00:02:51.340> can<00:02:51.610> make<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> Sun<00:02:52.360> turn<00:02:52.720> blue<00:02:53.049> it<00:02:53.349> it<00:02:54.040> can

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
it can make the Sun turn blue it it can

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.729 
it can make the Sun turn blue it it can
make<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:54.970> rocket<00:02:55.450> fly<00:02:55.720> off<00:02:55.900> but<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.379> won't<00:02:56.620> work

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
make a rocket fly off but it won't work

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.869 
make a rocket fly off but it won't work
on<00:02:57.220> wood<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.319> if<00:02:59.319> any<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.799> you<00:02:59.920> can<00:03:00.430> figure<00:03:00.700> out

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
on wood so if any of you can figure out

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.740 
on wood so if any of you can figure out
the<00:03:01.359> scientific<00:03:02.519> theory<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:04.090> make<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.480> sonic

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
the scientific theory to make the sonic

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.050 
the scientific theory to make the sonic
screwdriver<00:03:04.870> work<00:03:05.560> on<00:03:05.769> wood<00:03:06.040> then<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.819> can

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
screwdriver work on wood then you can

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.880 
screwdriver work on wood then you can
come<00:03:07.450> on<00:03:07.750> an<00:03:07.900> adventure<00:03:08.140> in<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.530> darkness

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
come on an adventure in the darkness

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.910 
come on an adventure in the darkness
because<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.430> haven't<00:03:09.549> worked

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
because we haven't worked

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.770 
because we haven't worked
yeah<00:03:11.920> we<00:03:12.099> don't<00:03:12.250> need<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.579> know<00:03:12.760> what<00:03:13.569> if<00:03:13.690> he

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
yeah we don't need to know what if he

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.420 
yeah we don't need to know what if he
meets<00:03:13.930> wooden<00:03:14.319> monsters<00:03:14.769> that<00:03:14.980> would<00:03:15.130> be<00:03:15.220> bad

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
meets wooden monsters that would be bad

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.449 
meets wooden monsters that would be bad
I<00:03:15.609> know<00:03:16.000> worse<00:03:19.769> how<00:03:20.769> makes<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.040> statement<00:03:21.220> how

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
I know worse how makes a statement how

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.710 
I know worse how makes a statement how
many<00:03:21.579> looks<00:03:22.500> 11<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.340> actual<00:03:24.639> show<00:03:24.910> but
