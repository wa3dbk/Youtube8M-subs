going to do this is all either or i'll
just<00:00:18.720> play<00:00:19.050> through<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.789> ridiculously

just play through it in ridiculously
slow<00:00:20.939> motion<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.689> if<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.859> don't<00:00:23.279> follow<00:00:23.640> what

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.000 
me for the tabs and i'll send them to
you<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> I'll<00:00:32.940> start<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> intro<00:00:33.660> riff

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
you so I'll start with the intro riff

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.799 
you so I'll start with the intro riff
it's<00:00:35.010> going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.790> same<00:00:35.969> thing<00:00:36.300> repeated

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it's going to be the same thing repeated

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.720 
it's going to be the same thing repeated
four<00:00:37.320> times<00:00:38.239> except<00:00:39.890> there's<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.070> little<00:00:43.730> bad

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
four times except there's a little bad

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.510 
four times except there's a little bad
thing<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.719> he<00:00:45.870> does<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> end<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.710> each<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
thing that he does at the end of each of

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
thing that he does at the end of each of
the<00:00:47.579> four<00:00:47.760> times<00:00:48.030> he'll<00:00:48.750> slightly<00:00:49.350> she<00:00:49.649> ate<00:00:49.890> it

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the four times he'll slightly she ate it

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.790 
the four times he'll slightly she ate it
and<00:00:50.250> I'll<00:00:50.730> explain<00:00:51.090> which<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:52.289> he<00:00:52.440> does<00:00:52.620> at

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and I'll explain which what he does at

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.490 
and I'll explain which what he does at
the<00:00:52.890> end<00:00:53.010> each<00:00:53.309> time<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.079> first<00:00:55.079> time<00:00:55.289> he<00:00:55.379> goes

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the end each time so first time he goes

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:07.330 
the end each time so first time he goes
through<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.039> just

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:17.760 

and<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.509> second<00:01:08.810> time<00:01:08.929> will<00:01:09.079> be

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.319 

so<00:01:18.770> at<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.159> end<00:01:19.189> he<00:01:19.490> just<00:01:19.700> does<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:20.060> pinch

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
so at the end he just does that pinch

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.069 
so at the end he just does that pinch
harmonic<00:01:21.670> okay<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.179> the<00:01:23.390> third<00:01:23.600> time<00:01:23.840> will<00:01:24.020> be

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
harmonic okay and the third time will be

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.330 
harmonic okay and the third time will be
the<00:01:24.229> same<00:01:24.380> as<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.590> first<00:01:24.740> time<00:01:25.009> with<00:01:25.189> no

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
the same as the first time with no

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:33.130 
the same as the first time with no
special<00:01:25.759> harmonic<00:01:26.329> or<00:01:26.450> anything

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.590 

and<00:01:33.800> then<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.040> four<00:01:34.250> time<00:01:34.520> when<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:35.390> do<00:01:35.510> the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
and then the four time when we do the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.149 
and then the four time when we do the
ending<00:01:35.870> a<00:01:35.930> little<00:01:36.200> riff<00:01:36.320> part<00:01:36.620> we'll<00:01:36.890> just<00:01:37.070> do

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
ending a little riff part we'll just do

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:46.460 
ending a little riff part we'll just do
the<00:01:37.190> whole<00:01:37.370> thing<00:01:37.400> palm<00:01:37.700> muted<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:38.330> to<00:01:38.390> be

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.320 

and<00:01:47.470> then<00:01:48.370> he'll<00:01:48.850> do<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.660> I<00:01:49.960> think<00:01:50.170> twice<00:01:50.470> and

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
and then he'll do that I think twice and

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.510 
and then he'll do that I think twice and
then<00:01:52.330> he<00:01:52.570> goes<00:01:52.720> into<00:01:53.200> what<00:01:53.620> I<00:01:53.890> guess<00:01:54.100> I'll<00:01:54.280> call

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
then he goes into what I guess I'll call

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:18.600 
then he goes into what I guess I'll call
the<00:01:54.790> first<00:01:55.570> riff<00:01:55.870> and<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:57.100> is<00:01:57.250> going<00:01:57.550> to<00:01:57.670> be

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.900 

and<00:02:19.120> he'll<00:02:20.020> repeat<00:02:20.350> that<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.920> think<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:21.760> more

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
and he'll repeat that I think one more

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.230 
and he'll repeat that I think one more
time<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.450> then<00:02:23.260> he<00:02:23.560> goes<00:02:23.710> into<00:02:23.980> i<00:02:24.730> guess<00:02:25.090> i'll

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
time and then he goes into i guess i'll

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.330 
time and then he goes into i guess i'll
call<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.750> chorus<00:02:26.080> riff<00:02:26.290> or<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.860> RIP

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
call it the chorus riff or the RIP

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.500 
call it the chorus riff or the RIP
that's<00:02:27.700> full<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:27.910> tremolo<00:02:28.270> picking<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:30.510> that

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
that's full of tremolo picking and that

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:59.530 
that's full of tremolo picking and that
will<00:02:31.750> start<00:02:32.020> with

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.500 

and<00:03:00.540> then<00:03:01.250> after<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.280> i'm<00:03:02.940> not<00:03:03.239> sure<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:03.420> he

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
and then after that i'm not sure if he

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.860 
and then after that i'm not sure if he
repeats<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:04.580> but<00:03:05.580> either<00:03:05.730> way<00:03:06.000> after<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.660> he

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
repeats it but either way after that he

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
repeats it but either way after that he
goes<00:03:07.019> right<00:03:07.200> back<00:03:07.379> into<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.860> intro<00:03:08.370> if<00:03:08.580> which

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
goes right back into the intro if which

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.940 
goes right back into the intro if which
i<00:03:08.910> explained<00:03:09.209> already<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:15.599> then<00:03:16.140> he'll<00:03:16.799> do

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
i explained already and then he'll do

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.330 
i explained already and then he'll do
that<00:03:16.980> intro<00:03:17.370> riff<00:03:17.610> i<00:03:17.910> think<00:03:18.180> it's<00:03:19.340> probably

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
that intro riff i think it's probably

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.890 
that intro riff i think it's probably
the<00:03:20.580> same<00:03:20.730> amount<00:03:20.849> of<00:03:21.030> times<00:03:21.209> as<00:03:21.599> at<00:03:21.870> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
the same amount of times as at the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.770 
the same amount of times as at the
beginning<00:03:22.379> then<00:03:23.129> he'll<00:03:23.459> go<00:03:23.580> back<00:03:23.970> into<00:03:24.299> what<00:03:24.720> i

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
beginning then he'll go back into what i

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:32.180 
beginning then he'll go back into what i
called<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.080> verse<00:03:25.260> or<00:03:25.530> FB<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.720> then<00:03:31.620> he'll<00:03:32.040> go

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
called the verse or FB and then he'll go

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.449 
called the verse or FB and then he'll go
into<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.670> chorus<00:03:33.890> or<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.010> vert<00:03:35.190> or<00:03:35.370> the

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
into the chorus or the vert or the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.039 
into the chorus or the vert or the
tremolo<00:03:35.760> rift<00:03:36.180> which<00:03:36.360> is<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.630> last<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:37.019> that

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
tremolo rift which is the last one that

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.380 
tremolo rift which is the last one that
I<00:03:37.200> showed<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.410> though<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.239> only

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
I showed you though and so the only

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.360 
I showed you though and so the only

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
this song is the solo it's really short

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.839 
this song is the solo it's really short
it's<00:03:47.610> really<00:03:47.879> easy<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:49.430> don't<00:03:50.430> know<00:03:50.519> if<00:03:50.670> these

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
it's really easy I don't know if these

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.970 
it's really easy I don't know if these
tabs<00:03:51.150> are<00:03:51.390> exactly<00:03:51.660> correct<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:52.410> wasn't<00:03:52.680> really

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
tabs are exactly correct I wasn't really

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.550 
tabs are exactly correct I wasn't really
picky<00:03:53.400> about<00:03:53.430> them<00:03:53.849> when<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.090> first<00:03:54.560> learned

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
picky about them when I first learned

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.569 
picky about them when I first learned
the<00:03:55.769> song<00:03:56.360> but<00:03:57.360> sounds<00:03:57.930> close<00:03:58.140> enough<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:59.129> what

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
the song but sounds close enough so what

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:17.390 
the song but sounds close enough so what
he<00:03:59.700> does<00:03:59.910> is<00:04:00.500> start<00:04:01.500> here

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:26.360

sorry<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.510> any<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.050> which<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.500> played

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:38.600 
sorry the any of that which I played
incorrectly<00:04:29.660> was<00:04:37.220> if<00:04:38.220> you<00:04:38.310> didn't<00:04:38.460> catch<00:04:38.550> it

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
incorrectly was if you didn't catch it

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.680 
incorrectly was if you didn't catch it
that<00:04:38.790> now<00:04:38.910> I'll<00:04:39.030> play<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.240> one<00:04:39.389> more<00:04:39.419> time

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
that now I'll play it one more time

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.189 
that now I'll play it one more time
because<00:04:40.650> he<00:04:40.919> does<00:04:41.100> that<00:04:41.340> twice<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:43.020> only

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
because he does that twice the only

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.360 
because he does that twice the only
difference<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.560> second<00:04:43.860> time<00:04:44.040> is<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:46.370> I'll

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
difference the second time is is I'll

00:04:47.370 --> 00:05:02.240 
difference the second time is is I'll
show<00:04:47.580> you<00:05:00.289> actually<00:05:01.289> I<00:05:01.470> can't<00:05:01.770> specifically

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
show you actually I can't specifically

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.520 
show you actually I can't specifically
remember<00:05:02.580> if<00:05:02.639> there's<00:05:02.820> anything<00:05:03.090> different

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
remember if there's anything different

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.140 
remember if there's anything different
listen<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.740> CD<00:05:05.070> i<00:05:05.100> think<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.580> may<00:05:05.940> be<00:05:05.970> that

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
listen to the CD i think it may be that

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.400 
listen to the CD i think it may be that
the<00:05:06.870> last<00:05:07.050> one<00:05:07.289> beam<00:05:07.620> goes<00:05:08.160> up<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.430> here<00:05:08.639> but

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
the last one beam goes up to here but

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.480 
the last one beam goes up to here but
that's<00:05:10.410> close<00:05:10.590> enough<00:05:10.620> if<00:05:11.160> you're<00:05:11.280> not<00:05:11.370> like

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
that's close enough if you're not like

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.980 
that's close enough if you're not like
the<00:05:11.610> tabs<00:05:11.820> they'll<00:05:12.150> be<00:05:12.270> right<00:05:12.449> just<00:05:12.720> asking

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
the tabs they'll be right just asking

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.640 
the tabs they'll be right just asking
for<00:05:13.020> those<00:05:14.479> yeah<00:05:15.479> just<00:05:15.810> so<00:05:16.020> low<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.320> go<00:05:16.440> back

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
for those yeah just so low you go back

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.719 
for those yeah just so low you go back
through<00:05:17.010> I<00:05:17.039> think<00:05:17.190> it's<00:05:17.550> like<00:05:17.699> the<00:05:18.000> chorus<00:05:19.729> you

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
through I think it's like the chorus you

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.070 
through I think it's like the chorus you
can<00:05:20.880> sort<00:05:21.000> out<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.330> order<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:21.690> only<00:05:21.870> thing

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
can sort out the order the only thing

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.900 
can sort out the order the only thing
that<00:05:22.199> I<00:05:22.229> should<00:05:22.410> mention<00:05:22.620> is<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.340> last<00:05:23.639> time

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
that I should mention is the last time

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.659 
that I should mention is the last time
that<00:05:23.970> he<00:05:24.360> goes<00:05:24.510> through<00:05:24.539> the<00:05:25.110> chorus<00:05:25.440> riff<00:05:25.650> duh

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.640 

one<00:05:29.669> of<00:05:29.789> the<00:05:29.850> times<00:05:30.090> he's<00:05:30.630> going<00:05:30.840> to<00:05:30.900> stop<00:05:31.289> and

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
one of the times he's going to stop and

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.180 
one of the times he's going to stop and
do<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:32.430> slight<00:05:32.639> deviations<00:05:33.150> I'll<00:05:33.300> show<00:05:33.479> you<00:05:34.190> so

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
do a slight deviations I'll show you so

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:48.999 
do a slight deviations I'll show you so
it'll<00:05:35.430> go

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:55.040 

and<00:05:50.009> then<00:05:50.159> he<00:05:50.309> goes<00:05:50.460> back<00:05:50.490> into<00:05:50.759> this<00:05:53.419> so<00:05:54.419> the

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
and then he goes back into this so the

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.420 
and then he goes back into this so the
only<00:05:55.199> difference<00:05:55.529> will<00:05:55.680> be<00:05:55.710> that<00:05:55.830> at<00:05:56.400> one

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
only difference will be that at one

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.929 
only difference will be that at one
point<00:05:56.550> in<00:05:56.789> time<00:05:56.939> he'll<00:05:57.150> stop<00:05:57.389> go<00:05:59.779> so<00:06:00.779> uh<00:06:01.939> hope

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:02.939 
point in time he'll stop go so uh hope

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:04.010 
point in time he'll stop go so uh hope
that's<00:06:03.150> helpful<00:06:03.389> is<00:06:03.629> probably<00:06:03.900> really

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
that's helpful is probably really

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.980 
that's helpful is probably really
sporadic<00:06:04.349> but<00:06:04.889> and<00:06:05.639> I've<00:06:06.240> enough<00:06:06.419> time<00:06:06.629> to<00:06:06.870> do

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
sporadic but and I've enough time to do

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.769 
sporadic but and I've enough time to do
another<00:06:07.110> one<00:06:07.379> so<00:06:07.740> and<00:06:08.309> Joe<00:06:08.879> I<00:06:08.909> hopefully<00:06:09.389> learn

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:09.779 
another one so and Joe I hopefully learn

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:12.199 
another one so and Joe I hopefully learn
something
