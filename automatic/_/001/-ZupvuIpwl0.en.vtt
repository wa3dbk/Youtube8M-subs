 the fruit of long-term work 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.070
 at first it's a one shot 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.170
 who had drawn it in the hope of being 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.580
 published in the shÃ´nen jump following a 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.830
 refusal from the publisher 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.050
 he decided to turn to the weekly 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.580
 shonen kodansha magazine who him 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.229
 will receive the price of the

 after which success was not achieved 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.289
 expect 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.850
 at the time I'm talking to you know that he 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.380
 this is the seventh series having 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.270
 exceeded 20 million sales 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.549
 and this with only 11 volumes to his 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.760
 active a record that made drool over 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.250
 a 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.510
 but why such a success I will you 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.590
 give some answers but 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.229
 before that I will introduce you 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.640
 the story of this manga not banal 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.409
 the history of chinguetti nokia jean se 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.700
 unfolds in a world devastated by 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.229
 titans in huge creatures of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.670
 several meters high whose only 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.680
 instinct will be that of feeding 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.810
 of men a hundred years after the extermination 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.520
 almost total of humanity it remains 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.680
 that a small cloistered population in 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.450
 a gigantic site is protected by 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.259
 three circular walls preventing 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.390
 giants to penetrate 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.009
 the characters that we will follow in the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.130
 manga will be mainly and reindeer and 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.840
 jaeger micasa ackermann and armin arlette 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.340
 three young childhood friends and even a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.140
 little more than that since micasa is 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.310
 actually the adopted sister of and reindeer 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.549
 but be careful I do not tell you 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.549
 more 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.640
 while humanity finally believed itself 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.020
 spared a huge titan much bigger 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.030
 that all his comparable called the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.280
 colossal comes to create a breach in the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.590
 first wall of the city massacre of 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.150
 hopes impotence here are so many words 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.459
 which symbolizes this moment of violence 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.930
 extreme during which queen will see her 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.230
 mother getting copiously shredded 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.230
 under his eyes 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.980
 following this he made the decision 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.450
 to eradicate purely and simply 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.340
 titans he will then become soldiers to 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.230
 sides of micasa and armin who follow him 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.090
 a stupid thing that I thought was great 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.800
 at this moment of the manga we do not attend 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.390
 at the ascent of the hero the idea is not 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.500
 there then no not drive 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.209
 things that will make you turn into 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.290
 and who will last you 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.000
 hours and hours 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.470
 no many ellipses are so 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.459
 made to follow the trio and their 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.459
 colleagues once in office 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.700
 if we find some shenen codes 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.160
 with eren the brave hero micasa at 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.020
 genius talent too dark and armin the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.490
 not very strong but very intelligent 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.990
 must admit that the intensity of the 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.550
 narration makes us quickly forget 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.050
 the standards to give rise to a 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.970
 plot that goes more than once you 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.960
 surprise difficult not to you 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.640
 spoiler to give you some 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.260
 examples but know that the deaths of 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.210
 attaching secondary characters will be 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.010
 legions and revelations about the origin 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.540
 Titans led cleverly for you 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.930
 to think without too much 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.930
 tell you 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.370
 so let's talk specifically about the anim 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.410
 now I think I can say 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.700
 without worry that this is the cream of 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.440
 the cream from a technical point of view 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.510
 I like to say that it's a bit of the game of 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.310
 animated thrones in the sense that we 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.810
 attends a real bidding for 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.190
 the pupils time the work done on 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.530
 the environment and the phases of action 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.000
 leave him speechless to defeat the titans 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.890
 soldiers use swords and a 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.790
 displacement system called maneuver 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.530
 three-dimensional 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.389
 basically it's a kind of harness 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.699
 as soon as they come out two huge cable 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.870
 to swing and to arrive 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.940
 very quickly on a specific area 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.500
 animated makes of honor at these 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.120
 actions that become ultra dynamic 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.280
 with a quantity of details always 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.960
 more crazy big efforts have also 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.330
 been made on the pace of storytelling 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.800
 which lends itself perfectly to the format and 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.240
 who comes to leave at each episode end 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.889
 a cliffhanger that drives to 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.280
 the sequence of the complete series in 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.280
 an evening 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.550
 now let's quickly get back to the 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.770
 question I was asking just now 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.539
 why such a success is well in 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.779
 a few words I would say originality 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.249
 rigor but especially intensity the 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.930
 universal vector to create a work 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:00.389
 who marks remains and will always remain 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.699
 the emotion and dancings and pinocchio jeans 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.020
 they are exploited all the attention is 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.909
 omnipresent in front of this force 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.770
 supernatural who does not seem to have any 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.419
 limits and fear of men just as 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.469
 their discomfort with confinement is 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.270
 almost palpable 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.620
 otherwise ignorance whether it's the 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.930
 yours or that of the manga characters 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.849
 to something confusing that leaves 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.319
 a huge part to the assumptions and I 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.729
 find that frankly cool 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.960
 the themes addressed are as to 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.580
 they are not very numerous but they 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.289
 are exploited so deeply 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.999
 and served with such care on the rhythm 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.650
 that magic works wonderfully 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.089
 so it's true we feel a little bit of 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.650
 clumsiness in the manga with a drawing 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:33.479
 not necessarily brilliant and a hint of 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.249
 outbid with some dead but I 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.999
 the redis is the intensity that makes it 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.169
 here its quality 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.460
 by the way it does not have much 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.529
 to see but did you know that one 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.949
 adaptation in games 3ds to take them out at 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.689
 Japan 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.479
 I am curious to see that in France 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.710
 in the end I can only you 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.270
 advise you to turn to this 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.349
 chinguetti nokia jeans whatever it is 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.449
 the animated or the manga 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.759
 both are interesting to discover 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.990
 and do not think that because 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.089
 its base and because it is 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.039
 mainstream is a work that is missing 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:00.120
 quality normally it does not work 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.069
 not always like that and well 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.449
 luckily by the way on this well 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.159
 I wish you good viewing of 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.509
 good readings and I tell you to very 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:09.680
 soon for a new episode of the point 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.680
 manga go hi everyone 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.610
 Oh 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.120
 Oh
