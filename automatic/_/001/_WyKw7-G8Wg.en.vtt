00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.960
 fabre 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.640
 you people stop being misunderstood 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.200
 horses I am happy to you 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.940
 find today for a video on 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.110
 call of duty 4 we are in a death match 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.430
 by team on ambush 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.800
 but before you start this little 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.590
 commentary I would first like to thank 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.070
 the community channel code seif which 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.629
 wanted me to plots from the first episode of 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.620
 black up so I invite you to click 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.420
 on the notation 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.360
 if you have not seen this first episode 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.590
 who was on black ops so that's it 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.260
 you have certainly noticed at the beginning 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.190
 of the video there is always 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.210
 the introduction of quotas is all 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.860
 just because I'm going to try to 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.229
 implode 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.809
 this second episode on on their channel 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.040
 and so here I wanted to thank everything 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.360
 Bah particularly weak and it is a 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.670
 chain that allows me to advance on 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:08.750
 youtube and so here is today 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.070
 what all on ambush on side 4 and 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.250
 today I have twenty small subjects 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.220
 well specific to you so you agree 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.390
 I do not really talk about the gameplay 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.100
 finally me I let you watch what 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.600
 I'm going to do a little violent very 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.640
 nice woman 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.340
 that's it today I'm talking to you 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.610
 of a topic that holds me to maybe king 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.600
 at heart because many of you 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.590
 maybe even create polemics 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.630
 still debates I would like 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.350
 really debate with you about 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.910
 graphics on a make a game so I 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.619
 can talk about call of duty 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.570
 but I can also talk about other 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.090
 games because there are a lot of women 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.200
 more and more games are becoming 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.399
 more beautiful what is normal since we 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.310
 advance in technology 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.160
 finally good brief so what call of duty 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.570
 it's a game that is controversial 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.119
 simply because since 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.640
 many years the game uses the 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.410
 same graphics engine whether it's 20 beats 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.509
 for all call of duty but finally 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.910
 good brief rumors like what the 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.590
 motor would finally change as each 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.440
 year besides since black ops of I 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.640
 think rumors say that that 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.080
 author's bale would change then one does not 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.940
 not change but the soul this year the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.690
 next call of duty that will come out so 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.250
 in 2014 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.019
 they would change graphic engine is this 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.299
 which is true that ben we would have all 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.040
 right to a lot of things besides this 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.420
 which is formalized is that the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.400
 next call of duty will not be 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.790
 developed by treyarch but well because 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.209
 age 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.769
 amr what they did say they 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.120
 were partners in quotation marks 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.190
 with a movie you see for modern warfare 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.440
 3 will this will be fully developed by 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.299
 600 kids 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.510
 excuse me for the pronunciations but 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.980
 that's fine, we're coming back to our 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.850
 about the graphics on the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.010
 graphics it's true that a lot 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.690
 of you playing a game maybe not 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.299
 for the graphics entirely but 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.280
 it is true that it contributes enormously 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.980
 when you play you have I think that 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.450
 your goal is not to shoot at 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.500
 disgusting characters as on wii 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.150
 Besides, it's not very pretty 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.180
 but it's true that there is foot 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.820
 coating and my friends that the console 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.650
 is not finally good I would like 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.990
 discuss with you about the usefulness of 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.000
 fine graphics and you play pretty much 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.400
 we are going to say a whole to make a 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.840
 percentage 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.940
 what is the impact actually of the graphics 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.770
 according to you in a game do you 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.170
 play for maneuverability fa gameplay 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.440
 between quotation marks let's talk 10.6 to the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.910
 wiimote is what the fact of 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.420
 control your character with your 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.880
 wrists and so on with fashion lorie or 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.250
 just so it gets better 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.720
 we forget the disgusting graphics 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.130
 of the wii it's true that it's a small 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.739
 debate that deserves to be done 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.020
 finally good short it is true that 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.250
 graphics in a game it's for me 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:57.420
 it's finally 1.1 point something that 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.130
 is weird we are that bah voila 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.510
 I'm right and all the time on wii 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.770
 before but heard I'm sure we 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.500
 knew for several years 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.640
 now 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.120
 finally good brief 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.950
 and it's true that to move to a 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.260
 quality like that and in hd 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.290
 well, it's true that it changes 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.479
 a lot but it's true 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.280
 we are often when we play these two 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:26.030
 versions we are not really out of place 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.960
 means here it's just that and is 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.699
 so here I really want to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.410
 debate with us about that but me it's 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.789
 really a little debate any 1 I 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.910
 I'm not even going to throw a big 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:36.770
 big debate so for what's left at 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.470
 thousandth please ah yes already to the three 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.910
 quarters finally why not other cases 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.240
 so my name is Alexis I am 17 years old 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.639
 and I'm doing some quickdraws just a little bit 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.580
 little bit of everything and nothing about 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.990
 a retro game system finally a novel 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.849
 I make machine is quite diverse 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.280
 as I invite you to go see way 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.470
 I made a presentation the chain 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.039
 you will see all this in the 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.820
 description of both sides I hope that 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.720
 fight for that that is my channel 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.220
 simply 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.870
 and then for that you subscribe to my 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.370
 subscribers for that subscribe next 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.930
 but that offers gameplay from 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.250
 any call of and then in addition 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.050
 hungry here it is it's really young people said 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.509
 baky and he's really helping the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.310
 little youtube 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.560
 and so here I went a little around 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.990
 what I meant 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.000
 and that's it 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.280
 so in the name of gameplay I'm going to do 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.250
 a little bit women carnage time 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.330
 given that ben here are the enemies 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.979
 were not overpowered either but 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:41.330
 but it's true that I had very much 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.250
 very little played at 4.4 late a long time ago 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.810
 in fact I had not played much at 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.770
 east coast is only bam for me it's 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.510
 not my favorite 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.789
 unlike many others 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.280
 youtuber that 4 4 is a little man 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.610
 their rating their call of duty fetish game 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.800
 for me it's world at war is that both 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.419
 bako of 4 finally good quick if everyone and 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.729
 segou i want to say but code 4 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.620
 it's not too much not really my favorite 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:09.409
 finally good I think you this time 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:11.870
 it's a bit of my life and so here I am 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:15.380
 wanted a little you also talk about the 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.900
 time of the end of the gameplay 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.389
 honestly I was talking to you a little about 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.830
 killstreak system is attributed to this 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:27.529
 call of duty so we only have three 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:30.260
 killstreaks to know the drone a hit 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:32.930
 aerial and the helicopter that I think 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.880
 was really just right soon 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.279
 surprisingly not what the 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.810
 like ghost or the bath copy we have 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:41.779
 a lot of what killstreak 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.580
 could rot the game and it's true that 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:45.490
 when we see this time there was 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.900
 very little rage left in woman 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.130
 I just unlocked for the third 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.409
 or second time I know more the choice 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.860
 than the third time a strike 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:53.390
 Aerial 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.940
 and then besides I come from 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:07:02.060
 to follow on too much second the same 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.700
 attacked helicopters finally that's it 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.930
 especially i'm going to start 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.790
 finally yes I'll finish on a score of 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.250
 29 to 3 I still hope that this 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.720
 little gameplay will have pleased you no hesitation 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.720
 not to tell me in space 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.680
 comment if you liked it or not 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.490
 small as interesting small gameplay 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.780
 in any case I tell you to very 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.960
 soon for a next video by all 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.960
 the world
