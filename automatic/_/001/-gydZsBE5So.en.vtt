this<00:00:16.290> treacherous<00:00:16.770> horrible<00:00:17.550> sense<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.880> down

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
this treacherous horrible sense it down

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.810 
this treacherous horrible sense it down
there<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:19.350> know<00:00:19.980> we're<00:00:20.190> talking<00:00:20.280> about<00:00:20.520> three

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
there you know we're talking about three

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.690 
there you know we're talking about three
or<00:00:20.940> four<00:00:21.090> inches<00:00:21.120> here<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.220> very<00:00:23.220> deep<00:00:23.430> tense

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
or four inches here and very deep tense

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.100 
or four inches here and very deep tense
I<00:00:23.910> started<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> go<00:00:24.360> from<00:00:24.540> strength<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
I started to go from strength but it

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.840 
I started to go from strength but it
doesn't<00:00:25.380> really<00:00:25.500> do<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.770> much<00:00:26.100> really<00:00:26.730> what

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
doesn't really do that much really what

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.029 
doesn't really do that much really what
you're<00:00:27.029> trying

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
you're trying

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.890 
you're trying
Michelle

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.440 

the<00:00:32.050> Shelf<00:00:32.529> is<00:00:32.650> really<00:00:32.950> important<00:00:33.430> in<00:00:34.120> event

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
the Shelf is really important in event

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.040 
the Shelf is really important in event
and<00:00:35.280> that's<00:00:36.280> because<00:00:36.580> we<00:00:37.000> were<00:00:37.060> playing<00:00:37.210> when

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
and that's because we were playing when

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.750 
and that's because we were playing when
they<00:00:38.140> weren't<00:00:38.290> on<00:00:38.440> top<00:00:38.650> of<00:00:38.800> it<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:39.489> so<00:00:39.700> you

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
they weren't on top of it and so you

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.250 
they weren't on top of it and so you
would

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.350 

shelf<00:00:43.260> below<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.300> then

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
shelf below and then and then and then

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.810 
shelf below and then and then and then
you<00:00:45.570> also<00:00:45.780> need<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.260> chef's<00:00:46.620> some<00:00:47.220> Tampa<00:00:47.610> shelf

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
you also need a chef's some Tampa shelf

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.660 
you also need a chef's some Tampa shelf
and<00:00:48.000> extractors<00:00:48.540> and<00:00:48.860> perfect<00:00:49.860> early<00:00:50.520> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and extractors and perfect early that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.880 
and extractors and perfect early that
just<00:00:50.850> didn't<00:00:51.090> happen<00:00:51.410> early<00:00:52.410> benches<00:00:52.739> were

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
just didn't happen early benches were

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
just didn't happen early benches were
built<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.160> Windsor<00:00:53.579> chairs<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.629> look<00:00:54.840> at

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
built like Windsor chairs if you look at

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.670 
built like Windsor chairs if you look at
you<00:00:55.800> know<00:00:55.920> Roman<00:00:56.760> benches<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.570> mom<00:00:57.780> hey<00:00:58.079> up

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you know Roman benches the mom hey up

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.049 
you know Roman benches the mom hey up
through<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.699> know

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
through you know

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.689 
through you know
European<00:01:00.659> men<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.110> 15th<00:01:01.800> century<00:01:01.949> we

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
European men to the 15th century we

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.490 
European men to the 15th century we
don't<00:01:02.909> see<00:01:03.150> stretchers<00:01:03.659> appear<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.140> engines

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
don't see stretchers appear on engines

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.650 
don't see stretchers appear on engines
until<00:01:04.650> about

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
until about

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.800 
until about
so<00:01:06.660> that<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.410> the<00:01:07.500> new<00:01:07.620> innovation<00:01:08.630> so<00:01:09.630> this

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
so that was the new innovation so this

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.120 
so that was the new innovation so this
is<00:01:09.960> still<00:01:10.110> essentially<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> Windsor<00:01:10.890> chair

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
is still essentially a Windsor chair

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.250 
is still essentially a Windsor chair
this<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> seat<00:01:12.450> these<00:01:12.870> are<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.050> legs

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
this is the seat these are the legs

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.990 
this is the seat these are the legs
that's<00:01:13.680> where<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:13.890> strength<00:01:14.160> is<00:01:14.370> this<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
that's where the strength is this is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.460 
that's where the strength is this is
just<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.300> decorative<00:01:15.720> stuff<00:01:15.900> at<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.140> bottom

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
just the decorative stuff at the bottom

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.800 
just the decorative stuff at the bottom
where<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.890> scrape<00:01:17.160> your<00:01:17.280> mud<00:01:17.460> off<00:01:17.640> off<00:01:18.570> your

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
where you scrape your mud off off your

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.550 
where you scrape your mud off off your
feet<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:21.620> is<00:01:22.620> why<00:01:23.010> I<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.540> over<00:01:24.960> one

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
feet so that is why I can get over one

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
feet so that is why I can get over one
of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> principle<00:01:26.310> objections<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.090> know

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
of the principle objections that I know

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.790 
of the principle objections that I know
I'm<00:01:29.480> not<00:01:30.480> genetic<00:01:31.020> okay<00:01:31.230> it's<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.440> little<00:01:31.560> light

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
I'm not genetic okay it's a little light

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.430 
I'm not genetic okay it's a little light
on<00:01:31.830> engineers<00:01:32.690> is<00:01:33.690> it<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.260> most

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
on engineers is it you know most

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.960 
on engineers is it you know most
engineer<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:34.980> a<00:01:35.040> look<00:01:35.190> at<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.400> bench<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.760> see

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
engineer is a look at this bench and see

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.180 
engineer is a look at this bench and see
that<00:01:36.120> it's<00:01:36.210> going<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.390> rip<00:01:36.540> itself<00:01:36.870> apart

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
that it's going to rip itself apart

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.350 
that it's going to rip itself apart
because<00:01:38.190> I<00:01:38.550> have<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:39.770> contract<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.150> so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
because I have this contract so that so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
because I have this contract so that so
it's<00:01:42.480> expanding<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.050> width<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.800> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it's expanding at the width up here and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.490 
it's expanding at the width up here and
then<00:01:44.400> down<00:01:44.580> here<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.000> these<00:01:45.500> structures

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
then down here I have these structures

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.190 
then down here I have these structures
that<00:01:46.830> are<00:01:47.160> working<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.090> opposition<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:49.080> this

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that are working in opposition to this

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.890 
that are working in opposition to this
they're<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> restraining<00:01:50.460> order<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
they're a restraining order and so you

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.150 
they're a restraining order and so you
can<00:01:52.140> think<00:01:52.260> that<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.530> spends<00:01:52.770> would<00:01:52.980> tear

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
can think that the spends would tear

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.830 
can think that the spends would tear
itself<00:01:53.370> apart<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.390> look<00:01:54.570> down<00:01:54.780> here

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
itself apart and if you look down here

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.690 
itself apart and if you look down here
closely<00:01:55.260> I<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:55.980> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.190> see<00:01:56.340> there's<00:01:56.520> some

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
closely I think you can see there's some

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.350 
closely I think you can see there's some
little<00:01:56.910> gaps<00:01:57.150> from<00:01:58.050> here<00:01:58.290> because<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:58.770> light

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
little gaps from here because the light

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.870 
little gaps from here because the light
in<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.540> out<00:02:00.660> on<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.470> stretches<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.370> good

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
in and out on the stretches it's good

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.420 
in and out on the stretches it's good
for<00:02:03.150> them<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.300> no<00:02:03.510> problem<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> bench<00:02:05.160> at

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
for them to no problem I have a bench at

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.490 
for them to no problem I have a bench at
several<00:02:05.760> benches<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.360> survived<00:02:06.690> many

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
several benches that have survived many

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.850 
several benches that have survived many
many<00:02:07.800> years<00:02:08.130> without<00:02:09.030> any<00:02:09.330> problems

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.410 

because<00:02:15.860> all<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.100> strength<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.550> up<00:02:16.670> here<00:02:16.910> so

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
because all the strength is up here so

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.760 
because all the strength is up here so
if<00:02:17.510> this<00:02:17.660> cares<00:02:17.930> who<00:02:18.080> sells<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.380> card<00:02:18.620> you're

french it's very close but I was trying

french it's very close but I was trying
to<00:03:47.099> simplify<00:03:47.370> some<00:03:47.730> things<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.390> leg<00:03:48.569> vices<00:03:48.989> is

to simplify some things the leg vices is

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.210 
to simplify some things the leg vices is
just<00:03:49.799> as<00:03:50.129> perfectly<00:03:50.879> according<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.420> roubo<00:03:52.220> it

I'm<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.140> big<00:04:04.379> fan<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:05.010> light<00:04:05.310> vices<00:04:05.730> because

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
I'm a big fan of light vices because

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.960 
I'm a big fan of light vices because
number<00:04:06.359> one<00:04:06.569> they're<00:04:07.379> simple<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:09.060> can<00:04:09.239> build

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
number one they're simple you can build

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.730 
number one they're simple you can build
you<00:04:11.970> know<00:04:12.000> construct<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.629> very<00:04:12.870> very<00:04:13.200> common

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
you know construct a very very common

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.370 
you know construct a very very common
former<00:04:14.130> vice<00:04:14.340> for<00:04:14.910> example<00:04:15.300> this<00:04:15.930> was<00:04:16.140> for

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
former vice for example this was for

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.770 
former vice for example this was for
less<00:04:16.530> than<00:04:16.740> the<00:04:16.830> day<00:04:16.980> to<00:04:17.610> make<00:04:17.730> if<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.570> have

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
less than the day to make if you have

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.110 
less than the day to make if you have
wooden<00:04:19.020> screws<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:20.010> actually<00:04:20.460> as<00:04:20.910> you<00:04:21.000> can

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
wooden screws this actually as you can

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.270 
wooden screws this actually as you can
see<00:04:21.300> it's<00:04:21.450> three<00:04:21.630> TPI<00:04:22.110> so<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.590> moves<00:04:22.800> very<00:04:23.100> very

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
see it's three TPI so it moves very very

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.750 
see it's three TPI so it moves very very
fast<00:04:23.730> in<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.300> out<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.950> then<00:04:26.220> most

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
fast in and out and then most

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.460 
fast in and out and then most
importantly<00:04:27.300> there<00:04:27.840> are<00:04:27.990> no<00:04:28.200> guide<00:04:28.530> walks<00:04:30.470> s

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470

there's<00:05:51.059> no<00:05:51.270> pounds<00:05:51.779> own<00:05:51.960> so<00:05:52.469> you<00:05:52.529> can't<00:05:52.800> you

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:53.339 
there's no pounds own so you can't you

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:58.040 
there's no pounds own so you can't you
can't<00:05:53.550> hit<00:05:53.699> it<00:05:55.069> banker<00:05:56.069> but<00:05:56.219> hub<00:05:56.699> accident<00:05:57.209> and

can't hit it banker but hub accident and
so<00:05:58.319> what<00:05:58.680> I<00:05:58.770> do

so what I do

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.309 
so what I do
I<00:05:59.399> much<00:05:59.669> prefer<00:05:59.699> using<00:06:00.389> a<00:06:00.539> quick-release<00:06:00.779> or<00:06:01.289> a

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
I much prefer using a quick-release or a

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.769 
I much prefer using a quick-release or a
big<00:06:01.499> chop<00:06:01.860> here<00:06:02.189> that<00:06:02.939> I<00:06:03.029> can<00:06:03.209> just<00:06:03.360> reach<00:06:03.539> in

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:03.779 
big chop here that I can just reach in

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:06.739 
big chop here that I can just reach in
and<00:06:04.050> move<00:06:04.619> my<00:06:04.800> dog<00:06:05.009> up<00:06:05.249> and<00:06:05.550> it<00:06:06.029> is<00:06:06.360> in<00:06:06.509> line

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:06.749 
and move my dog up and it is in line

with any of the any of the dog here
 the<00:06:10.330> reason<00:06:10.599> the<00:06:10.660> top<00:06:10.870> is<00:06:11.050> so<00:06:11.199> big<00:06:11.410> asila

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
 the reason the top is so big asila

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.180 
 the reason the top is so big asila
did<00:06:11.860> was<00:06:12.039> support<00:06:12.250> like<00:06:13.150> a<00:06:13.180> big<00:06:13.569> case<00:06:13.870> I<00:06:14.190> here

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
did was support like a big case I here

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.369 
did was support like a big case I here
so<00:06:15.400> I<00:06:15.490> can<00:06:15.669> actually<00:06:15.849> plane<00:06:16.389> out<00:06:16.750> here<00:06:17.139> and

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
so I can actually plane out here and

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.540 
so I can actually plane out here and
once<00:06:17.650> at<00:06:17.949> that's<00:06:18.940> why<00:06:19.120> I<00:06:19.180> have<00:06:19.360> this<00:06:19.479> big<00:06:20.550> this
