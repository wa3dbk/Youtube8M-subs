00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:01.565
 I hope this video 

00:00:01.565 --> 00:00:02.900
 to solve many examples, 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.366
 which will give us an even better explanation of this 

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.469
 what it means to collect or subtract 

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.386
 positive or negative numbers. 

00:00:10.386 --> 00:00:12.400
 And while I solve them, I recommend you 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.833
 pause the video and try to solve it yourself, 

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:17.256
 and then we'll see how we'll solve them together. 

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:18.333
 Let's start. 

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.535
 Let's say minus 1 

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:25.517
 is equal to 7, minus blank space. 

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:27.134
 What should be in the empty place? 

00:00:27.134 --> 00:00:29.333
 Which number, whether positive or negative, 

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.833
 I suppose it could be 0, what would that number be? 

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.600
 All right, let's solve it together. 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.134
 Let me draw here 

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:40.567
 one numerical axis. 

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.834
 Now let's think about what's going on. 

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:47.300
 We're trying to get there 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.300
 to minus 1 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.234
 and we start at 7. 

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:54.334
 7 - this is 5, 6, 7. 

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.700
 We start at 7. 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.300
 How much do we have to get out of 7, 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.606
 to get to minus 1? 

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:08.467
 We will have to move 1, 2, 3, 4, 

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:11.933
 5, 6, 7, 8. 

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.715
 8 left. 

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:17.769
 What we have just done is to pull out 

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:21.134
 8 out of 7 to get minus 1. 

00:01:21.134 --> 00:01:22.766
 How much do we get? 

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:26.366
 We have to get 8. 

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.033
 Let's solve one more of these tasks. This is quite fun. 

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:30.766
 Let's say we have to find ... 

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:35.766
 Let's say we have minus 10 plus something 

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:38.300
 is equal to minus 5. 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.601
 What should be in the empty place in this case? 

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.767
 Let me draw again 

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:48.115
 a numerical axis and see. 

00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:51.033
 We will start from minus 10, 

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:54.433
 this is minus 10 here. 

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:56.434
 We start from minus 10 

00:01:56.434 --> 00:02:00.000
 and we'll add something to it to get minus 5. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.366
 Remember that minus 5 is here. 

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.266
 So if we add something, that means it will 

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.400
 we go to the right axis on the numerical axis. 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.765
 This will happen if we add a positive number. 

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:10.600
 And we see here that we are going to the right, 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.866
 we will move from minus 10 to minus 5, 

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.433
 so we'll add a positive number. 

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:17.867
 If we had added a negative number, we would move to the left. 

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:19.500
 So how much should we add? 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.733
 Let's just count the divisions. 

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:25.300
 We will add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.467
 We added plus 5. 

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:31.067
 That's five. 

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:36.067
 Minus 10 plus 5 is equal to minus 5. 

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:39.400
 We just became less negative with 5, 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.933
 this is one way to look at it. 

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:42.266
 Let's resolve one more! 

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:43.433
 All right. 

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:46.933
 Say we have 4 is equal 

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:50.833
 to minus 2 plus a blank space. 

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:55.707
 4 is equal to minus 2 plus something. 

00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:57.800
 We can do it in the same way that we have decided the others. 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.200
 Let's draw the numerical axis here. 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.207
 Let's see now. 

00:03:03.207 --> 00:03:06.734
 Our goal could be to get to 4. 

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:10.000
 Our goal is 4 here. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.300
 This is 1, 2, 3, 4, to get to plus 4. 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.533
 Plus 4. 

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:19.052
 We start from minus 2 ... 

00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:21.000
 Let me write it in a different color. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.200
 We start from minus 2. 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.500
 4 is equal to minus 2 ... 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.468
 Minus 2 is here, 

00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:30.133
 minus 2 plus any number. 

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:33.112
 And it is clear that we will move 

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.354
 to the right 

00:03:35.354 --> 00:03:39.911
 with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:42.666
 We moved to the right with 6. 

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:44.300
 We have therefore added 6. 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.564
 So minus 2 plus 6 

00:03:48.564 --> 00:03:51.588
 is equal to 4. 

00:03:51.588 --> 00:03:52.333
 That's fascinating. 

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:55.638
 Let's solve some of these tasks. I can not stop. 

00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:56.966
 All right. 

00:03:56.966 --> 00:04:01.250
 Let's say we want to find ... 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.568
 I have 6 plus something 

00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:08.633
 is equal to minus 8. 

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:10.500
 As always, try to pause the video 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.030
 and find what will be in this empty place. 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.033
 I will draw again 

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:19.930
 numerical axis here. 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.455
 We can start the decision 

00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:28.423
 of 6. 

00:04:28.423 --> 00:04:31.466
 That's 5, this is 6. 

00:04:31.466 --> 00:04:34.933
 And I'll add something to get minus 8. 

00:04:34.933 --> 00:04:37.133
 To get to minus 8, I pass through minus 5, 

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:39.100
 minus 6, minus 7, minus 8. 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.300
 I want to get here here, 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.900
 to minus 8. 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.100
 What should I do to get from 6 to 8? 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.300
 To get from 6 to 8. 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.400
 It is clear that I have to move left to the numerical axis. 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.534
 And how far should I move to the left? 

00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:57.068
 Let's count. 

00:04:57.068 --> 00:05:00.644
 I have to move 1, 2, 3, 4, 

00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:04.367
 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:08.797
 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. 

00:05:08.797 --> 00:05:10.826
 So I'm moving with 14 left, you can say, 

00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:13.466
 I just pulled out 14. 

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:14.412
 And if we paraphrase it like 

00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:16.966
 6 plus how much is equal to minus 8? 

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:20.200
 6 plus minus 14. 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.733
 If it says 6 minus something, 

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:23.800
 I can just say 6 minus 14, 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.666
 but if it says 6 plus how much, 

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:30.617
 we will have 6 plus minus 14.
