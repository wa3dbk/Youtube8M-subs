00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.669
 do not 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.239
 but I refused was born from the union of three words cinema May 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:22.720
 it is the spirit that we have tried to make sense of this project 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.949
 On the one hand we wanted to make the work of great quality david bisbal de 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.230
 there he defines it 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.420
 on the other hand we wanted to go through the cramped were or the player's 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.419
 video to make the viewer participate 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.600
 and finally, more beloved than the spectator can say is the future 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.680
 of history not with different special developments depending on the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.620
 chosen path garcÃ­a 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.010
 the one that the game 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.750
 in short, to make the spectator the protagonist of his own adventure 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.170
 in reference to the three concepts that the mentioned that we should form the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.760
 heart of this america 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.310
 well that we have created what he called moss the first river others 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.150
 points 0 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.620
 then this creation is optimized to make my happy year you 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.150
 be as much or conditioned and played 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.260
 i situate the viewer 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.300
 in a close-up 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.160
 and contrary to what used to be traditional tea 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.900
 p the visual narrations was that the deficit is to say he 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.910
 the presenter state arms 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.410
 and good punching happen a series of events that you have to read the 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.730
 protagonist because now it is him precisely the spectator who 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.120
 It converts into users the one that through the clicks that the screen embraces you 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.550
 to solve puzzles or your own intuition that will tell the future 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.180
 of history and on the other hand history also moves from people 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.620
 let's say this platform would be natural to the other platforms on 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.840
 multimedia that currently exist as well as electronic mail or 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.460
 facebook then what it does is situate in one's life in your own real life 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.620
 your experience mixes with the story that you're seeing then it 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.450
 it produces an enrichment to the history there allows us then and it is much more 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.680
 there 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.920
 more depth 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.500
 efe 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.149
 what in the museum that to highlight those behind this america 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:18.009
 there is an NGO there is an idea apparently they should not be several tricks 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.039
 about these values â€‹â€‹the baby's weight 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.140
 what is the idea 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.259
 the crime that in the lpb production of the piece of visual 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.579
 the last creator the last producer 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.440
 the viewer 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.810
 pablo ii daniel have shown that 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.810
 the cut and fixing ideas using 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:37.839
 the base of domain or not 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.769
 something that asks you to go further technologically not and they have 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.189
 got them they have gone much further 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.209
 two 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.060
 lucky mckee poli on day of new technologies 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.819
 on the computer supports 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.299
 royal district are those audiovisual resources in the mÃ©ndez piana 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.179
 above all in the case our project the internet tutorials 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:07.059
 the produce 7 we can acquire a series of knowledge skills and resources 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:08.429
 has apostilled 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:10.949
 that would be unthinkable a few years ago 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.330
 and not only that but also 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.929
 in it for an audience 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.849
 with the amount of people is superior to any means of communication 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.219
 traditional 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.469
 and what to say with this 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.730
 we are not allies with these tools with these new 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:24.760
 technologies 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.629
 we have opted for the teacher of santa fe 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.329
 an exceptional case 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.209
 is probably the imagination or the desire to enjoy the work of 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:33.679
 one 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.689
 this athleti the greatest resource and 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.329
 and as many novels important things in this way can not be bought with 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.319
 money 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.199
 in special mention to a wig that we bought be for 14 euros in order to 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.399
 safeguard the identity of the protagonist 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:51.449
 and that never and we will use 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.939
 however, and if any derivative is used, either from diets or 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.210
 of gasoline or 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.700
 that kind of thing stretches that has not been an expensive product 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.139
 mmm 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.909
 the cash 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.319
 the consell has to take advantage of all the multiple platforms 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.489
 what right now, since everyone has access to a villa that uses 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.669
 often in fact anyone in your pocket and devices 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.330
 from which you can check your mail you can make purchases or you can 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.409
 in consultation with what kind of energy deer informs that a few years ago was 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:27.849
 practically unthinkable 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.199
 then we want you to follow menik percent uses your platforms as per 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.099
 example facebook or the user's own email 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.169
 to integrate the story and to penetrate the barrier of the 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.169
 shielding computer and thus getting deeper 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.520
