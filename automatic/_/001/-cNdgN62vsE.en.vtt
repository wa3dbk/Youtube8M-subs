origin<00:04:35.850> of<00:04:35.940> Wolverine<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.360> think<00:04:36.570> it's<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.750> great

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
origin of Wolverine I think it's a great

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.520 
origin of Wolverine I think it's a great
story

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
story

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.040 
story
um<00:04:37.880> maybe<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.150> story<00:04:39.450> had<00:04:39.630> been<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> little

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
um maybe the story had been a little

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.580 
um maybe the story had been a little
better

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
better

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.110 
better
