00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
thing tomorrow unfortunately our team

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.539 
thing tomorrow unfortunately our team
rating<00:01:09.990> isn't<00:01:10.200> really<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.770> high<00:01:11.040> we're<00:01:11.400> in

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
rating isn't really that high we're in

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.340 
rating isn't really that high we're in
like<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.420> brand<00:01:12.689> new<00:01:12.869> team<00:01:13.110> when<00:01:13.260> we

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
like it was a brand new team when we

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
started to be starting with 0 points and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.230 
started to be starting with 0 points and
I<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.500> 1200<00:01:17.490> rating

rating<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.750> what<00:01:30.899> I'd<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.399> week

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
rating is what I'd like for this week

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.539 
rating is what I'd like for this week
that's<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> short-term<00:01:33.750> goal<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.229> mine<00:01:34.549> if

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that's like a short-term goal of mine if

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.210 
that's like a short-term goal of mine if
we<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.820> get<00:01:35.909> 1,700<00:01:36.360> raining<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.560> know<00:01:37.649> for

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
we can get 1,700 raining or you know for

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.639 
we can get 1,700 raining or you know for
ibly<00:01:38.429> higher<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:39.539> at<00:01:39.810> least<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:40.409> some

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
ibly higher but at least to get some

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.440 
ibly higher but at least to get some
bonus<00:01:41.070> points<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> way<00:01:42.149> it<00:01:42.270> works

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
bonus points because the way it works

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.570 
bonus points because the way it works
yet<00:01:42.750> conquest<00:01:43.289> points<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:44.130> there's<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.369> cap

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
yet conquest points but there's a cap

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.020 
yet conquest points but there's a cap
depending<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.390> your<00:01:45.840> rvg<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:47.009> arena<00:01:47.580> ratings

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
depending on your rvg or arena ratings

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.320 
depending on your rvg or arena ratings
so<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.080> we<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.500> over<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.310> believe<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.090> caps

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
so if we can get over I believe the caps

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.889 
so if we can get over I believe the caps
around<00:01:51.780> 1700<00:01:52.679> and<00:01:52.770> higher<00:01:52.950> maybe<00:01:53.220> 1800<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.780> can

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
around 1700 and higher maybe 1800 we can

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.779 
around 1700 and higher maybe 1800 we can
actually<00:01:55.319> get<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.500> significant<00:01:56.490> advantage

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
actually get a significant advantage

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.899 
actually get a significant advantage
over<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.110> competition<00:01:58.259> by<00:01:59.069> increasing<00:01:59.759> our

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
over the competition by increasing our

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.690 
over the competition by increasing our
