scanning device it's amazing so tell me

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.130 
scanning device it's amazing so tell me
little<00:00:41.090> bit<00:00:41.239> about<00:00:41.330> how<00:00:41.449> it<00:00:41.570> works<00:00:41.720> well

actually<00:00:42.290> what<00:00:42.559> we<00:00:42.650> can<00:00:42.770> do<00:00:42.890> here<00:00:43.129> is<00:00:43.250> app

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
actually what we can do here is app

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.450 
actually what we can do here is app
activate<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.480> application<00:00:45.250> mobile<00:00:46.250> photo

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
built a authenticate yourself and now

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.080

you can pay a new bill by simply taking

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.450 
you can pay a new bill by simply taking
a<00:00:50.300> picture<00:00:50.510> of<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:51.650> I<00:00:51.680> can<00:00:51.920> activate<00:00:52.190> the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
a picture of it so I can activate the

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.270 
a picture of it so I can activate the
app<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.970> camera<00:00:53.390> comes<00:00:53.660> right<00:00:53.930> up<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.410> put<00:00:55.160> the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
app the camera comes right up I put the

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.310 
app the camera comes right up I put the
image<00:00:55.580> together<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.870> let<00:00:56.989> me<00:00:57.079> get<00:00:57.200> a<00:00:57.230> little

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
image together and let me get a little

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.510 
image together and let me get a little
further<00:00:57.590> away<00:00:57.770> there<00:00:58.180> take<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.300> picture<00:01:00.520> and

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
further away there take the picture and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.819 
further away there take the picture and
the<00:01:01.850> process<00:01:02.360> begins<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.320> what<00:01:03.500> we<00:01:03.620> do<00:01:03.800> is

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
the process begins so what we do is

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.830 
the process begins so what we do is
actually<00:01:04.190> take<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.970> image<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.449> it<00:01:05.570> can<00:01:05.690> be

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
actually take the image and it can be

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.200 
actually take the image and it can be
crooked<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.710> can<00:01:06.860> be<00:01:06.979> shadowed<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.880> can<00:01:08.060> be

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
crooked it can be shadowed it can be

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.240 
crooked it can be shadowed it can be
even<00:01:08.330> here<00:01:09.050> on<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:09.560> can<00:01:09.680> spill<00:01:09.920> your<00:01:10.009> beer

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
it's really a terrific of technologies

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.510 
it's really a terrific of technologies
very<00:01:26.930> clever<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:27.500> it's<00:01:27.619> basically<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:28.100> scanning

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
very clever so it's basically a scanning

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.670 
very clever so it's basically a scanning
technology<00:01:29.210> with<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:29.930> kind<00:01:30.229> of<00:01:30.260> a<00:01:30.350> bank

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680
