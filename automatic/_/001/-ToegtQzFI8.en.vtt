00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello and welcome to the video channel 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.170
 of the blog my child decides today I 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.150
 would like to suggest an activity 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.519
 fun to make a map of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.099
 greetings around the Christmas vault we go 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.120
 to paint a snowman with 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.980
 gouache paint 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.500
 we will also use some grains 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.220
 pepper to make a small 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 snowman 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.420
 it's an activity that has adapted for 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.000
 children from 3 years old up to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.740
 the age of six years removed so have to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.210
 our DIY we will need a 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.590
 cardboard sheet of colors of the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.230
 gouache ready to use colors 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.460
 plunges an effect brush but this is 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.750
 not required you can replace it 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.329
 with a fork 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.000
 a small glass and a bigger glass 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.219
 to draw the circles for the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.960
 snowman and black pepper and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.530
 of jamaica pepper that is a little 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.500
 bigger easier to pass between 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.930
 fingers and then 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.120
 best suited to make the eyes a 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.700
 felt and a painting painting biture 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.700
 so to start the child will trace 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.030
 the round around the greens is so 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.390
 formed the drawing of the snowman 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.180
 like this then he's going to apply the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.369
 white paint using a sponge 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.430
 using the corner we sponge it for 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.320
 do not go over the hole then we have 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.060
 used a hair dryer to dry the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.580
 paint quickly and we do not see to 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.950
 the grave too long and then 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.880
 the child will place the peppercorns 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.570
 in order to form the drawing of the face of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.630
 lots of snow and then placed 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.920
 a boon of his coat then the most 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.920
 big kids are going to be able 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.370
 paste the peppercorns alone 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.350
 for the little ones it will be the adult who will 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.860
 stick the peppercorns because 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.690
 it's pretty tricky 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.450
 then we used a sheet 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.720
 of different color to make a 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.110
 hat a scarf for our man 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.020
 of snow and we added some small 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.679
 decorations the snowflakes and then 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.209
 a snowy hill with the brush and 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.280
 the facts or so you can do 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.350
 exactly the same with a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.760
 fork 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.950
 here we hope that our DIY 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.660
