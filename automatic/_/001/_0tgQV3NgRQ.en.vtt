to<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.540> lr<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.530> phone<00:02:07.830> can<00:02:08.190> actually<00:02:08.550> take

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
to this lr this phone can actually take

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.730 
to this lr this phone can actually take
a<00:02:08.759> lot<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.330> due<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> lack<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.869> we're

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
a lot of just due to the lack of we're

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.440 
a lot of just due to the lack of we're
shot<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.220> also<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.790> fact<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.270> takes

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
shot and also the fact that it takes

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.470 
shot and also the fact that it takes
quite<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.750> while<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.250> poi<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.520> get<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.090> focus

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
quite a while for poi to get in focus

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.240 
quite a while for poi to get in focus
and<00:02:15.690> by<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.050> time<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.410> take<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.650> shot<00:02:16.980> it's

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
and by the time you take that shot it's

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.910 
and by the time you take that shot it's
already<00:02:17.550> lost<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.959> want<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.470> take

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
histogram macro shots are pretty good so

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.610 
histogram macro shots are pretty good so
China<00:02:36.000> Sea<00:02:36.239> which<00:02:36.570> micro<00:02:36.930> shot<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.200> better<00:02:37.410> now

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
as you can see right now Lucas have to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.380 
as you can see right now Lucas have to
use<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> tripod<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.410> make<00:02:40.709> everything<00:02:41.400> chapeau

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
use a tripod to make everything chapeau

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.790 
use a tripod to make everything chapeau
whereas<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.110> foot<00:02:43.320> we'll<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:43.620> have<00:02:43.769> to

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
whereas on the foot we'll just have to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.009 
whereas on the foot we'll just have to
tap<00:02:44.100> because<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.030> has<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> very<00:02:45.510> good<00:02:45.750> image

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
tap because it has a very good image

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.990 
tap because it has a very good image
stabilizer<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.400> terms<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.700> convenience

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
stabilizer so in terms of convenience

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.449 
stabilizer so in terms of convenience
the<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.989> phone<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.260> still<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> lot<00:02:49.830> more<00:02:50.040> easier

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
the the phone is still a lot more easier

00:02:50.459 --> 00:03:07.240 
the the phone is still a lot more easier
to<00:02:50.519> use<00:02:50.790> data<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.480> all<00:02:51.810> vintage<00:02:52.140> dis<00:02:52.470> along

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.920 

the<00:03:08.250> SLR<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.670> actually<00:03:09.090> using<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.510> really<00:03:09.720> long

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
the SLR is actually using a really long

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.470 
the SLR is actually using a really long
shutter<00:03:10.140> speed<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.430> phone<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:12.000> so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
shutter speed and the phone is it so

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.650 
shutter speed and the phone is it so
that<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.590> difference<00:03:13.890> between<00:03:14.660> 2006

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
that is the difference between 2006

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:30.990 
that is the difference between 2006
camera<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.769> 2012

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.210 

early<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.090> can<00:03:32.239> see<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.629> unlike<00:03:33.409> the<00:03:33.650> DSLR<00:03:34.159> I

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
early you can see that unlike the DSLR I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.830 
early you can see that unlike the DSLR I
have<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.519> go<00:03:34.640> really<00:03:34.790> close<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.450> get<00:03:35.599> a<00:03:35.629> same

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
have to go really close to get a same

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.570 
have to go really close to get a same
shot<00:03:36.220> because<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.489> could<00:03:37.760> actually<00:03:37.970> use<00:03:38.180> the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
shot because I could actually use the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.190 
shot because I could actually use the
digital<00:03:40.580> zoom<00:03:40.610> if<00:03:40.849> I<00:03:40.970> want<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.299> but<00:03:41.510> as<00:03:41.750> you

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
digital zoom if I want to but as you

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.680 
digital zoom if I want to but as you
already<00:03:42.409> know<00:03:42.739> when<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.040> use<00:03:43.190> digital<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
already know when you use digital the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.220 
already know when you use digital the
picture<00:03:45.560> quality<00:03:45.709> my<00:03:46.099> gotta<00:03:46.310> be<00:03:46.430> pixelated<00:03:47.230> so

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
picture quality my gotta be pixelated so

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.110 
picture quality my gotta be pixelated so
now<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.950> can<00:03:49.099> see<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.250> have<00:03:49.580> to<00:03:49.760> move<00:03:49.940> around
