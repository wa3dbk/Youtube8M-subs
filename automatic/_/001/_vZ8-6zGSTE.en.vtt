00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.220
 percentage and 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.330
 I wanted 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.500

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.040
 the path of the body is a great message 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.020
 collection 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.200

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.250
 prevents getting from having a lot 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.660
 different reasons 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.190
 because a lot I think that the main 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.130
 questions there rights flasher to ride 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.050

 in the interval 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.360
 so to speak 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.180
 well something that he is nervous adults 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.680
 I won't allow myself to be like that 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.550
 me a lot and 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.550

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.850

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.900
 I really hope that you go 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.600
 I hope that after the strike is not the point 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.239
 what am I in perspective 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.259
 streams advertise the thing is he i 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.609
 convinced that you need it 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.749
 while quite convinced that 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.579
 a huge number of people who do not 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.999
 understood the film and did not see it 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.889
 or took his touches 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.509
 a lot but leave 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.279
 questions they saw this this dilogy on 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.049
 similar to 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.049
 And so to speak on it the socket and on the plug 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.959
 both of them that light appears so 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.529
 satellites of the day when one enters another 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.159
 when polikarkin and for you 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.119
 single course setting 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:41.569

 even sure that we will talk in his 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:51.969
 because in general for the first time 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:53.609
 percent 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.339
 we decided to make such an action before 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:56.989
 surprise for you will be 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.569
 because he is with you 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.939
 not reported on live tv that 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.349
 called online on the Internet 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.370
 during the movie premiere and you will see 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.459
 I hope those people who 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.009
 will come to the film 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:11.839
 im maybe you see those people 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.639
 who being film after film 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.669
 listen to them 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.679
 later we will do nn 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.089
 so to speak direct communication 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.819
 this communication will take place on 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.799
 platform damn g 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.209
 and why the idea is that 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.439
 we communicate with people who have seen 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.639
 as 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.329
 it is very interesting to me 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.469
 believe that the point is not that bike 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.299
 in this meeting with 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.729
 lust will wait 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.889
 hike no i'm sober about this 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.539
 picture for one reason 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.189
 she was so worth human strength 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.289
 such an amount and increased risk and 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.399
 costs of such costs 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.279
 miracle of the north only cost rotax sing 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:56.340
 financial 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.739
 they cost nothing compared to costs 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.480
 man trust me 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.379
 I know this. I know what I am saying because 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.299
 all this finance is there on the screen and in 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.599
 pocket 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.909
 before the movie before the hood on that 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.619
 It remains to remove from the register and you will see it 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.929
 so I'm a little suitor for a while from 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:15.829
 you 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.750
 at that 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.510
 By the way, I immediately want to apologize to 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.659
 also great 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.949
 the amount that the information that 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.990
 my name is live especially after 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.199
 of this type after 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.990
 m live 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.500

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.920

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.500
 4 4 4 I ask you not to be offended even 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.460
 vice versa support not because 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.689
 if i don't do that 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.330
 I can not answer for what you see 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.159
 so I thought waiting for class I hope that 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.050
 we'll talk to you 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.349
 I am quite sure that by poll 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.120
 valid 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.010
 will be something to talk about 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.849
 further 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.699
 there are a lot of questions 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:01.559
 of problems 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.550
 but that does not want to talk to you 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.069
 this movie and 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.069
 sorry for the pathos of our beautiful 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.460

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.910
