00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
this is basically what the Kentucky

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.580 
this is basically what the Kentucky
rifle<00:01:11.430> evolved<00:01:12.030> from<00:01:12.180> since<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> German

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
rifle evolved from since the German

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.590 
rifle evolved from since the German
settlements<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.250> eastern<00:01:14.640> Germany<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
settlements in eastern Germany in the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.859 
settlements in eastern Germany in the
eastern<00:01:15.930> part<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.229> Pennsylvania<00:01:17.780> started<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
eastern part of Pennsylvania started to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.770 
eastern part of Pennsylvania started to
develop<00:01:19.140> guns<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:20.520> their<00:01:20.850> own<00:01:21.060> after<00:01:21.659> they

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
develop guns of their own after they

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.899 
develop guns of their own after they
came<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.140> their<00:01:22.380> homeland<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.310> evolved<00:01:23.759> into

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
came from their homeland it evolved into

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.910 
came from their homeland it evolved into
what<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.570> today<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.110> Kentucky<00:01:25.710> rifle

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
what we know today is the Kentucky rifle

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.330 
what we know today is the Kentucky rifle
so<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.150> basically<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.320> concept<00:01:28.799> or<00:01:29.130> this

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
so and basically the concept or this

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.179 
so and basically the concept or this
this<00:01:29.880> type<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.180> rifle<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
this type of rifle is what the the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.950 
this type of rifle is what the the
evolution<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> Kentucky<00:01:33.450> rifle<00:01:33.630> was

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
evolution of the Kentucky rifle was

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.600 
evolution of the Kentucky rifle was
developed<00:01:34.170> from<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.340> would<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
developed from so this would be a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.670 
developed from so this would be a
typical<00:01:35.970> German<00:01:36.299> hunting<00:01:36.869> rifle<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> what

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
typical German hunting rifle that what

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.240 
typical German hunting rifle that what
era<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.820> would<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.390> 1760<00:01:40.020> period<00:01:40.950> okay

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
era this would be about 1760 period okay

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.219 
era this would be about 1760 period okay
this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.610> typical<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.450> earlier<00:01:42.780> periods

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
this is typical of the earlier periods

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.899 
this is typical of the earlier periods
as<00:01:43.350> well<00:01:43.590> maybe<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> slightly<00:01:44.610> different

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
as well maybe with a slightly different

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.170 
as well maybe with a slightly different
features<00:01:45.509> okay<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> notice<00:01:47.610> about<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
features okay but what I notice about it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.999 
features okay but what I notice about it
compared<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> other<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
compared to the other one is it's a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.789 
compared to the other one is it's a
shorter<00:01:50.490> gun<00:01:50.729> yes<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.630> top<00:01:51.960> configuration

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
shorter gun yes this top configuration

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.760 
shorter gun yes this top configuration

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
were some that were made men most of

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.170 
were some that were made men most of
them<00:03:12.680> were<00:03:12.920> made<00:03:13.130> with<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.370> brass<00:03:13.640> patch<00:03:13.910> box

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
but it would have been simple again in

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.370 
but it would have been simple again in
form<00:03:16.489> not<00:03:16.670> like<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.120> lower<00:03:17.330> ones<00:03:17.690> okay<00:03:18.230> they

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
form not like the lower ones okay they

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.830 
form not like the lower ones okay they
get<00:03:18.530> kind<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:18.830> fancy<00:03:19.250> if<00:03:19.340> they<00:03:19.519> lower<00:03:19.880> down<00:03:20.150> yes

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
get kind of fancy if they lower down yes

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.680 
get kind of fancy if they lower down yes
yeah<00:03:21.739> then<00:03:22.220> after<00:03:22.580> after<00:03:22.790> we<00:03:23.060> transitioned

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
yeah then after after we transitioned

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.600 
yeah then after after we transitioned
past<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:24.110> Revolutionary<00:03:24.799> War<00:03:25.100> because<00:03:25.400> there
