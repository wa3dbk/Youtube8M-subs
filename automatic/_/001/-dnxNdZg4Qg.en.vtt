as<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:08.560> first<00:00:09.010> step<00:00:09.430> we<00:00:09.490> will<00:00:09.940> make<00:00:10.120> a<00:00:10.150> mix<00:00:10.510> of

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:10.720 
as a first step we will make a mix of

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.970 
as a first step we will make a mix of
glitter<00:00:11.020> using<00:00:11.590> green<00:00:11.830> and<00:00:12.070> blue<00:00:16.380> the<00:00:17.380> formula

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
glitter using green and blue the formula

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.179 
glitter using green and blue the formula
is<00:00:18.160> a<00:00:18.190> measure<00:00:18.550> of<00:00:18.730> blue<00:00:19.210> purple<00:00:19.720> green<00:00:20.710> to

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
is a measure of blue purple green to

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:35.120 
is a measure of blue purple green to
create<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.820> emerald<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:27.039> mix<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.490> glitters

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.490 

now<00:00:36.130> add<00:00:36.400> six<00:00:36.850> measurements<00:00:37.629> acrylic<00:00:38.170> glass

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
now add six measurements acrylic glass

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.889 
now add six measurements acrylic glass
to<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.070> mixture<00:00:39.550> of<00:00:39.730> glitter<00:00:40.030> three<00:00:40.539> to<00:00:40.690> one

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
to the mixture of glitter three to one

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.889 
to the mixture of glitter three to one
respect<00:00:41.410> to<00:00:41.559> glitter<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:46.300> must<00:00:46.570> blend

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
respect to glitter you must blend

00:00:46.899 --> 00:01:02.900 
respect to glitter you must blend
perfectly

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.030 

once<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.150> technique<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.750> reverse<00:01:05.170> ready<00:01:05.590> we

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
once the technique of reverse ready we

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.039 
once the technique of reverse ready we
started<00:01:06.460> making<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:07.000> tip<00:01:07.210> with<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.540> mixture

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
started making the tip with the mixture

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.590 
started making the tip with the mixture
prepared<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.950> take<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.250> pearl<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.909> formula<00:01:13.479> of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
prepared we take a pearl the formula of

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.380 
prepared we take a pearl the formula of
the<00:01:13.720> mixture<00:01:14.320> has<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.830> consistency

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the mixture has the consistency

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:50.630 
the mixture has the consistency
manageable

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.910 

we<00:01:51.640> proceeded<00:01:52.150> to<00:01:52.180> encapsulate<00:01:52.780> with<00:01:53.410> acrylic

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
we proceeded to encapsulate with acrylic

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:16.770 
we proceeded to encapsulate with acrylic
crystal

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.350 

now<00:02:17.780> using<00:02:18.050> our<00:02:18.380> black<00:02:18.680> gel<00:02:19.040> pen<00:02:19.069> dry<00:02:19.819> string

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
now using our black gel pen dry string

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:41.010 
now using our black gel pen dry string
lace<00:02:37.330> now<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:38.390> paste<00:02:38.900> crystals<00:02:39.470> using<00:02:39.980> acrylic

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
lace now we paste crystals using acrylic

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.080 
lace now we paste crystals using acrylic
we<00:02:42.020> took<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.350> mini<00:02:42.709> perlite<00:02:43.220> then<00:02:43.550> we<00:02:43.819> place

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
we took a mini perlite then we place

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.000 
we took a mini perlite then we place
where<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.540> glass<00:02:44.840> will<00:02:45.170> stick<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.739> we

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
where the glass will stick and we

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.960 
where the glass will stick and we
weighed<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.790> level<00:02:48.459> we<00:02:49.459> lifted<00:02:49.940> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
weighed that to level we lifted the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.120 
weighed that to level we lifted the
crystal<00:02:50.480> with<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.780> brush<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.410> we<00:02:51.620> place<00:02:51.890> it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
crystal with the brush and we place it

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:18.250 
crystal with the brush and we place it
on<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.430> bead<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.910> pressed<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.540> little

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.710 

now<00:03:19.260> since<00:03:19.830> dry<00:03:20.130> completely<00:03:20.700> our<00:03:21.000> pen<00:03:21.300> drying

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
now since dry completely our pen drying

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.500 
now since dry completely our pen drying
we<00:03:22.380> protect<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.280> resin<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.940> prevent<00:03:24.330> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
we protect it with resin to prevent the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:36.990 
we protect it with resin to prevent the
gel<00:03:24.780> finish<00:03:25.050> degraded

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.120 

finally<00:03:38.000> we<00:03:38.240> apply<00:03:38.390> finish<00:03:39.020> gel<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.710> dry<00:03:40.070> it

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
finally we apply finish gel and dry it

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:49.120 
finally we apply finish gel and dry it
