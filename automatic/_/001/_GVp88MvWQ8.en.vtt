00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:17.760
 Football, what are you talking about? 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.770
 and welcome everyone to one more 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.590
 video a video of today I bring to 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.369
 you a color gameplay 5 here 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.320
 playing an ultra mega violent td m in the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.810
 map of the name should be asked in the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.360
 tdm ultraviolent curb because 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.130
 Hell this is just because it really was 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.910
 Understanding me was a violent team. 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.100
 short 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.440
 the game ended more or less there 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.989
 About four minutes I could free 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.640
 all my christakis more than one 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.010
 This eventually ends up leaving the game. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.410
 well frantic so to say in this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.600
 sense of death the opposing team does not 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.000
 had many possibilities there 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.039
 get to face people 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.680
 Another cool thing is also to follow me. 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.289
 play was in relation to the vice map must 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.449
 being kind of finding similar with the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.470
 map of the module name was 3 at least 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.840
 in the name, right? 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.090
 since it appears a design is totally 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.820
 different has nothing to do with a map with 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.520
 the other one and I really know it 's a map 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.530
 which bears the same name but the design 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.060
 it is completely different than in this 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.860
 that I ended up using a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.380
 mala andrade that we can use 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.869
 four as both the core i5 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.580
 than the following when you 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.950
 build your style you finish 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.950
 taking his highest strike in case 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.990
 here it is with 7 kills and dollars what 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.790
 happens you loose the dollars 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.250
 you are building article 10 that the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.869
 followed 15 times followed by 21 followed 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.299
 in which it is more or less as if it were the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.869
 its sequence following that the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.850
 districts aa balcony of these thing that I 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.040
 do what when you get sirkis 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.790
 trick I wanted to be bigger 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.310
 You die, it triggers, and then you start to 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.350
 rebuild yours again explain 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.210
 why the dollars in the case of 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.920
 five years ended up helping each 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.860
 pound that they are killing academic 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.530
 they knock they kill they bite 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.899
 in fact the rain is just biting 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.970
 These cases end up helping you. 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.230
 catch the next that the strike is cool 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.670
 and 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.709
 using this morning I ended up 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.870
 managing to generate three times 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.930
 the critics in this sharing another 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.670
 cool thingplay gameplay regarding the weapon 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.129
 Just notice that I'm using the gun. 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.680
 type is not always one of the best weapons 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.879
 the game but it is an interesting take a 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.099
 nice to play 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.930
 only the most important detail to think 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.400
 is not the ammunition comb looks the size 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.069
 of him and 180 ammunition projectiles there that 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.870
 we may be using it during the 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.049
 sharing is basically a 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.790
 light machine gun is a lot of bullet you can 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.709
 Kill multiple opponents without needing 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.510
 reload is that I 'm here playing 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.599
 by Fluminense has that old mania 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.730
 to kill a killer logo recharge in 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.180
 Then I end up not taking advantage of a 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.069
 efficiently this advantage for the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.470
 Can we close this gun? 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.730
 with so much ammo and no pent 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.670
 basically you have that is 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.549
 using a touch me called the box 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.220
 magazine is more or less as if it were 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.470
 an extended black ops two clip is 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.419
 that you can have more ammunition in the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.540
 Your time and I are also using 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:24.720
 a pig called bambam doyle is like 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.989
 if it were a ska viger of black ops 2 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.690
 You start with more ammo only 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.430
 if you do not recover the core i5 here 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.650
 ammunition when passing over a 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.930
 dead opponent are some small 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.389
 differences from one game to another 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.000
 in general the system is basically the same 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.010
 It is good that this MP is practically in the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.989
 Finally, luckily I ended up finding 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.370
 a Brazilian room had no 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.380
 hacker I actually managed to find 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.340
 several hackers but it was in rooms 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.900
 previous 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.579
 This one was really nice, I played it. 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.730
 against about three or four 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.959
 Brazilians and the match went well 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.609
 nice to play 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.709
 I really hope you have 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.480
