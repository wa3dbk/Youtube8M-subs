leakage<00:00:42.269> in<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.449> tent<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:43.559> test<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
leakage in the tent we test the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.140 
leakage in the tent we test the
starlight<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.489> our<00:00:44.699> own<00:00:45.089> rain<00:00:45.449> facilities<00:00:47.150> we

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
starlight in our own rain facilities we

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.079 
starlight in our own rain facilities we
use<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.570> single<00:00:48.960> hoop<00:00:49.320> construction<00:00:50.220> which

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
use a single hoop construction which

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.990 
use a single hoop construction which
means<00:00:51.299> X<00:00:51.479> is<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:52.699> pole<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.729> the<00:00:53.970> middle

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
means X is just one pole in the middle

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.270 
means X is just one pole in the middle
and<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:55.019> small<00:00:55.500> accessory<00:00:55.979> poles

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and then we have small accessory poles

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.479 
and then we have small accessory poles
in<00:00:56.489> each<00:00:56.610> corner<00:00:56.909> to<00:00:57.510> give<00:00:57.690> some<00:00:57.809> extra<00:00:57.900> height

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
in each corner to give some extra height

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.140 
in each corner to give some extra height
in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.729> foot<00:01:00.689> and<00:01:00.869> head<00:01:01.170> area<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:02.790> accessory

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
in the foot and head area the accessory

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.670 
in the foot and head area the accessory
poles<00:01:03.390> are<00:01:03.600> pre<00:01:03.780> attached<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.379> very<00:01:04.559> easy

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
poles are pre attached so it's very easy

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.630 
poles are pre attached so it's very easy
to<00:01:05.309> pitch<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.720> pole<00:01:06.960> used<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> tent<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.070> an

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to pitch the pole used in the tent is an

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.330 
to pitch the pole used in the tent is an
eight<00:01:08.970> point<00:01:09.210> five<00:01:09.450> millimeter<00:01:10.130> anodized<00:01:11.130> a

eight point five millimeter anodized a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.410 
eight point five millimeter anodized a
light<00:01:11.520> pole<00:01:12.680> on<00:01:13.680> each<00:01:13.799> skyline<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
light pole on each skyline we have a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.920 
light pole on each skyline we have a
little<00:01:15.659> retainer<00:01:16.070> which<00:01:17.070> sex<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
little retainer which sex is just a

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.840 
little retainer which sex is just a
nylon<00:01:18.930> loop<00:01:19.110> which<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.890> used<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.340> store<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
nylon loop which is used to store the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.550 
nylon loop which is used to store the
guyline<00:01:21.270> when<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.690> use<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.080> next<00:01:22.260> time<00:01:22.440> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
guyline when not in use so next time you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.810 
guyline when not in use so next time you
have<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> use<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.130> won't<00:01:23.190> be<00:01:23.340> tangled<00:01:23.730> up

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
have to use it it won't be tangled up

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.490 
have to use it it won't be tangled up
and<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.150> easy<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.630> pitch<00:01:27.260> for<00:01:28.260> further

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and it's easy to pitch for further

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.610 
and it's easy to pitch for further
stability<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.970> tent<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.390> use<00:01:30.570> our<00:01:30.840> strong

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
stability in the tent we use our strong

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.230 
stability in the tent we use our strong
light<00:01:31.800> system<00:01:32.159> which<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> webbing<00:01:32.850> system

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
light system which is a webbing system

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.630 
light system which is a webbing system
that<00:01:33.480> helps<00:01:33.840> connect<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> fly<00:01:34.830> sheet<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that helps connect the fly sheet and the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.960 
that helps connect the fly sheet and the
guyline<00:01:36.260> to<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.350> pole<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.460> all<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.820> when

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
guyline to the pole so all you do when

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.970 
guyline to the pole so all you do when
you<00:01:39.060> pitch<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.870> you<00:01:39.990> rev<00:01:40.170> around<00:01:40.500> this

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
you pitch it is that you rev around this

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.120 
you pitch it is that you rev around this
webbing<00:01:41.370> wrap<00:01:42.000> around<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.420> pole<00:01:43.070> tighten<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
webbing wrap around the pole tighten it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
webbing wrap around the pole tighten it
up<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:47.600> back<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.490> we<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.580> tested<00:01:50.940> the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
up and back like this we have tested the

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.670 
up and back like this we have tested the
starlight<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.540> known<00:01:51.780> wind<00:01:52.080> simulator<00:01:52.440> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
starlight a known wind simulator and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.600 
starlight a known wind simulator and
assisted<00:01:53.040> up<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> 174<00:01:54.240> kilometers<00:01:54.659> now

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.150 

in<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.810> starlight<00:02:00.230> you<00:02:00.380> will<00:02:00.470> have<00:02:00.620> multiple

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
in the starlight you will have multiple

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.890 
in the starlight you will have multiple
options<00:02:01.580> for<00:02:01.670> good<00:02:02.090> ventilation

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
options for good ventilation

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.110 
options for good ventilation
we<00:02:03.410> have<00:02:03.590> installation<00:02:04.070> openings<00:02:04.460> in<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.910> top

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
we have installation openings in the top

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.070 
we have installation openings in the top
in<00:02:05.300> both<00:02:05.450> sides<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.960> also<00:02:06.910> in<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.240> bottom<00:02:08.750> in

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
ventilation down here in the side what

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.310 
ventilation down here in the side what
we<00:02:15.650> call<00:02:15.800> low<00:02:16.100> vent<00:02:16.810> until<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:18.050> ssin<00:02:18.200> is

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
we call low vent until a ssin is

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.780 
we call low vent until a ssin is
important<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.860> give<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> good<00:02:19.220> airflow<00:02:19.580> through

important to give a good airflow through

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.510 
important to give a good airflow through
this<00:02:19.970> end<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.540> minimize<00:02:21.520> condensation
