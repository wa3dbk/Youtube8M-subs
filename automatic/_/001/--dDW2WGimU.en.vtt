 the newest development of the palomar company we 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.990
 decided to use the best 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.240
 nozzles that this one offers 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.119
 the company that is this nozzles which 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.750
 works from the skin structure 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.789
 fractional rejuvenation procedure is very 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.919
 effectively in some cases is 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.859
 substitute intervention plastic 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.560
 the surgeon in some cases is 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.370
 good supplement after plastic 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.120
 operations 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.930
 either before plastic surgery both 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.510
 nozzles 1 nozzle is an infrared laser 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.850
 fractional laser allows you to give 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.440
 deep fisting 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.680
 penetrating up to 7 millimeters proper 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.410
 dermis and subcutaneously tightening in layers and 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.199
 dermis and fascia and muscle layer 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.300
 without giving any serious 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.450
 complications both inside 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.920
 tissue scars after the intervention on 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.659
 this machine 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 any plastic surgeon can 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.470
 safely 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.090
 be sure guaranteed to 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.869
 he can perform plastic surgery 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.990
 fully without fear that 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.329
 there is no vodka you and scars 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.220
 the procedure is very comfortable practically 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.149
 painlessly does not require a period 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.590
 rehabilitation 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.109
 we can shape 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.450
 the contour of the face oval is often very 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.820
 disturb patients with large 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.590
 age changes work on the face 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.450
 and body on 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.890
 in the lower and upper extremities 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.899
 this is a course of lifting procedures goes deep 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.310
 within three months after the last 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.659
 procedures the course of procedures is 34 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.640
 procedures 1 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.469
 this infrared nozzle is very good 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.560
 combined with fractional 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:59.490
 non- ablative ie without exfoliation 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.299
 white luxury nozzle 15-40 there 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.969
 small 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.920
 a short period of rehabilitation literally 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.750
 2-3 days the patient will be small 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.830
 redness and swelling 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.840
 This course is also the attachment procedures 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.560
 complement each other i repeat 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.069
 you that do not have serious restrictions 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.079
 no age no if there are any 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.819
 associated diseases we can too 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.430
 use and myself nozzles because 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.739
 what 's the selective effect here 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.650
 only on that target cell we are on 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.620
 We work on the principle of patients 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.739
 experiencing some discomfort 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.500
 a long period of rehabilitation while 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.680
 good visible lifting after the course 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.590
 procedures repeat ethics 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.480
 we can with patients every two to three years 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.620
 I repeat once again that they are very good 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.269
 these procedures are combined 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.269
 plastic surgeon interventions
