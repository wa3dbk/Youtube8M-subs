the rear wheel bearing hopefully that

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.300 
the rear wheel bearing hopefully that
won't<00:01:22.130> be<00:01:22.250> too<00:01:22.640> bad<00:01:25.090> all<00:01:26.090> day<00:01:26.979> all<00:01:27.979> right<00:01:28.160> got

won't be too bad all day all right got
the<00:01:28.340> brake<00:01:28.729> caliper<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.590> caliper

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
the brake caliper and the caliper

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.389 
the brake caliper and the caliper
mounting<00:01:31.369> bracket<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.149> rotor<00:01:32.420> off<00:01:33.399> and

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
mounting bracket and the rotor off and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.330 
mounting bracket and the rotor off and
here's<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.000> bearing

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.270 

it's<00:01:41.240> not<00:01:41.420> very<00:01:41.450> noisy<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.350> way<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:42.860> when

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
it's not very noisy that way but when

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.080 
it's not very noisy that way but when
you're<00:01:43.369> going<00:01:43.490> 70<00:01:44.000> miles<00:01:44.420> an<00:01:44.630> hour<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:45.049> howls

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
you're going 70 miles an hour it howls

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.460 
you're going 70 miles an hour it howls
so<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.119> think<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.450> just<00:01:47.479> need<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.930> take<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.229> nut

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
so I think I just need to take that nut

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.380 
so I think I just need to take that nut
there<00:01:48.710> off<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.250> then<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.549> bearing<00:01:50.180> should

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
there off and then that bearing should

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.880 
there off and then that bearing should
pop<00:01:50.630> right<00:01:50.659> off<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:52.670> then<00:01:53.619> reinstall<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.650> new

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
pop right off and then reinstall the new

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.389 
pop right off and then reinstall the new
one<00:01:55.070> okay<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:57.110> is<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.350> old<00:01:57.500> Baron<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.130> side

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.780 
tomorrow so put it all back together put
the<00:03:22.450> wheel<00:03:22.630> on<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.170> see<00:03:23.770> about<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.190> VTEC

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
the wheel on and see about this VTEC

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.850 
the wheel on and see about this VTEC
thing

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
thing

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.110 
thing
well<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:26.890> remove<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.570> VTEC<00:03:28.570> solenoid<00:03:30.120> right

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
well I remove that VTEC solenoid right

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.840 
well I remove that VTEC solenoid right
quick<00:03:31.560> before<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.590> get<00:03:32.890> too<00:03:33.070> involved<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.670> that

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
quick before I get too involved in that

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.780 
quick before I get too involved in that
I<00:03:33.880> better<00:03:34.300> get<00:03:34.450> some<00:03:34.660> new<00:03:34.810> gaskets<00:03:35.610> those<00:03:36.610> are

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
I better get some new gaskets those are

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.560 
I better get some new gaskets those are
holding<00:03:37.330> tight<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.610> tear<00:03:40.000> one<00:03:40.300> of<00:03:40.420> them

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
holding tight if I tear one of them

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.960 
holding tight if I tear one of them
disassembling<00:03:41.530> any<00:03:41.770> further<00:03:42.130> we'll<00:03:42.580> be<00:03:42.820> in

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
disassembling any further we'll be in

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.850 
disassembling any further we'll be in
trouble<00:03:43.390> so<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:44.130> think<00:03:45.130> I'll<00:03:45.280> do<00:03:45.430> that

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
trouble so I think I'll do that

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.220 
trouble so I think I'll do that
pull<00:03:47.860> this<00:03:48.040> thing<00:03:48.100> back<00:03:48.550> together<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.230> we'll

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
pull this thing back together and we'll

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.130 
pull this thing back together and we'll
make<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.860> Georgia<00:03:51.430> them<00:03:51.580> all<00:03:51.900> all<00:03:52.900> right

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
make it to Georgia them all all right

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.260 
make it to Georgia them all all right
it's<00:03:53.320> all<00:03:53.470> put<00:03:53.680> back<00:03:53.710> together<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.550> need<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.790> do

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
it's all put back together I need to do

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.790 
it's all put back together I need to do
a<00:03:55.330> little<00:03:55.450> more<00:03:55.630> research<00:03:55.870> see<00:03:56.350> how<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.470> test

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
a little more research see how to test

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.340 
a little more research see how to test
that<00:03:56.950> solenoid<00:03:57.490> and<00:03:57.730> its<00:03:57.910> oil<00:03:58.350> pressure

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
that solenoid and its oil pressure

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.020 
that solenoid and its oil pressure
switch<00:04:00.040> there

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.540 

I<00:04:05.120> notice<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.080> one<00:04:06.260> plugs<00:04:06.680> missing<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.250> clip

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
I notice that one plugs missing a clip

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.190 
I notice that one plugs missing a clip
that<00:04:07.790> money<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.300> backed<00:04:08.540> out<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.780> little<00:04:09.020> bit

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
that money just backed out a little bit

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.230 
that money just backed out a little bit
I<00:04:09.230> think<00:04:09.350> you<00:04:09.560> got<00:04:09.740> broke<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:11.000> transmission

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
I think you got broke the transmission

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.650 
I think you got broke the transmission
has<00:04:11.720> been<00:04:11.750> out<00:04:11.990> of<00:04:12.050> this<00:04:12.230> thing<00:04:12.530> three<00:04:12.890> times

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
has been out of this thing three times

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.150 
has been out of this thing three times
so<00:04:14.660> one<00:04:15.110> of<00:04:15.230> those<00:04:15.350> times

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
so one of those times

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.190 
so one of those times
probably<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.639> clip<00:04:16.880> got<00:04:17.120> broke<00:04:17.389> on<00:04:17.600> that<00:04:17.630> oil

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
probably the clip got broke on that oil

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.220 
probably the clip got broke on that oil
pressure<00:04:18.530> sensor<00:04:18.950> there<00:04:19.310> sender<00:04:20.109> if<00:04:21.109> it

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
pressure sensor there sender if it

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.940 
pressure sensor there sender if it
activates<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.919> VTEC<00:04:23.410> mighty<00:04:24.410> just<00:04:24.680> spend<00:04:24.889> a

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
activates the VTEC mighty just spend a

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.890 
activates the VTEC mighty just spend a
little<00:04:25.070> loose<00:04:25.340> I<00:04:25.580> don't<00:04:25.730> know<00:04:25.850> but<00:04:26.419> anyway<00:04:26.570> it

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
little loose I don't know but anyway it

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.420 
little loose I don't know but anyway it
didn't<00:04:27.200> act<00:04:27.470> up<00:04:27.710> all<00:04:27.889> the<00:04:28.010> time<00:04:28.190> just

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
didn't act up all the time just

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.890 
didn't act up all the time just
sometimes<00:04:29.270> so<00:04:30.850> we'll<00:04:31.850> see<00:04:32.030> what<00:04:32.210> happens

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.450 

that's<00:04:35.900> all<00:04:36.139> it's<00:04:36.650> getting<00:04:37.070> out<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.370> me

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
that's all it's getting out of me

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.700 
that's all it's getting out of me
tonight
