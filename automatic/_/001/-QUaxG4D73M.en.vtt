00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.840 

so<00:00:01.079> here's<00:00:01.290> how<00:00:01.410> you<00:00:01.439> tune<00:00:01.829> down<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.220> half<00:00:02.610> step

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
so here's how you tune down a half step

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.590 
so here's how you tune down a half step
using<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.200> tu<00:00:04.770> 3<00:00:05.250> or<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> tu<00:00:05.819> 2<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.210> probably<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
using a tu 3 or a tu 2 is probably the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.860 
using a tu 3 or a tu 2 is probably the
same<00:00:06.899> so<00:00:07.529> I'm<00:00:07.620> already<00:00:07.859> tuned<00:00:08.420> to<00:00:09.420> standard

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
same so I'm already tuned to standard

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.350 
same so I'm already tuned to standard
tuning<00:00:10.280> so<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.370> want<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.610> change<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.090> mode

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
tuning so you want to change the mode

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.140 
tuning so you want to change the mode
here<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.780> push<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.170> mode<00:00:13.349> button<00:00:13.940> until<00:00:14.940> it

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
here and push the mode button until it

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.700 
here and push the mode button until it
clicks<00:00:15.480> over<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.020> next<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.470> they're

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
clicks over to the next one they're

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.580 
clicks over to the next one they're
chromatic<00:00:17.340> flat<00:00:17.990> you<00:00:18.990> could<00:00:19.170> do<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> same

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
chromatic flat you could do the same

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.359 
chromatic flat you could do the same
thing<00:00:19.650> over<00:00:20.279> here<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.939> guitar<00:00:21.769> and<00:00:22.769> go<00:00:23.010> one

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
thing over here in guitar and go one

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.370 
thing over here in guitar and go one
semitone<00:00:24.980> over<00:00:25.980> half<00:00:26.220> step<00:00:26.580> flat<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.380> that

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
semitone over half step flat and that

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.290 
semitone over half step flat and that
will<00:00:28.529> give<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> string<00:00:29.189> number<00:00:29.550> versus

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
will give you the string number versus

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.729 
will give you the string number versus
the<00:00:30.449> note<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:32.009> we'll<00:00:32.130> come<00:00:32.340> back<00:00:32.520> around<00:00:33.739> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the note so we'll come back around to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.400 
the note so we'll come back around to
chromatic<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.790> go<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:37.550> half<00:00:38.550> step<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.239> then

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
chromatic and go to a half step and then

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.720 
chromatic and go to a half step and then
you<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.620> tuned<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> same<00:00:44.100> notes<00:00:44.550> that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
you just tuned to the same notes that

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880 
you just tuned to the same notes that
you<00:00:44.940> would<00:00:45.030> normally<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you would normally see so it's going to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:01:02.410 
you would normally see so it's going to
be<00:00:46.980> me

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:34.200 

you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.520 

even<00:01:35.210> though<00:01:35.329> you're<00:01:35.479> actually<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:35.899> half-step

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
even though you're actually a half-step

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.499 
even though you're actually a half-step
flat<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.130> just<00:01:37.369> tune<00:01:37.579> it<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.850> all<00:01:37.969> the<00:01:38.119> regular

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
flat you just tune it to all the regular

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.139 
flat you just tune it to all the regular
notes<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:39.859> it'll<00:01:40.100> it'll<00:01:40.280> move<00:01:40.609> you<00:01:40.729> down<00:01:40.909> one

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
notes and it'll it'll move you down one

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.749 
notes and it'll it'll move you down one
step<00:01:41.479> if<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:41.750> want<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.020> go<00:01:42.109> a<00:01:42.140> whole<00:01:42.439> step<00:01:42.770> and

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
step if you want to go a whole step and

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.120 
step if you want to go a whole step and
you're<00:01:44.000> just<00:01:44.179> going<00:01:44.329> to<00:01:44.359> push<00:01:44.539> this<00:01:44.719> again

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
you're just going to push this again

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.499 
you're just going to push this again
where<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.219> lights<00:01:46.429> up<00:01:46.579> on<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.850> two<00:01:47.060> that's<00:01:47.359> two

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
where it lights up on the two that's two

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.620 
where it lights up on the two that's two
half<00:01:48.140> step<00:01:48.469> two<00:01:48.709> semitones<00:01:49.100> or<00:01:49.579> a<00:01:49.670> whole<00:01:50.329> step

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
half step two semitones or a whole step

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.809 
half step two semitones or a whole step
and<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.530> just<00:01:51.709> again<00:01:52.069> go<00:01:52.250> through<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.579> same

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
and you just again go through the same

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.999 
and you just again go through the same
tuning<00:01:53.719> process<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:54.590> will<00:01:54.709> take<00:01:54.859> you

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
tuning process and that will take you

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.329 
tuning process and that will take you
down<00:01:55.219> a<00:01:55.520> whole<00:01:56.209> step
