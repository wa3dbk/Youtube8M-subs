00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.200 
meat and what i do is over here i do a
gnashing<00:00:09.929> Vil<00:00:10.460> do<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.610> right<00:00:11.759> here<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
gnashing Vil do it right here on the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.820 
gnashing Vil do it right here on the
coastline<00:00:12.830> where<00:00:13.830> PFD<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.370> located<00:00:15.590> the<00:00:16.590> mobs

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
coastline where PFD is located the mobs

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.010 
coastline where PFD is located the mobs
here<00:00:17.130> are<00:00:17.310> level<00:00:17.640> 20<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.240> any<00:00:18.390> lower<00:00:18.630> level

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
here are level 20 so any lower level

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.740 
here are level 20 so any lower level
character<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.859> as<00:00:19.980> well

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
character can do this as well

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.880 
character can do this as well
these<00:00:22.730> plan<00:00:23.730> meats

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
these plan meats

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.720 
these plan meats
so<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.250> about<00:00:26.340> 20<00:00:26.820> gold<00:00:27.000> stock<00:00:27.300> I

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
so for about 20 gold stock I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
so for about 20 gold stock I
successfully<00:00:29.730> solve<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.090> 20<00:00:30.300> gold<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.539> stack

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
successfully solve for 20 gold a stack

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.130 
successfully solve for 20 gold a stack
and<00:00:31.969> I<00:00:32.969> usually<00:00:33.450> put<00:00:34.399> five<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.940> ten<00:00:36.630> stacks<00:00:36.899> up

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and I usually put five to ten stacks up

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.119 
and I usually put five to ten stacks up
at<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> time<00:00:37.969> try<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.329> too<00:00:39.360> much<00:00:40.129> because

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
at a time try not to do too much because

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.619 
at a time try not to do too much because
of<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> undercutting<00:00:42.420> that

point where it's like almost free I know

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.570 
point where it's like almost free I know
that<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.199> another<00:01:04.500> server<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.979> plan<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.280> it's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
that on another server I plan on it's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.530 
that on another server I plan on it's
the<00:01:05.670> same<00:01:05.850> way<00:01:07.340> but<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.820> thing<00:01:09.060> how<00:01:09.479> you

we<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.900> benefit<00:01:10.350> from<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:11.659> if<00:01:12.659> people

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
we can benefit from this is if people

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.710

auction house and your experiences so I
did<00:02:59.220> go<00:02:59.400> about<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.640> minute<00:02:59.940> over<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.660> my<00:03:00.840> run<00:03:01.340> and

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
did go about a minute over on my run and

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.580 
did go about a minute over on my run and
during<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.330> run<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.569> end<00:03:03.870> up<00:03:04.019> getting

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
during this run I end up getting

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.160 
during this run I end up getting
46<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.730> meat<00:03:06.200> in<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.320> 15<00:03:07.680> minute<00:03:07.920> run<00:03:09.170> so

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
46 of the meat in a 15 minute run so

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.650 
46 of the meat in a 15 minute run so
I'll<00:03:10.320> round<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.739> down<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.250> say<00:03:11.760> 40<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.299> 15

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
I'll round it down to say 40 in 15

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.780 
I'll round it down to say 40 in 15
minutes<00:03:13.910> which<00:03:14.910> would<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.329> about<00:03:15.480> 160<00:03:16.109> an<00:03:16.380> hour

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
minutes which would be about 160 an hour

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.940 
minutes which would be about 160 an hour
so<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.820> got<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.060> potential<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.540> make<00:03:18.660> 160<00:03:19.500> gold

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
so I got the potential to make 160 gold

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.990 
so I got the potential to make 160 gold
an<00:03:20.070> hour<00:03:20.810> just<00:03:21.810> with<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.109> meat<00:03:22.519> not<00:03:23.519> including

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
an hour just with the meat not including

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.080 
an hour just with the meat not including
the<00:03:24.120> green<00:03:24.299> drops<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:26.100> those<00:03:26.370> shredder

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
the green drops and those shredder

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.509
