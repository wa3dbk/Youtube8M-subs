00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
but it looks like I've pretty much
already<00:01:29.250> got<00:01:29.640> everything<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> really

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
already got everything that I really

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.420 
already got everything that I really
really<00:01:30.990> wanted<00:01:31.320> from<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.619> purse<00:01:31.860> system<00:01:32.220> so
