gas prices and how much you drive I'm

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.070 
gas prices and how much you drive I'm
gonna<00:02:18.550> be<00:02:18.640> putting<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.000> about<00:02:19.180> 30,000<00:02:19.750> miles<00:02:19.930> a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
gonna be putting on about 30,000 miles a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.050 
gonna be putting on about 30,000 miles a
year<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.470> using<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.980> regularly<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:21.819> I

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
year and using it regularly so I

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.360 
year and using it regularly so I
estimate<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.019> will<00:02:23.230> probably<00:02:23.620> recuperate

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
estimate that I will probably recuperate

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.330 
estimate that I will probably recuperate
the<00:02:24.430> cost<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.150> investment<00:02:26.160> either<00:02:27.160> way

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
the cost of the investment either way

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.100 
the cost of the investment either way
it's<00:02:27.640> using<00:02:27.879> less<00:02:28.000> gasoline<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:28.900> I've<00:02:28.989> been

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
it's using less gasoline so I've been

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.839 
it's using less gasoline so I've been
very<00:02:29.230> pleased<00:02:29.500> with<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.680> product<00:02:30.069> and<00:02:30.250> the
