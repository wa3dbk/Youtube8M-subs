far left now there is a coral reef if
you<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.829> coral<00:00:47.190> reef<00:00:47.370> your<00:00:48.300> guy<00:00:48.480> will

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
you go to the coral reef your guy will

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.290 
you go to the coral reef your guy will
go<00:00:48.809> whoo<00:00:48.989> hoo<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.850> get<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
go whoo hoo and then if you get that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.819 
go whoo hoo and then if you get that
it's<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> warning<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.680> any

it's like a warning like if you go any

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.200 
it's like a warning like if you go any
further<00:00:53.010> you're<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> fall<00:00:53.730> into<00:00:53.969> this

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
further you're going to fall into this

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.180 
further you're going to fall into this
water<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.989> die<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.949> there's

certain parts like there's certain big
rocks<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.199> can't<00:00:58.410> go<00:00:58.559> around<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:59.489> most

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
rocks that you can't go around but most

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
rocks that you can't go around but most
of<00:00:59.879> them<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.469> now<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.649> map<00:01:01.890> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
of them you can now this map is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920 
of them you can now this map is
interesting<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.449> little<00:01:03.660> cliff

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
interesting you have this little cliff

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.039 
interesting you have this little cliff
right<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> little<00:01:06.810> ledge

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
right up here and it has a little ledge

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.510 
right up here and it has a little ledge
where<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> guy<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.590> come<00:01:08.010> from<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> other<00:01:08.340> side

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
where a guy can come from the other side

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
where a guy can come from the other side
and<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.299> camp<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.930> head<00:01:10.170> glitch<00:01:10.439> there

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
and just camp at the head glitch there

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.560 
and just camp at the head glitch there
so<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.040> pretty<00:01:11.220> cool<00:01:11.400> now<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.450> think

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
so it's pretty cool now that I think

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.320 
so it's pretty cool now that I think
that<00:01:12.900> plane<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> trick<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.970> that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that plane is like a trick because that

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.510 
that plane is like a trick because that
plane<00:01:16.369> it's<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.610> bad<00:01:17.909> angle<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:20.189> want<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
plane it's in the bad angle you want to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399 
plane it's in the bad angle you want to
be<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> higher<00:01:21.030> plane<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.290> that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
be on a higher plane which is up on that

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.100 
be on a higher plane which is up on that
plateau<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.520> side<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.909> island<00:01:24.110> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
plateau on this side of the island you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.740 
plateau on this side of the island you
wind<00:01:25.619> up<00:01:25.710> by<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> plane<00:01:26.189> side<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.570> can

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
wind up by the plane side then you can

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.620 
wind up by the plane side then you can
get<00:01:27.869> attacked<00:01:28.170> from<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.680> many<00:01:28.770> sides<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.280> very

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
get attacked from so many sides as very

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.580 
get attacked from so many sides as very
condensed<00:01:30.740> grenades<00:01:32.000> EMPs<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.320> really

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
condensed grenades EMPs it's it's really

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.249 
condensed grenades EMPs it's it's really
a<00:01:34.770> messy<00:01:35.250> spot<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.720> main<00:01:36.900> place

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a messy spot to be at the main place

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.200 
a messy spot to be at the main place
that<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.619> want<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> stick<00:01:38.100> around<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you get anything coming that way you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.630 
you get anything coming that way you
don't<00:01:52.530> got<00:01:52.649> nothing<00:01:52.920> coming<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.250> way<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
don't got nothing coming that way and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.600 
don't got nothing coming that way and
that<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.299> patrol<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.110> area<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that just patrol this area this is the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.749 
that just patrol this area this is the
safest<00:01:56.850> area<00:01:57.950> anybody<00:01:58.950> wants<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.340> break<00:01:59.549> this

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
safest area anybody wants to break this

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.249 
safest area anybody wants to break this
they<00:01:59.939> would<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.240> come<00:02:00.509> straight<00:02:00.930> up<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
they would have to come straight up the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.200 
they would have to come straight up the
middle<00:02:01.380> which<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.219> not<00:02:02.280> too<00:02:02.579> hard<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.000> mean

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
middle which it's not too hard I mean

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.510 
middle which it's not too hard I mean
once<00:02:03.390> people<00:02:03.630> figured<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:03.990> out<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.860> one

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
once people figured this out like one

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.270 
once people figured this out like one
game<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.329> figured<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.170> out<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.560> why<00:02:08.220> even

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
game I just figured it out like why even

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.339 
game I just figured it out like why even
go<00:02:09.000> around<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.539> challenge<00:02:09.929> from<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> side

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
go around and challenge from the side

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.050 
go around and challenge from the side
just<00:02:10.379> go<00:02:10.709> straight<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.160> middle<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.730> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
just go straight up the middle and you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.220 
just go straight up the middle and you
can<00:02:12.209> set<00:02:12.450> up<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.720> ledge

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
can set up on that ledge

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.290 
can set up on that ledge
and<00:02:13.349> they<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.980> literally<00:02:14.400> expose

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and they have to literally expose

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.420 
and they have to literally expose
himself<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:16.140> much<00:02:16.349> coming<00:02:16.800> out<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.220> ledge

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
himself so much coming out to that ledge

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.050 
himself so much coming out to that ledge
that<00:02:18.180> they're<00:02:18.390> easy<00:02:18.569> kills<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.790> this

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
that they're easy kills so I think this

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.619 
that they're easy kills so I think this
map<00:02:21.269> is<00:02:21.299> pretty<00:02:22.170> well-rounded<00:02:22.670> uh-huh<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:24.420> you

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
map is pretty well-rounded uh-huh if you

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.759 
map is pretty well-rounded uh-huh if you
get<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:24.959> drift<00:02:25.230> well<00:02:26.159> rounded<00:02:26.459> island<00:02:27.709> kind<00:02:28.709> of

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
get my drift well rounded island kind of

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.729 
get my drift well rounded island kind of
a<00:02:28.890> far<00:02:29.099> cry<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:30.299> know<00:02:30.420> you'd<00:02:30.900> wish<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.349> okay

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
a far cry you know you'd wish like okay

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.009 
a far cry you know you'd wish like okay
this<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:31.950> better<00:02:32.220> version<00:02:32.549> of<00:02:32.610> far<00:02:32.790> cry<00:02:32.819> of<00:02:33.209> all

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
this is better version of far cry of all

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.320 
this is better version of far cry of all
day<00:02:34.290> long<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> threw<00:02:35.459> up<00:02:35.519> my<00:02:35.610> sentry<00:02:36.150> gun

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
day long so I threw up my sentry gun

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.289 
day long so I threw up my sentry gun
right<00:02:36.510> there<00:02:36.540> picked<00:02:37.410> up<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> an-94<00:02:38.299> and

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
right there picked up the an-94 and

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.839 
right there picked up the an-94 and
you'll<00:02:39.420> see<00:02:39.599> right<00:02:39.720> here<00:02:39.900> calling<00:02:40.500> a

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
you'll see right here calling a

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.380 
you'll see right here calling a
hellstorm<00:02:42.170> boom<00:02:43.310> yes<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.670> then<00:02:44.849> it's<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.120> 2l

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
hellstorm boom yes and then it's a 2l

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.539 
hellstorm boom yes and then it's a 2l
storms<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.560> lightning<00:02:46.829> strikes<00:02:47.310> work

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
storms and the lightning strikes work

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.759 
storms and the lightning strikes work
very<00:02:47.940> well<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.569> these<00:02:49.110> new<00:02:49.379> maps<00:02:49.560> because

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
very well on these new maps because

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.650 
very well on these new maps because
they're<00:02:50.010> wide<00:02:50.250> open<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.879> there's<00:02:51.060> no<00:02:51.329> cover

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
they're wide open and there's no cover

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.869 
they're wide open and there's no cover
so<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.500> can<00:02:52.650> really<00:02:52.890> get<00:02:53.040> your<00:02:53.220> streaks<00:02:53.519> going

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
so you can really get your streaks going

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.180 
so you can really get your streaks going
like<00:02:54.239> they<00:02:54.810> made<00:02:55.049> this<00:02:55.230> they<00:02:55.500> made<00:02:55.739> these<00:02:55.890> maps

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
like they made this they made these maps

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.210 
like they made this they made these maps
for<00:02:56.519> mid-range<00:02:56.870> Street<00:02:57.870> type<00:02:58.140> people<00:02:58.379> you

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
for mid-range Street type people you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.670 
for mid-range Street type people you
know<00:02:59.340> they're<00:02:59.519> like<00:02:59.700> a<00:03:00.299> lot<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.140> maps<00:03:01.349> were

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
know they're like a lot of the maps were

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.380 
know they're like a lot of the maps were
you<00:03:02.099> know<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.400> streets<00:03:02.670> can't<00:03:02.910> get<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.239> you

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
you know the streets can't get to you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.869 
you know the streets can't get to you
you<00:03:04.109> can't<00:03:04.319> build<00:03:04.530> up<00:03:04.650> fast<00:03:04.859> streak<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.370> this

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
you can't build up fast streak so this

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.940 
you can't build up fast streak so this
is<00:03:06.030> Corona<00:03:06.599> kind<00:03:07.049> of<00:03:07.140> like<00:03:07.260> more<00:03:07.530> like<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.859> a

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
is Corona kind of like more like of a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.589 
is Corona kind of like more like of a
mid-range<00:03:09.200> streak<00:03:10.400> gameplay<00:03:11.400> map<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.000> I've

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
mid-range streak gameplay map and I've

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.150 
mid-range streak gameplay map and I've
really<00:03:12.959> i<00:03:13.019> really<00:03:13.049> appreciate<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.680> now<00:03:14.010> i'll

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
really i really appreciate that now i'll

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.789 
really i really appreciate that now i'll
go<00:03:14.340> over<00:03:14.370> here<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:15.329> left<00:03:15.930> side<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.620> don't

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
go over here this left side I don't

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.309 
go over here this left side I don't
really<00:03:17.010> go<00:03:17.160> into<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:18.510> left<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:19.019> middle

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
really go into the the left that middle

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.080 
really go into the the left that middle
piece<00:03:19.440> but<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.250> can<00:03:20.370> go<00:03:20.459> around<00:03:20.669> this<00:03:20.819> piece

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
piece but you can go around this piece

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.690 
piece but you can go around this piece
right<00:03:21.209> here<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:22.410> then<00:03:22.709> there's<00:03:22.919> two<00:03:23.430> racks

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
right here and then there's two racks

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.140 
right here and then there's two racks
this<00:03:24.329> rock<00:03:24.599> you<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.049> head<00:03:25.590> glitch<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.280> then

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
this rock you can head glitch and then

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.819 
this rock you can head glitch and then
once<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.599> hit<00:03:27.720> glitch<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.380> rack<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.769> can

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
once you hit glitch to this rack you can

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.879 
once you hit glitch to this rack you can
get<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.250> next<00:03:29.430> rock<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:31.440> know<00:03:31.590> you

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
get to the next rock and you know you

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.319 
get to the next rock and you know you
take<00:03:32.069> cover<00:03:32.340> not<00:03:32.639> sure<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:32.970> don't<00:03:33.030> know<00:03:33.209> about

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
take cover not sure I don't know about

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.559 
take cover not sure I don't know about
those<00:03:33.510> trees<00:03:33.870> how<00:03:34.530> much<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:35.180> how<00:03:36.180> much<00:03:36.329> they

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
those trees how much of how much they

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.319 
those trees how much of how much they
give<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.989> as<00:03:37.230> far<00:03:37.919> as<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.190> blocking<00:03:39.000> out

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
give you as far as like blocking out

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.670 
give you as far as like blocking out
stuff<00:03:39.630> but<00:03:40.220> overall<00:03:41.810> like<00:03:42.810> i<00:03:42.930> said<00:03:43.139> i<00:03:43.349> think

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
stuff but overall like i said i think

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.270 
stuff but overall like i said i think
this<00:03:43.919> map<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.380> salt<00:03:46.380> rifle<00:03:46.739> map<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:47.160> could

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
this map is is a salt rifle map it could

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.520 
this map is is a salt rifle map it could
be<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> sniper<00:03:47.700> map<00:03:48.120> as<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.989> see<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.230> i'm

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
be a sniper map as you see that i'm

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.199 
be a sniper map as you see that i'm
using<00:03:49.859> right<00:03:49.889> here<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.400> can<00:03:50.519> use<00:03:50.549> snipers

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
using right here you can use snipers

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.690 
using right here you can use snipers
salt<00:03:51.750> rifles<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.440> don't<00:03:53.040> really<00:03:53.160> think<00:03:53.250> it's

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
salt rifles I don't really think it's

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.300 
salt rifles I don't really think it's
too<00:03:53.910> advantageous<00:03:54.419> to<00:03:54.810> an<00:03:54.900> SMG<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:56.069> I<00:03:56.129> said

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
too advantageous to an SMG like I said

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.670 
too advantageous to an SMG like I said
you're<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:57.299> lot<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.840> these<00:03:57.900> new<00:03:58.139> maps<00:03:58.319> you're

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
you're a lot of these new maps you're

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.979 
you're a lot of these new maps you're
exposed<00:03:59.129> out<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.519> open<00:03:59.639> so<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.569> think<00:04:00.750> these

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
exposed out in the open so I think these

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.170 
exposed out in the open so I think these
maps<00:04:01.319> were<00:04:01.620> mostly<00:04:02.340> built<00:04:02.609> for<00:04:02.910> assault

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
maps were mostly built for assault

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.409 
maps were mostly built for assault
rifles<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:05.040> think<00:04:05.400> once<00:04:05.609> people<00:04:05.700> calm<00:04:06.120> down

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
rifles and I think once people calm down

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.020 
rifles and I think once people calm down
you<00:04:07.319> could<00:04:07.530> start<00:04:07.769> using<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.220> LMGs<00:04:08.730> in

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
you could start using the LMGs in

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.449 
you could start using the LMGs in
certain<00:04:09.569> areas<00:04:09.810> with<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.620> smoke<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.160> start

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
certain areas with the smoke and start

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.339 
certain areas with the smoke and start
setting<00:04:11.699> stuff<00:04:11.940> up<00:04:12.209> with<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.840> target<00:04:13.169> finder

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
setting stuff up with the target finder

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.360 
setting stuff up with the target finder
as<00:04:13.590> well<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:14.030> think<00:04:15.030> we<00:04:15.120> haven't<00:04:15.299> seen<00:04:15.569> that<00:04:15.599> yet

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
as well I think we haven't seen that yet

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.819 
as well I think we haven't seen that yet
also<00:04:17.510> tart<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.630> know<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.810> can<00:04:19.019> probably<00:04:19.169> you

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
also tart you know you can probably you

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.949 
also tart you know you can probably you
might<00:04:20.070> probably<00:04:20.340> see<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.609> lot<00:04:20.699> of<00:04:20.959> tactical

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
might probably see a lot of tactical

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.800 
might probably see a lot of tactical
insertion<00:04:22.520> snipers<00:04:23.520> I<00:04:23.729> mean<00:04:23.909> like<00:04:24.150> all<00:04:24.479> these

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
insertion snipers I mean like all these

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.040 
insertion snipers I mean like all these
maps

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
maps

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.040 
maps
these<00:04:26.259> new<00:04:26.470> maps<00:04:26.849> could<00:04:27.849> have<00:04:28.060> tactical

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
these new maps could have tactical

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.689 
these new maps could have tactical
insertion<00:04:29.669> snipers<00:04:30.669> so<00:04:30.819> you<00:04:30.879> really<00:04:31.270> have<00:04:31.300> to

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
insertion snipers so you really have to

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.309 
insertion snipers so you really have to
you<00:04:33.699> know<00:04:33.789> you<00:04:34.599> really<00:04:34.840> have<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.169> be<00:04:35.199> careful

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
you know you really have to be careful

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.149 
you know you really have to be careful
um<00:04:36.300> especially<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:37.629> rush<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.560> maps<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.979> pain

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
um especially on rush that maps a pain

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.580 
um especially on rush that maps a pain
in<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.340> ass<00:04:39.750> uplink<00:04:40.750> isn't<00:04:41.050> too<00:04:41.199> bad<00:04:41.379> because

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
in the ass uplink isn't too bad because

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.670 
in the ass uplink isn't too bad because
the<00:04:42.069> small<00:04:42.699> areas<00:04:43.090> are<00:04:43.240> really<00:04:43.569> really<00:04:44.440> close

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
the small areas are really really close

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.189 
the small areas are really really close
to<00:04:44.889> spawn<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:45.669> you<00:04:46.360> might<00:04:46.509> get<00:04:46.690> like<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:46.930> bunch

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
to spawn so you might get like a bunch

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.689 
to spawn so you might get like a bunch
of<00:04:47.289> guys<00:04:47.440> spawning<00:04:47.919> all<00:04:48.009> at<00:04:48.190> once<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:48.610> the

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
of guys spawning all at once so the

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.969 
of guys spawning all at once so the
snipers<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.810> know<00:04:49.930> if<00:04:50.229> you<00:04:50.620> don't<00:04:50.800> line

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
snipers you know if you don't line

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.619 
snipers you know if you don't line
people<00:04:51.370> up<00:04:51.520> right<00:04:51.699> off<00:04:51.729> a<00:04:51.849> spawn<00:04:52.210> they<00:04:52.389> wanted

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:52.629 
people up right off a spawn they wanted

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.420 
people up right off a spawn they wanted
where<00:04:52.780> I<00:04:52.810> could<00:04:53.080> kill<00:04:53.289> you<00:04:53.319> see<00:04:53.949> here<00:04:54.099> I'm<00:04:54.220> kind

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
where I could kill you see here I'm kind

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.540 
where I could kill you see here I'm kind
of<00:04:54.490> rushing<00:04:54.849> from<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.090> right<00:04:55.210> side<00:04:55.449> and

pretty much locking stuff down i decided
to<00:05:18.310> move<00:05:18.460> my<00:05:18.780> sentry<00:05:19.780> gun<00:05:19.990> for<00:05:20.800> people<00:05:21.069> that

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
to move my sentry gun for people that

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
are coming out of the spawn coming down

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.809 
are coming out of the spawn coming down
this<00:05:22.780> side<00:05:23.050> I'm<00:05:23.379> not<00:05:23.979> worried<00:05:24.370> about<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.580> like

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
this side I'm not worried about it like

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.820 
this side I'm not worried about it like
that<00:05:24.879> when<00:05:25.750> these<00:05:25.810> maps<00:05:26.050> are<00:05:26.199> new<00:05:26.379> not<00:05:26.680> too

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
that when these maps are new not too

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.200 
that when these maps are new not too
many<00:05:26.889> people<00:05:27.190> they<00:05:27.490> don't<00:05:27.669> even<00:05:27.759> come<00:05:28.000> up<00:05:28.030> the

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
many people they don't even come up the

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.909 
many people they don't even come up the
middle<00:05:28.389> so<00:05:29.110> you<00:05:29.139> have<00:05:29.289> to<00:05:29.379> worry<00:05:29.650> about<00:05:29.770> the

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
middle so you have to worry about the

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.170 
middle so you have to worry about the
middle<00:05:30.130> assist<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.490> sides<00:05:30.759> you<00:05:30.880> got<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.060> worry

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
middle assist the sides you got to worry

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.740 
middle assist the sides you got to worry
about<00:05:31.210> cider<00:05:31.599> I<00:05:32.969> checked<00:05:33.969> out<00:05:34.120> my<00:05:34.210> sentry<00:05:34.569> gun

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
about cider I checked out my sentry gun

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.019 
about cider I checked out my sentry gun
make<00:05:34.930> sure<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.199> wasn't<00:05:35.380> a<00:05:35.620> impede<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.699> then

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.029 
make sure it wasn't a impede and then

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.670 
make sure it wasn't a impede and then
check<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.479> centerpiece<00:05:38.020> one<00:05:38.259> more<00:05:38.440> time

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
check the centerpiece one more time

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.070 
check the centerpiece one more time
nothing<00:05:39.610> they're<00:05:39.759> probably<00:05:40.060> on<00:05:40.360> one<00:05:40.960> guy

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
nothing they're probably on one guy

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.659 
nothing they're probably on one guy
running<00:05:41.349> across<00:05:41.529> see<00:05:41.830> he<00:05:42.310> could<00:05:42.460> have<00:05:42.550> came

running across see he could have came

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.640 
running across see he could have came
right<00:05:42.849> up<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.060> middle<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.479> nobody<00:05:44.289> would<00:05:44.409> it

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
right up the middle and nobody would it

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.409 
right up the middle and nobody would it
you'd<00:05:44.919> made<00:05:45.190> over<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.400> head<00:05:45.550> glitch<00:05:45.759> and<00:05:46.210> then
