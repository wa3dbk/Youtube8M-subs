00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.279
 what good afternoon are I david 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.410
 ortega and what it intends to do 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.930
 Pretty quick tutorial on how to create 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.880
 your own templates in light room 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.950
 I delayed quite the video asks 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.800
 apologies for some occupations that I've 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.520
 had and without more then we will work 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.610
 quickly in this tutorial the first thing 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:30.100
 What I have to do is create or choose 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:32.480
 example a page any truth and 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.140
 this 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.390
 select it and then put it as 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.420
 as a page to save a personalized page 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.540
 it's not the first thing I have to do 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.090
 click here I choose my design any 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.420
 actually anyone and after a 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.750
 click here 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.589
 right and I put you save as page 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.289
 customized 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.050
 once I do this I have already been 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.920
 recorded the personalized page and I was 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:07.210
 has recorded within this profile not 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.759
 within the cce was not users in my 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.549
 case is user ortega then I 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:16.990
 I'm going to app data, this is important, not local 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:19.180
 but roaming adobe and then we're going to 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.880
 lightroom 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.900
 truth and we're going here is the layout 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.870
 templates 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.060
 the line-out templates we will find 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.050
 depending on where I made it I put it 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.150
 in a 10 x 8 book is what you 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.550
 select them here in 10 by 8 and 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.000
 is 10 for 8 that's why I 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.800
 the template was put on 10 by 8 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.570
 So this is where I already start 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.770
 work I'm going to close a little bit of 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.050
 lightroom and here I already have the job 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.300
 I do not double click and this is the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:00.220
 preview true and this is the one that has the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.470
 information if I open this with a pad 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.370
 of notes or with any text editor 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.320
 truth here I have the information this 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.400
 is how are you going to distribute this is the 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.150
 photo 1 this is photo 2 truth that is going to 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.080
 have and here is the name of this 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.020
 preview that is here true custom pay 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.850
 137 71 is the one that is here for you 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.800
 change it should 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.680
 change the name true and its title 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.520
 perfect how do I make a new one or how do I 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.750
 I'm going to make a layout for now I have not 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.210
 found another solution 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.880
 I'm going to keep looking or suddenly 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.380
 I create a program to do this to me 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.330
 automatically what I have to do 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:53.540
 is the next one do a control c 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:57.080
 of this true and then a control of 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.240
 this saying with him took copy and paste and 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.530
 I start playing 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:07.880
 instead the index in three and then I 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.960
 I play with the position of x and xi 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:16.130
 the position that here 54 true 54 here 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.730
 It's 3 53 truth, here I'm going to leave you 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.990
 equal 54 but the one and we're going to change it 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.120
 what do I know, what are we going to put 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.960
 one that is one 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:34.850
 or 10 10 10 and here also 10 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:37.390
 with this file save close talk 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.390
 lightroom 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:44.450
 I hope it loads 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.110
 I go to my personalized page and observe 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.660
 that is already here 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.880
 and then we're going to try to make it 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.730
 a little more to the right would be true 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.220
 a little more to the right and keep 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.940
 this same then this same margin 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.260
 it would come to be the position of iu and 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.510
 it would come to the position here 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.830
 then we are going to copy the position of 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.440
 iu from photo 2 I'm really going to close it 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.290
 because otherwise they do not cool what 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:23.950
 I 'm going to open I 'm going to copy the position of 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:26.200
 386 iu truth is I think more 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.930
 we should copy the position of x 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.690
 I'm really going to copy the position of x 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.690
 best 54 record 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.190
 remember that I have learned this 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.810
 going through there is no side of this 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.520
 information if someone has already in 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.500
 information to this 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.430
 organized I will go up a bit 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.060
 look what this would be 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.980
 the full point of the point and from where 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.560
 start I'll take point from the first 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:03.720
 image then how would you tell them if 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.660
 someone has a 54 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.840
 if someone has a reference of the 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.700
 own adobe page would be interesting 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.250
 I think not because it's like a 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.280
 negotiated that they do with blur then 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.900
 as they do not unsympathetic them much 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.690
 the fact that you create your own 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.570
 template and it's there then well this 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:29.070
 is how you can create the 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:31.860
 templates inside my book not inside 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.890
 of my book without major problem already here 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.970
 you already know how you can go 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.420
 changing not this is no longer 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:42.080
 science actually 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.590
 this is no longer science as I said here 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.710
 simply what I do is adapt my 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.780
 image 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:56.470
 what I need then 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:59.320
 basically this if it's not book anymore 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:03.880
 but I hope I have helped in something though 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:06.190
 if it is quite complicated the fact of 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.860
 change them we will not try or I will 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.140
 try to see how it can be done 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.880
 in an easier way that's why it's all 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.880
 I say goodbye until later
