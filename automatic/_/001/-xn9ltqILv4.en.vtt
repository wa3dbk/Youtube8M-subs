00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
of my classes we start along the selvage

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.370 
of my classes we start along the selvage
edge<00:00:17.520> picking<00:00:18.210> up<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.869> normally<00:00:19.020> would

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
edge picking up like we normally would

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.080 
edge picking up like we normally would
the<00:00:19.560> first<00:00:19.800> stitch<00:00:20.070> but<00:00:20.430> before<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.850> do<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the first stitch but before we do the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.240 
the first stitch but before we do the
second<00:00:21.480> stitch<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.990> just<00:00:22.230> place<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.650> yarn<00:00:22.859> over

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
second stitch we just place a yarn over

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.179 
second stitch we just place a yarn over
and<00:00:23.460> then<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.150> pick<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.600> stitch<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.230> we

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and then we pick up a stitch and we

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.730 
and then we pick up a stitch and we
aren't<00:00:26.490> over<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.660> pick<00:00:27.869> up<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.140> stitch<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
aren't over and we pick up a stitch and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.970 
aren't over and we pick up a stitch and
we<00:00:29.640> aren't<00:00:29.880> over<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.480> each<00:00:31.289> time<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.679> pick<00:00:31.859> up

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
we aren't over and each time we pick up

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.040 
we aren't over and each time we pick up
a<00:00:32.130> stitch<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:33.030> place<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.450> yarn<00:00:33.690> over

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
a stitch we place a yarn over

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.080 
a stitch we place a yarn over
and<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.980> we're<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> pick<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.880> many

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and so we're going to pick up as many

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.459 
and so we're going to pick up as many
stitches<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:36.870> normally<00:00:37.050> would

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
stitches as we normally would

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.520 
stitches as we normally would
plus<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.489> yarn<00:00:39.090> over<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.600> between<00:00:39.960> every<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.500> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
plus a yarn over in between every one of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.880 
plus a yarn over in between every one of
them<00:00:40.770> until<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.430> get<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> last<00:00:42.480> stitch<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.580 

I'm<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> end<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.960> get<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.320> last

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
I'm at the end so as I get to the last

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
I'm at the end so as I get to the last
stitch<00:00:49.980> I'm<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> yarn<00:00:50.670> over<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.149> then

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
stitch I'm going to yarn over and then

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.060 
stitch I'm going to yarn over and then
just<00:00:51.690> pick<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.469> last<00:00:53.250> stitch<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
just pick up one last stitch so as I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.740 
just pick up one last stitch so as I
begin<00:00:59.340> working<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> first<00:01:00.000> row<00:01:00.329> I'm<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
begin working the first row I'm going to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.389 
begin working the first row I'm going to
purl<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.800> normally<00:01:02.219> what<00:01:02.370> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
purl because that is normally what I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.910

would<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.449> I'm<00:01:03.570> purling<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> last<00:01:04.559> stitch

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
would do but I'm purling the last stitch

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.429 
would do but I'm purling the last stitch
I<00:01:05.070> picked<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.489> together<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:06.570> its<00:01:06.840> adjacent

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439
