00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
though actually now I come to think of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.260 
though actually now I come to think of
it<00:01:29.630> one<00:01:30.630> thing<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.259> had<00:01:31.500> puzzled<00:01:31.829> me<00:01:32.250> was<00:01:33.000> how

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it one thing that had puzzled me was how

an oath like kleiner could possibly have

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
answer he happened it was just a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.560 
answer he happened it was just a
collection<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.710> wires<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.490> valves<00:01:45.060> arranged

rock Railton or giddy semestre among

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.190 
rock Railton or giddy semestre among
them<00:03:54.030> they<00:03:55.030> were<00:03:55.090> all<00:03:55.360> of<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.630> similar<00:03:55.989> height

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
them they were all of a similar height

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.110 
them they were all of a similar height
and<00:03:56.470> roughly<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.890> same<00:03:57.100> build<00:03:57.430> as<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.820> Stars

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
and roughly the same build as the Stars

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.690 
and roughly the same build as the Stars
they<00:03:58.390> had<00:03:58.600> been<00:03:58.780> intended<00:03:59.350> to<00:03:59.380> replace<00:03:59.739> but

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
they had been intended to replace but

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.400 
they had been intended to replace but
they<00:04:00.850> just<00:04:01.180> didn't<00:04:01.780> have<00:04:02.670> something<00:04:04.410> maybe

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
they just didn't have something maybe

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.199 
they just didn't have something maybe
its<00:04:05.680> star<00:04:05.980> quality<00:04:06.720> maybe<00:04:07.720> it's<00:04:08.260> charisma

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
its star quality maybe it's charisma

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.140 
its star quality maybe it's charisma
maybe<00:04:10.209> it's<00:04:11.049> just<00:04:11.519> confidence

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
maybe it's just confidence

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.729 
maybe it's just confidence
but<00:04:13.870> they<00:04:14.049> were<00:04:14.110> all<00:04:14.439> alive<00:04:15.189> and<00:04:15.670> well<00:04:16.739> they'd

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
but they were all alive and well they'd

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.289 
but they were all alive and well they'd
not<00:04:18.009> been<00:04:18.250> kissed<00:04:18.489> by<00:04:18.699> an<00:04:18.820> angel

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
not been kissed by an angel

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.800 
not been kissed by an angel
so<00:04:19.989> they'd<00:04:20.199> live<00:04:20.410> full<00:04:20.709> and<00:04:21.009> happy<00:04:21.310> lives<00:04:21.810> or

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
so they'd live full and happy lives or

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.939 
so they'd live full and happy lives or
