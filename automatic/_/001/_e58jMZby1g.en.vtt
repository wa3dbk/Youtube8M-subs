thing and you control it through here so
much<00:01:35.970> when<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.360> flip<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.689> back<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.380> goes

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
much when I flip this back that goes

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.160 
much when I flip this back that goes
down<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.009> want<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> down<00:01:38.700> okay<00:01:39.329> that's<00:01:39.960> down

them for myself now moving forward move
these<00:04:44.760> modular<00:04:45.760> straight<00:04:45.970> forward<00:04:46.270> you're

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
these modular straight forward you're

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.870 
these modular straight forward you're
moving<00:04:46.390> both<00:04:46.720> over<00:04:47.370> it'll<00:04:48.370> give<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.730> nice

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
moving both over it'll give you a nice

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.790 
moving both over it'll give you a nice
little<00:04:49.150> backup<00:04:49.480> signal<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.380> know<00:04:50.560> you're<00:04:50.710> not

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
little backup signal you know you're not

another<00:04:53.169> thing<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.740> think<00:04:54.190> about<00:04:54.610> though<00:04:54.850> is

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
another thing to think about though is

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.570 
another thing to think about though is
when<00:04:55.780> you're<00:04:55.930> actually<00:04:56.110> in<00:04:56.380> Reverse<00:04:56.800> with

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
when you're actually in Reverse with

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.470 
when you're actually in Reverse with
these<00:04:57.730> machines

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
these machines

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.500 
these machines
sometimes<00:04:59.080> you'll<00:04:59.230> go<00:04:59.380> forward<00:05:00.300> because<00:05:01.300> you

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
sometimes you'll go forward because you

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.780 
sometimes you'll go forward because you
want<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.750> notice<00:05:02.140> but<00:05:02.440> if<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:02.950> cab<00:05:03.220> is<00:05:03.460> swung

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
want to notice but if the cab is swung

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.290 
want to notice but if the cab is swung
around<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.120> opposite<00:05:04.570> way<00:05:05.100> you<00:05:06.100> you<00:05:07.090> might

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
around the opposite way you you might

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.659 
around the opposite way you you might
accidentally<00:05:07.990> push<00:05:08.560> forward<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:09.490> you'll

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
accidentally push forward and you'll

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.250 
accidentally push forward and you'll
actually<00:05:09.910> go<00:05:10.360> backwards<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:12.720> just<00:05:13.720> something

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
actually go backwards so just something

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.880 
actually go backwards so just something
to<00:05:14.380> think<00:05:14.470> about

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
to think about

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.860 
to think about
you<00:05:15.520> know<00:05:15.640> we<00:05:15.850> all<00:05:15.970> we<00:05:16.120> all<00:05:16.150> do<00:05:16.419> it<00:05:16.540> from<00:05:16.690> time

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
you know we all we all do it from time

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.030 
you know we all we all do it from time
to<00:05:16.990> time<00:05:17.020> they<00:05:17.260> don't<00:05:17.440> realize<00:05:17.740> what

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
to time they don't realize what

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.870 
to time they don't realize what
when<00:05:18.340> machine<00:05:18.760> is<00:05:18.880> facing<00:05:20.250> he's<00:05:21.250> both<00:05:21.520> bird

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
when machine is facing he's both bird

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.969 
when machine is facing he's both bird
and<00:05:22.390> I'm<00:05:22.930> going<00:05:23.200> to<00:05:23.350> forward<00:05:23.620> both<00:05:24.040> tracks<00:05:24.900> and

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
and I'm going to forward both tracks and

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.500 
and I'm going to forward both tracks and
I<00:05:26.979> mean<00:05:27.160> that's<00:05:27.340> really<00:05:27.640> all<00:05:27.790> there<00:05:27.940> is<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:28.330> it

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
I mean that's really all there is to it

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.090 
I mean that's really all there is to it
I'm<00:05:28.720> a<00:05:28.810> little<00:05:29.020> bit<00:05:29.140> more<00:05:29.320> out<00:05:29.500> now<00:05:29.740> so<00:05:29.979> I'll

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
I'm a little bit more out now so I'll

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.120 
I'm a little bit more out now so I'll
show<00:05:30.280> you<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.610> hole<00:05:31.300> left<00:05:31.450> to<00:05:31.660> right<00:05:32.130> I'm

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
show you the hole left to right I'm

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.570 
show you the hole left to right I'm
pretty<00:05:33.430> pretty<00:05:33.820> simple<00:05:34.210> last

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
pretty pretty simple last

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.080 
pretty pretty simple last
right<00:05:37.320> very<00:05:38.320> very<00:05:39.010> very<00:05:39.280> simple<00:05:39.700> machines

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
right very very very simple machines

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.450 
right very very very simple machines
that's<00:05:40.300> right<00:05:40.470> one<00:05:41.470> thing<00:05:41.620> I<00:05:41.770> have<00:05:41.950> noticed<00:05:42.160> I

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
that's right one thing I have noticed I

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.550 
that's right one thing I have noticed I
don't<00:05:42.520> think<00:05:43.420> this<00:05:43.600> is<00:05:43.630> with<00:05:43.960> all<00:05:44.230> the

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
don't think this is with all the

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.920 
don't think this is with all the
machines<00:05:44.890> in<00:05:45.070> particular<00:05:45.550> but<00:05:45.750> I've<00:05:46.750> noticed

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
machines in particular but I've noticed

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.810 
machines in particular but I've noticed
the<00:05:47.140> cats<00:05:47.380> are<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.710> lot<00:05:48.010> more<00:05:48.040> responsive<00:05:48.790> than

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
the cats are a lot more responsive than

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.500 
the cats are a lot more responsive than
the<00:05:49.120> deers

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
the deers

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.360 
the deers
so<00:05:50.320> just<00:05:50.560> keep<00:05:50.710> that<00:05:50.830> in<00:05:50.890> mind<00:05:50.980> you<00:05:51.250> know<00:05:51.340> you

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
so just keep that in mind you know you

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.100 
so just keep that in mind you know you
go<00:05:51.520> from<00:05:51.700> a<00:05:51.790> cat<00:05:51.940> to<00:05:52.120> here<00:05:52.360> you<00:05:52.450> jump<00:05:52.660> in<00:05:52.840> and

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
go from a cat to here you jump in and

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.790 
go from a cat to here you jump in and
start<00:05:53.350> controlling<00:05:54.130> it<00:05:54.430> it's<00:05:54.670> going<00:05:54.880> to<00:05:54.970> cats

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
start controlling it it's going to cats

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.350 
start controlling it it's going to cats
at<00:05:56.800> least<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.100> ones<00:05:57.250> on<00:05:57.370> this<00:05:57.460> job<00:05:57.760> are<00:05:57.970> a<00:05:58.000> lot

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
at least the ones on this job are a lot

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.440 
at least the ones on this job are a lot
more<00:05:58.630> responsive<00:05:59.370> so<00:06:00.370> you<00:06:01.030> know<00:06:01.150> it's<00:06:01.330> a

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
more responsive so you know it's a

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.450 
more responsive so you know it's a
little<00:06:01.600> misleading<00:06:02.260> when<00:06:02.740> you<00:06:02.830> jump<00:06:03.070> in<00:06:03.250> one

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
little misleading when you jump in one

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.760 
little misleading when you jump in one
you<00:06:03.730> go<00:06:03.850> to<00:06:03.880> you've<00:06:04.840> been<00:06:04.930> driving<00:06:05.110> it<00:06:05.410> all<00:06:05.530> day

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
you go to you've been driving it all day

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.140 
you go to you've been driving it all day
and<00:06:05.980> you<00:06:06.100> go<00:06:06.220> to<00:06:06.280> give<00:06:06.490> it<00:06:06.580> the<00:06:06.670> same<00:06:06.850> pressure

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
and you go to give it the same pressure

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.030 
and you go to give it the same pressure
on<00:06:07.360> the<00:06:07.450> controls<00:06:07.870> and<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.320> whole<00:06:08.500> thing<00:06:08.800> just

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
on the controls and the whole thing just

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.770 
on the controls and the whole thing just
either<00:06:09.190> goes<00:06:09.460> way<00:06:09.610> too<00:06:09.670> fast<00:06:10.030> or<00:06:10.240> way<00:06:10.330> too<00:06:10.390> slow

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
either goes way too fast or way too slow

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.920 
either goes way too fast or way too slow
so<00:06:11.050> yeah<00:06:11.920> and<00:06:12.040> that's<00:06:12.160> pretty<00:06:12.640> much<00:06:12.760> it<00:06:12.910> I<00:06:13.300> mean

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
so yeah and that's pretty much it I mean

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.750 
so yeah and that's pretty much it I mean
other<00:06:14.140> than<00:06:14.230> that<00:06:14.470> you<00:06:14.680> know<00:06:14.710> you<00:06:14.860> got<00:06:15.100> nice

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
other than that you know you got nice

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.470 
other than that you know you got nice
radio<00:06:16.920> 12-volt<00:06:17.920> power<00:06:18.070> outlets<00:06:18.520> that's<00:06:19.300> one

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
radio 12-volt power outlets that's one

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.240 
radio 12-volt power outlets that's one
more<00:06:19.600> thing<00:06:19.660> so<00:06:20.080> always<00:06:20.650> check<00:06:20.950> your<00:06:20.980> power

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
more thing so always check your power

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.950 
more thing so always check your power
outlets<00:06:21.730> before<00:06:22.000> you<00:06:22.090> go<00:06:22.180> plug<00:06:22.420> in<00:06:22.540> stuff<00:06:22.780> and

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
outlets before you go plug in stuff and

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.050 
outlets before you go plug in stuff and
do<00:06:23.050> them<00:06:23.200> till<00:06:23.440> they<00:06:23.650> take<00:06:23.830> 12<00:06:24.130> volts<00:06:24.460> yeah

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
do them till they take 12 volts yeah

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.170 
do them till they take 12 volts yeah
well<00:06:25.600> sometimes<00:06:26.110> they're<00:06:26.440> 24<00:06:26.980> so<00:06:27.490> they'll<00:06:28.000> go

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
well sometimes they're 24 so they'll go

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.500 
well sometimes they're 24 so they'll go
plug<00:06:28.390> in<00:06:28.540> your<00:06:28.660> cell<00:06:28.900> phone<00:06:28.930> into<00:06:29.260> that<00:06:29.640> and<00:06:30.640> I

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
plug in your cell phone into that and I

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.030 
plug in your cell phone into that and I
mean<00:06:31.660> that's<00:06:31.840> about<00:06:31.990> it<00:06:32.290> as<00:06:32.710> far<00:06:32.770> as<00:06:32.920> the

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
mean that's about it as far as the

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.500 
mean that's about it as far as the
biggest<00:06:33.280> operation<00:06:33.820> goes<00:06:33.970> don't<00:06:34.180> forget

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
biggest operation goes don't forget

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.990 
biggest operation goes don't forget
before<00:06:34.780> you<00:06:34.840> get<00:06:34.990> out<00:06:35.130> you<00:06:36.130> know<00:06:36.250> slide<00:06:36.820> this

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
before you get out you know slide this

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.900 
before you get out you know slide this
over<00:06:37.530> down<00:06:38.580> and<00:06:40.530> yeah<00:06:41.530> that's<00:06:42.250> pretty<00:06:42.340> much<00:06:42.580> it

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
over down and yeah that's pretty much it

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.170 
over down and yeah that's pretty much it
it's<00:06:43.390> got<00:06:43.540> a<00:06:43.620> computer<00:06:44.620> here<00:06:44.770> tells<00:06:45.760> you<00:06:45.850> basic

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
it's got a computer here tells you basic

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.610 
it's got a computer here tells you basic
things<00:06:46.390> if<00:06:46.600> you<00:06:46.720> want<00:06:46.930> on<00:06:47.080> I<00:06:47.260> don't<00:06:47.470> know<00:06:47.560> if

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
you can see that it's pretty bright out

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.060 
you can see that it's pretty bright out
tells<00:06:49.870> you<00:06:49.990> if<00:06:50.050> you<00:06:50.230> all<00:06:50.440> that<00:06:50.620> all<00:06:50.710> that<00:06:50.920> good
