you<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:21.220> thick<00:02:22.470> articulation<00:02:23.470> feet<00:02:23.740> move

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
you can the thick articulation feet move

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.410 
you can the thick articulation feet move
back<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.490> forth<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:25.570> like<00:02:25.690> in<00:02:25.990> this<00:02:26.170> one<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
back and forth just like in this one and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:39.440 
back and forth just like in this one and
then<00:02:29.820> deletion<00:02:30.820> arms<00:02:33.540> go<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.720> focus<00:02:38.010> arms

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
then deletion arms go and focus arms

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:47.340 
then deletion arms go and focus arms
articulation<00:02:44.280> articulation<00:02:45.600> it's<00:02:46.600> not<00:02:46.750> focus

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
articulation articulation it's not focus

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.780 
articulation articulation it's not focus
the<00:02:47.500> income<00:02:47.860> on<00:02:48.150> focus<00:02:49.150> thank<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:50.790> arms

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
the income on focus thank you arms

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.940 
the income on focus thank you arms
articulation<00:02:52.570> is<00:02:52.720> like<00:02:52.930> up<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.350> down<00:02:53.530> and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
articulation is like up and down and

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.260 
articulation is like up and down and
then<00:02:54.900> move<00:02:55.900> this<00:02:56.260> up<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:57.250> down<00:02:57.730> yeah<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:59.470> then

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
then move this up and down yeah and then

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.520 
then move this up and down yeah and then
head<00:03:01.270> articulation<00:03:02.140> move<00:03:03.030> backwards

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
head articulation move backwards

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.390 
head articulation move backwards
forwards<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.810> then<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.769> truly<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.190> it

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
forwards and then it truly is it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.060 
forwards and then it truly is it
transform<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:10.870> need<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.230> do<00:03:11.350> is<00:03:11.500> align<00:03:11.799> the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
transform so I need to do is align the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.870 
transform so I need to do is align the
arms<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.790> legs<00:03:12.910> are<00:03:13.330> harder<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:15.700> have<00:03:15.760> to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
arms and the legs are harder you have to

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.460 
arms and the legs are harder you have to
paint<00:03:16.269> like<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.980> flip<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.220> down<00:03:19.470> flick

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
paint like that flip this down flick

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:41.820 
paint like that flip this down flick
