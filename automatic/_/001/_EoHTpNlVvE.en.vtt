00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.979
 maha melts 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:46.150
 and I tell them the battery terminal in advance 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:49.400
 made a tin of tin and 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.790
 carbon electrode from simple old 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.350
 373 batteries 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.670
 fix slowly heating the terminal 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:03.100
 I put lead from fishing 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.210
 sinker not mother attention when soldering 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.980
 battery electrode arc occurs 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.980
 which is undesirable tales 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.770
 cool is very hot 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.659
 therefore, to make lead mass uniformity 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.149
 it was equally good hard 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.149
 mix soldering time 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:15.050
 here is the mold filled waiting for cooling 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.050
 full cooling of the terminal 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.450
 remove lead residue 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:46.610
 which flew away and plastics and bitumen here 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.610
 may be 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:07.769
 I think that Klim soldered after that 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.769
 carefully remove the bandage from the tin 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.160
 it should be homogeneous beautiful 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:24.099
 Clima may be very beautiful at the beginning but 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:27.620
 after that we are filed 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:31.420
 move on to the kind that is needed for the terminals 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.420
 car battery 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:45.689
 suck wait for complete cooling only 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:48.290
 after that with them a yoke here if you're on 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.290
 this soldering is finished 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:06.520
 the terminal on the bus will understand the batteries 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:08.840
 car pre-anointed her 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:17.139
 some kind of lubricant well lithol can 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:20.590
 or graphite so it does not oxidize 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.590
 work process 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.610
 light too 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:55.170
 we put on the battery 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:29.840
 Lima sits on the spot then I come to you 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:31.550
 wedge and tighten and try to bring 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.890
 our car of course the battery could 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.890
 eat after miami 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.400
 but 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.040
 well, as we put all the batteries under him 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:12.530
 works okay on this we 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.530
 ending our video is not mine
