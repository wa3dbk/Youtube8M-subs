higher than if I'm working on just a

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.450 
higher than if I'm working on just a
single<00:01:02.960> blog<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.560> it's<00:01:03.710> something<00:01:04.250> that

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
he just couldn't see around you know

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.920 
he just couldn't see around you know
this<00:01:09.830> front<00:01:10.190> part<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.760> machine<00:01:11.150> here<00:01:11.630> and

exactly okay and josh is stitching on
all<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.590> marked<00:01:27.950> lines<00:01:28.220> within<00:01:28.760> this<00:01:28.909> block<00:01:29.150> I

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
all the marked lines within this block I

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.080 
all the marked lines within this block I
stitched<00:01:29.870> this<00:01:30.020> design<00:01:30.409> freehand<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.790> I<00:01:31.909> hope

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
stitched this design freehand and I hope

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.330 
stitched this design freehand and I hope
that<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.500> understand<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.770> stippling<00:01:34.190> is

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
that you understand that stippling is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.010 
that you understand that stippling is
one<00:01:34.490> of<00:01:34.580> those<00:01:34.670> designs<00:01:35.060> yes<00:01:35.690> you<00:01:35.900> can

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
one of those designs yes you can

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.070 
one of those designs yes you can
definitely<00:01:36.260> mark<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:38.150> can<00:01:38.330> also<00:01:38.540> most

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
definitely mark it but you can also most

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.070 
definitely mark it but you can also most
definitely<00:01:39.560> memorize<00:01:39.979> these

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
definitely memorize these

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.810 
definitely memorize these
simple<00:01:41.500> steps<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.070> design<00:01:42.370> just<00:01:42.700> a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
simple steps of the design just a

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
simple steps of the design just a
liquidy<00:01:43.330> shape<00:01:43.600> of<00:01:43.990> bending<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:45.250> kind<00:01:45.520> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
liquidy shape of bending and and kind of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.780 
liquidy shape of bending and and kind of
meandering<00:01:46.840> them<00:01:47.050> around<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:48.460> can<00:01:48.700> be

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
meandering them around that can be

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.820 
meandering them around that can be
memorized<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.510> don't<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.260> have<00:01:50.470> these

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
memorized you don't have to have these

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.650 
memorized you don't have to have these
marked<00:01:51.220> lines<00:01:51.460> in<00:01:51.790> order<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.210> stitch<00:01:52.420> this

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.090 
well I'm sure it's a sharp turn yeah I
wanted<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.780> avoid<00:02:22.959> all<00:02:23.230> sharp<00:02:23.560> turns<00:02:23.800> keep

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
a look at how that will work like that

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.850 
a look at how that will work like that
well<00:02:58.420> that's<00:02:58.630> for<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> future<00:02:59.050> video<00:02:59.230> yeah<00:02:59.830> and
