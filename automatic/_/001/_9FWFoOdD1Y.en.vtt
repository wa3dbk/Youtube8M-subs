Rail<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.329> he's<00:00:36.329> basically<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
Rail and he's basically that was the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.220 
Rail and he's basically that was the
task<00:00:37.350> 2<00:00:37.739> pitch<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.780> come<00:00:39.780> up<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.079> unique

task 2 pitch and come up with a unique
idea<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.550> try<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.790> prevent<00:00:42.000> people<00:00:42.420> you

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
idea on to try and prevent people you

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.270 
idea on to try and prevent people you
know<00:00:43.110> messing<00:00:43.410> about<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.770> train<00:00:43.980> track

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
know messing about on the train track

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.090 
know messing about on the train track
and<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.000> we've<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:45.870> given<00:00:46.020> our<00:00:46.260> different

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
and so we've all given our different

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
and so we've all given our different
approach<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.420> he's<00:00:48.600> got<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> go

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
approach to it and now he's got to go

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.540 
approach to it and now he's got to go
away<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.559> pick<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> right<00:00:50.370> approach

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
away in and pick what the right approach

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.330 
away in and pick what the right approach
is<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.120> deal<00:00:51.690> with<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.899> subject<00:00:52.110> matter<00:00:52.469> here

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
is to deal with that subject matter here

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.950 
is to deal with that subject matter here
a<00:00:53.370> new<00:00:53.789> plan<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> screenwriting<00:00:54.719> course

well<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.629> may<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.109> considered<00:01:01.649> writing<00:01:01.890> for

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
well you may not considered writing for

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.910 
well you may not considered writing for
this<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.120> give<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.480> go<00:01:03.660> well<00:01:04.379> my<00:01:04.500> idea<00:01:04.650> was

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
this but give it a go well my idea was

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.310 
this but give it a go well my idea was
to<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> mother<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.820> then<00:01:06.320> basically

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
to do with the mother and then basically

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500 
to do with the mother and then basically
approach<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.950> from<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:08.909> our<00:01:08.939> family<00:01:09.240> as

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
approach it from you know our family as

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.990 
approach it from you know our family as
a<00:01:09.540> whole<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:10.110> opposed<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.740> directly<00:01:11.549> towards

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
a whole as opposed to directly towards

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.370 
a whole as opposed to directly towards
the<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> one<00:01:12.750> lad<00:01:12.930> who<00:01:13.080> might<00:01:13.260> be

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the you know the one lad who might be

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.230 
the you know the one lad who might be
messing<00:01:13.680> around<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> track<00:01:14.400> well<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.119> end

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
messing around on the track well the end

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.080 
messing around on the track well the end
result<00:01:15.570> I'm<00:01:15.750> hoping<00:01:16.229> will<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.100> northern

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
result I'm hoping will be that northern

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570 
result I'm hoping will be that northern
