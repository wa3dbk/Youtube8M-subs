where<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.799> looks<00:03:23.130> like<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.459> skirt<00:03:23.940> from<00:03:24.150> a

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
where it looks like a skirt from a

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.569 
where it looks like a skirt from a
distance<00:03:24.660> but<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:24.989> has<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.650> convenience<00:03:26.340> of

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
shorter so it's gotten to the point

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.720 
shorter so it's gotten to the point
where<00:03:48.690> i<00:03:48.810> have<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.200> wear<00:03:49.470> spandex<00:03:50.190> under<00:03:50.579> them

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.850 
wasn't complaining and my wardrobe of
course<00:04:44.900> would<00:04:45.020> not<00:04:45.140> be<00:04:45.290> complete<00:04:45.410> without<00:04:45.710> a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
course would not be complete without a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.460 
course would not be complete without a
black<00:04:46.130> pair<00:04:46.400> so<00:04:46.670> I<00:04:46.700> got<00:04:46.970> a<00:04:47.000> pair<00:04:47.240> from<00:04:47.420> BB<00:04:47.900> these

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
black pair so I got a pair from BB these

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.780 
black pair so I got a pair from BB these
ones<00:04:48.620> are<00:04:48.800> just<00:04:48.860> black<00:04:49.250> with<00:04:49.460> gold<00:04:49.640> hardware

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
ones are just black with gold hardware

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.610 
ones are just black with gold hardware
and<00:04:50.390> I<00:04:50.450> really<00:04:50.720> like<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:50.990> simplicity<00:04:51.170> of

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
and I really like the simplicity of

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.500 
and I really like the simplicity of
these<00:04:51.890> and<00:04:52.190> I<00:04:52.640> thought<00:04:52.850> that<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.120> black<00:04:53.360> and

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
these and I thought that the black and

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.570 
these and I thought that the black and
gold<00:04:53.660> would<00:04:53.990> be<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.230> really<00:04:54.620> nice<00:04:54.830> contrast<00:04:55.370> as

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
gold would be a really nice contrast as

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.300 
gold would be a really nice contrast as
opposed<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.450> a<00:04:56.660> white<00:04:57.350> and<00:04:57.500> gold<00:04:57.710> so<00:04:57.980> I<00:04:58.010> really

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
opposed to a white and gold so I really

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.980 
opposed to a white and gold so I really
can't<00:04:58.520> wait<00:04:58.670> to<00:04:58.910> style<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.570> bunch<00:04:59.750> of<00:04:59.810> these
