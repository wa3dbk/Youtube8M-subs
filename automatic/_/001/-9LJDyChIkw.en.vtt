 right through them come here 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.180
 a left and from it you can create 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.360
 metallic 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.640
 he does not have the same meal as 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.980
 I have to go through naturally. 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.260

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.390
 he does not have the same ability to 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.640
 filtering film're sunbathing you have

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.500
 with coffee with paper filters 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.450
 No, it's not 100 percent like that. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.940
 then the tip will put the future 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.950

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.720
 power 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.750
 It's not really like that, so my tip is 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.229
 focus of the sporting day that a 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.080

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.760
 air that this huge plastic box 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.790
 that to you see you will make a 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.840
 there are kits already 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.390
 adapt 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.180
 you have to leave in a way one 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.560
 tool or system for you to 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.810
 remove the filter 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.850
 I'm wise before I say the word. 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.979
 Good, but you're going to end up having a 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.620
 premature wear of mechanical parts 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.680
 caused by solid particles 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.040
 stay there get into friction confession 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.959
 involving more rt liquid are reminiscent 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.570

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.940
 bad performance and to get worse will pull the 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.799
 crankcase gases because the gib diary 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.180
 greater resistance to the emission 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.130
