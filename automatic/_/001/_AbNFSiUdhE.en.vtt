alright so that's a regular version now

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630 
alright so that's a regular version now
the<00:01:09.600> shiny<00:01:10.020> version<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:11.430> bit

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the shiny version is just a little bit

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.810 
the shiny version is just a little bit
