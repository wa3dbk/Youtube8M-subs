00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
main principles of the basics are use a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.880 
main principles of the basics are use a
firm<00:00:31.710> squeegee<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.520> good<00:00:32.850> buffer<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.329> it

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
firm squeegee with a good buffer on it

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.830 
firm squeegee with a good buffer on it
hold<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> squeegee<00:00:35.219> properly<00:00:35.670> four<00:00:36.510> fingers

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
hold the squeegee properly four fingers

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.410 
hold the squeegee properly four fingers
on<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:36.989> side<00:00:37.350> thumb<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> other<00:00:41.420> always

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
on one side thumb on the other always

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.600 
on one side thumb on the other always
use<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> 45<00:00:43.320> degree<00:00:43.469> angle<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:44.129> applying<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
use a 45 degree angle when applying the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
use a 45 degree angle when applying the
film<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.570> optimal<00:00:46.140> angle<00:00:46.289> that

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
film this is the optimal angle that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.110 
film this is the optimal angle that
allows<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.010> most<00:00:47.219> film<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.579> applied<00:00:47.910> in

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
allows the most film to be applied in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.779 
allows the most film to be applied in
the<00:00:48.270> air<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.539> escape<00:00:48.629> also<00:00:49.559> use<00:00:50.160> efficient

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the air to escape also use efficient

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.369 
the air to escape also use efficient
overlapping<00:00:51.690> strokes<00:00:51.989> from<00:00:52.350> side<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.890> side

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.049 

when<00:00:58.379> cutting<00:00:58.680> always<00:00:59.399> use<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> high-quality

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
when cutting always use a high-quality

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.700 
when cutting always use a high-quality
knife<00:01:01.399> use<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> short<00:01:02.910> sharp<00:01:03.690> blade<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.199> it's

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
knife use a short sharp blade as it's

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.840 
knife use a short sharp blade as it's
held<00:01:04.920> by<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> knife<00:01:05.309> firmly<00:01:07.159> have<00:01:08.159> good<00:01:08.610> hand

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
held by the knife firmly have good hand

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.370 
held by the knife firmly have good hand
technique<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.180> there's<00:01:12.360> three<00:01:13.020> types<00:01:13.200> of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
technique and there's three types of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.429 
technique and there's three types of
cuts<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> vehicle<00:01:14.030> empty<00:01:15.030> empty<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:16.110> always

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
cuts on a vehicle empty empty is always

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.840 
cuts on a vehicle empty empty is always
on<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> front<00:01:16.920> fender<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> front<00:01:17.610> door

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
on the front fender and the front door

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
on the front fender and the front door
which<00:01:18.240> means<00:01:18.420> either<00:01:19.110> side<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> get

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
which means either side is going to get

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100 
which means either side is going to get
cut<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:21.119> portion<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> middle

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
cut out and the portion in the middle

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.179 
cut out and the portion in the middle
will<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.650> removed<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.350> majority<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> cuts<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
will be removed the majority of cuts on

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.609 
will be removed the majority of cuts on
vehicles<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.729> called<00:01:26.939> solid<00:01:27.210> empty<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:28.439> cut

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
vehicles is called solid empty one cut

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
vehicles is called solid empty one cut
is<00:01:28.740> made<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.040> empty<00:01:29.369> side<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is made on the empty side and then the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
is made on the empty side and then the
material<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:31.079> wrapped<00:01:31.799> around<00:01:31.920> onto<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
material is wrapped around onto the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.289 
material is wrapped around onto the
solid<00:01:32.939> side

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.980 

and<00:01:36.920> four<00:01:37.920> cuts<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.549> moldy<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.750> called

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and four cuts on moldy this is called

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.429 
and four cuts on moldy this is called
tuck<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.649> cut<00:01:41.719> molding<00:01:42.719> is<00:01:42.810> difficult<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> cut

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
tuck and cut molding is difficult to cut

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.350 
tuck and cut molding is difficult to cut
so<00:01:43.799> by<00:01:43.890> tucking<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.460> film<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.789> firmly<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so by tucking the film in firmly to the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.749 
so by tucking the film in firmly to the
edge<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:46.380> cutting<00:01:46.679> this<00:01:47.280> creates<00:01:47.640> high

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
edge and then cutting this creates high

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.840 
edge and then cutting this creates high
quality<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.450> durability<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.789> are

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
quality and durability and there are

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.450 
quality and durability and there are
times<00:01:51.060> when<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> film<00:01:51.630> has<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.990> heated

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
times when the film has to be heated

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.609 
times when the film has to be heated
always<00:01:53.460> set<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> film<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.060> properly<00:01:54.500> heat<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
always set the film up properly heat the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.350 
always set the film up properly heat the
film<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.039> right<00:01:56.159> temperature<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.759> avoid

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
