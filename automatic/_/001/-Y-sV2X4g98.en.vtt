00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.230
 I think when I start to dance 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.640
 all spectators away maybe shows us 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.320
 here before so cool stuff us 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.369
 then showed more stuff then you can 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.100
 you completely a bit 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:46.850
 Drift off and say where the bar is 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:46.850
 and musicians please else can 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.530
 now makes the tree 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.120
 I rotate a lot do not want to front 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.120
 important is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.759
 and a traceur freezers 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.070
 imitate everything immediately 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.940
 the top box center is the power to do 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940
 above 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.420
 this is your own station 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.340
 breakdance is about being your own 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.210
 things to come up with their own stuff 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.210
 be deep 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:08.780
 not just in the belly button between 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:34.730
 It is also something that combines honestly 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.730
 can also combine 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.140
 Yes 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.720
 I can show you what should I like 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.660
 want to do 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.660
 I would like to be able to do that now 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.050
 would like to 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.400
 part 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:21.510
 you are and then you always come 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.940
 already swing the leg through 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.680
 that's the air of coffee with yes and 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.900
 it is usually also as input 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:36.540
 in this country itself as for example 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.540
 a frieze in now go again 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:04:00.860
 I can combine that with the rail 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.360
 that's a bit shorter for me 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.100
 tested earlier you can do spagat 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.440
 you found yourself 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:13.000
 So when we looked at were we would 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:21.919
 us usually my top box 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.930
 they have already seen it 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:28.180
 be with us on our most 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.180
 Yesterday still dynamic 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.990
 for the sport we do 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.990

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:16.520

 I wanted to I can not can move 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:25.440

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:29.870
