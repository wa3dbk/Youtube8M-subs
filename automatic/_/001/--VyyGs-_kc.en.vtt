who don't have color vision understand

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.670 
who don't have color vision understand
what<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.460> means<00:02:18.730> what<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:19.210> what<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.540> does<00:02:20.140> red

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
what that means what is what is does red

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.860 
what that means what is what is does red
ink<00:02:20.980> symbolize<00:02:21.640> what<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> symbol<00:02:22.840> for

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
ink symbolize what is it the symbol for

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.260 
ink symbolize what is it the symbol for
and<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.220> when<00:02:24.340> they<00:02:24.490> see<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.910> symbol

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
and so that when they see that symbol

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.940 
and so that when they see that symbol
they<00:02:25.390> know<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.140> means<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.590> those<00:02:26.740> are

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
they know that that means that those are

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.230 
they know that that means that those are
new<00:02:27.280> words<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:27.610> then<00:02:27.760> probably<00:02:27.910> going<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.180> be

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240
