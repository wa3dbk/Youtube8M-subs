00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hallet welcome here today 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.030
 with the unboxing of sony wireless 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.980
 headset and the sbh 50 and now 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.719
 Let's take a look at the packaging and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.019
 the inner life in a small unboxing 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.050
 on 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:21.689
 Let's go take the knife 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.640
 at hand cut the glue here 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.080
 ash and we'll do it up here 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 that stupid plastic thing was gone 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:37.710
 By the way, not really easy is okay 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.760
 we take a pair of scissors and then we can 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.100
 We also have the problem without problems 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.960
 open the packaging so the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.550
 lax still on, and then we get the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.680
 We take care of whole inner life 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.969
 Let's go out and have a look 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.899
 as I said now only one here 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.539
 unboxing no test youtube.com later 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.510
 and there I will still the video 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.010
 link as far as it is online so what he 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.210
 in this packaging the way here 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.979
 not really good 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.380
 what do we have in any case everything 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.990
 be in it what at times piece by piece 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.299
 so first we do not really have 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.180
 nicely packed but least expedient 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.909
 here the headset with the bluetooth and 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.640
 nfc module and as possible others one 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.470
 headphones and the whole is meandering 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.420
 then somewhere in the packaging and around 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.090
 does not really get tangled 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.799
 but no matter 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.270
 then we have such a power supply here 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.159
 charging from the module that is on everyone 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.240
 case very valuable processed beautifully 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.400
 and a short usb cable a micro 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.530
 USB cable to charge the plan of the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.049
 We then have more on different 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.920
 adapter for the different places 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.350
 the human being has and still wonderful 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.320
 a few slips of paper do not show a pig 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.110
 not so we come to work on this 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.310
 Part we fuck here somehow the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.310
 headphones out 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.080
 ok first plastic layer would be gone then 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.590
 here the cable out of the slot here 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.879
 to lead 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.269
 Oh, you shit that ok and then we have 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.580
 ultimately this clip here still so 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.910
 a film which we can sometimes 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.920
 do the same from 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.660
 Oh, shit, that's what we're looking for 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.519
 first the headphones the headphones 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.180
 supplied are to sound from 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.799
 be very good 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.290
 more course there again and again to 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.630
 he just unpacked 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.560
 I really looked out of the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.930
 sea ​​headphones 3.5 connection from the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.310
 length ago so that you have the module here 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.900
 already on the collar can attach 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.590
 and not too much cable around the neck 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.750
 hang in ear headphones relatively well 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.260
 should be processed so in the sand lane 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.549
 up to 20 euros are so and 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.930
 experience is this time on this module 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.470
 and try again this slide here 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.620
 to scratch down 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.629
 First of all we try to get white 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.730
 small oled display inside of us 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.730
 display information from the device 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.450
 wonderful the film now from what have 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.950
 We'll stop here for a moment 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:30.260
 little autofocus yes he has 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.819
 works wonderfully and look us 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.510
 all the time how do we have one 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.940
 have volume rocker plusminus below 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.069
 we then connect the usb and a 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.250
 pickup so good you can not do that now 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:47.660
 recognize and then we have here 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.510
 Pause and continue button title 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.250
 title back and a back switch 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.680
 for the menu on this little one 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.419
 screen so what this button knows eight 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.790
 I do not know intuitively now and here 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.739
 I have just the microphone and the top 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.419
 make connection for the headphones like that 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.419
 Let's see if there's something else 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:07.370
 there is something in there and look at us 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.139
 then in the review just like that 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.389
 part is processed so what exactly 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.459
 because it is primarily this as a 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.840
 To be an agitator with what you do 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.229
 Just put it on the collar now 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.870
 unfortunately no juice on it and then infected 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.760
 you just 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.770
 35 pure copper and can then per 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.600
 bluetooth and nfc with the mobile phone 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.340
 connect and then I like this one 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.250
 long cable what else in somewhere 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:34.130
 The area around hangs also you can 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.360
 to use that as a music radio and 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.100
 wonderful part actually and more 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.260
 there's then in the review until then 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.560
 See you soon that was the dz I am 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.560
 then go away
