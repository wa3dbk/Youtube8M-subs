do some research and some testing and I
figured<00:00:13.290> out<00:00:13.410> exactly<00:00:13.679> how<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.519> no<00:00:15.150> this

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
figured out exactly how to do it no this

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.599 
figured out exactly how to do it no this
is<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> brand<00:00:16.680> new<00:00:16.740> map<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.369> came<00:00:17.580> out

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
is a brand new map that just came out

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.640 
is a brand new map that just came out
pretty<00:00:18.000> neat<00:00:18.359> color<00:00:18.570> by<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.840> way<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
pretty neat color by the way it's like a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.220 
pretty neat color by the way it's like a
burgundy<00:00:20.279> red<00:00:20.640> brown<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.600> don't<00:00:21.930> even<00:00:22.020> really

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
burgundy red brown I don't even really

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.410 
burgundy red brown I don't even really
know<00:00:22.470> what<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.710> club<00:00:22.890> well<00:00:23.340> anyways<00:00:23.699> if<00:00:24.180> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
know what the club well anyways if you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.620 
know what the club well anyways if you
see<00:00:24.600> people<00:00:24.960> using<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.380> mat<00:00:25.619> typically<00:00:26.630> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
see people using this mat typically this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.839 
see people using this mat typically this
will<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.619> medium<00:00:29.010> marker<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.519> let's<00:00:29.699> say

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
will be the medium marker so let's say

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.600 
will be the medium marker so let's say
I'm<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.410> there's<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.740> line<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.250> then

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
I'm here there's the line and then

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.900 
I'm here there's the line and then
there's<00:00:32.880> my<00:00:33.120> opponent<00:00:33.540> well<00:00:34.219> they<00:00:35.219> folded<00:00:35.730> it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
there's my opponent well they folded it

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.630 
there's my opponent well they folded it
incorrectly<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.890> automatically<00:00:38.520> have

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
incorrectly so you automatically have

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.910 
incorrectly so you automatically have
creases<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.540> places<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.500> don't<00:00:40.710> want

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
creases and places that you don't want

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.180 
creases and places that you don't want
um<00:00:42.050> would<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:43.170> been<00:00:43.200> nice<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> said<00:00:44.129> if

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
um would have been nice like I said if

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.470 
um would have been nice like I said if
they<00:00:44.309> put<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.610> right<00:00:44.730> down<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> middle<00:00:45.090> but

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
they put it right down the middle but

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.560 
they put it right down the middle but
they<00:00:45.660> didn't<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.770> mean<00:00:47.579> typically<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.120> guess<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
they didn't I mean typically I guess it

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.810 
they didn't I mean typically I guess it
really<00:00:48.780> doesn't<00:00:49.050> matter<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.250> those<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
really doesn't matter but for those the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.810 
really doesn't matter but for those the
order<00:00:51.090> anal<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.949> whatever<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.520> show

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
you how to do that here is the finished

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.119 
you how to do that here is the finished
product<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> show<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
product just to show that you know it

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.880 
product just to show that you know it
does<00:00:59.370> actually<00:00:59.699> work<00:01:00.030> um<00:01:00.510> there<00:01:01.350> are<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
does actually work um there are going to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.539 
does actually work um there are going to
be<00:01:01.949> very<00:01:02.070> very<00:01:03.140> minor<00:01:04.140> creases<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.400> that's

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
be very very minor creases but that's

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.990 
be very very minor creases but that's
simply<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.470> once<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.770> fold<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.670> mat

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
simply because once you fold your mat

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.149 
simply because once you fold your mat
you<00:01:09.360> know<00:01:09.479> you're<00:01:10.320> gonna<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> put<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.040> in

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you know you're gonna have to put it in

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.399 
you know you're gonna have to put it in
your<00:01:11.280> bag<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> fold<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.260> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
your bag so you have to fold it so you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.960 
your bag so you have to fold it so you
are<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:13.979> some<00:01:14.220> sort<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.549> creases

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
are going to have some sort of creases

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.700 
are going to have some sort of creases
but<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.270> least<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.720> you'll<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.470> where

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
but at least like you'll have it where

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.770 
but at least like you'll have it where
you<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.729> factory<00:01:18.240> creases

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you want it and it's not factory creases

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
you want it and it's not factory creases
anymore<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.860> actually<00:01:20.040> barely

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
anymore so it's actually barely

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.210 
anymore so it's actually barely
noticeable<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.070> i<00:01:23.100> meant

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
noticeable so this is what i meant

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.530 
noticeable so this is what i meant
typically<00:01:23.939> miss<00:01:24.840> people<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:26.070> play<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:27.330> the

horizontally<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.439> know<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.979> said

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
horizontally I don't know if I just said

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.480 
horizontally I don't know if I just said
that<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.430> not<00:01:32.549> um<00:01:33.110> but<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.829> know<00:01:34.860> what's<00:01:35.280> cool

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that or not um but you know what's cool

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.030 
that or not um but you know what's cool
with<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.820> most<00:01:36.630> people<00:01:37.020> will<00:01:37.409> treat<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.860> as

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
with this most people will treat this as

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.039 
with this most people will treat this as
a<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.430> player<00:01:38.700> they'll<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.630> leave<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.020> little

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
a one player they'll just leave a little

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.069 
a one player they'll just leave a little
bit<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.560> space<00:01:41.340> past<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.119> line<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.540> then

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
bit of space past the line and then

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.800 
bit of space past the line and then
they'll<00:01:43.409> want<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> crease<00:01:44.189> right<00:01:44.430> there

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
they'll want to put a crease right there

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
they'll want to put a crease right there
so<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:45.899> gives<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.409> more<00:01:46.740> playing<00:01:47.100> more

cards<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.250> stuff<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:51.560> but<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:52.740> also

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
cards and stuff like that but then also

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.550 
cards and stuff like that but then also
what's<00:01:53.460> cold<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.450> pull<00:01:55.200> from

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
what's cold then you can just pull from

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280 
what's cold then you can just pull from
beneath<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.360> turn<00:01:57.509> into<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.810> two<00:01:58.049> player

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
beneath and I can turn into a two player

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.580 
beneath and I can turn into a two player
ago<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.159> how<00:01:59.790> exactly<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.380> mats

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
ago so how exactly do you do the mats

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.149 
ago so how exactly do you do the mats
well<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.549> actually<00:02:03.000> quite<00:02:03.689> simple<00:02:04.159> first

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
well it's actually quite simple first

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.830 
well it's actually quite simple first
you<00:02:05.520> start<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> back<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.509> mat<00:02:06.659> because

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you start on the back of the mat because

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.210 
you start on the back of the mat because
you<00:02:07.079> want<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.469> rid<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> factory

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you want to get rid of the factory

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.999 
you want to get rid of the factory
creases<00:02:08.670> more<00:02:09.209> likely<00:02:09.629> nobody<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:10.830> likes

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
creases more likely nobody really likes

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.650 
creases more likely nobody really likes
where<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> creases<00:02:11.970> are<00:02:12.120> so

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
where the creases are so

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.320 
where the creases are so
that's<00:02:13.200> where<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.950> customization<00:02:14.910> comes<00:02:15.150> in

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
that's where the customization comes in

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.080 
that's where the customization comes in
so<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:16.200> you'll<00:02:16.380> need<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.770> an<00:02:17.040> iron<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.610> what

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
so what you'll need is an iron and what

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.300 
so what you'll need is an iron and what
you're<00:02:18.240> going<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:18.710> you'll<00:02:19.710> want<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:19.980> set

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
you're going to do you'll want to set

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.580 
you're going to do you'll want to set
your<00:02:20.520> arm<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.120> lowest<00:02:21.510> steam<00:02:21.990> possible

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
your arm to the lowest steam possible

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.470 
your arm to the lowest steam possible
you<00:02:22.800> want<00:02:22.950> steam<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.490> come<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.210> don't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
you want steam to come out but you don't

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960 
you want steam to come out but you don't
want<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:24.860> holy<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.580> know<00:02:26.790> what<00:02:26.820> I

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
want it like holy you know what I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.140 
want it like holy you know what I
mean<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.560> start<00:02:29.040> at<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.430> bottom<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.910> then

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
mean so start at the bottom and then

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.030 
mean so start at the bottom and then
maybe<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.930> can<00:02:31.110> work<00:02:31.140> up<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.560> notch<00:02:31.740> know

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
maybe you can work up a notch know

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.360 
maybe you can work up a notch know
typically<00:02:32.520> there's<00:02:33.000> numbers<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> Dow<00:02:34.370> like

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
typically there's numbers on a Dow like

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.940 
typically there's numbers on a Dow like
mine<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.820> year<00:02:36.060> through<00:02:36.390> five<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.410> started

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
mine is year through five so I started

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.220 
mine is year through five so I started
at<00:02:38.160> three<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.660> was<00:02:39.780> just<00:02:39.810> something

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
at three so that was just something

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.350 
at three so that was just something
right<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.800> middle<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.220> 1i<00:02:41.760> anything<00:02:42.150> too

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
right in the middle that 1i anything too

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.350 
right in the middle that 1i anything too
crazy<00:02:42.570> but<00:02:43.020> not<00:02:43.200> too<00:02:43.500> soft<00:02:43.800> either<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:45.240> then

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
crazy but not too soft either and then

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.080 
crazy but not too soft either and then
you'll<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.690> run<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:47.190> iron<00:02:47.400> across<00:02:47.760> there

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
you'll just run the iron across there

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.770 
you'll just run the iron across there
gets<00:02:48.720> rid<00:02:48.960> of<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.110> creases<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.270> then<00:02:51.270> here

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
gets rid of the creases so then here

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.130 
gets rid of the creases so then here
comes<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.380> cool<00:02:52.590> part<00:02:52.860> how<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:54.210> put<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
comes the cool part how do you put the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.780 
comes the cool part how do you put the
crease<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.920> other<00:02:56.070> side<00:02:56.400> because

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
crease on the other side because

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.060 
crease on the other side because
obviously<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.960> do<00:02:58.290> not<00:02:58.320> want<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:58.770> put<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
obviously you do not want to put the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.280 
obviously you do not want to put the
iron<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.520> this<00:02:59.820> material<00:03:00.030> that's<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.110> no-no

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
iron on this material that's a no-no

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.440 
iron on this material that's a no-no
you're<00:03:01.800> asking<00:03:01.920> for<00:03:02.190> bad<00:03:02.490> things<00:03:02.520> so<00:03:03.210> what

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
you're asking for bad things so what

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.010 
you're asking for bad things so what
you're<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:04.020> is<00:03:05.240> set<00:03:06.240> where<00:03:06.810> do<00:03:06.930> you

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
you're going to do is set where do you

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.250 
you're going to do is set where do you
want<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.350> crease<00:03:07.620> fold<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.850> mat<00:03:09.060> will<00:03:09.930> fold

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
want to crease fold the mat will fold

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.170 
want to crease fold the mat will fold
the<00:03:10.440> portion<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.010> mat<00:03:11.310> underneath<00:03:11.700> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the portion of the mat underneath and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.510 
the portion of the mat underneath and
then<00:03:12.210> you're<00:03:13.200> going<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.380> lay<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> towel<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.280> top

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
then you're going to lay a towel on top

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.170 
then you're going to lay a towel on top
and<00:03:14.760> then<00:03:15.750> now<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:17.100> are<00:03:17.220> going<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.459> iron<00:03:17.640> now

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
and then now you are going to iron now

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.050 
and then now you are going to iron now
since<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.320> have<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.770> towel<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.280> between<00:03:20.820> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
since you have the towel in between the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.180 
since you have the towel in between the
mat<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.690> honor<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.560> go<00:03:22.709> on<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:22.980> higher

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
mat and the honor you can go on a higher

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.520 
mat and the honor you can go on a higher
setting<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:23.760> depends<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.270> how<00:03:24.750> well<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.140> want

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
setting it depends on how well you want

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.360 
setting it depends on how well you want
this<00:03:25.709> crease<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.640> um<00:03:27.480> as<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:28.620> said<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:29.340> can

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
this crease so um as I said you can

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.850 
this crease so um as I said you can
start<00:03:29.790> at<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.209> lowest<00:03:30.420> level<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.140> now<00:03:31.410> you

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
start at the lowest level but now you

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.340 
start at the lowest level but now you
actually<00:03:32.070> have<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.580> option<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.120> crank<00:03:34.050> up<00:03:34.170> the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
actually have the option to crank up the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.410 
actually have the option to crank up the
steam<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> little<00:03:34.800> bit<00:03:35.130> if<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.520> need<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.910> sue<00:03:36.209> on

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
steam a little bit if you need to sue on

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.920 
steam a little bit if you need to sue on
as<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> really<00:03:37.290> nice<00:03:37.500> crease<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:39.840> know

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
as a really nice crease and you know

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.840 
as a really nice crease and you know
it's<00:03:40.110> typically<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:43.290> just<00:03:43.610> folds<00:03:44.610> on

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
it's typically that so it just folds on

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
on the bottom so I definitely wouldn't

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.140

suggest<00:04:02.220> for<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.720> just<00:04:04.170> do<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.980> iron

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
directly to the map maybe you can just

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.880 
directly to the map maybe you can just
put<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.770> towel<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.430> then<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.970> will<00:04:09.090> work<00:04:09.890> and

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
put a towel and then it will work and

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.100
