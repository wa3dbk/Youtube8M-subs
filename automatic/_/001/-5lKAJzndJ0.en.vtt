00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
to high school so far uh well it's

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.980 
to high school so far uh well it's
definitely<00:02:07.090> different<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.600> mean<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:07.930> a

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
definitely different I mean it's a

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.719 
definitely different I mean it's a
transition<00:02:08.560> like<00:02:08.590> living<00:02:09.160> on<00:02:09.250> your<00:02:09.280> own<00:02:09.429> for

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
transition like living on your own for

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.449 
transition like living on your own for
the<00:02:09.759> first<00:02:10.000> time<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.950> know<00:02:12.069> you're<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.340> lot

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
the first time and you know you're a lot

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.190 
the first time and you know you're a lot
more<00:02:12.610> independent<00:02:12.790> but<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.480> think<00:02:13.959> it'll<00:02:14.050> be

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
more independent but I think it'll be

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.020 
more independent but I think it'll be
hopefully<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.010> smooth<00:02:15.310> transition<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.970> know
