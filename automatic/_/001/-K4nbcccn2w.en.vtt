00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.969
 orso and a little piece of saffron is the 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:37.050
 saffron

 a lemon two cups of chicken broth and 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.400
 oil ok the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.400
 is that we are going to put the chicken broth 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.230
 and we're going to put it, let's learn to 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:59.300
 more or less high not very high 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.210
 let's put it more a little bit of 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.670
 saffron and we are going to cover what we are going to leave 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.430

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.430
 a slight boil and that we are going to add 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.020

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.020
 with day we are going to add the fat 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.350
 since this is how we are going to put a 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.010
 little salt because she of the broth of 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.720
 chicken already has salt 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.720
 and we will lower it a little 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.000
 and we're going to put what is pasta 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.240
 we will move 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.040
 and here we are going to leave you as a being 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.540
 seen is a slight boil I'm going to put 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.970
 here as in 4 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.580
 there is more or less it is not necessary that 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.010
 the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.230
 do not cover it but if you want you can cover it 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.930
 What he is wearing is made of him 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.530
 then eight or ten minutes 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.020
 I'm going to leave it for 10 minutes 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.860
 back we will move it not 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.390
 constantly but now and then 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.390
 you will see it when the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.190
 back is already tender that is not very 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.830
 hard depends on you as you like 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.030
 but they have to be for stern and tone 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.450
 and the water is going to be consumed 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.010
 obviously 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.459

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.160

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.930
 evaporate well in the color 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.969
