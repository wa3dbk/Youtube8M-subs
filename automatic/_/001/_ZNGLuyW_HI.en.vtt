the LG slimline Scarlett also has a new

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.569 
the LG slimline Scarlett also has a new
feature<00:00:50.870> added<00:00:51.140> called<00:00:51.559> intelligent<00:00:51.890> sensor

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
feature added called intelligent sensor

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.719 
feature added called intelligent sensor
now<00:00:53.300> this<00:00:53.449> is<00:00:53.510> designed<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.679> optimize<00:00:54.949> viewing

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
now this is designed to optimize viewing

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.059 
now this is designed to optimize viewing
conditions<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.479> reduce<00:00:57.289> power<00:00:57.559> consumption

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:58.069 
conditions and reduce power consumption

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:59.770 
conditions and reduce power consumption
as<00:00:58.309> well<00:00:58.339> and<00:00:58.729> the<00:00:59.089> way<00:00:59.210> that<00:00:59.359> it<00:00:59.479> works<00:00:59.600> is

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
as well and the way that it works is

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.160 
as well and the way that it works is
this<00:01:00.429> to<00:01:01.429> turn<00:01:01.609> on<00:01:01.789> intelligent<00:01:02.300> sensor<00:01:02.659> we

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
this to turn on intelligent sensor we

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.760 
this to turn on intelligent sensor we
have<00:01:03.289> to<00:01:03.409> go<00:01:03.499> to<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.739> picture<00:01:04.040> menu<00:01:05.590> from<00:01:06.590> the

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
b2 and a v1 but really what does all

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.219 
b2 and a v1 but really what does all
this<00:06:00.400> mean<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:00.879> it<00:06:01.240> can<00:06:01.419> get<00:06:01.539> quite<00:06:01.659> confusing

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
this mean and it can get quite confusing

this mean and it can get quite confusing
so<00:06:03.129> we<00:06:03.430> have<00:06:03.520> added<00:06:03.759> input<00:06:04.389> labeling<00:06:04.839> by

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:05.439 
so we have added input labeling by

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:07.709
