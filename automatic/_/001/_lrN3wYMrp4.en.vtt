00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
hi there I meant from pc tengas and i

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.230 
hi there I meant from pc tengas and i
want<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.080> talk<00:00:04.259> about<00:00:04.290> pcs<00:00:04.980> there<00:00:05.970> are<00:00:06.060> many

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
want to talk about pcs there are many

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.849 
want to talk about pcs there are many
people<00:00:06.600> have<00:00:06.750> confused<00:00:06.930> bates<00:00:07.319> interior<00:00:07.710> but

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
people have confused bates interior but

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.339 
people have confused bates interior but
it's<00:00:08.429> actually<00:00:08.550> very<00:00:08.760> simple<00:00:09.150> but<00:00:10.050> check<00:00:10.320> it

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
it's actually very simple but check it

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.320 
it's actually very simple but check it
out<00:00:16.190> okay<00:00:17.190> now<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.789> case<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.000> open

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
out okay now that the case is open

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.980 
out okay now that the case is open
you're<00:00:18.720> going<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.020> see<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.439> lot<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.800> wires<00:00:20.130> and

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
you're going to see a lot of wires and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.630 
you're going to see a lot of wires and
demand<00:00:21.990> aboard<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.800> motherboard<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.369> really

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
demand aboard the motherboard is really

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.060 
demand aboard the motherboard is really
simple<00:00:23.910> okay<00:00:24.420> from<00:00:25.230> top<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.470> bottom<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:26.039> can

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
simple okay from top to bottom you can

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.599 
simple okay from top to bottom you can
see<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.660> 4-pin<00:00:27.660> eps<00:00:28.109> collector<00:00:28.590> okay<00:00:29.429> this

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
see a 4-pin eps collector okay this

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.939 
see a 4-pin eps collector okay this
provides<00:00:30.000> power<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.480> cpu<00:00:30.990> which<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.679> under

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
provides power to the cpu which is under

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.420 
provides power to the cpu which is under
this<00:00:32.099> heatsink<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.059> fan<00:00:33.149> which<00:00:33.719> goes<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.140> off

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
this heatsink and fan which goes it off

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.709 
this heatsink and fan which goes it off
next<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.579> you're<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.120> ram<00:00:36.360> slots

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
next that you're going to see ram slots

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.500 
next that you're going to see ram slots
okay<00:00:37.290> i've<00:00:38.040> installed<00:00:38.460> two<00:00:38.730> sticks<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.120> ddr

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
okay i've installed two sticks of ddr

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.459 
okay i've installed two sticks of ddr
ram<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.520> here<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.390> /<00:00:43.079> connector

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
ram and here you can see the / connector

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.529 
ram and here you can see the / connector
for<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.680> motherboard<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.670> changes<00:00:45.329> from

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
for the motherboard this changes from

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.720 
for the motherboard this changes from
multiple<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> muddy<00:00:46.500> boot<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.039> either<00:00:47.190> 20

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
multiple to muddy boot so it's either 20

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.600 
multiple to muddy boot so it's either 20
or<00:00:47.760> 24<00:00:48.329> pin<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.710> next<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
or 24 pin and next that you're going to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.360 
or 24 pin and next that you're going to
see<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.969> bitch<00:00:51.149> keep<00:00:51.360> sink<00:00:51.690> under<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
see not bitch keep sink under that is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.260 
see not bitch keep sink under that is
the<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.180> cheap<00:00:54.649> this<00:00:55.649> connect<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> cpu

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the not bit cheap this connect the cpu

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.189 
the not bit cheap this connect the cpu
to<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> expansion<00:00:58.230> ports<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.850> next<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
to the expansion ports and next this is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.100 
to the expansion ports and next this is
the<00:01:01.680> South<00:01:02.280> Beach<00:01:02.520> heat<00:01:02.760> sink<00:01:03.059> again<00:01:03.629> salt

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the South Beach heat sink again salt

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.950 
the South Beach heat sink again salt
which<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> used<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.860> connect<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.790> hard<00:01:06.630> drives

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
which is used to connect the hard drives

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.700 
which is used to connect the hard drives
and<00:01:07.200> optical<00:01:07.619> drives<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.430> CPU<00:01:09.409> okay<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
and optical drives to the CPU okay and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.870 
and optical drives to the CPU okay and
here<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.210> expansion<00:01:12.750> ports<00:01:13.189> this<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
here are the expansion ports this is the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.990 
here are the expansion ports this is the
pci<00:01:15.390> express<00:01:16.049> 16x<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:17.549> graphics
