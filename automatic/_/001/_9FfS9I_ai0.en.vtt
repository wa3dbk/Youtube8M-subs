00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.759
 life 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.199

 Say hello and welcome to all 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 in this lapse she and to start a 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.060
 small very practical application 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.740
 to not have to worry about your 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.329
 smartphone when you're on your 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.160
 computer because if you have 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.380
 the habit of communicating a lot by 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.870
 texto you know how much he is not 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.610
 always easy to swing between his 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 computer keyboard and keyboard 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.789
 his smartphone especially when he is at 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.539
 bottom of his bag from his pocket and that we are 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.820
 currently working 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.379
 merrick more dumpling no more need of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.879
 leave your computer keyboard 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.440
 when you receive a message since 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.480
 this app allows you to just 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.640
 popping up on the screen of your pc or 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.379
 of your mac in a small condition 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.210
 all the same for that you will have to 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.920
 not only installed first that I 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.660
 want to be on your smartphone too 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.309
 installed an extension for your 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.320
 usual browser 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.280
 whether it's chrome firefox opera 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.409
 or safari 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.970
 or a little software still in beta 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.659
 on windows and that will soon be 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.280
 to arrive on bach 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.659
 here is the turn is not only 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.950
 you will receive your text messages on 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.939
 your computer but in addition to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.100
 email notifications 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.990
 and then a lot of other notification in 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.640
 the more you will be able to exchange 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 files between your different devices 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.229
 where you installed the app 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.579
 including between 2 smartphones a brief 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.470
 app who knows go very quickly 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.700
 indispensable and that not to spoil anything 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.570
 to pleasure is available for free 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 so on android and ios mac and pc but 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 also on windows phone thanks to push pin 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.119
 a small application compatible with 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.430
 chip goulette who will she cost you 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.320
 1 euro 49 an application that has 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.570
 besides not escaped either from enough 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.689
 rosiÃ¨res who on twitter told me 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.689
 strongly suggested stuffing done thing 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 well it's no secret to anyone 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.460
 to keep fit not only it 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.710
 must eat five fruits every day 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 and vegetables or more elsewhere but also 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.100
 practice at least 30 minutes of activity 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.270
 physical of the race margin the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.710
 bike is you who see 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.270
 apps to verify that you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.520
 move your body properly 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.770
 not missing there is only embarrassment 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.180
 of choice and yet here is one more 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.280
 except that it has the particularity 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.200
 to have been developed by google and so 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.720
 to be automatically associated with your 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.190
 google account + a detail will you tell me 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.870
 especially as compared to others 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.510
 google fit apps is for the least 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.070
 minimalist but less precisely 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.630
 I liked this app 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.400
 only added a quick glance 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.500
 on it just to know the number of 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.720
 not done in the day compared to 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.100
 a goal set by the rain then to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.690
 know all the same this goal you 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.670
 can change it at any time in you 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.620
 making in google settings 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.900
 made this one by default to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.150
 an hour of free daily walking to 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.460
 you then to decrease it finally this is 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.320
 not very reasonable or increase it 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.720
 if you have free time to you 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.700
 also add other activities 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.630
 physical as for example the race to 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.160
 foot or bike 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.840
 and then also to record each 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.150
 day your point in order to follow his 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.650
 evolution over time to finally know 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.910
 google feet can also monitor 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.860
 your heart rate as long as you 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.380
 be equipped with a watch connected under 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.330
 android or and has a monitor of 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.890
 heart rate obviously and 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.440
 it's all free and available 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.120
 only for the moment on android 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.950
 iphone and windows phone can 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.360
 return to the dressing room get dressed or 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.360
 to use another app 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.920
 good then you got it or not this 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.300
 invitation are you part of these 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.190
 happy elected officials who can use the 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.720
 new google mail i want 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.000
 talk you probably understood it from 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.950
 inbox good if you still do not have 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.690
 received your invitation a little patience 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.129
 this should not be long in 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.690
 Waiting I propose to come back on 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.670
 what this new app will change 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.110
 in your way of managing your mails because 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.849
 everything does not fit in its interface 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.470
 refined that will integrate perfectly with 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.580
 the new version of android lollipop 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.680
 who should fall tonight 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.090
 no he's boxing is a clever mix of 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.470
 several functions in this case a 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.180
 messaging of course but also a kind 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.430
 a task manager 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.470
 so when you receive an email with 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.120
 in box you can so slip 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.920
 of finger put it on hold at a 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.930
 time when a given day for it 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.420
 will reappear automatically at this time 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.860
 there as a reminder or pin it for 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.030
 mark it as very important 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.890
 all the messages pinned being 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.400
 grouped in a second box of 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.019
 reception 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.359
 it's stupid but it's rather 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.039
 practice and then especially a box will you 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.570
 help to clean up your box 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.340
 main but for that you go 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.120
 having to make a habit of dealing 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.600
 each of your messages by classifying them 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.520
 systematically in one of the 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.410
 categories offered by inbox voyage un 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.139
 chat finance social networks forums 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.150
 unimportant promotion or else in 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.229
 another you will have created you 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.060
 will see that after a while 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.280
 you will not even need to 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.320
 specify at a box or put away your mails 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.389
 application will do it automatically for 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.800
 what you do not find in 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.389
 your inbox that the 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.870
 messages that are really worth it 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.760
 look 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.169
 that's it if you do not have 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.120
 still dean boxing i remind you that 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.660
 to get an invitation there you 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.400
 Just send an email to inbox at 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.810
 google.com and we love it in nothing 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.760
 prevents you from downloading the app that 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.000
 is free on android as on 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.000
 iphone 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.999
 go to finish a nice little game 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:11.330
 which was offered to me on twitter by 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:13.099
 alexis of cohade heap this is tiny 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.449
 stryker a simple game but 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.219
 dreadfully effective you go 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.149
 have to prove your worth as 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.189
 scorer 

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:20.749
 So here you are in front of the goals and 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.249
 guards changed you from a slip of 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:23.659
 fingers to find the guy for that 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:25.519
 your balloon enters the skylight 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.229
 easy at the beginning the game gets horny 

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:28.729
 quickly because of the displacements of the 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.830
 goalkeeper but also other players 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.179
 who stands before you he will have to 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.610
 as you learn to bring the ball 

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:36.769
 like a pro knowing that you do not have 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.989
 all your time every time you 

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:39.649
 must imperatively mark in the 

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:41.449
 allotted time 

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:43.369
 then certainly you have the right to 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.439
 go back to it several times but the 

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:46.999
 chrono continues to turn the goal 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:49.009
 this is the case to say it's time to get 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:50.689
 to make the biggest possible score in 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.459
 chaining a maximum of goals 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:54.529
 short I told you a game really 

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:56.929
 basic but I do not get tired 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.399
 thanks to Alexis for offering it to me 

00:05:56.929 --> 00:06:00.079
 and that's it for this week 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.249
 we find ourselves obviously Wednesday 

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:02.509
