00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.220
 ah 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.690
 i 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.430
 hello welcome to photography there is no more 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.990
 merik from barcelona to spain today os 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.450
 I will show what are the steps that 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.720
 I usually continue to touch up a 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.630
 feminine portrait you are going to see that I start 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.870
 with lightroom and to continue with the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.050
 edit step to photoshop cs so 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.640
 come let's go 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.540
 this is the image originally taken 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:49.370
 in camera we have already imported to 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.620
 lightroom some clipping to frame 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.690
 better the image and then as you see I do 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.690
 some usual adjustments 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.910
 with it there are some minimal adjustments 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.949
 including for example the reduction of 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.390
 noise because it has an iso 400 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.399
 and also a bit of a vignette for 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.399
 darken the edges a little bit 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.170
 corrected a little the temperature and in 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.730
 Finally, once this is done, what I do is 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.310
 edited the image in photoshop no button 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.570
 right from the image and avoid and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.560
 edit in photoshop 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.560
 and in photoshop 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.090
 you will see that I do some some steps 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.049
 basic 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.390
 The first thing that I concentrate on is 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.890
 correct imperfections that can 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.430
 have the skin 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.760
 if you see here there is a 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.630
 the model has some small 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.960
 imperfections but what good for the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.960
 retouch 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.710
 beauty or retouching photo portrait 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.710
 feminine then good these little ones 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.080
 details are what usually mark 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.150
 the difference 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.980
 so as you can see I'm using the 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:16.819
 patch tool 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.700
 and I'm working on the points where 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.959
 I consider that imperfections are 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.959
 you can notice a little more 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.530
 you see the before and after before 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.879
 Now what I have done is I put 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.840
 I use the portal to correct what 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.200
 is the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.769
 skin softened in this way the skin and 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.610
 so it's still a little better what 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.830
 that with a mask removed let's say this 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.860
 softened from the part of the eyes and the 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.860
 mouth 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.709
 then I will do what is the dash 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.319
 unborn is to change a bit the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.540
 theme of the lights and shadows 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.950
 as you see here they did have a little 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.150
 shades 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.800
 do everything also the lights with two with 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.709
 two different layers for this can be 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.769
 use different techniques you can 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.410
 use for example from two layers 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.810
 different with curves or you can 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.140
 use something that is very typical too 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.920
 one layer 50% gray and then 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.640
 we use with the with the tool 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.030
 expose and exhibit 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.250
 with layers in white and then 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.720
 we use a blending mode that can 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.770
 be the one he writes the manifold to do 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.770
 you are these corrections 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.930
 As you can see now I have added a bit of 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.000
 simply contrast with a curve and 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.640
 I reduce the opacity a bit now I'm going 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.510
 to concentrate on the teeth for the subject 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.140
 of the teeth because there is a very technical 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.750
 simple that is I use a tone layer 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.730
 saturation and then indeed this already 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.510
 You have seen it in some previous video 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.370
 that is in this same channel 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.770
 I remove the yellow ones and in this way 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.510
 because the teeth are whiter in 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.630
 the eyes also used a technique that 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.090
 I had already explained on this same channel and 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.060
 as you see I give a touch to highlight 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.920
 a little bit the eyes I put the image to the hundred 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.000
 per hundred to be able to visualize 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.890
 correctly and see what 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.680
 the challenge that we do not get too much 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.960
 exaggerated now in my hair I give it a 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.030
 little illumination because this you already know 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.790
 with curves also and with one with one 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.700
 mask 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.840
 so that the subject of the 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.840
 of the hair 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.949
 now I use a black and white layer 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.840
 to give a little bit to add a little 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.840
 contrast to the image 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:23.260
 I also use selective correction 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.580
 with different modifying the 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.800
 different sliders I use some 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.080
 layer mask so you do not 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.180
 modify the parts that I do not have 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.669
 interesting then I concentrate on creating 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.990
 some a few vignettes so much a vignette of 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.370
 blur as a vignette also of 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.470
 gradient at the edges of the image 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.260
 so that the viewer who looks at the photo 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.350
 concentrate a little more on the model 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.210
 As you can see here , these are blurred 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.240
 edges of the jacket and the edges of the 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.840
 image and also darken a 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.300
 little more then he applied some textures 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.800
 I applied a couple of textures to 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.260
 give a touch of a finish a little more 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.050
 artistic and also used some 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.620
 layer masks so that this texture 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.160
 not in the 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:19.340
 on the skin or on the model where it is 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.190
 way the background takes these textures 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.680
 the model shows is a bit like 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.380
 one of the textures clarifies a lot the 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.500
 then good image used again 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.700
 curves to adjust the tone that I give 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.070
 I want to give the image 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.840
 finally in this area that you see that 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.220
 it's very bright as it bothers me 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.530
 little and I think it can distract the 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.750
 attention then again also with 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.270
 some with curves and mask the 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.780
 rest of the image that I do not 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.120
 interest 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:54.740
 finally you can see how our 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:58.090
 image before retouching and once 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.090
 finished the photo retouching 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:05.140
 well that 's all if you think this 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:10.420
 video tutorial has been useful 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:10.420
