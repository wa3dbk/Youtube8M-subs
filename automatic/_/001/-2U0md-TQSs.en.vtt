there will be changes I don't know if I

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
have an exact number yet we'll need to

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.530 
have an exact number yet we'll need to
see<00:00:10.139> how<00:00:10.260> some<00:00:10.500> guys<00:00:10.650> feel<00:00:10.920> today<00:00:11.419> but<00:00:12.419> all

see how some guys feel today but all

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.060 
see how some guys feel today but all
along<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.650> looked<00:00:14.039> at<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:15.860> camp<00:00:16.860> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
along we we looked at this camp and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.769 
along we we looked at this camp and
these<00:00:17.520> two<00:00:17.700> games<00:00:19.039> as<00:00:20.039> an<00:00:20.220> opportunity<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.119> see

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
these two games as an opportunity to see

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.529 
these two games as an opportunity to see
some<00:00:21.810> different<00:00:22.289> players<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.710> well<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.539> now

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
some different players as well so now

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.060 
some different players as well so now
obviously<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.170> other<00:00:25.289> day<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.650> had<00:00:25.679> a<00:00:25.830> chance

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
obviously the other day we had a chance

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.419 
obviously the other day we had a chance
in<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> second<00:00:26.670> half<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.980> Juan<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.250> Timmy

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
in the second half to see Juan and Timmy

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.630 
in the second half to see Juan and Timmy
and<00:00:29.759> so<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> good<00:00:31.289> thing<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:31.859> there's

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and so that was a good thing but there's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.930 
and so that was a good thing but there's
some<00:00:32.759> others<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.330> so<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.780> think

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
some others and so you know I I think

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.369 
some others and so you know I I think
both<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.090> terms<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.539> starting<00:00:39.899> lineup<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
both in terms of the starting lineup and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.740 
both in terms of the starting lineup and
then<00:00:40.469> possibly<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.730> way<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.059> choose<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.300> sub

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
then possibly the way we choose to sub

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.930 
then possibly the way we choose to sub
we<00:00:43.079> only<00:00:43.230> use<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> other<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.579> other<00:00:44.610> night

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
we only use to the other the other night

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.260 
we only use to the other the other night
because<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.390> felt<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.590> was<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> big<00:00:47.760> game<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
because we felt that was a big game and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
because we felt that was a big game and
that<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.960> group<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.350> second<00:00:49.739> half<00:00:49.859> was

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
that the group in the second half was

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
that the group in the second half was
responding<00:00:50.609> well<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.840> other

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
responding well but I think in other

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.270 
responding well but I think in other
ways<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.620> game<00:00:52.800> it'll<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.160> very

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
ways for this game it'll be very

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.779 
ways for this game it'll be very
different<00:00:54.050> I<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.070> most<00:00:56.219> important

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
different I think the most important

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.250 
different I think the most important
thing<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:58.879> these<00:00:59.879> fixtures<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.930> this

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
thing for these fixtures is this

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.770 
thing for these fixtures is this
replicates<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.090> qualifying<00:01:03.090> looks<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
replicates what qualifying looks like a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.570 
replicates what qualifying looks like a
lot<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> times<00:01:04.650> where<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> play<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> very

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
lot of times where you play a very

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.220 
lot of times where you play a very
important<00:01:06.060> game<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.510> quickly<00:01:06.870> you<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
important game and quickly you have to

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.219 
important game and quickly you have to
turn<00:01:07.380> around<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.390> mentally<00:01:09.390> emotionally<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
turn around and mentally emotionally and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.179 
turn around and mentally emotionally and
physically<00:01:10.710> recover<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.869> good

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
physically recover so this is a good

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.600 
physically recover so this is a good
exercise<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.759> way<00:01:16.040> from<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> Argentine

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
exercise in that way from the Argentine

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.440 
exercise in that way from the Argentine
game<00:01:19.009> every<00:01:20.009> game<00:01:20.189> looks<00:01:20.430> different<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:20.970> when

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
game every game looks different and when

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.050 
game every game looks different and when
you<00:01:21.570> play<00:01:21.950> Argentina<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.130> Brazil<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.549> Spain

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
you play Argentina or Brazil or Spain

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.999 
you play Argentina or Brazil or Spain
it's<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.930> look<00:01:25.079> different<00:01:25.110> than<00:01:25.619> when

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
it's going to look different than when

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's going to look different than when
you<00:01:26.100> play<00:01:26.280> most<00:01:26.490> teams<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> world<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.509> we

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you play most teams in the world so we

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.490 
you play most teams in the world so we
understand<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:29.540> we<00:01:30.540> felt<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.320> got

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
understand that we felt like we got

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.929 
understand that we felt like we got
better<00:01:33.740> from<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> first<00:01:35.130> half<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> second

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
better from the first half to the second

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.850 
better from the first half to the second
half<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.210> got<00:01:36.390> better<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:38.280> think<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.210> all

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
half we got better and I think we all

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
half we got better and I think we all
know<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.329> we<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> better<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:44.549> longer

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
know that we can be a better for longer

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
know that we can be a better for longer
stretches<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> game<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.079> that'll

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
stretches of the game and that'll

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.010 
stretches of the game and that'll
certainly<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:47.040> an<00:01:47.130> emphasis<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.020> we're

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
certainly be an emphasis and we're

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.010 
certainly be an emphasis and we're
playing<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.619> team<00:01:50.299> that's<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.390> very<00:01:51.600> good<00:01:51.780> team<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
playing a team that's a very good team a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.690 
playing a team that's a very good team a
team<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.590> came<00:01:53.369> off<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:54.049> good<00:01:55.049> world<00:01:55.290> cup

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
team that came off a good world cup

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.370 
team that came off a good world cup
performance<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> be

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
performance and we know it's going to be

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.340 
performance and we know it's going to be
a<00:01:58.409> hard<00:01:58.649> game<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.310> um<00:01:59.780> we'd<00:02:00.780> certainly<00:02:01.049> need

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
a hard game but um we'd certainly need

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.800 
a hard game but um we'd certainly need
to<00:02:01.439> improve<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.729> Saturday<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.299> understand

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
to improve on on Saturday we understand

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.830 
to improve on on Saturday we understand
that
