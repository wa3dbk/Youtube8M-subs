00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.400
 study is that this car really does 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.660
 more little the whole world many others and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.980
 return with subscribers like this one well 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.139
 we find the kind of which reid 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.120
 exaggerated and a well right I shit on 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.770
 everything in which you have to go ascending 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.500
 little by little as you go when the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.170
 Guardrail somewhat cured him but 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.070
 well I think we can get this 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.070
 this is this platform 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.929
 we're really still a little bit 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.929
 complicated to see vale 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.630
 well we have, we have what we have 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.240

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.820
 Godmother grinding guys is pretty 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.830
 cool eye that nailed her nailed her nailed 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.390
 the nailed more line more line that is to say 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.760
 can make a more perfect fall uncle 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.280
 I think it's not good 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.200
 pretty short but it's still 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.200
 I recommend you to try the most beautiful 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.510
 writers who have gone on tour 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.490
 afternoon twist late twist late kid tour 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.110
 later valeria on subscribers has 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.520
 subscribed boy also head that you 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.900
 ask me to catch you, okay, come on let's go, let's go 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.479
 for the moment behind I do not have 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.100
 nobody is worth every one take the curves like 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.600
 xl for that video and labor treaty 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.790
 you can take me a whole is that with 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.650
 It seems that he is carrying a stick again 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.450
 load is unfortunate said it is 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.130
 unfortunate but I mean seriously in this is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.720
 sorry for the jump for the lady 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.220
 take care of the kingdom of pine the lady is worth and 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.260
 so try to get me to run two 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.640
 wheels on top of the tubes I love 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.990
 but when it touches this it was as if 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.380
 double once 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.480
 I like ballet cells and they me 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.410
 cago 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.390
 We are here, there is no need to spill. 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.770
 accelerate bit by bit so I say 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.450
 when I 'm back trapped by 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.280
 example a mountain to which you can not 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.360
 upload some of it do not accelerate high 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.770
 thinking I told him from concept of 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.270
 car supplies rapa and understand its 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.070
 once I had to press the state a 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.180
 little by little and you will see how 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.220
 the car is really picking up power 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.440
 an advice that few people will know true 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.340
 so let's continue giving them and this 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.340
 it goes from here 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.440
 each one front as well was in the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.390
 forgetfulness indeed effectively follows the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.520
 I think two years we adhere to the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.650
 sectors is a little bit off 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.530
 rhythm of things as they are ok let's go 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.510
 we are missing 4 control dot four 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.340
 control points and this race will be 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.340
 more I was the one that everything is worth 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.769
 go car with the caught let's go 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.019
 yes yes 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:10.069
 interesting site and champions 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.069
 the principle above all 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720
 and
