column not only will go up and down but

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.920 
column not only will go up and down but
it<00:00:51.070> will<00:00:51.159> come<00:00:51.400> out<00:00:51.430> in<00:00:51.549> an<00:00:51.790> angle<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.600> even<00:00:52.839> go

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
it will come out in an angle and even go

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.320 
it will come out in an angle and even go
/<00:00:53.110> in<00:00:53.170> particular<00:00:53.409> to<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:53.949> floor<00:00:54.250> it's<00:00:54.909> a<00:00:55.089> nice

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
/ in particular to the floor it's a nice

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.410

you create sharper images better lit
images<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:04.330> more<00:01:04.960> consistent<00:01:05.439> images<00:01:06.010> I've

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
images and more consistent images I've

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.090 
images and more consistent images I've
created<00:01:07.270> some<00:01:07.540> samples<00:01:07.960> for<00:01:08.140> you<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:08.920> let's

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100

sharper images this image is blurry due
to<00:01:21.490> camera<00:01:21.880> shake<00:01:22.120> because<00:01:22.900> it's<00:01:23.080> not<00:01:23.230> on<00:01:23.410> a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
to camera shake because it's not on a
