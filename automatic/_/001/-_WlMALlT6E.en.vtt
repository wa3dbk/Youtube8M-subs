latest cyclist who suffered a fatality
mayor<00:00:31.109> Johnson<00:00:31.499> that's<00:00:32.310> right<00:00:32.550> obviously<00:00:33.030> one

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
mayor Johnson that's right obviously one

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.619

cycling<00:00:34.140> fatality<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.949> one<00:00:35.340> too<00:00:35.640> many<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
cycling fatality is one too many but the

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.389 
cycling fatality is one too many but the
fact<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.680> numbers<00:00:38.010> certainly<00:00:38.190> this

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
fact is that the numbers certainly this

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.240 
fact is that the numbers certainly this
year<00:00:38.670> are<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.199> anything<00:00:40.199> out<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:41.070> of

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
year are not anything out of the out of

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.770 
year are not anything out of the out of
the<00:00:41.340> ordinary<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.820> think<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.359> second

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the ordinary I think this was the second

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.720 
the ordinary I think this was the second
fatality<00:00:43.199> this<00:00:44.100> year<00:00:44.160> were<00:00:44.489> now<00:00:45.829> ordinace<00:00:46.859> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
fatality this year were now ordinace and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.029 
fatality this year were now ordinace and
and<00:00:48.300> when<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.289> look<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> numbers<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and when you look at the numbers of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.939 
and when you look at the numbers of
deaths<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> roads<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.960> obviously<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.769> is

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
deaths on the roads the obviously one is

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.840 
deaths on the roads the obviously one is
is<00:00:53.160> too<00:00:53.519> many<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> won't<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.850> take

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
is too many but what I won't do is take

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.759 
is too many but what I won't do is take
measures<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.539> you're<00:00:57.629> gonna<00:00:57.769> drive

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
measures that I think you're gonna drive

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.529 
measures that I think you're gonna drive
cyclists<00:00:59.249> off<00:00:59.429> the<00:00:59.879> road<00:00:59.999> so<00:01:00.089> what<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.300> want<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
cyclists off the road so what we want to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.000 
cyclists off the road so what we want to
do<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.469> safer<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.300> that<00:01:03.300> means

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
do is make it safer and that means

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.429 
do is make it safer and that means
testing<00:01:05.010> investing<00:01:05.579> in<00:01:05.700> stuff<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.439> improves

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
testing investing in stuff that improves

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.230 
testing investing in stuff that improves
life<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.890> cyclists<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.579> motorists<00:01:09.030> yes

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
life for cyclists and for motorists yes

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.359 
life for cyclists and for motorists yes
investing<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> roundabouts<00:01:11.220> in

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
investing in the in the roundabouts in

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.710 
investing in the in the roundabouts in
the<00:01:11.460> signaling<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.420> also<00:01:14.479> training<00:01:15.479> people

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the signaling but also training people

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.350 
the signaling but also training people
particularly<00:01:16.710> bus<00:01:17.670> drivers<00:01:18.119> where<00:01:18.270> they

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
particularly bus drivers where they

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.969 
particularly bus drivers where they
could<00:01:18.479> actually<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.110> been<00:01:19.229> doing<00:01:19.380> much<00:01:19.710> much

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
could actually have been doing much much

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:20.840 
could actually have been doing much much
better<00:01:20.040> yes

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
better yes

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.069 
better yes
over<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> last<00:01:21.149> few<00:01:21.329> years<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.840> training

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
over the last few years but training

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.819 
over the last few years but training
lorry<00:01:22.470> drivers<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.040> well<00:01:24.350> next<00:01:25.350> time<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.619> hire

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
lorry drivers as well next time I hire

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.889 
lorry drivers as well next time I hire
my<00:01:26.130> Barclays<00:01:27.000> bite<00:01:27.240> which<00:01:27.479> are<00:01:27.630> commonly

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
my Barclays bite which are commonly

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.120 
my Barclays bite which are commonly
known<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.200> Boris<00:01:28.470> bike<00:01:28.680> shouldn't<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.009> be

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
known as Boris bike shouldn't I be

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.289 
known as Boris bike shouldn't I be
forced<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.399> have<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> helmet<00:01:29.700> no<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.969> don't<00:01:30.210> think

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
forced to have a helmet no I don't think

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.160 
forced to have a helmet no I don't think
so<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.899> think<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.170> evidence<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.399> in

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
so I think the evidence is that in

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.030 
so I think the evidence is that in
Australia<00:01:34.170> where<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.380> made<00:01:34.530> helmets

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
Australia where they made helmets

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.679 
Australia where they made helmets
mandatory<00:01:35.670> for<00:01:35.939> instance<00:01:36.299> actually<00:01:36.479> what

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
mandatory for instance actually what

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.080 
mandatory for instance actually what
that<00:01:36.810> led<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.409> decline<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.250> cycling

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that led to was a decline in cycling

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
that led to was a decline in cycling
overall<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.619> people<00:01:40.860> get

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
overall I think I know that people get

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.830 
overall I think I know that people get
very<00:01:41.100> very<00:01:41.640> worked<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.149> about<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.390> actually

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
very very worked up about this actually

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.830 
very very worked up about this actually
the<00:01:43.409> evidence<00:01:43.530> about<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.820> usefulness<00:01:45.360> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the evidence about the usefulness of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260 
the evidence about the usefulness of
cycle<00:01:46.110> helmets<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.340> mixed<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.969> I<00:01:48.030> do

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
cycle helmets is is is mixed I I do

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.789
