00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
a big long break from YouTube for

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.250 
a big long break from YouTube for
probably<00:00:41.610> about<00:00:41.730> six<00:00:42.270> or<00:00:42.420> seven<00:00:42.570> months<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
probably about six or seven months and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.340 
probably about six or seven months and
so<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:44.030> lot<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.180> viewers<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.809> fans<00:00:46.050> have

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.080 
so a lot of my viewers and fans have

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
gone inactive and so I figured it would

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.830 
to be made um and so I do think that
there's<00:01:56.100> money<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.490> made<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:57.149> remasters

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
there's money to be made with remasters

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.569 
there's money to be made with remasters
now<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.290> don't<00:01:58.649> know<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:58.860> they're<00:01:59.040> gonna<00:01:59.100> if

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
now I don't know if they're gonna if

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.580 
now I don't know if they're gonna if
this<00:01:59.880> would<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.329> separate<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.500> would

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this would be separate or if it would

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.340 
this would be separate or if it would
just<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.100> bundle<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.960> if<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.140> had<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
just be like a bundle but if I had to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.210 
just be like a bundle but if I had to
pick<00:02:04.469> maybe<00:02:05.689> one<00:02:06.689> or<00:02:06.810> two<00:02:06.840> call<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> duties

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
pick maybe one or two call of duties

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.740 
pick maybe one or two call of duties
that<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.399> think<00:02:08.640> would<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.879> remastered<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.629> would

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that I think would be remastered I would

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.930 
that I think would be remastered I would
probably<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> go<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.950> course<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
probably have to go with of course the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.760 
probably have to go with of course the
infamous<00:02:12.599> cod4

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
infamous cod4

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
infamous cod4
is<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.100> do<00:02:14.490> believe<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.060> one<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.330> greatest

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
is I do believe it's one of the greatest

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.920 
is I do believe it's one of the greatest
shooters<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.110> time<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.880> I'm<00:02:17.880> sure<00:02:18.570> some

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
shooters of all time and I'm sure some

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.300 
shooters of all time and I'm sure some
of<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.110> would<00:02:19.230> agree<00:02:19.380> with<00:02:19.500> me<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.890> and

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
of you would agree with me on that and

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.570 
of you would agree with me on that and
also<00:02:20.820> mw2<00:02:21.590> now<00:02:22.590> obviously<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:23.100> think<00:02:23.430> with

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
also mw2 now obviously I think with

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.790 
also mw2 now obviously I think with
three<00:02:23.790> masters<00:02:24.210> they<00:02:24.450> would<00:02:24.600> just<00:02:24.630> fix<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> up

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
three masters they would just fix it up

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.940 
three masters they would just fix it up
you<00:02:26.130> know<00:02:26.810> better<00:02:27.810> graphic<00:02:28.380> stuff<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.920> that

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
you know better graphic stuff like that

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.990 
you know better graphic stuff like that
fix<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.670> couple<00:02:29.790> problems<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.750> may<00:02:31.020> have<00:02:31.230> been

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
fix a couple problems that may have been

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.840 
fix a couple problems that may have been
issues<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.080> actual<00:02:34.470> games<00:02:34.830> now<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> know

setting yourself up for disappointment

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.950 
setting yourself up for disappointment
because<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.180> going<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.750> whole

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
because it's just going to be a whole

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.760 
because it's just going to be a whole
lot<00:02:51.990> of<00:02:52.410> quick<00:02:53.340> scoping<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.290> hacked<00:02:55.290> lobbies

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
lot of quick scoping and hacked lobbies

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.890 
lot of quick scoping and hacked lobbies
and<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:56.520> know<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.700> join<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.390> thinking<00:02:57.750> that

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
and you know you join in thinking that

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.260 
and you know you join in thinking that
you're<00:02:58.080> gonna<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.470> good<00:02:58.650> time<00:02:58.710> and<00:02:59.310> you

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
you're gonna have a good time and you

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.640 
you're gonna have a good time and you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
don't have a good time because the guy

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.120 
don't have a good time because the guy
on<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.830> enemy<00:03:02.010> team<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.750> running<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.770> sky

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
on the enemy team is running in the sky

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.970 
on the enemy team is running in the sky
and<00:03:06.470> quick<00:03:07.470> scoping<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.160> through<00:03:08.610> walls<00:03:09.000> and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
and quick scoping you through walls and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.130 
and quick scoping you through walls and
it's<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.190> not<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> good<00:03:11.460> thing<00:03:11.760> um<00:03:12.420> but<00:03:12.780> I

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
it's just not a good thing um but I

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.840 
it's just not a good thing um but I
think<00:03:13.710> that<00:03:13.740> there<00:03:13.980> could<00:03:14.160> be<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.310> remaster

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
think that there could be a remaster

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.460 
think that there could be a remaster
somewhere<00:03:15.210> at<00:03:15.780> least<00:03:15.960> those<00:03:16.110> are<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.320> two

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
somewhere at least those are the two

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.260 
somewhere at least those are the two
that<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.650> would<00:03:16.890> choose<00:03:17.070> but<00:03:17.850> maybe<00:03:18.030> there

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
that I would choose but maybe there

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.870 
that I would choose but maybe there
could<00:03:18.390> be<00:03:18.450> some<00:03:18.810> type<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.340> bundle<00:03:20.340> pack<00:03:20.580> or

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
could be some type of bundle pack or

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.240 
could be some type of bundle pack or
something<00:03:20.910> as<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.540> said<00:03:21.750> before<00:03:21.780> maybe<00:03:22.350> where

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
something as I said before maybe where

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.860 
something as I said before maybe where
you<00:03:23.340> just<00:03:23.550> remaster<00:03:24.120> all<00:03:24.300> of<00:03:24.480> them<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.720> just

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
you just remaster all of them and just

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.260 
you just remaster all of them and just
throw<00:03:25.050> them<00:03:25.110> all<00:03:25.290> into<00:03:25.410> one<00:03:26.030> however<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.120> think

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
throw them all into one however I think

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.640 
throw them all into one however I think
there<00:03:27.690> would<00:03:27.810> need<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:27.990> be<00:03:28.110> some<00:03:28.380> type<00:03:28.410> of

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
there would need to be some type of

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.490 
there would need to be some type of
partnership<00:03:29.070> deal<00:03:29.400> because<00:03:30.140> call<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.230> duty<00:03:31.440> is

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
partnership deal because call of duty is

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.840 
partnership deal because call of duty is
made<00:03:31.650> by<00:03:31.770> three<00:03:32.010> different<00:03:32.130> companies<00:03:32.670> now

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
made by three different companies now

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.120 
made by three different companies now
and<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.209> got<00:03:33.360> treyarch<00:03:33.890> sledgehammer<00:03:34.890> and

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
and so you got treyarch sledgehammer and

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.590 
and so you got treyarch sledgehammer and
infinity<00:03:35.640> ward<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.150> think<00:03:36.300> if<00:03:36.540> you

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
infinity ward and so I think if you

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.210 
infinity ward and so I think if you
wanted<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.930> do<00:03:37.020> a<00:03:37.050> bundle<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.560> all<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.860> them<00:03:38.040> you

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
wanted to do a bundle of all of them you

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.250 
wanted to do a bundle of all of them you
have<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.459> get<00:03:38.730> all<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:38.970> them<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.240> on<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.570> maybe

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
have to get all of them in on it maybe

and if it's going to happen I do see it
happening<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.720> next<00:03:57.810> couple<00:03:58.050> of<00:03:58.170> years
