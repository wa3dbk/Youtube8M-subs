00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
first summer with short hair since I was

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.550 
first summer with short hair since I was
really<00:02:59.489> little<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.180> we're<00:03:00.989> gonna<00:03:01.079> see<00:03:01.349> how<00:03:01.530> I

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
really little so we're gonna see how I

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.110 
really little so we're gonna see how I
where<00:03:01.889> I<00:03:01.920> think<00:03:02.310> I'll<00:03:02.489> probably<00:03:02.670> just<00:03:02.819> wear<00:03:03.030> it

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
where I think I'll probably just wear it

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.660 
where I think I'll probably just wear it
like<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.269> like<00:03:03.689> down<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.230> know<00:03:04.430> simple<00:03:05.430> but

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
like this like down you know simple but

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.390 
like this like down you know simple but
usually<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.420> just<00:03:07.109> let<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.769> do<00:03:08.010> whatever<00:03:08.189> it

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
usually I just let it do whatever it

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.270 
usually I just let it do whatever it
once<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.599> don't<00:03:09.900> never<00:03:10.230> cup<00:03:10.590> never<00:03:11.010> colored

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
once and I don't never cup never colored

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.759 
once and I don't never cup never colored
or<00:03:11.549> done<00:03:12.359> anything<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.780> my<00:03:12.870> hair<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.409> that

or done anything to my hair and that

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.240 
or done anything to my hair and that
sort<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.579> probably<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:15.420> normal<00:03:16.250> eight

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
