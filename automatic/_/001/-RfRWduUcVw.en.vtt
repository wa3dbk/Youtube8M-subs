Google made this awesome tool called

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.329 
Google made this awesome tool called
Google<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.090> go<00:01:03.300> look<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:04.339> there

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
Google so and just go look it up there

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.740 
Google so and just go look it up there
are<00:01:05.430> ways<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> improve<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:06.030> chances<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.720> a

are ways to improve your chances have a
full<00:01:06.990> party<00:01:07.229> helps<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> lot<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:08.189> since<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
full party helps a lot but since the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.980 
full party helps a lot but since the
game<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.760> old<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> takes<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.600> lot<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> time

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
game is old and it takes a lot of time

you're most likely getting so long like
I<00:01:12.270> think<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.799> guess<00:01:14.010> account<00:01:14.369> power

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
I think you can guess account power

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you better drop rates as well although

you better drop rates as well although
I've<00:01:24.509> read<00:01:24.780> pretty<00:01:25.290> much<00:01:25.350> anywhere<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.740> said

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040

if they did not notice an increase and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.760 
if they did not notice an increase and
drops<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:28.950> really<00:01:29.130> your<00:01:29.310> call<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.729> that

not do just one or the other really

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.200 
not do just one or the other really
you're<00:02:05.549> pretty<00:02:05.729> much<00:02:05.850> gonna<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.149> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
you're pretty much gonna do a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.280 
you're pretty much gonna do a
combination<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.780> both

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
combination of both

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.800 
combination of both
don't<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.520> pass<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> farming<00:02:09.330> due<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
don't do just pass a farming due to the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.550 
don't do just pass a farming due to the
fact<00:02:10.020> that

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
fact that

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.060 
fact that
if<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.400> me<00:02:12.550> your<00:02:12.940> system<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.420> all<00:02:13.600> night<00:02:14.070> the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
if you me your system on all night the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.010 
if you me your system on all night the
drop<00:02:15.280> rates<00:02:15.520> will<00:02:15.760> despawn<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.840> makes

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
drop rates will despawn and it makes

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.720 
drop rates will despawn and it makes
sense<00:02:17.230> because<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.650> math<00:02:17.890> normal<00:02:18.280> look<00:02:18.520> data

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
sense because the math normal look data

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.910 
sense because the math normal look data
at<00:02:18.880> one<00:02:19.030> time<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:20.350> know<00:02:20.440> similar<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
at one time you know similar to the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.560 
at one time you know similar to the
bullet<00:02:21.130> holes<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.760> maybe<00:02:22.000> first-person

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
bullet holes and maybe first-person

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.970 
bullet holes and maybe first-person
shooters<00:02:22.900> when<00:02:23.140> she<00:02:23.290> kill<00:02:23.410> all<00:02:23.560> those

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
shooters when she kill all those

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.700 
shooters when she kill all those
disappear<00:02:25.140> pointing<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.320> can<00:02:26.500> personally

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
disappear pointing I can personally

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.550 
disappear pointing I can personally
confirm<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.940> exploded<00:02:28.750> junk<00:02:29.050> from

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
confirm is that the exploded junk from

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.320 
confirm is that the exploded junk from
the<00:02:29.620> robot<00:02:30.220> setup<00:02:30.580> falling<00:02:30.850> on<00:02:30.940> top<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
the robot setup falling on top of the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.500 
the robot setup falling on top of the
loot<00:02:31.480> have<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.840> spawn<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.410> see<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.710> happen<00:02:33.100> so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
loot have to spawn that see it happen so

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.300 
loot have to spawn that see it happen so
just<00:02:34.510> watch<00:02:35.440> out<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.010> that's<00:02:36.160> why

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
just watch out for that so that's why
