00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.290
 today among other things in the counselor money 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.470
 Good day and welcome to the area 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.810
 Counselor money it is beautiful it is rare 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.240
 And besides, gold is the only safe 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.070
 since the beginning of the euro crisis think that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.570
 many went in the last weeks 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.190
 the gold price on the downhill 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.190
 many began to doubt 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.390
 Small investors like michael adelt appreciate 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.300
 the precious metal as a hedge against 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.850
 Crisis is just preparing for him 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.070
 a gold award significant headache 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.710
 historical crash leaves its 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.260
 traces 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.970
 what had happened on the stock exchanges 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.160
 immense amounts of gold based on the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.360
 Securities sold in the equivalent of 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.399
 around 2300 tons of gold that equals 80 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.510
 percent of the annual production of all 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.659
 gold mines of the world 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.850
 the consequence in the middle of april broke the golden course 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.750
 within two days by almost 13 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.080
 percent 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.630
 all wins since february 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.310
 2011 targeted in recent days 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.850
 the course recovered a bit again 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:24.310
 an analysis mainly speculative 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.500
 was driven and therefore s2 one 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.090
 This should come in 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.549
 the coming days and weeks 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.300
 get up and therefore count 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.130
 We return with the rising prices 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.890
 even if there was a crash now 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.899
 Gold will never be worthless worldwide 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.050
 The central banks last year 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.630
 their stocks again by 535 tons 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.729
 increased and also in private 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.860
 plant should gold with a share of 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.700
 around 15 percent of total assets 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.830
 experts say contain the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.830
 current gold price we consider for 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.310
 cheap and advise our investors and 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.110
 Our customers are up to date with them 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.470
 to cover gold investment that is 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.310
 both physically and as well 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.459
 financial instruments rising 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.420
 Gold prices put buy at the end of the year 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.200
 Expect the rates of about 650 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.879
 dollar 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.920
 that's compared to today's level 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.160
 an increase of almost 15 percent 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.830
 Customers are already responding worldwide 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.980
 as is the gold merchant pro aurum 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.720
 the precious metal very much in demand we see 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.400
 a significant boost in the business in the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.870
 Last days we are talking about four 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.830
 to five weeks of normal sales 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.390
 being nine out of ten customers on the 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.769
 buyer side that is very 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.250
 remarkable still the last 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.960
 bigger gear 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.370
 Ultimately, there is a gold investment 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.600
 but a question of faith 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.810
 Everyone has to do it for themselves 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.750
 decide here three reasons pro and 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.420
 contra 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.430
 for gold it speaks is crisis-proof 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.610
 no risk of default and is not 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.190
 increased at speaks against it 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.500
 has no fixed income or interest it 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.570
 is subject to high price fluctuations and it 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.110
 But there are high trading margins 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.160
 even more 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.040
 important is the decision between 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.959
 gold to touch or on the stock exchange 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.209
 traded papers in gold 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.810
 invest 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.400
 If your gold is for the short term 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.739
 Thinking investors are suitable there 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.170
 Many stock market papers are essential 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.120
 have lower transaction costs than 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.180
 an investment in physical gold for 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.680
 gold for customers at least 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.780
 In the medium term, therefore, think in one 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.540
 period of at least three years 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.180
 It is an insurance the capital 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.500
 Michael Apelt has thought it over 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.540
 buy again 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.060
 but how much commission do they require 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.480
 he actually makes for adviser 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.069
 Money a sample at 3 sellers 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.489
 what kind of tension do you have between 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.560
 and selling physical gold for the 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.010
 Comparison asked for a fine ounce 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.090
 so good 31 grams at degussa is the 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.650
 margin at 2.8 percent 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.519
 next station the gold dealer pro 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.739
 aurum 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.570
 here the margin is 44 percent 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.329
 last station of the sample one 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.959
 Stadtsparkasse I was very much 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.599
 surprised 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.610
 the gap between buying and selling 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.500
 not at 63 percent 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.030
 and that's more than twice as 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.370
 by the way, at degussa the smaller the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.729
 The gold piece will fall the higher the 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.160
 Trading margins off at a 1 gram 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.160
 piece for example had degussa at 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.410
 a span of on our sample 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.270
 sale of about 20 percent 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:52.449
 at pro aurum it was around 25 percent 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.460
 and rounded at Sparkasse MÃ¼nchen 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.880
 52 percent more than half of the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.770
 worth more sense makes it so ounce 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.360
 or heavy goods to buy 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.880
 you can then in a locker 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.039
 At his bank store costs for it 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.770
 from and 30 euros per year 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.260
 who have direct access to his gold 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.970
 I also want to store it at home 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.970
 but then take good care of it
