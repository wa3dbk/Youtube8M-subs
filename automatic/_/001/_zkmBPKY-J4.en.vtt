00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
our one weapon is and let's get to it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.860 
our one weapon is and let's get to it
coming<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.370> at<00:01:02.489> number<00:01:02.579> five<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.180> got<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> time

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
coming in at number five we got the time

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.289 
coming in at number five we got the time
gun<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.799> time<00:01:05.040> gun<00:01:05.369> basically<00:01:05.580> slows

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
gun and the time gun basically slows

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.450 
gun and the time gun basically slows
down<00:01:06.990> zombies<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.979> when<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> slows<00:01:08.400> down

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
down zombies and when it slows down

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
down zombies and when it slows down
zombies<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.390> only<00:01:09.570> keeps<00:01:09.869> some<00:01:10.200> slowed<00:01:10.500> down

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
zombies it only keeps some slowed down

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.920 
zombies it only keeps some slowed down
for<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> little<00:01:11.520> while<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.150> while<00:01:12.750> they're

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
for a little while and while they're

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.630 
for a little while and while they're
slow<00:01:13.229> down<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.860> take<00:01:14.100> out<00:01:14.280> your<00:01:14.430> other

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
slow down you can take out your other

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.700 
slow down you can take out your other
weapons<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.080> pretty<00:01:16.290> much<00:01:16.380> do

the<00:01:33.810> zombies<00:01:34.200> fight<00:01:34.470> each<00:01:34.650> other<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.189> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the zombies fight each other so you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.859 
the zombies fight each other so you
shoot<00:01:35.579> all<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> zombies<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.630> fight

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
shoot all the zombies and they fight

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.120 
shoot all the zombies and they fight
each<00:01:37.049> other<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.560> while<00:01:37.710> they're<00:01:37.860> doing<00:01:37.979> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
each other and while they're doing that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.100 
each other and while they're doing that
you<00:01:38.369> could<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:39.060> things<00:01:39.240> because

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
you could go do other things because

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.390 
you could go do other things because
they're<00:01:40.439> distracted<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.189> they're<00:01:41.280> gonna

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
they're distracted and they're gonna

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
they're distracted and they're gonna
fight<00:01:41.640> each<00:01:41.790> other<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.329> while<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.869> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
fight each other for a while so that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.380 
fight each other for a while so that
would<00:01:43.140> probably<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.560> around<00:01:43.770> maybe<00:01:44.040> twenty

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
would probably go around maybe twenty

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.819 
would probably go around maybe twenty
seconds<00:01:45.390> 25<00:01:45.810> seconds<00:01:46.320> while<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.619> fight<00:01:46.799> each

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
seconds 25 seconds while they fight each

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.980 
seconds 25 seconds while they fight each
other<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.090> go<00:01:48.119> open<00:01:48.630> doors<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
other and you get to go open doors and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.990 
other and you get to go open doors and
do<00:01:49.290> whatever<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.710> need<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.159> get<00:01:50.729> away<00:01:50.850> from

the zombies and maybe while they're

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.410 
the zombies and maybe while they're
fighting<00:01:53.220> each<00:01:53.460> other<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.060> help<00:01:54.210> them

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
fighting each other you can help them

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.240 
fighting each other you can help them
kill<00:01:54.600> each<00:01:54.659> other<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.380> keep<00:01:55.950> shooting

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
number three we got the tornado gun and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.149 
number three we got the tornado gun and
this<00:02:02.159> gun<00:02:02.460> shoots<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.030> giant<00:02:03.689> tornado

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
this gun shoots a giant tornado

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.249 
this gun shoots a giant tornado
and<00:02:05.249> I<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.520> basically<00:02:06.179> swirls<00:02:06.630> around<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and I just basically swirls around and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.199 
and I just basically swirls around and
it<00:02:07.380> cuts<00:02:07.590> up<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.829> zombies<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.640> they're<00:02:08.940> just

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
it cuts up the zombies and they're just

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.479 
it cuts up the zombies and they're just
spinned<00:02:09.479> around<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:11.160> hope<00:02:11.310> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
spinned around it and I really hope that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.860 
spinned around it and I really hope that
it's<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.940> really<00:02:12.150> gruesome<00:02:12.510> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it's going to be really gruesome and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.059 
it's going to be really gruesome and
their<00:02:12.989> body<00:02:13.260> parts<00:02:13.379> are<00:02:13.680> gonna<00:02:13.799> fly

their body parts are gonna fly

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.070 
their body parts are gonna fly
everywhere<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.629> sounds

everywhere and just that that sounds

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.830 
everywhere and just that that sounds

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
that's kind of an obvious one we haven't

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.710 
that's kind of an obvious one we haven't
seen<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.739> any<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.549> past<00:02:23.790> iterations

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
of these zombies games so I would really

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.390 
of these zombies games so I would really
like<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.170> see<00:02:28.379> some<00:02:28.650> sort<00:02:28.799> of<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.980> giant<00:02:29.280> tornado

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
like to see some sort of a giant tornado

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.030 
like to see some sort of a giant tornado
and<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:29.940> Azam<00:02:30.780> bees<00:02:30.959> get<00:02:31.080> sucked<00:02:31.440> into<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and the Azam bees get sucked into it and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.390 
and the Azam bees get sucked into it and
they<00:02:32.099> all<00:02:32.310> die<00:02:32.519> but<00:02:33.060> that's<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:34.190> coming<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.280> at

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
they all die but that's it coming in at

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.309 
they all die but that's it coming in at
number<00:02:35.430> two<00:02:35.760> we<00:02:35.910> got<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.239> glove<00:02:36.569> gun<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.140> it

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
number two we got the glove gun and it

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.020 
number two we got the glove gun and it
launches<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.950> toward<00:02:38.190> zombies<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.849> they

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
launches you toward zombies and they

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.150 
launches you toward zombies and they
explode<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.750> impact<00:02:40.019> so<00:02:40.530> essentially<00:02:41.010> what

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
explode on impact so essentially what

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.550 
explode on impact so essentially what
happens<00:02:41.579> is<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:42.209> punch<00:02:42.450> them<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.349> whole

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
happens is you punch them and a whole

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.319 
happens is you punch them and a whole
bunch<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.950> zombies<00:02:44.160> die<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.970> front<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.269> you

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
bunch of zombies die in front of you

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.039 
bunch of zombies die in front of you
they<00:02:45.480> explode<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.730> pretty<00:02:48.209> damn<00:02:48.989> good

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
they explode that is a pretty damn good

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.900 
they explode that is a pretty damn good
weapon<00:02:49.799> in<00:02:49.920> my<00:02:50.069> opinion<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.579> will<00:02:50.730> definitely

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
weapon in my opinion I will definitely

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.759 
weapon in my opinion I will definitely
like<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.540> see<00:02:51.720> some<00:02:51.900> sort<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.200> like<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.349> glove

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
like to see some sort of like a glove

like to see some sort of like a glove
I'm<00:02:53.519> gun<00:02:54.180> because<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.629> know<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> lot<00:02:55.049> of

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
I'm gun because I know that a lot of

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.170 
I'm gun because I know that a lot of
people<00:02:55.319> want<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.430> definitely<00:02:56.910> think

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
people want that and I definitely think

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.839 
people want that and I definitely think
that<00:02:57.299> is<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:57.599> good<00:02:57.930> idea<00:02:58.280> just<00:02:59.280> having<00:02:59.730> them

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
that is a good idea just having them

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.599 
that is a good idea just having them
explode<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:01.079> it's<00:03:01.290> really<00:03:01.590> simple<00:03:01.859> yet

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
explode it's like it's really simple yet

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.880 
explode it's like it's really simple yet
really<00:03:03.000> fun<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.780> definitely<00:03:04.319> think<00:03:04.799> that

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
really fun and I definitely think that

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.009 
really fun and I definitely think that
they'd<00:03:05.099> say<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.030> very<00:03:06.269> good<00:03:06.480> idea<00:03:06.629> for

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
they'd say it's a very good idea for

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.660 
they'd say it's a very good idea for
them<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.260> implement<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.129> future<00:03:08.519> it's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
them to implement in the future it's

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.309 
them to implement in the future it's
kind<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:08.970> error<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.329> reminds<00:03:09.630> me<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:10.049> the

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
kind of error it reminds me of the

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.120 
kind of error it reminds me of the
Galvan<00:03:11.040> knuckles<00:03:11.400> but<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.150> really<00:03:13.130> more

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
Galvan knuckles but on a really more

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.860 
Galvan knuckles but on a really more
massive<00:03:14.670> scale<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:14.970> guess<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.480> could<00:03:15.510> say

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
massive scale I guess you could say

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.589 
massive scale I guess you could say
because<00:03:16.290> when<00:03:16.859> once<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.280> punch<00:03:17.519> them<00:03:17.880> they

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
because when once you punch them they

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.470 
because when once you punch them they
just<00:03:18.840> literally<00:03:19.349> explode<00:03:20.160> like<00:03:20.549> maybe<00:03:20.970> 10<00:03:21.299> of

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
just literally explode like maybe 10 of

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.170 
just literally explode like maybe 10 of
them<00:03:21.630> if<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.870> punch<00:03:22.139> into<00:03:22.440> one<00:03:23.040> group<00:03:23.970> of

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
them if you punch into one group of

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.809 
them if you punch into one group of
zombies<00:03:24.359> so<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.440> looks<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:26.489> sounds

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819
