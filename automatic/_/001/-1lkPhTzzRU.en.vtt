00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.149
 hello youtube friends I'm cristian 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.920
 from the hiding place of before and today they 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.969
 I bring a video of how to do the 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:16.850
 overclock of a graphics card r 7 260 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:20.030
 x this is a md and the one I have is the 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.200
 factory overclock version good the 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.060
 truth is that I had never wanted 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.840
 risk to overclock him from none 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.940
 of my components 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.510
 playing this game that the resident evil 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.310
 4 and ultimate hd I have a little left 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.540
 short and I'm also doing some 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.780
 videos so you can see them here in 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.940
 my channel 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.100
 and well I decided to make him a little 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.410
 Overclocking if I'm going to teach you how 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.780
 do what 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.950
 is done in the following way let's go 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.680
 to the 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.680
 m of catalysis control center 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.680
 well here as you can see now 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.900
 I'm here in the area where the 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.300
 overclock that are coming programs 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.340
 included in the graphics control of the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.470
 card but good if you do not know 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.239
 where is it open in this program to 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.880
 those with this same card are going 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.960
 here to performance and they're going to select 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.820
 this tab and here it will appear 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.720
 this same part 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.520
 How good is the activity of the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.679
 fpv the clock 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.329
 the memory clock of the energy that 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.120
 is currently using the 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.610
 temperature 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.610
 and the fan speed 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.920
 well here we have the following 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.590
 parameters these are the parameters 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.560
 default card 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.720
 says we have in clock speed 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.720
 of gpu we have a thousand 50 megahertz 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.409
 in memory speed 1500 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.869
 megahertz 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.909
 and well I manipulated this before so 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.030
 It should have another value for you but 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.730
 I left it at 65% control of the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.500
 fan 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.780
 good 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.330
 let's do the following to see 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.060
 that it is true that you can see cluck 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.270
 easily here we have the program 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.190
 gpu-z that measures our graphics card and 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.250
 all its values 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.000
 for example that tells us what 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.180
 we have the default of the club of the gpu in 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.490
 thousand 50 megahertz and up comes the same 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.560
 therefore, no 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.130
 modification and here to memory is what 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.000
 same we have 96 gigabyte bandwidth 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.860
 per second 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.860
 we have 128 bits 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.030
 and other texture filters and things for 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.280
 the style 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.890
 well let's start 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.549
 I gave myself the card 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.950
 with much 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.019
 configurations but at the highest it 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.170
 I free that there was and it turns off the pc well 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.760
 I do not recommend it but well we go 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.280
 to try it with the ones that were more 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.290
 stable for my pc at least 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.810
 let's start 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.150
 let's go up it gives little if 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.510
 you consider that these many are 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:21.420
 they leave it to the female we are going to put 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.420
 we're going to upload the gpu clock to 1100 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.370
 and memory 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.440
 to 1550 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.840
 we give in applying 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.190
 let's go to gpu-z to see what 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.190
 what if the changes were made 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.420
 here it tells us the gp or current is in a thousand 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.079
 110 megahertz and the default that the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.359
 factory was at 1050 and here we have 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:53.270
 changed the speed of memory 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:55.760
 also from 1500 to 1550 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.860
 and how can you remember the bandwidth 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.610
 that we had that we had before was 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.560
 96 gigabyte is now 99 points 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.450
 which is faster card 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.450
 very well let's continue with the process 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.760
 let's give it 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.650
 1150 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.970
 and here we are going to go up to 1600 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.530
 you can climb it of less clear 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.150
 to go testing and testing with a 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.040
 game 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.800
 to be 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.800
 much better your experience and you are not 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.990
 explain how to me 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.819
 because if I'm free that today he went to 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.940
 Fuck and I got really scared and I thought I 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:43.090
 there was 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.650
 burned the card so that's why I 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.820
 I recommend you to go little by little 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:52.190
 of 10 days if they want like this it is safer 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.770
 well now we have a bandwidth of 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.100
 102 guys how can you see us too 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.940
 has reported that the watch was changed here 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.290
 of the memory 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.290
 and the gpu clock 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.449
 The truth is that I have tried it on 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.840
 this configuration and it went to hell 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.780
 so I do not recommend it 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.860
 I had it here 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.440
 in 1300 and it's in 1800 and it was like 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.110
 I told them on the screen they are hydro more 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.290
 you lockers so do not do it 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.420
 and good for them to know as soon as I 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.490
 I have and it's stable 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.800
 stable stable that entered the games 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.090
 I 'm not free that you play pretty 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.720
 weather 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.540
 is the following 1200 configuration 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.240
 megahertz in the gpu and in the speed of 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.120
 the 1750 memory 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.310
 the fan speed the truth is 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.969
 that does not affect much only in that the 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.179
 card gets a little warmer 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:58.939
 but never exceeds 55 degrees 

00:05:56.179 --> 00:06:01.879
 celsio so in the problem but 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:06.559
 let's activate it again let's give it in a 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:09.589
 70% and we give you in applying that is the 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:11.869
 most acceptable setting that I have 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:15.620
 done that is pretty good it improves me 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:17.930
 quite the card 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.460
 and let's say it does not make a clock 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.040
 monstrous but if you will give them so 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.960
 less 20% more speed to your 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.960
 graphics card and all its game 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.840
 let's see here we're going to open up new 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.980
 programs 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.700
 and now 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.200
 as you see gives us 112 arrives of width of 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.890
 band 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.960
 we have 1200 in the clock of the gpu and 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.729
 1750 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.699
 in the memory clock 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.199
 good guys the truth is that they do not 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.059
 I can do a gameplay now because 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.710
 this damn program that I'm 

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:58.170
 using that you already get 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:01.500
 do not give me to make a gameplay 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:04.050
 while he recorded the screen but good 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.210
 if someone can please tell me how 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.950
 leave it in the comments 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.520
 Manito up if they liked manito down 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:14.100
 if not and I hope that they do not split my mother 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.420
 If you do not like them I hope they say no 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:20.569
 improve your tutorials or something like that but not 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.449
 crucify me please 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:26.599
 good friends, I hope you liked it 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:28.129
 this would be until a next occasion that 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:30.499
 I will delight you with my voice in my 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:33.580
 fierce gameplay you liked 

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:33.580
 see you later
