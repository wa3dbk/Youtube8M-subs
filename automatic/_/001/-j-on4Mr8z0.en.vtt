00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.460
 hi friends i'm fishing on foam 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.700
 I try to show this way of fishing 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.730
 to everyone that everyone knew about this method 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.510
 fishing that he is very effective 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.510
 not everyone appreciates him not everyone understands him 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.320
 the essence but liver go to the channel 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.240
 watch the video you will understand what you eat 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:47.120

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.170
 some city days

 twenty to thirty you can catch in 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.360
 Generally if the fish we have the price moves 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.180
 depending on the weather more movement 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.970
 fish more poklevok if you already 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.130

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.170
 already it obtained as both factory 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.869
 pulling out the water was warm he 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.170
 rested his drag he relied thomas 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:32.060
