say you get your knees like this

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.750 
say you get your knees like this
actually<00:00:39.930> once<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.350> push<00:00:40.829> your<00:00:41.040> legs<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
push them out so from the front you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.060 
push them out so from the front you
should<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.520> able<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.940> my<00:00:45.629> toes<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.590> my<00:00:46.649> feet

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
should be able to see my toes on my feet

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.310 
should be able to see my toes on my feet
so<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.370> I'll<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:48.899> my<00:00:49.079> ground

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
so what I'll do so I get down my ground

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
so what I'll do so I get down my ground
and<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.710> my<00:00:49.800> knees<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.190> now<00:00:50.730> push

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

and I'm on my knees like this now push
them<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.079> even<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> move<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.710> can

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
them out that can even be a move I can

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.610 
them out that can even be a move I can
go<00:00:53.010> pull<00:00:54.000> them<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.110> grab<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
go pull them out and I can grab and I

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.560 
go pull them out and I can grab and I
can<00:00:55.770> pull<00:00:56.039> them<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> concept

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
can pull them in so this is the concept

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.590 
can pull them in so this is the concept
a<00:00:57.809> cue<00:00:58.440> sometimes<00:00:58.949> I've<00:00:59.730> done<00:01:00.359> where<00:01:00.510> I'll

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
a cue sometimes I've done where I'll

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.290

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
all kind of way back in then my feet

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.039 
all kind of way back in then my feet
will<00:01:05.040> follow<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.939> also<00:01:06.060> use<00:01:06.360> kind<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
will follow you can also use kind of a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.050 
will follow you can also use kind of a
puppeting<00:01:07.409> concept<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.610> your<00:01:08.820> foot

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
puppeting concept to have your foot

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.030 
puppeting concept to have your foot
follow<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.600> hands<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.560> there's<00:01:10.710> lots<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
follow your hands so there's lots of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.230 
follow your hands so there's lots of
different<00:01:11.100> possibilities<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> use<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.850> feet

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240

when<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> bend<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:16.020> try<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> incorporate

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
when you bend out try to incorporate

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100 
when you bend out try to incorporate
that<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:18.030> dance<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.570> next<00:01:18.780> one's<00:01:18.960> kind

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that in your dance the next one's kind

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.170 
that in your dance the next one's kind
of<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.259> moving<00:01:19.710> piece<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.119> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
of a moving piece so this is going to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
of a moving piece so this is going to
use<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.570> sliding<00:01:22.020> ability<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.159> move

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
use some sliding ability to kind of move

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.070 
use some sliding ability to kind of move
as<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.700> back<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.090> forth<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:24.960> I'm

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
as you go back and forth and what I'm

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.350 
as you go back and forth and what I'm
doing<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.530> I'm<00:01:25.590> having<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.490> start<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
doing is I'm having my start with the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.810 
doing is I'm having my start with the
left<00:01:27.659> knee<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.020> goes<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.610> putting

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
left knee that goes out and I'm putting

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.340 
left knee that goes out and I'm putting
all<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> pressure<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.450> my<00:01:30.570> left<00:01:30.840> knee<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.229> my

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
all the pressure on my left knee so my

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.370 
all the pressure on my left knee so my
right<00:01:31.590> leg<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.070> go<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> obviously<00:01:34.259> this

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
right leg can go and so obviously this

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.830 
right leg can go and so obviously this
was<00:01:34.500> kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.220> silly<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.850> when<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
was kind of silly but when you do it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.200 
was kind of silly but when you do it
