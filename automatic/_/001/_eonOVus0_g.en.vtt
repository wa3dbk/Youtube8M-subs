00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.760 

since<00:07:01.550> gas<00:07:01.790> is<00:07:02.060> gonna<00:07:02.240> there<00:07:02.870> since

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
since gas is gonna there since

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.470 
since gas is gonna there since
hypothetically<00:07:04.460> gas<00:07:04.670> will<00:07:04.880> be<00:07:04.970> hard<00:07:05.180> to<00:07:05.300> find

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 
hypothetically gas will be hard to find

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:13.330 
hypothetically gas will be hard to find
and<00:07:06.380> shit<00:07:06.710> like<00:07:06.740> that

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:30.699 
but that's okay cuz this is just more

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:34.950 
but that's okay cuz this is just more

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 
reason to ride the bike around as if I

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.480 
reason to ride the bike around as if I
