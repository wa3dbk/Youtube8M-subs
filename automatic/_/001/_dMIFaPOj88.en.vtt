00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hi everyone, how are you? Let's record one more. 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.940
 little video here gives continuity to our 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.799
 sequence of videos is I will comment with 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.240
 you today about a doubt that 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.269
 The staff will email us here. 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.460
 and is one of our subscribers 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.619
 he asked the following in my case the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.230
 My little animal had diarrhea. 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.430
 even making that gradual change 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.320
 I believe that his maid must have 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.000
 given a higher quantity ratio in the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.769
 period he was not at home right and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.099
 ended up using the animal's gut 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.199
 So he's tell me what I'm going to give. 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.759
 for you about the case like this 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.980
 case of animal feces alone since 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.760
 that's a puppy stayed a little longer 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.829
 pasty is even rich day is a case 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.559
 simple as the one we already have 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.059
 science of what happened as he knows 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.670
 who was an employee who ended up giving 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.570
 reason is out of hours but in greater 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.719
 amount 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.250
 his little animal, we already have 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.020
 clarification of this fact the only thing 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.329
 that we can use is that in one case 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.789
 as this is a simpler case knowing 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.760
 that the series are not is not so 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.100
 liquid acese not with one has mucunÃ£ not 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.710
 it contains sanguine so it's a change 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.140
 physiological only by the exchange of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.030
 in the intestinal tract of that animal right by 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.530
 sudden exchange of food is over 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.880
 by dislodging this gastrointestinal tract 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.290
 of the animal 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.700
 then in case like this what people 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.159
 end up recommending is simply a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.780
 probiotic and finds in 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.710
 agricultural or even clinical 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.659
 veterinary right 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.780
 most of them are sold 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.000
 with her in a syringe neven a syringe 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.700
 and it already has recommendations for use 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.560
 How much dosage is this supposed to tell me? 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.140
 What generically for you is difficult 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.840
 speak a specific dose a standard for 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.909
 You guys, but it would be the most 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 simple that we can use is for 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.140
 people think this probiotic is 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.950
 comparing with humans is very 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.649
 similar to ours and he is not 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.170
 are simply it enhances microbiota 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.219
 in order to really 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.329
 absorption of your intestine is to 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.439
 intestinal flora to really 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.439
 to be able to convert 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.640
 then the nutrients of the ration is to be the 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.409
 simplest case 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.060
 Remembering of course I do not like to stay. 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.990
 passing medication passing prescriptions 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.430
 on here 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.440
 a video because we always need 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.620
 examine this animal in order to pass 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.600
 an answer is accurate for this 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.740
 animal but in a case like this that would be 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.120
 a simple case 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.010
 he asked me what he could 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.870
 do in a case he already knows 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.850
 exactly what happened then it would be 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.830
 this gives a probiotic for that animal 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.280
 with a period of at least five days 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.530
 huh 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.650
 in the case of a maximum of three days this 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.640
 animal does not notice no signs of 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.440
 improved huh 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.780
 light as soon as possible this animal 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.340
 to a veterinarian for evaluation 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.860
 why because you may have 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.360
 other possibilities for disease and which 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.260
 the great aggravation that we have 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.970
 when you understand that our 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.000
 animal without knowing exactly what is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.950
 happening to our animal, right? 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.990
 to chew some 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.540
 diseases, for example in the case of 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.300
 a puppy is not not call him 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.640
 whether or not this animal is vaccinated or not 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.510
 or the exact age of that animal only know that 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.820
 it's a puppy 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.610
 We do not know if this animal is still 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.980
 susceptible if it is already susceptible 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.540
 viral diseases for example do not know if 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.000
 he has already completed the entire 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.220
 vaccination of this animal, then in a case 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.380
 like that of chewing a chance 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.640
 this animal has some viral disease 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.710
 We work with somebody. 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.280
 problem or other medication 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.350
 simple and is thinking is that it is some 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.070
 quiet thing presented simply 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.620
 a change in reason but sometimes not 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.630
 sometimes and animal already manifests another 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.090
 of a viral disease and people with 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.800
 ends up losing this notion because people 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.640
 believe it was really a cause 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.900
 food exchange 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.180
 then this is one of the main points 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.160
 that the cable is not liking it to pass 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.980
 really indicate that in the videos 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.390
 because otherwise we end up masking the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.790
 symptoms that may become 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.590
 fundamentally close this 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.570
 diagnosis of some diseases that 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.550
 perhaps they could be more serious is 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.680
 So, a lot of criteria for us to go 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.300
 use this type of medication and / or 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.980
 any other type of medication that 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.800
 people to use because people are 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.570
 masking some of the symptoms of the disease 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.580
 this animal is likely to manifest and 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.470
 this is of course only veterinarian 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.450
 will be able to evaluate if the animal is 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.620
 with accuracy 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.540
 what is happening to him and what is happening 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.700
 really was this or not the parameters 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.530
 are all more likely to go 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.840
 also ask you to take a 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.490
 blood is to be sure exactly the 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.169
 what is going on with your brother in 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.450
 if the blood test does not give anything 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.490
 usual clinical evaluation with all 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.060
 normal parameters should really be 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.840
 only one change is from the gut of the 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.970
 animal response by the exchange is abrupt 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.040
 feed for example 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.590
 then in a case like this yes would be 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.930
 recommended a probiotic is not the 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.490
 My tip for you, a lot. 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.080
 criterion to use not only the 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.300
 probiotic like any other medication 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.979
 always if possible always looked for 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.110
 medical veterinary help 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.330
 Your reliable veterinarian is 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.800
 Okay so you can really be sure 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.450
 who is aware of what is 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.340
 Happening to the little animal, okay? 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.810
 More doubts people who are very 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.760
 happy for the answer that people 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.470
 has the channel then sends reply to 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.690
 People say and email us 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.810
 will respond as much as possible 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.400
 size 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.970
 Thank you for having assisted a young 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.970
 you liked
