00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.269
 today I want us to do a meditation or 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:10.510
 a reflection on in this case a 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:13.720
 fruit unites the cotton that I have here that 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.700
 is the subject of analyzing all things 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.550
 that we have at home all the things that 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.150
 we see in everyday life and things 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.419
 that the food we eat is treated 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.179
 to realize that everything in life 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:31.569
 It seems like a miracle, you do not have to look 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.760
 the divine or the magical 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:36.050
 we are walking to heaven waiting for 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.600
 lower UFOs 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.020
 I do not know looking at paranormal phenomena 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.960
 and those things the miracles the mysteries 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.960
 they are in our day to day and today I am going 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.070
 to explain how in this peach can 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.600
 be the whole universe this peach 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.480
 and this can help you to do 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.449
 any meditation reflection of when 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.000
 even give it importance when to 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.550
 the best we eat food that does not 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.440
 we just feed ourselves and that's it 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.619
 but serve us many times to 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.520
 meditate and reflect well then the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.009
 theme is that this peach for example 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.090
 someone has had to plant someone 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:24.860
 I plant the bone of a peach tree 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.729
 He puts it nursed him fed until 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.820
 this peach came out the peach tree 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.070
 possibly he has his years he has 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.289
 care a lot of people but at the same time 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.380
 that I could buy it in the store 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.239
 I would have to transport someone to that 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.030
 person has had like the 

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:46.270
 peasant I care 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.820
 has had it had to work from 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.790
 that learn to work from his trade 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.560
 to be able to transport this peach has 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.140
 there had to be a series of people 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.820
 who have created that company the same 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.830
 happens with the person who sold me this 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.500
 Peach has had since his family 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.740
 his offspring and others but 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.810
 interestingly if we analyze all those 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.750
 things that have made it possible that today 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.830
 I have a peach, possibly this 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.400
 whole universe because we go in parts 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.810
 the plant worth the peach has come out of 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.030
 a tree that tree has had to live 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.160
 his experiences is to say best 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.800
 moments of drought moments of 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.930
 flood diseases a whole series 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.420
 of things even as I have told you people 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.209
 who has been taking care of her but at the same time 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.910
 has had to feed then of 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.120
 minerals that are in the planet of 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.480
 sun that star that thanks to him we have 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.310
 the oxygen life of the air all those 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.430
 things are in essence 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.560
 peach and as I told you the life of 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.840
 many people but there we do not 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.120
 we are left if we look back 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.660
 example let's just put the case of 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.700
 peasant who cared for this peach not 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.500
 we are talking about the people who 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.769
 have sold the company that the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.569
 distributed of all those people who 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.640
 we are talking about that so that I 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.970
 You can eat this peach has been 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.970
 go through hundreds of people's lives 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.940
 of experiences and different people 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.110
 but let's just start from the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.110
 person who cared for the tree that person 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.660
 was born of someone from a couple 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.030
 possibly that couple found themselves 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.819
 the best by chance or did not fall in love 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.580
 or not worth it but they had that peasant 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.819
 but if we look at that peasant he could not 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.430
 to be alive could not have cared that 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.849
 peach tree if I had not had 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.920
 those parents who decided to have it or not 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.700
 or they just had it by accident 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.590
 or for other reasons but good 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.200
 the subject of a sexual act so that 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.050
 that peasant was born and at the same time educate 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.120
 him to direct his life in such 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.730
 way I was interested in the 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.550
 theme of agriculture on the subject of 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.920
 field but if we look more so many those 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.830
 parents who had the farmer have 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.739
 come from other parents and so we can 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.780
 look backwards and backwards and 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.780
 we will see that in the beginning possibly 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:27.370
 be the first men or the first 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.010
 monkeys, thank you, thanks to them, 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.310
 peach I 'm going to eat it is to say 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.729
 just a link in that whole chain 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.410
 of peasant producers of the 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.780
 ancestors of the peasant of the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.389
 ancestors of the producers of 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.930
 those who have sold only that one 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.479
 only link will fail this peach and 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.669
 this video could not be done if 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:55.510
 we analyze everything and look back 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:58.690
 we will see that this peach in essence 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.129
 starts in the big band that is to say in that 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.069
 explosion of the birth of 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.589
 universe because both oxygen and 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:09.159
 all that life on the planet all the 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:11.289
 origin was the case that beginning 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:15.669
 of the universe so in this minute ton 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.199
 is the essence is the whole universe in 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.059
 this and the button 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.729
 I would like you to meditate on this topic 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:25.360
 and that we analyze even we only 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.639
 that one of our ancestors just for 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.339
 a second for a minute that there was not 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.409
 come to meet such person or by 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:35.110
 those coincidences of life we ​​do not 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.929
 we would be here so I would like 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.149
 meditate on us that everything depends on 

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:44.939
 many factors that he has spoken to us 

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:44.939
 but pop and see you in upcoming videos
