decided to go with my all trustee 352

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.130 
decided to go with my all trustee 352
formation<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.180> was<00:00:48.270> actually<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.110> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
formation it was actually just the one I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.170 
formation it was actually just the one I
decided<00:00:49.530> I'd<00:00:49.739> try<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.010> out<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.260 
figured this would actually be a little
bit<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> challenging<00:00:53.550> task<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.969> know<00:00:54.090> there

instantly took a look at was the in

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.959 
instantly took a look at was the in
formulas<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.440> well<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.190> Schneider<00:01:02.550> those<00:01:02.820> were

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
formulas as well as Schneider those were

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.910 
formulas as well as Schneider those were
the<00:01:03.090> two<00:01:03.300> main<00:01:03.480> players<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.409> kind<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the two main players that I was kind of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.030 
the two main players that I was kind of
drawn<00:01:05.400> towards<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.150> they're<00:01:06.630> um<00:01:06.930> they're

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
drawn towards because they're um they're

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.440 
drawn towards because they're um they're
probably<00:01:08.040> two<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> most<00:01:08.520> popular<00:01:09.000> ones<00:01:09.180> in

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
probably two of the most popular ones in

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.750 
probably two of the most popular ones in
that<00:01:09.720> particular<00:01:09.900> team<00:01:10.680> unfortunately<00:01:11.340> there

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that particular team unfortunately there

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.280 
that particular team unfortunately there
isn't<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.180> rest<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> Turkish<00:01:12.960> league<00:01:13.140> on

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
isn't the rest of the Turkish league on

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.859 
isn't the rest of the Turkish league on
FIFA<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.070> only<00:01:14.310> really<00:01:14.490> pick<00:01:14.970> players

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
FIFA so you can only really pick players

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.800 
FIFA so you can only really pick players
from<00:01:16.619> within<00:01:17.360> Galatasaray<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.720> them

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
from within Galatasaray if you want them

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.120 
from within Galatasaray if you want them
to<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:18.990> any<00:01:19.140> sort<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.380> chemistry<00:01:19.740> links<00:01:20.009> but

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
to get any sort of chemistry links but

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.580 
to get any sort of chemistry links but
in<00:01:20.580> goalkeeper<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.210> decided<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.720> pick<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.140> Buffon

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
in goalkeeper I decided to pick a Buffon

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.410 
in goalkeeper I decided to pick a Buffon
one<00:01:22.830> because<00:01:23.070> Buffon<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> quality<00:01:24.270> player

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
one because Buffon is a quality player

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.660 
one because Buffon is a quality player
and<00:01:24.780> he<00:01:25.110> fills<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.710> ventus<00:01:26.159> roles<00:01:26.430> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and he fills that you ventus roles so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 
and he fills that you ventus roles so
that<00:01:26.880> worked<00:01:27.150> absolutely<00:01:27.360> wonderfully<00:01:28.350> for

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that worked absolutely wonderfully for

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.440 
that worked absolutely wonderfully for
me<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.000> obviously<00:01:30.150> had<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
me and then we obviously had a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.300 
me and then we obviously had a
centre-back<00:01:31.049> position<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.650> fill<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:32.009> as<00:01:32.159> well

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
centre-back position to fill up as well

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.999 
centre-back position to fill up as well
and<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.270> Lucio<00:01:33.750> Lucio<00:01:34.650> as

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and that was going to be Lucio Lucio as

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.440 
and that was going to be Lucio Lucio as
a<00:01:35.040> centre<00:01:35.400> by<00:01:35.490> he's<00:01:35.670> alright<00:01:35.939> he<00:01:36.060> has<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> high

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
a centre by he's alright he has a high

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.810 
a centre by he's alright he has a high
attacking<00:01:36.930> were<00:01:37.049> trait<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.159> kind<00:01:38.610> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
attacking were trait so it can kind of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.240 
attacking were trait so it can kind of
let<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.180> down<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.770> figured

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
let you down a little bit but I figured

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
let you down a little bit but I figured
he'd<00:01:41.430> work<00:01:41.640> well<00:01:41.880> when<00:01:42.119> combining<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.810> with

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
he'd work well when combining up with

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960 
he'd work well when combining up with
Buffon<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> Lucio<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.189> actually<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> really

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
Buffon and Lucio is actually a really

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.819 
Buffon and Lucio is actually a really
key<00:01:45.270> part<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.750> team<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.140> he's<00:01:46.680> gonna

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
key part of this team because he's gonna

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.249 
key part of this team because he's gonna
essentially<00:01:47.520> unlock<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.299> left<00:01:48.570> half<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.049> my

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
essentially unlock the left half of my

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.770 
essentially unlock the left half of my
squad<00:01:49.500> which<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.159> very<00:01:50.430> Brazilian<00:01:51.149> dominated

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
squad which is very Brazilian dominated

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
squad which is very Brazilian dominated
so<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.530> left<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.979> centre-back<00:01:53.549> position<00:01:53.909> we

likes<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.150> Schneider<00:03:05.450> or<00:03:05.750> yo<00:03:05.930> mas<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.770> just

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
likes of Schneider or yo mas but it just

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.340 
likes of Schneider or yo mas but it just
wasn't<00:03:07.100> working<00:03:07.400> out<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.760> was<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:08.570> hard<00:03:08.870> to

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
wasn't working out it was so so hard to

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.990 
wasn't working out it was so so hard to
create<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.740> team<00:03:10.040> with<00:03:10.250> both<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.460> those<00:03:10.730> players

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
create a team with both of those players

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.880 
create a team with both of those players
in<00:03:11.270> him<00:03:11.390> then<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.900> left<00:03:12.080> mid<00:03:12.380> we<00:03:12.530> have<00:03:12.650> another

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
around you know I didn't really I'm

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.150 
around you know I didn't really I'm
really<00:03:20.420> played<00:03:20.989> with<00:03:21.110> him<00:03:21.260> too<00:03:21.410> much<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.830> didn't

really played with him too much I didn't
really<00:03:22.280> like<00:03:22.580> him<00:03:22.760> at<00:03:22.850> all<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.090> fifa<00:03:23.450> 12<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:23.780> I

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
really like him at all and fifa 12 so I

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.210 
really like him at all and fifa 12 so I
was<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.959> little<00:03:23.989> bit<00:03:24.230> skeptical<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:24.739> using<00:03:25.100> him

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
was a little bit skeptical of using him

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.520 
was a little bit skeptical of using him
again<00:03:25.520> in<00:03:25.670> FIFA<00:03:25.940> 13<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.600> then<00:03:27.110> at<00:03:27.260> right

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
again in FIFA 13 and then at right

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.910 
again in FIFA 13 and then at right
midfield<00:03:28.040> we<00:03:28.580> have<00:03:28.820> obviously<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.630> la<00:03:30.590> liga

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
midfield we have obviously a la liga

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.100 
midfield we have obviously a la liga
player<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:31.430> i<00:03:31.970> don't<00:03:32.480> even<00:03:32.600> want<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.840> try

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
player and that i don't even want to try

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.110 
player and that i don't even want to try
and<00:03:33.260> say<00:03:33.380> name<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.830> shocking<00:03:34.400> jacques<00:03:34.910> queen

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
and say name is shocking jacques queen

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.540 
and say name is shocking jacques queen
or<00:03:35.390> something<00:03:36.110> like<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.590> anyways<00:03:37.340> I

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
or something like that anyways I

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.580 
or something like that anyways I
probably<00:03:38.300> was<00:03:38.570> completely<00:03:38.989> butchered<00:03:39.470> his

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
probably was completely butchered his

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.949 
probably was completely butchered his
name<00:03:39.800> there<00:03:40.010> but<00:03:40.280> he<00:03:41.239> hasn't<00:03:41.510> informed<00:03:41.630> so<00:03:41.930> i

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
name there but he hasn't informed so i

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.510 
name there but he hasn't informed so i
decided<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.350> put<00:03:42.650> him<00:03:42.830> as<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:42.980> right<00:03:43.130> mid<00:03:43.340> and

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
decided to put him as a right mid and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.130 
decided to put him as a right mid and
you<00:03:43.880> can<00:03:44.060> see<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.360> know<00:03:44.450> those<00:03:44.660> three<00:03:44.870> players

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
you can see you know those three players

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.740 
you can see you know those three players
there<00:03:45.410> get<00:03:45.830> all<00:03:46.040> really<00:03:46.700> bright<00:03:47.000> green<00:03:47.360> links

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
there get all really bright green links

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.090 
there get all really bright green links
so<00:03:47.870> they're<00:03:48.020> getting<00:03:48.290> some<00:03:48.440> great<00:03:48.650> chemistry

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
so they're getting some great chemistry

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.710 
so they're getting some great chemistry
off<00:03:49.280> each<00:03:49.459> other<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:49.940> that's<00:03:50.330> what<00:03:50.510> pretty

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
off each other and that's what pretty

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.570 
off each other and that's what pretty
much<00:03:50.900> allowed<00:03:51.230> shabby<00:03:51.590> alonso<00:03:52.130> there<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.459> pick

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
much allowed shabby alonso there to pick

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.210 
much allowed shabby alonso there to pick
up<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.910> nine<00:03:53.690> chemistry<00:03:54.230> rating<00:03:54.680> considering

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
up a nine chemistry rating considering

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.610 
up a nine chemistry rating considering
that<00:03:55.340> he<00:03:55.489> doesn't<00:03:56.030> connect<00:03:56.420> up<00:03:56.570> to<00:03:56.600> any<00:03:56.989> to

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
that he doesn't connect up to any to

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.490 
that he doesn't connect up to any to
either<00:03:57.770> Lucio<00:03:58.280> or<00:03:58.520> romello<00:03:59.120> then<00:03:59.780> at<00:04:00.110> center

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
either Lucio or romello then at center

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.930 
either Lucio or romello then at center
attacking<00:04:00.800> mid<00:04:00.950> we<00:04:01.100> have<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.250> player<00:04:01.550> that<00:04:01.580> kind

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
attacking mid we have a player that kind

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.229 
attacking mid we have a player that kind
of<00:04:01.970> connected<00:04:02.420> both<00:04:02.630> sides<00:04:03.020> of<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:04.100> 352<00:04:04.850> up

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
of connected both sides of the 352 up

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.110 
of connected both sides of the 352 up
and<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.840> kaka<00:04:06.830> kaka<00:04:07.100> is<00:04:07.519> a<00:04:07.550> wonderful

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
and that is a kaka kaka is a wonderful

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.030 
and that is a kaka kaka is a wonderful
center<00:04:08.390> document<00:04:08.840> he<00:04:09.200> takes<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.590> Brazilian

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
center document he takes the Brazilian

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.949 
center document he takes the Brazilian
from<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.310> left<00:04:10.489> hand<00:04:10.700> side<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.630> la<00:04:11.930> liga

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
from the left hand side and the la liga

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.630 
from the left hand side and the la liga
from<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.500> Ryan<00:04:12.680> said<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.100> combines<00:04:13.459> them

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
from the Ryan said it combines them

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.979 
from the Ryan said it combines them
which<00:04:13.820> allows<00:04:14.180> him<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.420> get<00:04:14.720> some<00:04:14.870> good

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
which allows him to get some good

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.110 
which allows him to get some good
chemistry<00:04:15.440> as<00:04:15.590> well<00:04:15.890> then<00:04:16.460> a<00:04:16.489> striker<00:04:16.910> we

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
chemistry as well then a striker we

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.390 
chemistry as well then a striker we
obviously<00:04:17.270> needed<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:18.200> Bayern<00:04:18.830> Munich<00:04:19.160> player

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
obviously needed a Bayern Munich player

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.289 
obviously needed a Bayern Munich player
and<00:04:19.640> obviously<00:04:20.180> someone<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:20.960> link<00:04:21.140> up

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
and obviously someone to link up

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.909 
and obviously someone to link up
nicely<00:04:21.569> with<00:04:21.720> him<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.259> we<00:04:22.349> decided<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.770> go<00:04:22.889> with

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
nicely with him so we decided to go with

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.300 
nicely with him so we decided to go with
Royce<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.879> gomez<00:04:24.509> so<00:04:25.050> there<00:04:25.229> it<00:04:25.349> is<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.830> is<00:04:26.009> a

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
Royce and gomez so there it is that is a

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.670 
Royce and gomez so there it is that is a
one-player<00:04:27.030> from<00:04:27.060> at<00:04:27.479> least<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:28.289> know<00:04:28.409> from

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
one-player from at least you know from

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.850 
one-player from at least you know from
one<00:04:29.069> club<00:04:29.849> all<00:04:30.270> in<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.930> core<00:04:31.139> final<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.650> don't

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
one club all in the core final I don't

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.559 
one club all in the core final I don't
have<00:04:31.949> that<00:04:32.009> make<00:04:32.280> sense<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:33.030> they<00:04:33.180> pick<00:04:33.419> up

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
have that make sense but they pick up

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.119 
have that make sense but they pick up
nine<00:04:33.750> chemistry<00:04:34.169> of<00:04:34.289> each<00:04:34.409> other<00:04:34.590> because<00:04:34.889> one

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.129 
nine chemistry of each other because one

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.339 
nine chemistry of each other because one
they're<00:04:35.940> both<00:04:36.120> German<00:04:36.569> and<00:04:36.690> two<00:04:36.960> they<00:04:37.139> both

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
they're both German and two they both

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.689 
they're both German and two they both
play<00:04:37.500> in<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.650> same<00:04:37.830> league<00:04:38.039> so<00:04:38.190> they<00:04:38.310> get<00:04:38.610> that

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
play in the same league so they get that

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
is actually no gameplay because I just

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.890 
is actually no gameplay because I just
was<00:04:50.550> more<00:04:50.699> of<00:04:50.759> a<00:04:50.819> challenge<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.419> see<00:04:51.599> if<00:04:51.629> I

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
was more of a challenge to see if I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.899 
was more of a challenge to see if I
could<00:04:51.960> create<00:04:52.349> the<00:04:52.560> squad<00:04:52.800> itself<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:53.610> wasn't

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
could create the squad itself it wasn't

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.369 
could create the squad itself it wasn't
necessarily<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.599> see<00:04:54.750> how<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.900> team<00:04:55.139> played

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379
