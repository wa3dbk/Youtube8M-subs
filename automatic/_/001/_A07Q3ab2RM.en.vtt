00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
and i know this is extremely dark but I

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.840 
and i know this is extremely dark but I
use<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:19.500> orange<00:03:19.950> one<00:03:20.040> right<00:03:20.400> here<00:03:20.670> as<00:03:20.820> a

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
use this orange one right here as a

color corrector as well so you're

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.130 
color corrector as well so you're
probably<00:03:23.970> wondering<00:03:24.270> why<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:24.990> are

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
probably wondering why they are

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.770 
probably wondering why they are
extremely<00:03:25.470> different<00:03:25.980> shades<00:03:26.460> and<00:03:26.790> yeah

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
extremely different shades and yeah

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.650 
extremely different shades and yeah
there<00:03:28.110> is<00:03:28.260> nothing<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:28.860> is<00:03:29.100> similar<00:03:30.090> or<00:03:30.600> the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
there is nothing that is similar or the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.350 
there is nothing that is similar or the
same<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:32.250> are<00:03:32.370> two<00:03:32.490> reasons<00:03:32.520> for<00:03:33.060> them

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
same and there are two reasons for them

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.350 
same and there are two reasons for them
for<00:03:34.020> that<00:03:34.170> one<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.460> gravitate<00:03:36.060> towards

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
for that one is that I gravitate towards

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.510 
for that one is that I gravitate towards
these<00:03:36.660> top<00:03:37.050> four<00:03:37.440> because<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.370> their

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
these top four because of their

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.120 
these top four because of their
consistency<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.570> their<00:03:39.720> texture<00:03:40.230> which<00:03:40.530> they

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
consistency and their texture which they

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.240 
consistency and their texture which they
all<00:03:41.370> pretty<00:03:41.790> much<00:03:41.910> have<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.750> same<00:03:42.980> there<00:03:43.980> are

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
all pretty much have the same there are

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.310 
all pretty much have the same there are
largely<00:03:44.700> cream<00:03:45.180> products<00:03:45.750> obviously<00:03:45.900> they're

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
largely cream products obviously they're

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.050 
largely cream products obviously they're
cream<00:03:46.530> products<00:03:47.010> but<00:03:47.130> they<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.610> certain

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
cream products but they have a certain

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.450 
cream products but they have a certain
thickness<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.350> formulation<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:51.200> density<00:03:52.200> of

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
thickness and formulation and density of

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.590 
thickness and formulation and density of
consistency<00:03:53.460> that<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.790> very<00:03:54.060> different<00:03:54.330> from

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
consistency that is very different from

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.870 
consistency that is very different from
other<00:03:54.840> concealers<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.770> this<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.490> think<00:03:56.550> is

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
other concealers and this I think is

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.800 
other concealers and this I think is
what<00:03:57.180> makes<00:03:57.540> them<00:03:57.810> amazing<00:03:58.280> for<00:03:59.480> this<00:04:00.480> area

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
what makes them amazing for this area

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.780 
what makes them amazing for this area
the<00:04:01.140> under<00:04:01.380> eye<00:04:01.410> color<00:04:01.860> concealing<00:04:02.580> and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
the under eye color concealing and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.630 
the under eye color concealing and
correcting<00:04:03.560> besides<00:04:04.560> their<00:04:04.770> consistency<00:04:05.310> is

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
correcting besides their consistency is

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.120 
correcting besides their consistency is
their<00:04:05.910> varying<00:04:06.450> shades<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.200> find<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:07.920> they

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
their varying shades I find that they

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.430 
their varying shades I find that they
are<00:04:08.220> not<00:04:08.400> exactly<00:04:08.970> my<00:04:09.180> skin<00:04:09.570> tone<00:04:09.810> but<00:04:10.020> they're

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
are not exactly my skin tone but they're

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.870 
are not exactly my skin tone but they're

orange concealer right here but this is

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.189 
orange concealer right here but this is
a<00:06:32.340> trick<00:06:32.669> that<00:06:32.699> I<00:06:32.880> learned<00:06:32.970> from<00:06:33.330> Wayne<00:06:33.930> of

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 
a trick that I learned from Wayne of

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.129 
a trick that I learned from Wayne of
gossmakeupartist<00:06:34.800> and<00:06:35.610> so<00:06:36.389> I<00:06:36.599> thought<00:06:36.870> it<00:06:37.050> was

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
gossmakeupartist and so I thought it was

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.659 
gossmakeupartist and so I thought it was
kind<00:06:37.410> of<00:06:37.500> crazy<00:06:37.740> but<00:06:38.010> I<00:06:38.070> did<00:06:38.310> have<00:06:38.460> this

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
kind of crazy but I did have this

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.330 
kind of crazy but I did have this
palette<00:06:39.150> which<00:06:39.780> are<00:06:40.020> which<00:06:40.560> is<00:06:40.620> from<00:06:40.949> my<00:06:41.099> kit

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.770 
for darker skin tones and I did have a
bright<00:06:43.800> orange<00:06:44.010> so<00:06:44.910> I<00:06:44.940> tried<00:06:45.240> it<00:06:45.360> out<00:06:45.449> one<00:06:45.750> day

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
bright orange so I tried it out one day

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.700 
bright orange so I tried it out one day
and<00:06:46.020> it<00:06:46.349> doesn't<00:06:47.010> absolutely<00:06:47.520> amazing<00:06:48.330> job

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
and it doesn't absolutely amazing job

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.950 
and it doesn't absolutely amazing job
when<00:06:49.710> you<00:06:49.919> mix<00:06:50.190> that<00:06:50.340> with<00:06:50.910> your<00:06:51.120> actual<00:06:51.570> skin

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
when you mix that with your actual skin

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.399 
when you mix that with your actual skin
concealer<00:06:52.470> on<00:06:52.830> top<00:06:53.220> it<00:06:53.729> really<00:06:54.570> just<00:06:54.870> counters

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:55.409 
concealer on top it really just counters

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:56.500 
concealer on top it really just counters
the<00:06:55.620> blue

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
the blue

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.220 
the blue
and<00:06:57.250> it<00:06:58.250> does<00:06:58.490> a<00:06:58.520> great<00:06:58.730> camouflage

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
and it does a great camouflage

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.330 
and it does a great camouflage
especially<00:07:00.230> when<00:07:00.320> your<00:07:00.470> topic<00:07:00.830> of<00:07:01.040> your

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
especially when your topic of your

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.990 
especially when your topic of your
natural<00:07:02.120> skin<00:07:02.630> concealer<00:07:03.200> so<00:07:04.010> I<00:07:04.340> guess<00:07:04.880> that

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
natural skin concealer so I guess that

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.050 
natural skin concealer so I guess that

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
is my share for today those are my top

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.780

picks<00:07:08.420> for<00:07:08.540> color<00:07:08.930> correctors<00:07:09.650> and<00:07:09.920> i<00:07:10.520> truly

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
picks for color correctors and i truly

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.930 
picks for color correctors and i truly
think<00:07:11.210> that<00:07:11.360> color<00:07:11.900> correctors<00:07:12.790> does<00:07:13.790> an

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
think that color correctors does an

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.960 
think that color correctors does an
amazing<00:07:14.060> job<00:07:14.450> for<00:07:15.310> effectively<00:07:16.310> concealing

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:16.970 
amazing job for effectively concealing

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.240 
amazing job for effectively concealing
the<00:07:17.090> under<00:07:17.360> eye<00:07:17.540> and<00:07:17.930> I<00:07:18.290> think<00:07:18.560> it's<00:07:18.740> a<00:07:18.950> step

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250 
the under eye and I think it's a step

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.160 
the under eye and I think it's a step
that<00:07:19.310> you<00:07:19.550> should<00:07:20.060> actually<00:07:20.240> consider<00:07:20.870> doing

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.170 
that you should actually consider doing

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.900 
that you should actually consider doing
rather<00:07:21.560> than<00:07:21.680> just<00:07:21.950> put<00:07:22.160> in<00:07:22.250> one<00:07:22.700> eye

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
rather than just put in one eye

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.380 
rather than just put in one eye
brightener<00:07:23.750> on<00:07:24.020> the<00:07:24.410> entire<00:07:24.740> area<00:07:25.150> not<00:07:26.150> only

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:26.390 
brightener on the entire area not only

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.180 
brightener on the entire area not only
does<00:07:26.660> it<00:07:26.720> counter<00:07:27.290> the<00:07:27.470> blue<00:07:27.680> more

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.190 
does it counter the blue more

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.310 
does it counter the blue more
effectively<00:07:28.790> but<00:07:29.450> it<00:07:29.540> allows<00:07:29.870> for<00:07:29.900> your

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.320 
effectively but it allows for your

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.490 
effectively but it allows for your
actual<00:07:30.710> concealer<00:07:31.190> to<00:07:31.430> last<00:07:31.640> longer<00:07:32.000> so<00:07:32.780> that
