a connector and this connector slides in
to<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:36.690> rack<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.670> connects<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> input

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
to the rack and connects it to the input

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.700 
to the rack and connects it to the input
and<00:00:39.390> output<00:00:39.540> connectors<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> power

and output connectors and the power

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.100 
and output connectors and the power
supply<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.730> there<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.059> no<00:00:42.360> internal<00:00:42.930> power

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110

yellow one so they look really cool like

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.380 
yellow one so they look really cool like
the<00:01:27.479> retro<00:01:28.470> Trident<00:01:29.310> consoles<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.210> things

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
high-quality switches as are the pots

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.219 
high-quality switches as are the pots
and<00:01:38.610> everything<00:01:38.909> else<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.360> real<00:01:39.720> hefty

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
feeling well-built two-piece and of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.859 
feeling well-built two-piece and of
course<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.530> amplifier<00:01:44.009> stage<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.149> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
course the amplifier stage and this is a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.620 
course the amplifier stage and this is a
tube<00:01:46.290> amplifier<00:01:46.950> stage<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.790> solid-state<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
tube amplifier stage not solid-state and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.130 
tube amplifier stage not solid-state and
like<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> name<00:01:49.860> says<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:51.030> tube<00:01:51.689> you'll<00:01:51.869> has<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
like the name says the tube you'll has a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.850 
like the name says the tube you'll has a
very<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.670> sound<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.810> imparts<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.470> lot<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
very to be sound it imparts a lot of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.149 
very to be sound it imparts a lot of
warmth<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.969> roundness<00:01:57.509> more<00:01:58.320> than<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> lot<00:01:58.860> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
warmth and roundness more than a lot of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.389 
warmth and roundness more than a lot of
microphone<00:02:00.119> preamps<00:02:00.659> I've<00:02:00.810> noticed<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
microphone preamps I've noticed a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.480 
microphone preamps I've noticed a
definitely<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.729> lot<00:02:03.390> more<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.869> coloration<00:02:04.860> with

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
definitely a lot more to coloration with

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.789 
definitely a lot more to coloration with
the<00:02:05.850> rolls<00:02:06.060> tibul<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.290> you're<00:02:07.409> looking<00:02:07.649> for

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
the rolls tibul so if you're looking for

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.520 
the rolls tibul so if you're looking for
something<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:09.110> softens<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
something that really softens up and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.860 
something that really softens up and
fattens<00:02:10.950> up<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.430> sound<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.090> takes<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.569> stiff

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
fattens up the sound and takes a stiff

this<00:02:18.569> would<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:19.019> very<00:02:19.230> good<00:02:19.739> it's<00:02:20.010> very

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
this would be very good it's very

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.180 
this would be very good it's very
musical<00:02:21.000> sounding<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.680> that's<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.769> very<00:02:22.920> high

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
quality piece very big sounding and as

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.240 
quality piece very big sounding and as
far<00:02:27.930> as<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.140> features<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.620> course<00:02:28.769> we<00:02:29.040> looked

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
far as the features of course we looked

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.309 
far as the features of course we looked
at<00:02:29.400> these<00:02:29.549> switches<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.299> also<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:31.140> have

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
at these switches here and also you have

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.569 
at these switches here and also you have
your<00:02:31.349> gain<00:02:32.840> pot<00:02:33.840> here<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.650> goes<00:02:34.950> by<00:02:35.190> clicks

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
your gain pot here and it goes by clicks

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.630 
your gain pot here and it goes by clicks
and<00:02:35.879> then<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.989> have<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> fine<00:02:37.739> tune<00:02:38.220> for<00:02:38.549> your

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
and then you have a fine tune for your

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.220 
and then you have a fine tune for your
gain<00:02:38.909> here<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.360> when<00:02:39.510> you're<00:02:39.629> trying<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.019> set

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
gain here so when you're trying to set

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.559 
gain here so when you're trying to set
the<00:02:40.260> level<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:41.280> record<00:02:41.640> level<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.299> right

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
the level to record level just right

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.839 
the level to record level just right
that's<00:02:43.560> your<00:02:43.799> fine<00:02:44.040> tune<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.579> that's

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
basically what you you set the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.150 
basically what you you set the
approximate<00:02:47.400> amount<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:48.209> gain<00:02:48.799> that<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:49.859> use

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
approximate amount of gain that you use

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.250
