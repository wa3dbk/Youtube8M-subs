00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.760 
the team how can the team you know build
on<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.880> forward<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.350> continued

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
on that going forward to have continued

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
on that going forward to have continued
success<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.399> think<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
success I think that

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.760 
success I think that
the<00:02:03.880> second<00:02:04.240> half<00:02:04.480> we<00:02:04.840> let<00:02:05.140> them<00:02:05.320> come<00:02:05.590> at<00:02:05.740> us

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
the second half we let them come at us

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.050 
the second half we let them come at us
and<00:02:06.130> we<00:02:06.340> need<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.670> manage<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:09.060> instead

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
and we need to manage that and instead

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.970 
and we need to manage that and instead
of<00:02:10.119> them<00:02:10.690> getting<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.140> third<00:02:11.500> goal<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.830> the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
of them getting the third goal of the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.610 
of them getting the third goal of the
game<00:02:12.160> we<00:02:12.550> should<00:02:12.580> have<00:02:12.790> made<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.900> 30<00:02:14.200> instead

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
game we should have made it 30 instead

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.590 
game we should have made it 30 instead
of<00:02:14.830> let<00:02:15.220> them<00:02:15.400> back<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.580> with<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.150> one<00:02:16.360> and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
of let them back in with it to one and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.150 
of let them back in with it to one and
it's<00:02:17.200> something<00:02:17.380> we<00:02:17.500> can<00:02:17.680> build<00:02:17.830> off<00:02:18.010> we

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
it's something we can build off we

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.070 
it's something we can build off we
should<00:02:18.190> take<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.730> first<00:02:18.970> half<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.900> get

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
should take the first half and just get

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.770 
should take the first half and just get
better<00:02:20.230> from<00:02:20.470> there<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.920> um<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:22.000> think

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
better from there and um I think

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.130 
better from there and um I think
defensively<00:02:23.560> as<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.160> team<00:02:24.940> we<00:02:25.330> need<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.690> get

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
defensively as a team we need to get

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.740 
defensively as a team we need to get
better<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.590> we<00:02:26.800> will<00:02:27.010> for<00:02:27.280> sure<00:02:27.750> absolutely
