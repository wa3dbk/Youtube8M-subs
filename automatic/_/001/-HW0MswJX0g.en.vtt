going to move the vehicle so we've got a
bit<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.939> okay<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.079> we've<00:01:49.229> got

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
bit more like okay so I think we've got

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
a bit more light so this unit is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.319 
a bit more light so this unit is
obviously<00:01:52.380> currently<00:01:52.770> playing<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.329> DVD

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
obviously currently playing the DVD

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.499 
obviously currently playing the DVD
which<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.200> roof<00:01:55.500> screen<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.509> again

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
which is in the roof screen and again

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.090 
which is in the roof screen and again
change<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.229> source<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> DVD<00:02:01.710> which<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
change that source to the DVD which is

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.380 
change that source to the DVD which is
inside<00:02:02.780> let's<00:02:03.780> change<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.229> source<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:05.220> radio

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
inside let's change that source to radio

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.940 
inside let's change that source to radio
now<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.860> example<00:02:08.570> if<00:02:09.570> we<00:02:09.780> had<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:13.680> front

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
now for example if we had the front

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.400 
now for example if we had the front
screen<00:02:14.340> DVD<00:02:14.850> playing<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.780> we<00:02:15.900> wanted<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> see

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
screen DVD playing but we wanted to see

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.740 
screen DVD playing but we wanted to see
the<00:02:16.560> map<00:02:16.770> whilst<00:02:17.040> driving<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:18.270> hit<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> nav

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
the map whilst driving we hit the nav

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.920 
the map whilst driving we hit the nav
map<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:20.190> DVD<00:02:20.640> still<00:02:21.000> plays<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.660> split

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
map the DVD still plays in the split

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.010 
map the DVD still plays in the split
screen<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.790> unit<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.390> its<00:02:24.600> own<00:02:24.750> will<00:02:24.900> do

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
screen so this unit on its own will do

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.200 
screen so this unit on its own will do
