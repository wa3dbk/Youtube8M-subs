quite<00:01:06.080> clearly<00:01:06.500> in<00:01:06.710> movie<00:01:07.310> 2<00:01:07.520> because<00:01:07.970> of<00:01:08.120> what

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
quite clearly in movie 2 because of what

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.300 
quite clearly in movie 2 because of what
happens<00:01:08.600> with<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.870> spiders<00:01:09.470> with<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:09.980> with

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
happens with the spiders with the with

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.410 
happens with the spiders with the with
the<00:01:10.690> elven<00:01:11.690> dungeons<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.970> Bilbo<00:01:13.970> finding<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
the elven dungeons and Bilbo finding the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.220 
the elven dungeons and Bilbo finding the
staircase<00:01:14.990> these<00:01:15.740> moments<00:01:16.630> mean<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:17.840> Bilbo

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
staircase these moments mean that Bilbo

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.140 
staircase these moments mean that Bilbo
becomes<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.680> great<00:01:18.860> asset<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:19.550> him<00:01:19.790> rather<00:01:20.000> than

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
becomes a great asset to him rather than

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.660 
becomes a great asset to him rather than
a<00:01:20.330> liability<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.260> he<00:01:21.950> has<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.250> change<00:01:22.460> his

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
a liability so he has to change his

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.220 
a liability so he has to change his
perception<00:01:23.240> but<00:01:23.390> as<00:01:23.510> soon<00:01:23.630> as<00:01:23.720> he<00:01:23.810> gets<00:01:24.020> into

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
perception but as soon as he gets into

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.930 
perception but as soon as he gets into
the<00:01:24.320> mountain<00:01:24.680> that<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.070> madness<00:01:25.460> kicks<00:01:25.730> in

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
the mountain that the madness kicks in

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.400 
the mountain that the madness kicks in
and<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.120> realized<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:26.900> relationship

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
and you realized that this relationship

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.930 
and you realized that this relationship
is<00:01:27.560> going<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.770> be<00:01:27.890> much<00:01:28.400> more<00:01:28.610> complicated

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
is going to be much more complicated

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.910 
is going to be much more complicated
than<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:29.390> think

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.899 

I<00:01:38.530> think<00:01:39.530> fighting<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.130> dragon<00:01:40.460> inside<00:01:40.580> the

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
I think fighting the dragon inside the

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:41.740 
I think fighting the dragon inside the
mountain<00:01:41.210> was<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.360> most<00:01:41.600> challenging

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
mountain was the most challenging

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.510 
mountain was the most challenging
because<00:01:42.229> there<00:01:42.380> was<00:01:42.500> no<00:01:42.740> mountain<00:01:43.310> there<00:01:43.430> was

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
because there was no mountain there was

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.219 
because there was no mountain there was
no<00:01:43.640> dragon<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.180> was<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.330> green<00:01:44.509> box<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.049> green

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
no dragon it was a green box and a green

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.490 
no dragon it was a green box and a green
ball<00:01:45.470> on<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.649> stick<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:47.390> had<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.750> create<00:01:48.020> the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
ball on a stick so I had to create the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.820 
ball on a stick so I had to create the
dragon<00:01:48.799> in<00:01:48.890> my<00:01:49.009> mind<00:01:49.250> with<00:01:49.610> various<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.540> know

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
dragon in my mind with various you know

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.560 
dragon in my mind with various you know
pictures<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.100> music<00:01:52.670> whatever<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:53.149> was<00:01:53.299> I<00:01:53.450> was

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
pictures and music whatever it was I was

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.330 
pictures and music whatever it was I was
using<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:54.049> find<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.860> dragon<00:01:55.220> so<00:01:56.000> seeing<00:01:56.299> it

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
using to find the dragon so seeing it

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.279 
using to find the dragon so seeing it
finally<00:01:58.340> realized<00:01:58.700> in<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.970> movie<00:01:59.299> it's

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
finally realized in the movie it's

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.080 
finally realized in the movie it's
surpassing<00:02:00.920> my<00:02:00.950> expectations<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:01.909> hope
