Sega's entry into the 32-bit their real
entry<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.700> should<00:01:11.909> say<00:01:11.939> into<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> 32-bit

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
entry I should say into the 32-bit

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.910 
entry I should say into the 32-bit
basically<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.939> compete<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:15.659> three<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
basically to compete with three do and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.749 
basically to compete with three do and
the<00:01:17.250> PlayStation<00:01:17.939> 1<00:01:17.970> at<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> time<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.759> n64

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the PlayStation 1 at the time the n64

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.420 
the PlayStation 1 at the time the n64
was<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.659> little<00:01:22.320> bit<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.560> ways<00:01:22.710> yet<00:01:23.540> but<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:26.040> was

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
was a little bit of ways yet but it was

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.960 
was a little bit of ways yet but it was
a<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:26.700> system<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.930> my<00:01:28.140> opinion<00:01:28.790> some<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
a good system in my opinion some of the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.880 
a good system in my opinion some of the
main<00:01:30.270> problems<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.409> though<00:01:31.619> or

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
main problems with it though or

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.960 
main problems with it though or
basically<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.790> say<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:33.390> itself<00:01:34.970> they

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
basically just say get itself they

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.740 
basically just say get itself they
released<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.840> Sega<00:01:37.079> CD<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.820> Genesis<00:01:39.329> add-on

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
released the Sega CD the Genesis add-on

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.069 
released the Sega CD the Genesis add-on
and<00:01:40.079> then<00:01:40.619> decided<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.610> release<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> 32<00:01:42.869> X

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and then decided to release a 32 X

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.690 
and then decided to release a 32 X
add-on<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:45.420> guess<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.159> way<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> story

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
add-on and I guess the the way the story

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.359 
add-on and I guess the the way the story
goes<00:01:47.880> there's<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.630> lot<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.020> Sega's<00:01:49.860> customers

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
goes there's a lot of Sega's customers

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.880 
goes there's a lot of Sega's customers
were<00:01:50.610> pretty<00:01:51.450> p<00:01:51.720> 0<00:01:51.750> they've<00:01:52.170> spent<00:01:52.530> money<00:01:52.799> on

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
were pretty p 0 they've spent money on

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.850 
were pretty p 0 they've spent money on
two<00:01:53.549> systems<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:55.229> has<00:01:55.470> short

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
two systems that really has short

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.850 
two systems that really has short
lifespans<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> 32x<00:01:58.140> having<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> really

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
lifespans with the 32x having a really

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.780 
lifespans with the 32x having a really
short<00:01:59.189> lifespan<00:02:00.829> why<00:02:01.829> would<00:02:02.189> anybody<00:02:02.460> put

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
short lifespan why would anybody put

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.080 
short lifespan why would anybody put
their<00:02:02.969> money<00:02:03.090> into<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.990> system<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.090> companies

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
their money into a system that companies

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.570 
their money into a system that companies
not<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> support<00:02:06.950> except<00:02:07.950> I'd<00:02:08.160> off<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
not going to support except I'd off the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.130 
not going to support except I'd off the
bat<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.390> system<00:02:09.660> was<00:02:11.209> already<00:02:12.209> not<00:02:12.540> winning

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
bat this system was already not winning

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.840 
bat this system was already not winning
the<00:02:13.260> hearts

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the hearts

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.980 
the hearts
of<00:02:13.910> players<00:02:14.690> over<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:17.000> other<00:02:17.240> thing<00:02:17.660> was

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
of players over the other thing was

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.890 
of players over the other thing was
basically<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:19.250> hardware<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.480> hardware

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
basically the hardware the hardware

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.700 
basically the hardware the hardware
which<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.410> cute<00:02:21.650> damn<00:02:21.860> difficult<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:24.530> code

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
which is cute damn difficult to to code

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.620 
which is cute damn difficult to to code
for<00:02:25.070> unless<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.610> knew<00:02:25.760> exactly<00:02:25.940> what<00:02:26.480> was

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
for unless you knew exactly what was

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.820 
for unless you knew exactly what was
going<00:02:26.840> on<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:29.080> processor<00:02:30.080> there<00:02:30.470> was<00:02:30.590> two<00:02:30.800> of

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
going on the processor there was two of

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.760 
going on the processor there was two of
them<00:02:31.570> kind<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:32.660> like<00:02:32.840> what<00:02:33.050> Atari<00:02:33.350> did<00:02:33.620> with

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
them kind of like what Atari did with

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.130 
them kind of like what Atari did with
the<00:02:33.860> Jaguar<00:02:34.400> she's<00:02:35.090> had<00:02:35.270> way<00:02:35.480> too<00:02:35.540> much<00:02:35.840> crap

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
the Jaguar she's had way too much crap

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.020 
the Jaguar she's had way too much crap
under<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> hood<00:02:36.770> that<00:02:37.460> people<00:02:37.820> couldn't

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
under the hood that people couldn't

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.900 
under the hood that people couldn't
figure<00:02:38.270> out<00:02:38.920> now<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:39.980> games<00:02:40.310> have<00:02:40.490> people

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
figure out now the games have people

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.150 
figure out now the games have people
could<00:02:41.060> do<00:02:41.270> we're<00:02:41.930> actually<00:02:42.110> very<00:02:42.590> good<00:02:42.860> once

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
could do we're actually very good once

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.770 
could do we're actually very good once
they<00:02:43.340> got<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.610> hang<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.030> some<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
they got the hang of it some of the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.060 
they got the hang of it some of the
early<00:02:45.110> games<00:02:45.320> look<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:47.410> but<00:02:48.410> once<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
early games look like but once the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.520 
early games look like but once the
the<00:02:49.520> system<00:02:50.060> got<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.210> little<00:02:50.390> older<00:02:50.660> like<00:02:51.200> many

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
the system got a little older like many

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.530 
the system got a little older like many
systems<00:02:52.070> when<00:02:52.460> people<00:02:52.790> become<00:02:52.940> familiar<00:02:53.420> with

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
systems when people become familiar with

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.320 
systems when people become familiar with
the<00:02:53.720> hardware<00:02:54.140> then<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.550> do<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:55.970> get<00:02:56.120> some

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
the hardware then you do you get some

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.870 
the hardware then you do you get some
real<00:02:56.510> gems<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.020> come<00:02:57.200> out<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.560> system

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
real gems that I come out of the system

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.110 
real gems that I come out of the system
well<00:02:58.880> first<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.330> all<00:02:59.420> this<00:02:59.780> is<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.020> US<00:03:00.410> version

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120

well first of all this is the US version
as<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.480> can<00:03:02.630> see<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:04.400> has<00:03:04.640> your<00:03:05.030> eject<00:03:05.390> button

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
as you can see it has your eject button

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
as you can see it has your eject button
power<00:03:07.070> and<00:03:07.900> reset<00:03:08.900> right<00:03:09.320> there<00:03:09.880> there's<00:03:10.880> two

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
power and reset right there there's two

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.210 
power and reset right there there's two
controller<00:03:11.480> ports<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.080> front<00:03:12.380> and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.590 
overall it's a good-looking system I
like<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.670> design<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.360> it's<00:03:21.350> pretty<00:03:21.770> sleek

that's<00:04:09.290> another<00:04:10.540> that's<00:04:11.540> for<00:04:11.990> that<00:04:12.350> sega

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
that's another that's for that sega

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.730 
that's another that's for that sega
internet<00:04:14.540> thing<00:04:14.840> that<00:04:15.020> they<00:04:15.140> tried<00:04:15.410> with<00:04:15.650> the

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
internet thing that they tried with the

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.010 
internet thing that they tried with the
saturn<00:04:16.160> that<00:04:16.400> didn't<00:04:16.730> really<00:04:16.880> go<00:04:17.090> too<00:04:17.150> far<00:04:17.510> and

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
saturn that didn't really go too far and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.760 
saturn that didn't really go too far and
then<00:04:18.230> here<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:18.950> where<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.430> backup<00:04:19.820> battery<00:04:20.180> is

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
then here is where the backup battery is

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.620 
then here is where the backup battery is
so<00:04:21.770> if<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:21.979> ever<00:04:22.100> have<00:04:22.340> to<00:04:22.490> replace<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:23.120> that's

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
so if you ever have to replace it that's

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.530 
so if you ever have to replace it that's
where<00:04:23.750> that<00:04:24.350> is<00:04:24.560> as<00:04:25.430> far<00:04:25.570> as<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.840> games<00:04:27.080> ago<00:04:27.380> I

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
where that is as far as the games ago I

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.170 
where that is as far as the games ago I

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
my favorite of that error I had a ps1 I

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.300 
my favorite of that error I had a ps1 I
had<00:04:35.240> an<00:04:35.390> n64<00:04:35.840> but<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.380> always<00:04:36.680> went<00:04:36.860> back<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.190> the

satyr<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:38.540> was<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.720> 2d<00:04:39.140> powerhouse<00:04:39.800> that's<00:04:40.730> what

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
satyr it was a 2d powerhouse that's what

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.050 
satyr it was a 2d powerhouse that's what
Sega<00:04:41.210> intended<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:41.990> be<00:04:42.250> which<00:04:43.250> is<00:04:43.430> why<00:04:43.640> a

Sega intended it to be which is why a

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.170 
lot of the 3d games are not on Saturn
and<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:48.200> ones<00:04:48.590> that<00:04:48.710> they<00:04:49.250> do<00:04:49.310> share<00:04:49.760> with<00:04:50.030> the

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
and the ones that they do share with the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.560 
and the ones that they do share with the
ps1<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:51.590> ps1<00:04:51.950> can<00:04:52.610> do<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.150> little<00:04:53.360> bit

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
ps1 the ps1 can do it a little bit

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.400 
ps1 the ps1 can do it a little bit
better<00:04:54.070> but<00:04:55.070> when<00:04:55.280> it<00:04:55.400> comes<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.760> 2d<00:04:56.090> games

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
better but when it comes to 2d games

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.370 
better but when it comes to 2d games
especially<00:04:57.410> games<00:04:57.950> had<00:04:58.160> used<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.490> ram<00:04:58.670> cart

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
especially games had used a ram cart

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.460 
especially games had used a ram cart
PlayStation<00:05:00.380> 1<00:05:00.410> it's<00:05:01.370> not<00:05:01.790> even<00:05:02.030> comparable

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
PlayStation 1 it's not even comparable

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.200 
PlayStation 1 it's not even comparable
the<00:05:03.470> Saturn<00:05:03.890> just<00:05:04.100> blows<00:05:04.490> it<00:05:04.520> away<00:05:04.760> and

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
the Saturn just blows it away and

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.410 
the Saturn just blows it away and
basically<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.710> said<00:05:07.280> it<00:05:07.400> was<00:05:07.520> on<00:05:07.640> shore<00:05:07.940> the

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
basically I said it was on shore the

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.300 
basically I said it was on shore the
push<00:05:08.630> for<00:05:08.870> 3d<00:05:09.260> at<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.500> time<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:10.700> was<00:05:10.790> pretty<00:05:12.310> it

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
push for 3d at the time it was pretty it

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.580 
push for 3d at the time it was pretty it
was<00:05:13.910> up-and-coming<00:05:14.360> they<00:05:14.960> still<00:05:15.320> thought

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
was up-and-coming they still thought

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.520 
was up-and-coming they still thought
that<00:05:15.920> 2d<00:05:16.280> was<00:05:16.490> where<00:05:16.730> was<00:05:16.970> that<00:05:17.530> obviously

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
that 2d was where was that obviously

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.380 
that 2d was where was that obviously
they<00:05:18.680> were<00:05:18.740> wrong<00:05:19.070> with<00:05:19.520> her<00:05:19.670> success<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.300> the

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
they were wrong with her success of the

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.410 
they were wrong with her success of the
ps1<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:20.930> all<00:05:21.200> their<00:05:21.380> 3d<00:05:21.800> games<00:05:22.120> but<00:05:23.120> overall

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
ps1 and all their 3d games but overall

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.900 
ps1 and all their 3d games but overall
it's<00:05:23.870> a<00:05:24.050> very<00:05:24.080> good<00:05:24.380> system<00:05:24.740> I<00:05:25.130> like<00:05:25.730> the

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
it's a very good system I like the

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.530 
it's a very good system I like the
system<00:05:26.360> it's<00:05:26.600> sleek<00:05:27.140> it<00:05:27.860> looks<00:05:28.130> good<00:05:28.400> it<00:05:28.730> has<00:05:29.480> a

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
system it's sleek it looks good it has a

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.460 
system it's sleek it looks good it has a
great<00:05:30.080> library<00:05:30.500> of<00:05:30.860> games<00:05:31.130> and<00:05:31.900> has<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:32.930> ton<00:05:33.410> of

import<00:05:34.040> games<00:05:34.220> this<00:05:34.490> system<00:05:34.880> last<00:05:35.120> but<00:05:35.360> I

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
import games this system last but I

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.080 
import games this system last but I
believe<00:05:35.660> two<00:05:35.990> years<00:05:36.290> longer<00:05:36.770> in<00:05:36.860> Japan<00:05:37.250> I<00:05:37.490> had

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
believe two years longer in Japan I had

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.160 
believe two years longer in Japan I had
a<00:05:38.120> much<00:05:38.720> bigger<00:05:39.140> fan<00:05:39.530> base<00:05:39.770> over<00:05:40.160> in<00:05:40.280> Japan<00:05:40.610> and

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
a much bigger fan base over in Japan and

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.050 
a much bigger fan base over in Japan and
therefore<00:05:42.170> it<00:05:42.500> does<00:05:42.890> open<00:05:43.190> up<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.790> door<00:05:44.030> for

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
therefore it does open up the door for

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.960 
therefore it does open up the door for
some<00:05:44.510> games<00:05:44.780> though<00:05:45.050> because<00:05:45.620> I<00:05:45.800> lo<00:05:46.250> lot<00:05:46.820> of

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
some games though because I lo lot of

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.030 
some games though because I lo lot of
the<00:05:47.120> games<00:05:47.270> with<00:05:47.540> I've<00:05:47.660> had<00:05:48.230> the<00:05:48.470> past<00:05:48.680> and
