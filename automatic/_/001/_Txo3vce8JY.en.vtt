00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
automatically going to run it going to

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.479 
automatically going to run it going to
take<00:00:55.930> a<00:00:55.960> little<00:00:56.110> bit<00:00:56.350> time<00:00:56.620> because<00:00:56.890> its

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
take a little bit time because its

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.100

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
massive weighs a lot ok so there you go

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.139 
massive weighs a lot ok so there you go
it's<00:01:02.110> kind<00:01:02.260> of<00:01:02.379> big<00:01:02.649> so<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.010> can't<00:01:03.820> you<00:01:04.089> have

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
it's kind of big so you can't you have

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.510 
it's kind of big so you can't you have

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
to move a lot to see everything you

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.539 
to move a lot to see everything you
cannot<00:01:06.790> see<00:01:06.970> all<00:01:07.149> at<00:01:07.299> once<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.250> small
