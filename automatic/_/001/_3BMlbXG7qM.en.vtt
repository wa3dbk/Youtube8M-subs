00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
little dungeon symbol and that's you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.130 
little dungeon symbol and that's you
know<00:00:44.789> where<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> am<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> bank<00:00:46.020> down

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
know where I am there is a bank down

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.260 
know where I am there is a bank down
here<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:47.160> thing<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.700> noticed<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
here one thing that I have noticed is

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.000 
here one thing that I have noticed is
that<00:00:48.329> yes<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.899> big<00:00:49.140> boulder<00:00:49.530> things<00:00:49.770> do

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
that yes these big boulder things do

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.529 
that yes these big boulder things do
fall<00:00:50.340> down<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.000> they<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.300> actually

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
fall down and I think they do actually

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.080 
fall down and I think they do actually
hit<00:00:51.840> your<00:00:52.050> head<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:53.070> probably<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:53.910> does<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
hit your head and I probably just does a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.250 
hit your head and I probably just does a
little<00:00:54.149> bit<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.420> damage<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.199> not

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
little bit of damage to you so I'm not

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.630 
little bit of damage to you so I'm not
too<00:00:55.500> sure<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.309> good<00:00:56.520> for

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
too sure if this is like not good for

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.889 
too sure if this is like not good for
level<00:00:56.879> threes<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.270> there's<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.570> bank<00:00:57.750> down

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
level threes but there's a bank down

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.720 
level threes but there's a bank down
here<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.289> case<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.800> needed<00:00:58.949> some<00:00:59.219> food<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
here in case you needed some food and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
here in case you needed some food and
craft<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> requirement<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.079> 30<00:01:01.350> mining

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
craft and the requirement is 30 mining

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.500 
craft and the requirement is 30 mining
so<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> would<00:01:02.370> assume<00:01:02.489> most<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> guys<00:01:03.300> can

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
so I would assume most of you guys can

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.840 
so I would assume most of you guys can
do<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.629> anyways<00:01:04.129> let<00:01:05.129> me<00:01:05.159> see<00:01:05.309> how<00:01:05.400> much<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.640> guy

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
do it anyways let me see how much my guy

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.880 
do it anyways let me see how much my guy
weighs<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.390> how<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.689> entire<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> 53

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
weighs with how this entire it's a 53

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.620 
weighs with how this entire it's a 53
kilogram<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.430> maybe<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:08.850> an<00:01:08.939> energy<00:01:09.299> pot<00:01:09.479> or

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
kilogram so maybe like an energy pot or

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.600 
kilogram so maybe like an energy pot or
two<00:01:09.780> sometimes<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.159> run<00:01:11.310> back<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
two sometimes then as you run back to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
two sometimes then as you run back to
the<00:01:11.700> middle<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.479> deposit<00:01:13.320> into

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the middle and you just deposit into

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.679 
the middle and you just deposit into
this<00:01:13.740> thing<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> all<00:01:14.939> goes<00:01:15.299> yeah

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
this thing and there it all goes yeah

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.499 
this thing and there it all goes yeah
yeah<00:01:15.840> yeah<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.350> know<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.189> got<00:01:17.369> 240<00:01:17.970> mining

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
yeah yeah I know it's got 240 mining

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
yeah yeah I know it's got 240 mining
experience<00:01:18.659> drop<00:01:19.170> at<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> ending<00:01:19.770> there<00:01:20.100> so

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430

selling in the middle like this guy
right<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.479> train<00:01:30.750> them<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.079> this

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
right here you can train them and this

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.719 
right here you can train them and this
is<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> maybe<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> update<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> would

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
is the maybe is that the update I would

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.280 
is the maybe is that the update I would
think<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.600> probably<00:01:34.020> isn't<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
think because this probably isn't the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.679 
think because this probably isn't the
best<00:01:34.350> place<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:35.070> mining<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:36.119> money<00:01:36.329> or<00:01:36.540> for

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
best place to go mining for money or for

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.560 
best place to go mining for money or for
experience<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> mining

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
experience is that there is a mining

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.690 
experience is that there is a mining
outfit<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.200> old<00:01:40.409> school<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.610> too

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
outfit on old school now I'm not too

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.370 
outfit on old school now I'm not too
sure<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> gives<00:01:42.090> these<00:01:42.240> 5%<00:01:42.899> or<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
sure if it gives these 5% or not like it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.990 
sure if it gives these 5% or not like it
does<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.790> rs3

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
does on rs3

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
does on rs3
I<00:01:45.030> say<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> would<00:01:46.200> assume<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.649> does<00:01:46.829> because<00:01:47.009> I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
I say I would assume it does because I

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.319 
I say I would assume it does because I
don't<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> full<00:01:47.670> outfit<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.000> got<00:01:48.240> like

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
don't have the full outfit I got like

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.210 
don't have the full outfit I got like
the<00:01:48.450> boots<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.840> 20<00:01:49.590> hours<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> next

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220

outfit guys with peer money that's not
how<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.119> works<00:01:57.360> obviously<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.930> place<00:01:58.170> was

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
how it works obviously this place was

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.560 
how it works obviously this place was
created<00:01:58.860> basically<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.540> just

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
created basically for that but you just

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.030 
created basically for that but you just
keep<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:01.049> around<00:02:01.140> mining<00:02:01.680> these<00:02:01.770> things

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
keep going around mining these things

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.039 
keep going around mining these things
off<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.460> walls<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.630> guys<00:02:03.810> saw<00:02:03.990> you

off of the walls and as you guys saw you

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.389 
off of the walls and as you guys saw you
go<00:02:04.229> back<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> middle<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.979> pause<00:02:05.189> it

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
go back to the middle you to pause it

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.039 
go back to the middle you to pause it
into<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> little<00:02:05.790> cart<00:02:06.090> thingy<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:06.899> you

into a little cart thingy and then you

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.960 
into a little cart thingy and then you
loot<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> sack<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.670> are<00:02:08.849> lucky

work let me just hammer it now looking
at<00:02:24.820> my<00:02:24.940> Orion<00:02:25.270> thing<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.660> looks<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.200> far

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
at my Orion thing it looks like so far

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.030 
at my Orion thing it looks like so far
I've<00:02:26.650> gained<00:02:27.070> like<00:02:27.630> 3k<00:02:28.630> experience<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.650> mining

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
I've gained like 3k experience in mining

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.970 
I've gained like 3k experience in mining
at<00:02:30.250> 21k<00:02:30.910> experience<00:02:31.360> an<00:02:31.480> hour<00:02:31.830> which<00:02:32.830> is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
at 21k experience an hour which is

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.590 
at 21k experience an hour which is
obviously<00:02:33.340> pretty<00:02:33.610> bad<00:02:33.880> but<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.240> slacked

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
obviously pretty bad but I have slacked

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.720 
obviously pretty bad but I have slacked
off<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.810> little<00:02:35.020> bit<00:02:35.290> but<00:02:35.620> yeah<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.250> place<00:02:36.460> is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
off a little bit but yeah this place is

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.250 
off a little bit but yeah this place is
probably<00:02:36.910> not<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.330> best<00:02:37.360> out<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.960> go<00:02:38.080> and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
probably not the best out you go and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.040 
probably not the best out you go and
train<00:02:38.530> yourself<00:02:38.650> you're<00:02:39.070> mining<00:02:39.400> level<00:02:40.020> but<00:02:41.020> I

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
train yourself you're mining level but I

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.270 
train yourself you're mining level but I
guess<00:02:41.230> if<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.470> want<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.680> get<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.830> outfit<00:02:42.130> its

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
guess if you want to get the outfit its

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.920 
guess if you want to get the outfit its
pilot<00:02:42.580> worth<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.880> if<00:02:43.060> you're<00:02:43.270> going<00:02:43.420> for<00:02:43.630> 200

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
pilot worth it if you're going for 200

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.330 
pilot worth it if you're going for 200
no<00:02:44.020> mining<00:02:44.380> it's<00:02:44.560> definitely<00:02:45.040> worth<00:02:45.160> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
no mining it's definitely worth the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.270 
no mining it's definitely worth the
outfit<00:02:45.640> if<00:02:45.760> you're<00:02:45.940> not<00:02:46.350> then<00:02:47.350> probably<00:02:48.190> not

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
outfit if you're not then probably not

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.280 
outfit if you're not then probably not
really<00:02:48.580> worth<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.910> actually<00:02:49.480> going<00:02:49.750> for<00:02:49.870> 99<00:02:50.260> I

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
really worth it actually going for 99 I

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.600 
really worth it actually going for 99 I
would<00:02:50.530> assume<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:50.920> probably<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.280> worth<00:02:51.430> it

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
would assume it probably is worth it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.030 
would assume it probably is worth it
because<00:02:51.760> takes<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.690> long-ass<00:02:53.200> time<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.740> get<00:02:53.890> to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
because takes a long-ass time to get to

think<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:31.389> honestly<00:04:31.540> totally<00:04:32.199> worth<00:04:32.350> dem

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
think it's honestly totally worth dem

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.879 
think it's honestly totally worth dem
unless<00:04:32.740> you're<00:04:32.889> going<00:04:33.040> 499<00:04:33.669> cuz<00:04:33.910> that's<00:04:34.090> like

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
unless you're going 499 cuz that's like

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.129 
unless you're going 499 cuz that's like
500<00:04:35.889> didn't<00:04:36.699> like<00:04:36.850> me<00:04:36.940> like<00:04:37.090> 600<00:04:37.630> K<00:04:37.750> experience

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
500 didn't like me like 600 K experience

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.900 
500 didn't like me like 600 K experience
you<00:04:38.259> save<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:39.070> gotta<00:04:39.310> remember<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.610> arguing

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
you save you gotta remember you arguing

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.029 
you save you gotta remember you arguing
20k<00:04:40.630> experience<00:04:41.080> an<00:04:41.169> hour<00:04:41.289> while<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:41.620> train

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
20k experience an hour while you train

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.189 
20k experience an hour while you train
here<00:04:42.250> so<00:04:42.430> if<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.639> takes<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.940> like<00:04:43.090> 30<00:04:43.750> hours

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
here so if it takes you like 30 hours

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.379 
here so if it takes you like 30 hours
you<00:04:44.320> will<00:04:44.470> still<00:04:44.680> get<00:04:44.770> 300<00:04:45.220> K<00:04:45.340> whining<00:04:45.759> but<00:04:46.300> if

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
you will still get 300 K whining but if

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.850 
you will still get 300 K whining but if
you<00:04:46.509> were<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.660> be<00:04:46.750> training<00:04:47.020> mining<00:04:47.530> okay

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
you were to be training mining okay

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.020 
you were to be training mining okay
maybe<00:04:48.070> hopefully<00:04:48.310> does<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:48.610> take<00:04:48.699> you<00:04:48.789> 30

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
maybe hopefully does it take you 30

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.909 
maybe hopefully does it take you 30
hours<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:49.479> it's<00:04:49.570> not<00:04:49.720> worth<00:04:49.900> getting<00:04:50.050> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
hours and it's not worth getting the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.590 
hours and it's not worth getting the
cutoff<00:04:51.190> point<00:04:51.310> is<00:04:51.759> probably<00:04:52.210> if<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.419> takes

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
cutoff point is probably if it takes

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.840 
cutoff point is probably if it takes
around<00:04:52.720> 15<00:04:52.990> hours<00:04:53.620> cuz<00:04:53.800> 15<00:04:54.160> hours<00:04:54.520> if<00:04:54.729> you're

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
around 15 hours cuz 15 hours if you're

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.909 
around 15 hours cuz 15 hours if you're
go<00:04:55.000> mining<00:04:55.630> I'm<00:04:56.199> not<00:04:56.350> going<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.560> sure<00:04:56.710> how<00:04:56.770> much

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
go mining I'm not going to sure how much

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.159 
go mining I'm not going to sure how much
mining<00:04:57.430> spirits<00:04:57.880> are<00:04:58.120> I<00:04:58.150> guess<00:04:58.360> for<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.990> lower

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
mining spirits are I guess for the lower

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.980 
mining spirits are I guess for the lower
levels<00:04:59.620> I<00:04:59.710> know<00:04:59.770> it's<00:05:00.039> like<00:05:00.160> around<00:05:00.340> 40k

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
levels I know it's like around 40k

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.120 
levels I know it's like around 40k
well<00:05:01.990> maybe<00:05:02.260> 50<00:05:02.620> if<00:05:02.710> you're<00:05:02.889> repeating

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
well maybe 50 if you're repeating

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.890 
well maybe 50 if you're repeating
