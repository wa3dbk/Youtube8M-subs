00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.259 

all<00:00:05.589> right<00:00:05.830> the<00:00:06.040> beginning<00:00:06.430> stages<00:00:06.729> of<00:00:06.939> my

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:07.269 
all right the beginning stages of my

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:09.020 
all right the beginning stages of my
mausoleum

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
mausoleum

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.070 
mausoleum
so<00:00:11.459> formula<00:00:12.459> as<00:00:12.760> you<00:00:12.910> can<00:00:13.029> see<00:00:13.180> one<00:00:13.420> inch<00:00:13.570> thick

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
so formula as you can see one inch thick

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.730 
so formula as you can see one inch thick
I<00:00:14.340> cut<00:00:15.340> cut<00:00:16.000> this<00:00:16.119> into<00:00:16.510> four<00:00:17.050> four<00:00:17.260> sections

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
I cut cut this into four four sections

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.760 
I cut cut this into four four sections
so<00:00:18.010> just<00:00:18.340> chopped<00:00:18.880> it<00:00:19.029> anyway<00:00:19.420> a<00:00:19.660> foot<00:00:20.439> and<00:00:20.680> a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
so just chopped it anyway a foot and a

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.850 
so just chopped it anyway a foot and a
half<00:00:20.800> and<00:00:21.750> great<00:00:22.750> thing<00:00:22.930> about<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.350> formula

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
half and great thing about the formula

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.620 
half and great thing about the formula
is<00:00:24.550> that<00:00:24.940> it<00:00:25.750> has<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:27.310> little<00:00:27.580> edge<00:00:27.970> here<00:00:28.449> the

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
is that it has this little edge here the

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.540 
is that it has this little edge here the
where<00:00:28.779> they<00:00:28.960> can<00:00:29.140> meet<00:00:29.740> and<00:00:29.920> they<00:00:30.220> join

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
where they can meet and they join

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.209 
where they can meet and they join
together<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.840> added<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.529> little<00:00:32.739> bit<00:00:32.980> of<00:00:33.190> a

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
together so added a little bit of a

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.660 
together so added a little bit of a
liquid<00:00:34.180> nails<00:00:34.420> did<00:00:35.230> a<00:00:35.320> bead<00:00:35.530> in<00:00:35.559> there<00:00:36.010> so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
liquid nails did a bead in there so

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.169 
liquid nails did a bead in there so
that's<00:00:36.879> all<00:00:37.059> stuck<00:00:37.300> together<00:00:38.729> this<00:00:39.729> is<00:00:39.879> a<00:00:39.909> one

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
that's all stuck together this is a one

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.090 
that's all stuck together this is a one
by<00:00:40.359> two<00:00:40.390> no<00:00:40.929> I<00:00:40.960> wasn't<00:00:41.199> really<00:00:41.440> going<00:00:41.829> to<00:00:41.890> do<00:00:41.979> it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
by two no I wasn't really going to do it

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.410 
by two no I wasn't really going to do it
this<00:00:42.249> way<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.870> I<00:00:43.929> had<00:00:44.260> already<00:00:45.059> liquid<00:00:46.059> you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
this way but I had already liquid you

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.000 
this way but I had already liquid you
know<00:00:46.510> use<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.839> liquid<00:00:47.109> nails<00:00:47.319> and<00:00:47.679> attached

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
know use the liquid nails and attached

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.289 
know use the liquid nails and attached
it<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.339> the<00:00:48.579> one<00:00:48.760> by<00:00:48.909> twos<00:00:49.499> and<00:00:50.819> well<00:00:51.819> it's<00:00:52.030> it's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
it to the one by twos and well it's it's

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:53.910 
it to the one by twos and well it's it's
probably<00:00:52.690> okay<00:00:53.049> though<00:00:53.289> because<00:00:53.469> then<00:00:53.679> I<00:00:53.769> can

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
probably okay though because then I can

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.680 
probably okay though because then I can
at<00:00:53.979> least<00:00:54.069> take<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.429> side<00:00:54.639> panels<00:00:55.210> off<00:00:55.420> and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
at least take the side panels off and

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.809 
at least take the side panels off and
store<00:00:55.870> them<00:00:56.049> in<00:00:56.139> the<00:00:56.229> basement<00:00:56.409> and<00:00:56.859> leave<00:00:57.639> the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:57.819 
store them in the basement and leave the

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:02.549 
store them in the basement and leave the
frame<00:00:58.059> up<00:00:58.299> here<00:00:59.190> so<00:01:00.389> we<00:01:01.389> have<00:01:01.569> both<00:01:01.809> sides<00:01:02.139> are

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
frame up here so we have both sides are

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.820 
frame up here so we have both sides are
done<00:01:02.799> and<00:01:03.069> attached<00:01:03.459> and<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:05.140> frame<00:01:05.440> is

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
done and attached and the frame is

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.120 
done and attached and the frame is
really<00:01:06.010> simple<00:01:06.520> it's<00:01:06.700> two<00:01:06.909> by<00:01:07.090> three<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.860> top

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
really simple it's two by three the top

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.960 
really simple it's two by three the top
this<00:01:09.370> is<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.580> four<00:01:09.880> forty<00:01:10.720> five<00:01:10.750> inch<00:01:11.110> section

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
this is a four forty five inch section

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.040 
this is a four forty five inch section
this<00:01:12.970> is<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.210> six<00:01:13.510> foot<00:01:13.720> long<00:01:13.980> piece<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.330> you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
this is a six foot long piece so I you

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.930 
this is a six foot long piece so I you
know<00:01:17.110> screwed<00:01:17.650> a<00:01:17.800> menu<00:01:18.010> thing<00:01:18.400> about<00:01:18.610> four

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
know screwed a menu thing about four

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.000 
know screwed a menu thing about four
inch<00:01:19.120> nails<00:01:20.280> these<00:01:21.280> were<00:01:21.550> some<00:01:21.790> sections<00:01:22.300> of

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
inch nails these were some sections of

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.730 
inch nails these were some sections of
pallet<00:01:24.010> you<00:01:24.340> know<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.760> I<00:01:24.820> had<00:01:24.970> left<00:01:25.210> over

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
pallet you know that I had left over

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.990 
pallet you know that I had left over
which<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:26.950> good<00:01:27.190> because<00:01:27.370> I<00:01:27.640> didn't<00:01:27.910> buy

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
which is good because I didn't buy

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.320 
which is good because I didn't buy
enough<00:01:28.300> wood<00:01:28.600> so<00:01:28.870> I<00:01:28.930> used<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.230> pallet<00:01:30.330> she

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
enough wood so I used the pallet she

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.210 
enough wood so I used the pallet she
kind<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.660> hold<00:01:31.870> the<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.380> rest<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.830> the

kind of hold the the rest of the the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.400 
kind of hold the the rest of the the
framing<00:01:33.670> together

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410

being<00:01:44.290> Labor<00:01:44.680> Day<00:01:44.860> weekend<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.760> guess<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:46.330> still

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
being Labor Day weekend I guess I still

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.870 
being Labor Day weekend I guess I still
have<00:01:46.750> them<00:01:46.870> at<00:01:47.050> 299<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:47.890> I'm<00:01:48.220> sure<00:01:48.430> if<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.640> hold

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
have them at 299 and I'm sure if I hold

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.970 
have them at 299 and I'm sure if I hold
off<00:01:49.090> for<00:01:49.270> another<00:01:49.360> few<00:01:49.720> weeks<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:50.200> could<00:01:50.740> find

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
off for another few weeks I could find

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.920 
off for another few weeks I could find
pulling<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.370> rules<00:01:51.580> for<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.240> cheaper<00:01:52.720> price

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
pulling the rules for a cheaper price

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.560 
pulling the rules for a cheaper price
but<00:01:53.580> didn't<00:01:54.580> feel<00:01:54.670> like<00:01:54.820> waiting<00:01:55.030> want<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.480> get

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
but didn't feel like waiting want to get

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.750 
but didn't feel like waiting want to get
the<00:01:55.659> project<00:01:56.110> going<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:56.860> what<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.159> did<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.490> I<00:01:57.580> use

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
the project going so what I did is I use

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.700 
the project going so what I did is I use
that<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.630> pipe<00:01:58.870> insulation<00:01:59.440> and<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.780> just<00:02:02.380> kind

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
that the pipe insulation and I just kind

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.160 
that the pipe insulation and I just kind
of<00:02:02.860> expanded<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:03.909> wrapped<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.540> around<00:02:04.630> the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
of expanded it wrapped it around the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.550 
of expanded it wrapped it around the
edge<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:06.430> two<00:02:06.700> inch<00:02:06.880> formula<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.720> then

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
edge of this two inch formula and then

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.670 
edge of this two inch formula and then
kind<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.209> spread<00:02:10.209> out<00:02:10.390> spread<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.140> out<00:02:11.319> as<00:02:11.530> I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
kind of spread out spread it out as I

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.369 
kind of spread out spread it out as I
glued<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.190> on<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:13.030> was<00:02:13.209> kind<00:02:13.719> of<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.959> bitch<00:02:14.139> doing

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
glued it on it was kind of a bitch doing

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.009 
glued it on it was kind of a bitch doing
it<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.739> way<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.909> could<00:02:16.030> also<00:02:16.060> fill<00:02:16.629> it<00:02:16.810> with

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
it that way you could also fill it with

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.180 
it that way you could also fill it with
some<00:02:17.499> plastic

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
some plastic

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.490 
some plastic
these<00:02:18.430> are<00:02:18.700> some<00:02:18.850> other<00:02:18.940> crap<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.900> bulk<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.320> up

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
these are some other crap to bulk it up

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.050 
these are some other crap to bulk it up
and<00:02:20.680> then<00:02:20.800> just<00:02:20.980> blew<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.460> whole<00:02:21.610> thing<00:02:21.670> on

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
and then just blew the whole thing on

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.940 
and then just blew the whole thing on
there<00:02:22.360> which<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.690> did<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> few<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.650> those<00:02:23.800> but

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
there which I did on a few of those but

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.100 
there which I did on a few of those but
so<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.100> all<00:02:27.220> kinds<00:02:27.460> of<00:02:27.490> various<00:02:27.850> pieces<00:02:28.780> we

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
so it's all kinds of various pieces we

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.370 
so it's all kinds of various pieces we
got<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> 2-inch<00:02:29.590> piece<00:02:30.120> we<00:02:31.120> got<00:02:31.360> two<00:02:31.990> 2-inch

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
got a 2-inch piece we got two 2-inch

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.830 
got a 2-inch piece we got two 2-inch
pieces<00:02:32.620> glued<00:02:33.010> together<00:02:33.190> there<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:34.660> that

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
pieces glued together there so that

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.200 
pieces glued together there so that
makes<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.290> entire<00:02:35.410> column<00:02:38.700> then<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.730> started

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
makes the entire column then I started

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.840 
makes the entire column then I started
to<00:02:40.300> carve<00:02:40.510> some<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.960> stone<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.920> used<00:02:42.760> to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
to carve some of the stone in I used to

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.510 
to carve some of the stone in I used to
dremel<00:02:43.270> for<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.740> I'll<00:02:44.740> probably<00:02:44.890> use<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.280> hot

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
dremel for that I'll probably use a hot

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.850 
dremel for that I'll probably use a hot
tool<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.180> Dremel<00:02:46.810> metal<00:02:47.350> very<00:02:47.560> back<00:02:47.830> and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
tool and Dremel metal very back and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.170 
tool and Dremel metal very back and
forth<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:49.060> add<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:49.450> rest<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.870> detail<00:02:51.180> so

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
forth to add the rest of the detail so

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
forth to add the rest of the detail so
the<00:02:52.330> yesterday<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.200> other<00:02:53.380> column<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:55.200> this

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
the yesterday the other column and this

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.090 
the yesterday the other column and this
is<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.680> rough<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:59.740> rough<00:03:00.070> shell<00:03:01.770> all<00:03:02.770> right

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
is the rough the rough shell all right

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.850 
is the rough the rough shell all right
me<00:03:03.370> millions<00:03:03.820> before<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.930> paint<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.590> thought<00:03:05.830> I

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
me millions before I paint I thought I

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.990 
me millions before I paint I thought I
would<00:03:06.040> take<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.310> second<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.870> show<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.860> where<00:03:09.640> we

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
would take a second to show you where we

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.030 
would take a second to show you where we
are<00:03:10.180> at<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:12.030> am<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:16.480> it's<00:03:16.660> various<00:03:17.230> pieces

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
are at and I am so it's various pieces

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.090 
are at and I am so it's various pieces
of<00:03:18.220> two-inch<00:03:19.090> formula<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.930> one-inch<00:03:20.470> formula

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
of two-inch formula a one-inch formula

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.490 
of two-inch formula a one-inch formula
and<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:22.090> actually<00:03:22.300> got<00:03:22.750> some<00:03:23.020> white<00:03:23.200> beaded

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
and I actually got some white beaded

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.040 
and I actually got some white beaded
foam<00:03:23.860> which<00:03:24.610> they<00:03:24.970> started<00:03:25.330> stocking<00:03:25.630> at<00:03:25.900> Home

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
foam which they started stocking at Home

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.470 
foam which they started stocking at Home
Depot<00:03:26.080> which<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.890> was<00:03:27.040> surprised<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.580> see<00:03:27.610> so<00:03:27.970> I

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
Depot which I was surprised to see so I

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.050 
Depot which I was surprised to see so I
grabbed<00:03:28.780> some<00:03:29.220> it's<00:03:30.220> really<00:03:30.310> not<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:30.700> much

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
grabbed some it's really not that much

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.600 
grabbed some it's really not that much
cheaper<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:31.900> it's<00:03:32.709> apparently<00:03:33.220> asked<00:03:33.400> to

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
cheaper and it's apparently asked to

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.260 
cheaper and it's apparently asked to
work<00:03:33.790> with<00:03:34.060> but<00:03:34.300> I<00:03:34.330> just<00:03:34.570> thought<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.750> would<00:03:34.840> try

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
work with but I just thought I would try

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.330 
work with but I just thought I would try
doing<00:03:37.270> some<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.660> edging<00:03:38.020> with<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.410> as<00:03:39.070> I

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
doing some of the edging with it as I

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.900 
doing some of the edging with it as I
did<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.950> used<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.580> dremel<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.840> cut<00:03:44.200> out<00:03:44.230> a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
did I used a dremel and I cut out a

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.800 
did I used a dremel and I cut out a
basically<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:45.970> probably<00:03:46.180> took<00:03:46.360> about<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.630> a

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
basically I probably took about a a

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.530 
basically I probably took about a a
three<00:03:47.260> or<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.590> quarter<00:03:48.130> of<00:03:48.280> an<00:03:48.400> inch<00:03:48.670> out<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.060> the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
three or a quarter of an inch out of the

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.860 
three or a quarter of an inch out of the
foam<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.250> then<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.280> drew<00:03:51.790> some<00:03:52.090> lines<00:03:52.120> through

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
foam and then I drew some lines through

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.710 
foam and then I drew some lines through
and<00:03:53.140> I<00:03:53.200> made<00:03:53.410> some<00:03:53.620> bricks<00:03:54.450> using<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.540> hot

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
and I made some bricks using the hot

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.690 
and I made some bricks using the hot
tool<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:57.489> just<00:03:57.550> carved<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:59.010> then<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.100> add<00:04:00.310> a

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
tool it just carved and then I add a

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.220 
tool it just carved and then I add a
little<00:04:01.060> roughness<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.840> there<00:04:01.989> was<00:04:02.080> already

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
little roughness and there was already

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.840 
little roughness and there was already
some<00:04:02.560> roughness<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.250> because<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.730> the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
some roughness to it because of the

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.380 
some roughness to it because of the
Dremel<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:05.019> added<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:05.380> little<00:04:05.410> bit<00:04:05.920> more

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
Dremel and I added a little bit more

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.080 
Dremel and I added a little bit more
with<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.660> hot<00:04:07.900> tool<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:09.220> we<00:04:09.370> made<00:04:09.550> a<00:04:09.580> couple<00:04:09.850> of

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
with the hot tool so we made a couple of

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.300 
with the hot tool so we made a couple of
patches<00:04:10.269> on<00:04:10.660> that<00:04:10.870> side<00:04:11.140> then<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:11.980> took<00:04:12.070> the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
patches on that side then I took the

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.400 
patches on that side then I took the
great<00:04:12.459> stuff<00:04:12.850> foam<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.630> made<00:04:13.840> some<00:04:14.080> vines

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
great stuff foam and I made some vines

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.759 
great stuff foam and I made some vines
climbing<00:04:15.100> up<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.340> side<00:04:16.109> here<00:04:17.109> is<00:04:17.380> my

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
climbing up the side here is my

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.680 
climbing up the side here is my
completed<00:04:18.930> mausoleum

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
completed mausoleum

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.650 
completed mausoleum
I<00:04:22.130> just<00:04:23.130> added<00:04:23.310> some<00:04:23.640> moss<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.270> little<00:04:24.510> bit

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
I just added some moss and a little bit

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.160 
I just added some moss and a little bit
of<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.840> touch<00:04:25.410> up<00:04:25.650> on<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.790> vines<00:04:27.060> which<00:04:27.780> I<00:04:27.960> made

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
of a touch up on the vines which I made

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.470 
of a touch up on the vines which I made
with<00:04:28.320> great<00:04:28.530> stuff<00:04:28.800> foam<00:04:29.100> by<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.760> way<00:04:30.000> total

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480
