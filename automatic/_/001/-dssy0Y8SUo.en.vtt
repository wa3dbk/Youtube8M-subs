00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.830
 Now we're going to talk about a reality. 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.000
 very common in various properties 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.860
 brazilian 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.340
 I'm talking about properties that have to 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.350
 small to medium size but this one is 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.250
 a fairly common reality is a 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.350
 picket 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.910
 we have here about a hectare 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.340
 area that has high rate turnover 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.570
 of stocking or the cart does not grow 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.730
 very sure 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.070
 he gets one with that height of 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.850
 about 40 to 50 centimeters in the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.890
 maximum 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.770
 And then I love that you're at home and you're 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.690
 identifying with this reality he does not 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.450
 need a professional brushcutter 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.340
 At 40 he has something for him. 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.260
 I liked it, it was semi professional 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.620
 is 22 6 2 2 6 er cleavers 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.690
 semi professional 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.969
 only then is it ideal for this kind of 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.780
 folder that is exactly one more step 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.180
 low 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.039
 usually an exact brachial shape 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.409
 twist if you formatted scenes she is not a 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.740
 machine so big but it is not a machine 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.740
 So small is she an average machine to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.020
 service is semi-professional as it is 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.610
 needing not see here does not arrive 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.530
 to be such a high price a price so 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.210
 down an intermediate machine 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.409
 It's good to make sure that several 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.450
 people we are watching in this 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.670
 moment they identified with this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.930
 machine and there are already wanting to know 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.880
 little more about it 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 I'll talk a bit about power with 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.189
 clÃ¡udio to 22 000 r it has 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 approximately 25 hp and 1.1 hp 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.229
 look at friends a point a horse 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.439
 power with hiv about 25 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.650
 cylinder and is a machine 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.290
 semi professional 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.810
 that is one more time but explaining to 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.630
 Me, who is at home? He identified himself. 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.659
 with this here pasture picket 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.189
 rotated with high rotation rate and 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.079
 So I 'm talking to you, not me. 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.850
 sorry you have a little 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.280
 property an average property 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.130
 works with a farm that is more than 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.600
 dairy or else areas or else 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.770
 that has a lot of horse 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.280
 so my friend you should have a 226 in 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.280

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.330
 ah 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.080
 haha ha 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.780
 you can compare the productivity of the 226 is 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.550
 with a person working manually 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.830
 you can not compare with productivity 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.010
 your brush will triple four times 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.560
 the productivity understood my friend there 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.020

 three men to four men working 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.260
 manually in the sickle 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.460

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.200

 school and iron blocks is here in the area of 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.580
 mall 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.540
 today the day of a man who makes and 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.650
 because it is more or less 60 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.630
 real 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.650
 you're talking to me only me that is 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.430

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.800
 day 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.100
 if he has 226 r doing 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.810
 exactly it will work for three to 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.790
 four people went quiet 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.650
 economy of labor economy of 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.020
 and there also gives uniformity 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.420
 the family cutting the cut cot 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.860
 perfect will stay those ripples 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.170
 same on flowers 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.180
 now the man must be wondering 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:50.480
 the fuel consumption of that brand 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.480
 she goes 500 ml in the tank and she works 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:57.380
 around one hour and 21 hours and 15 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.720
 hours and 15 hours and 21 hours and 15 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.100
 hour and twenty minutes with only half 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.810
 liter of fuel 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.210
 I mean, I think if your friend 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.550
 works all day he'll spend 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.400
 less than 3 liters of fuel and three 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.950
 beds to make that wonderful mowing 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.110
 but something else with the change is 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.030
 asking is the one who has a 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.580
 minor rural property 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.590
 who works with milk or with the horse 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.470
 or even time for leisure 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.800
 this friend usually has one 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.790
 residence that he uses as a home and to donate 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.610
 on property 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.280
 and there must have an orchard are garden he 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.100
 you must be asking yourself 26 is it only 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.590

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.990

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.840
 spoke to small small homes 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.540
 places where there is an air as soon as 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.990
