00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.400
 Welcome and welcome to your channel 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.879
 psycho mathematics today alfonso educator and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.889
 today we are going to work the percent 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:17.400
 two types of exercises we go for the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.000
 first we express as a decimal number 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.190
 the bearing forgiveness percentage 75% 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.880
 remember that to calculate the percentage 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.570
 of a number is to multiply that number 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 for the desired percent of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.380
 agreement and always divided by 100 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.160
 parts among 100 in this case we're going to 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.680
 relate it here if I want to express 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.340
 75 percent the decimal number we have 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.570
 to know that how much is the both 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.900
 hundred that we have caught 75 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.910
 and you have to divide it by the amount 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.520
 total of parts 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:06.630
 I repeat 100 parts then 75 between 100 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.240
 we do the division as such and we know 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.710
 that by dividing a figure by 100 the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.170
 comma runs from two places to the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:19.920
 left as many places as zeros 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:22.050
 you indicate 1 and 2 I finally have 0.75 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 you see, this is the meaning of both 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.190
 percent a fraction in the carnival 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.340
 I have a percentage and below the 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.200
 Total well over one hundred percent 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.850
 one hundred percent the total of the parties 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.100
 I take 75 I represent it in fraction I put 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.750
 the decimal number and I have already answered the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.170
 exercise we are going to put 21% 21% as 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.600
 it would be a bit of the same how many parts 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.750
 we take in total 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.509
 good denominator the total and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.479
 specifically how much does the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.140
 so much percent that I have caught on that 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.960
 total 21 21 percent can be put 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.149
 as 21 party of 100 we do the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.800
 division and again the same two places 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.260
 to the left the comma here the like here 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.020
 0.21 would be the decimal figure a detail 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.160
 that I did not mention before on the channel 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.860
 Spain well the decimal point is a comma 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.880
 not a point is worth in other countries is a 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.470
 dot 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.540
 I always add the decimal point 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.880
 how we work here with a comma 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.000
 well we continue but you know a detail 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.640
 important we indicate the percentage that 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.760
 corresponds to good because now we give 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.260
 the return to the tortilla agreed before 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.500
 about a decimal figure percentage now 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.710
 over a decimal figure the percentage of 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.180
 agreement here we would have the first two 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.720
 and well then we make 087 we had it 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.680
 what I call the fraction 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.900
 generatrix what does that mean about 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.120
 generating fraction a tenth 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.770
 we go to fraction in the channel it has 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.510
 worked the generating fraction of 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.960
 agreement if you remember this is a number 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.400
 exact decimal therefore it was put 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:17.280
 the whole part that was 87 and in the 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.760
 denominator worth 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.100
 as many zeros as eat well in this case 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.740
 a 1 and a decimal other decimal two zeros 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.980
 0.87 2.087 match of 100 and here 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.860
 we visualize that about the total how much 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.190
 I have specifically picked up 87 parts 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:44.810
 about 100 parts lame 87 what it indicates 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:48.180
 that I have caught 87% and 0.87 is 87% 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:54.819
 there is another trick that students do and 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:04:00.280
 is multiply in this case it is worth 0.87 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:04.150
 per hundred well and 0 87% is 87 87 for 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.430
 one hundred and three match of 5 here you can 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.430
 do two ways the first one to me 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.120
 is the one that I like would be what I'm going to do 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.550
 with another color 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.140
 come with blue 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.140
 let's put colors 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:25.659
 first way and this the cabin like in 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:28.490
 how many parts divided in total 5 1 2 3 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.690
 4 and 5 equal parts more or less equal 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.379
 that has not come out very accurate but 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:39.710
 we go 1 2 3 4 and 5 equal parts and of 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:43.460
 those five parts how many I take 1 2 and 3 and 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:48.080
 set the total to how much it equals 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:52.729
 one hundred percent if I divide according to the 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:56.289
 one hundred percent in five parts 100 between 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:01.919
 5 of 20 agree then 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:05.399
 each part is equivalent to 20% what you see 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.399
 each part 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.080
 20 percent and without the exercise I'm 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.800
 indicating that from 5 parts the one 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:23.680
 divided the total I'm taking 3 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:25.569
 1 2 and 3 how much I have taken in total 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.990
 as you see 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:33.099
 60 percent that would be the solution 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.659
 of the exercise well anyway I know 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.909
 that in the exam the students this of 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.490
 draw then man is a very form 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:42.339
 logical to see it but I know they do not like it 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:46.029
 that he likes to do more than this 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:49.179
 in dividing 3 by 5 well then we're going 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:52.599
 to do here 3 out of 5 like this figure 

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:58.040
 smaller that is zero comma adds a 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:06:03.310
 0 16 agree and 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.310
 3 between 5 would be 0.6 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.120
 you see it and now 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.840
 this is telling me that if I 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.430
 multiplied in agreement by a hundred remember 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.260
 what I have told you before the trick of the 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.960
 students, I will do it like that if I 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:29.169
 multiplied by 100 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:33.940
 according to the end 0 6% would be 60 the 60% 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:36.729
 you see it in the first type I divided or what 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.639
 I went to the generating fraction because I was 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:42.819
 you see it divided by 100 then it 's 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:46.240
 a very visual and very fast way of 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.860
 get 87% or multiply the number 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.979
 decimal which is what the 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.680
 students per hundred and directly 87% 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:57.220
 here it justifies it in two ways with a 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.220
 drawing or taking out the decimal figure of 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:04.320
 this fraction that is 0.6 and multiplying 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:08.800
 for 100 that in the end I get 60% you see 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.800
 several ways to go from decimal to 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.360
 so much percent and this has been all already 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.610
 you know if there is any doubt please 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.650
 contact me through the channel if 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.960
 you liked the video like share it 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.110
 subscribe and see you in the next 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.930
 videos of xico math 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.810
 lowering problem resolution with 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:30.320
 percent thanks for being there and 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.320
 go for it
