gonna cut a line with the jigsaw and
connect<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> holes<00:01:29.909> after<00:01:30.360> Shawn<00:01:30.600> cuts<00:01:30.840> our

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
so now the next step is we're going to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.820 
so now the next step is we're going to
put<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> couple<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.180> points<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:58.560> hold<00:02:58.740> the
