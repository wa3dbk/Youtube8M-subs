 innovative and highly adjustable support 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.450
 allowing you to work in different 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.670
 positions 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.290
 the support is against heavy in a way 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 that the screen can be extended more 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.180
 beyond the edge of your desk like 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.669
 result the armed support and weight of the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.920
 screen is approximately 64 pounds 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.540
 for your safety, follow the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.640
 instructions printed on the packaging 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.620
 original that include assistance for 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.680
 remove and install the click on your 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.510
 desk you will frequently be 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.210
 adding the screen to a system 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.239
 existing now we will show you the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.010
 configuration for double screen 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.180
 our installation instructions are 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.070
 apply in any case 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.100
 the easiest thing is to think about downtown 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.680
 like two devices on a screen and 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.500
 a digitizing table make sure 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.400
 that everything is turned off your equipment and you without 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.700
 ticket 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.160
 Now let's check the cables when you take out 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.430
 to feel from the box you will find the cable 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.830
 video and power connection 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.810
 a usb cable 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.910
 at this point you must choose what connection 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.490
 of video you would like to use by 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.370
 defect the digital cable dvi is already 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.600
 you can connect directly to 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.570
 a dvi connection or a dvi adapter like this 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.780
 as well as hd e-mails with mini hdmi 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.880
 for travel adapters if you choose 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.560
 displayport connection use it 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.650
 you can find inside the part 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.750
 back of the holder when using a display 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.060
 port or a mini for an adapter 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.200
 display completely will deliver to your 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.180
 better color and quality 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.189
 just pull out these screws in the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.890
 cable compartment to access the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.770
 Displayport cable pulls out the cable eyelet 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.380
 from the bein cable next to the cable 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.320
 displayport then put it back in 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.660
 position since you will not use 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.150
 the cable should roll it in place 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.250
 of the display cable then 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.000
 replaces the compartment cover 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.130
 on the back of the stand 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.470
 If you ever need to replace a 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.840
 cable you are two panels in the part 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.390
 back of the belt cover the connection 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.850
 of the cables 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.440
 connect the video cable you want to 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.250
 corresponding port on your computer 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.470
 connect the usb cable to your computer this 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.170
 it's the way I felt it delivered 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.670
 the information to your tablet connects the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.740
 electrical connection to the source of 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.350
 feed and then to a take 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.110
 current confirms that the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.670
 light in the power source now using 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.050
 the power button on the part 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.390
 later on the right side of the 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.819
 screen turn on you felt that then 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.410
 turn on your equipment doing this in 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.690
 order you will make sure that your equipment 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.570
 recognize the belt as a screen 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.760
 connected during boot on a mac 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.250
 most likely I felt it like 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.730
 extra the default background of the marq but 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.310
 nothing else for now this is normal in a 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.470
 pc you need to set up the centic in the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.260
 screen configurations to make 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.810
 This sees the start menu panel 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.510
 control then depending on your view 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.610
 of the control panel choose screen or 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.180
 from appearances and customization 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.680
 choose screen resolution setting 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.670
 You can also select by making a 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.340
 right click on your desktop and pse 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.980
 screen resolution to make sure 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.050
 which monitors which click on the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.450
 identification button from the menu 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.170
 drop - down screen choose your feel 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.010
 and confirm that your resolution is 1920 x 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.040
 1200 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.650
 if you have multiple screens in the menu 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.310
 extend choose these screens and 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.380
 confirms 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.599
 this will guarantee that the bar 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.080
 tasks and applications start in 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.880
 the default belts in this way the 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.800
 pencil will always work on the screen 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.220
 having the taskbar and 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.200
 applications are going to open by default 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.050
 this is better for a basic navigation 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.720
 and to access the other screen in a 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.139
 mac go to the menu to paul preferences the 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.240
 system screen the resolution for each 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.700
 one of your screens will be displayed on your 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.320
 own screen confirms that it 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.240
 I configured the feeling in 1920 x 1200 for 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.729
 multiple screens select the 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.500
 disposition tab which will be in the 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.360
 Configuration panel for any 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.729
 screen that has the menu bar 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.439
 in the layout window you can 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.830
 organize the screens to make them 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:48.050
 match where they are physically here 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.300
 you can also make the downtown 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.340
 your main screen when you drag the 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.810
 white bar from the top of 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.850
 one of the icons to the monitor of the other 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.800
 this will ensure that the pencil can be 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.230
 always use to access the bar of the 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.360
 menu in all applications and that the 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.210
 applications will start in to send and 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.790
 that now let's put the 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.650
 part of the table without tics to make 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.660
 that your synte works properly with 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.630
 your team must ensure 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.400
 install the software the software cd 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.500
 is in the box that comes with to send and 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.450
 make sure your team is 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.040
 connected to the internet so that the 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.200
 cid and the software can access 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.600
 more recent versions of it if there 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.580

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.150
 find directly where you want 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.430
 you just need to calibrate it at 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.200
