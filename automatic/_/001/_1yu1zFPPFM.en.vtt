00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
video yesterday with this great car with

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.169 
video yesterday with this great car with
their<00:00:08.519> TMC<00:00:09.179> units<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.320> whatever<00:00:11.120> I've<00:00:12.120> got

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
their TMC units in it whatever I've got

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.539 
their TMC units in it whatever I've got
a<00:00:12.360> unit<00:00:12.809> chip<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.349> well<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.920> had<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> unit

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
a unit chip in the well I had a unit

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.170 
a unit chip in the well I had a unit
chip<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.969> other<00:00:15.089> car<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.660> white<00:00:16.109> one<00:00:17.180> it

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
chip in the other car the white one it

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.779 
chip in the other car the white one it
doesn't<00:00:18.690> like<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.140> I've<00:00:19.890> been<00:00:20.130> told<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
doesn't like it I've been told it's and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.220 
doesn't like it I've been told it's and
I'm<00:00:21.090> pretty<00:00:21.270> sure<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> booster

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
I'm pretty sure it's the booster

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.490 
I'm pretty sure it's the booster
solenoid<00:00:23.119> it<00:00:24.119> surges<00:00:24.689> when<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.170> get<00:00:25.289> too<00:00:25.380> high

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
solenoid it surges when you get too high

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.609 
solenoid it surges when you get too high
reps<00:00:25.830> from<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.310> 4000<00:00:27.060> onwards<00:00:27.449> it'll<00:00:28.410> search

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
reps from like 4000 onwards it'll search

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.150 
reps from like 4000 onwards it'll search
quite<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> lot<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.050> it's<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.619> car<00:00:31.859> just

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
quite a lot and it's just the car just

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.950 
quite a lot and it's just the car just
doesn't<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:35.149> I've<00:00:36.149> done<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> TMC<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
doesn't like it so I've done the TMC I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690 
doesn't like it so I've done the TMC I
love<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.559> put<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> unit<00:00:38.250> chip<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
love this one put the unit chip in it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.220 
love this one put the unit chip in it
drove<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.079> other<00:00:40.680> car

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
drove the other car

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.680 
drove the other car
just<00:00:42.890> back<00:00:43.040> to<00:00:43.070> standard<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:44.000> it'll<00:00:44.540> break

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
just back to standard and it'll break

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.430 
just back to standard and it'll break
down<00:00:44.750> very<00:00:45.710> very<00:00:46.070> slightly<00:00:46.489> at<00:00:46.970> about<00:00:47.440> 5,000

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
down very very slightly at about 5,000

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.660 
down very very slightly at about 5,000
reps<00:00:48.650> and<00:00:49.010> stuck<00:00:49.340> but<00:00:50.180> hardly<00:00:50.600> hardly<00:00:50.930> at<00:00:51.230> all

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
reps and stuck but hardly hardly at all

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.130 
reps and stuck but hardly hardly at all
so<00:00:52.670> it's<00:00:52.940> pretty<00:00:53.090> much<00:00:53.210> it's<00:00:53.480> just<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.840> unit

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
so it's pretty much it's just the unit

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.619 
so it's pretty much it's just the unit
chip<00:00:54.699> finding<00:00:55.699> all<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:55.940> weaknesses<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.540> the

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
chip finding all the weaknesses in the

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.530 
chip finding all the weaknesses in the
car<00:00:56.840> pretty<00:00:57.110> much<00:00:57.230> I'm<00:00:57.559> if<00:00:57.739> you<00:00:57.800> cars<00:00:58.040> not

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
car pretty much I'm if you cars not

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.990 
car pretty much I'm if you cars not
absolutely<00:00:59.540> tip-top<00:00:59.900> condition<00:01:00.850> which<00:01:01.850> I

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
absolutely tip-top condition which I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.060 
absolutely tip-top condition which I
thought<00:01:02.180> my<00:01:02.449> car<00:01:02.780> was<00:01:02.839> but<00:01:03.440> obviously<00:01:03.559> not

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
thought my car was but obviously not

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
thought my car was but obviously not
then<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:07.040> Union<00:01:07.310> ship<00:01:07.430> is<00:01:07.490> going<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.670> find<00:01:07.910> any

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
then the Union ship is going to find any

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.770 
then the Union ship is going to find any
flaws<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.860> you<00:01:09.860> may<00:01:10.250> have<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:11.150> be<00:01:11.270> prepared<00:01:11.659> to

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
flaws and you may have to be prepared to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.050 
flaws and you may have to be prepared to
deal<00:01:11.960> with<00:01:12.020> them<00:01:12.259> I<00:01:12.530> mean<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.369> can't<00:01:13.640> take<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:13.970> in

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
deal with them I mean I can't take it in

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.060 
deal with them I mean I can't take it in
and<00:01:14.270> say<00:01:14.390> look<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:15.140> is<00:01:15.200> breaking<00:01:15.770> because

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
and say look this is breaking because

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.070 
and say look this is breaking because
it's<00:01:16.220> it's<00:01:17.000> pretty<00:01:17.149> much<00:01:17.360> perfectly<00:01:17.840> fine

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
it's it's pretty much perfectly fine

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.460 
it's it's pretty much perfectly fine
with<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:18.979> stock<00:01:19.430> car<00:01:19.899> so<00:01:20.899> I'm<00:01:21.050> just<00:01:21.200> gonna<00:01:21.289> have

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
with a stock car so I'm just gonna have

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.880 
with a stock car so I'm just gonna have
to<00:01:21.500> wait<00:01:21.710> until<00:01:21.920> something

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
to wait until something

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.680 
to wait until something
you<00:01:24.280> know<00:01:24.370> II<00:01:24.430> guess<00:01:24.790> we're<00:01:25.060> solar<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.450> may<00:01:25.600> have

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
you know II guess we're solar I may have

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.620 
you know II guess we're solar I may have
to<00:01:25.840> buy<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.050> out<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.920> my<00:01:27.010> pocket<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:28.240> long<00:01:28.420> as<00:01:28.540> I

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
to buy it out of my pocket as long as I

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.180 
to buy it out of my pocket as long as I
can<00:01:28.690> you<00:01:28.960> know<00:01:29.080> definitely<00:01:29.320> make<00:01:29.830> sure<00:01:29.980> that's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
can you know definitely make sure that's

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.530 
can you know definitely make sure that's
what<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.700> I<00:01:30.730> mean<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.030> don't<00:01:31.150> mind<00:01:31.360> buying

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
what it is I mean I don't mind buying

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.470 
what it is I mean I don't mind buying
one<00:01:31.900> I<00:01:31.930> just<00:01:32.670> don't<00:01:33.670> want<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:33.940> buy<00:01:34.060> that<00:01:34.090> and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
one I just don't want to buy that and

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.850 
one I just don't want to buy that and
it'd<00:01:34.570> be<00:01:34.690> something<00:01:34.960> else<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.380> know<00:01:35.590> but<00:01:35.620> I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
it'd be something else you know but I

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.430 
it'd be something else you know but I
think<00:01:36.220> that's<00:01:36.370> what<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.610> is

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
think that's what it is

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.340 
think that's what it is
anyway<00:01:38.440> this<00:01:38.650> is<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.020> other<00:01:41.110> car

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
anyway this is this is the other car

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.600 
anyway this is this is the other car
with<00:01:41.560> unity<00:01:41.950> have<00:01:42.130> been<00:01:43.800> took<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.920> TMC<00:01:45.220> out<00:01:45.490> of

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
with unity have been took the TMC out of

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.670 
with unity have been took the TMC out of
it<00:01:45.700> took<00:01:45.880> their<00:01:46.120> spin<00:01:46.690> booster<00:01:47.050> pedal<00:01:47.229> off<00:01:47.470> it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
it took their spin booster pedal off it

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.910 
it took their spin booster pedal off it
it's<00:01:47.920> just<00:01:48.100> got<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.340> r3t<00:01:49.350> version<00:01:50.350> two<00:01:50.530> intake

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
it's just got the r3t version two intake

it's just got the r3t version two intake
like<00:01:51.250> same<00:01:51.760> as<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:51.970> white<00:01:52.150> car
