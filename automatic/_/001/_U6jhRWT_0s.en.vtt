okay<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:41.140> let's<00:02:41.440> go<00:02:41.590> through<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.870> skills<00:02:43.870> that

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
okay so let's go through the skills that

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.800 
okay so let's go through the skills that
comprise<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.800> this<00:02:45.040> multi<00:02:45.550> skilled<00:02:45.910> skilled

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
comprise of this multi skilled skilled

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.680 
comprise of this multi skilled skilled
so<00:02:47.650> first<00:02:47.860> up<00:02:48.069> awakened<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:49.209> will<00:02:49.390> activate

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
so first up awakened this will activate

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.350 
so first up awakened this will activate
the<00:02:50.050> dormant<00:02:50.380> element<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.160> weapons<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:52.209> can

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
the dormant element of weapons you can

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.850 
the dormant element of weapons you can
tell<00:02:52.510> which<00:02:52.660> weapons<00:02:53.080> these<00:02:53.319> are<00:02:53.530> because
