00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.569 
to Allah most gracious most merciful
I<00:03:35.880> think<00:03:36.540> first<00:03:37.140> game<00:03:37.380> yeah<00:03:37.680> team<00:03:38.310> combination

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
I think first game yeah team combination

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.550 
I think first game yeah team combination
we<00:03:39.030> only<00:03:39.180> got<00:03:39.359> to<00:03:39.600> practice<00:03:39.989> games<00:03:40.170> together

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
we only got to practice games together

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.979 
we only got to practice games together
before<00:03:41.370> we<00:03:41.549> came<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.970> tournament<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.540> new

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
before we came to the tournament and new

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.890 
before we came to the tournament and new
conditions<00:03:43.470> grass<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.250> turf<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.790> first<00:03:45.750> time

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
conditions grass and turf and first time

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.229 
conditions grass and turf and first time
with<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.170> coach<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.760> think<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.850> takes<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.090> time

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
with the coach I think it takes a time

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.789 
with the coach I think it takes a time
to<00:03:48.420> build<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.660> team<00:03:48.810> but<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.170> think<00:03:49.560> we've<00:03:49.680> gained

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
to build a team but I think we've gained

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.500 
to build a team but I think we've gained
momentum<00:03:49.980> in<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.819> tournament<00:03:51.180> at<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.299> right

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
momentum in the tournament at the right

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.180 
momentum in the tournament at the right
time<00:03:51.750> we'll<00:03:52.079> probably<00:03:52.170> at<00:03:52.410> our<00:03:52.500> peak<00:03:52.709> now<00:03:52.920> and

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
time we'll probably at our peak now and

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.920 
time we'll probably at our peak now and
it's<00:03:53.430> probably<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.269> right<00:03:54.389> time<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.690> we

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
it's probably the right time that we
