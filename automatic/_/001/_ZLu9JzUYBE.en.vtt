to be a just a straightforward tutorial

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.869 
to be a just a straightforward tutorial
on<00:00:32.699> how<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.879> play<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:34.170> I'm<00:00:34.320> gonna<00:00:34.440> start<00:00:34.620> out

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
on how to play so I'm gonna start out

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.210 
on how to play so I'm gonna start out
explaining<00:00:35.879> are<00:00:36.329> these<00:00:36.570> gauges<00:00:36.809> here<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.589> all

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
explaining are these gauges here so all

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.770 
explaining are these gauges here so all
this<00:00:38.400> is<00:00:38.519> explained<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.030> tutorial<00:00:39.059> texts

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
this is explained in the tutorial texts

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
this is explained in the tutorial texts
in<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> game<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:41.010> goes<00:00:41.159> by<00:00:41.339> pretty<00:00:41.370> fast

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
in the game but it goes by pretty fast

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.430 
in the game but it goes by pretty fast
in<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.089> middle<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.390> gameplay<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.229> think

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
in the middle of gameplay and I think

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.079 
in the middle of gameplay and I think
most<00:00:43.649> players<00:00:43.860> don't<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.100> time<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.610> stop<00:00:44.879> em

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
most players don't have time to stop em

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.429 
most players don't have time to stop em
and<00:00:47.000> fight<00:00:48.000> off<00:00:48.149> their<00:00:48.300> stress<00:00:48.659> and<00:00:48.689> and<00:00:49.229> try

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:49.439 
and fight off their stress and and try

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:52.700 
and fight off their stress and and try
to<00:00:49.500> look<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:49.830> these<00:00:49.920> gauges<00:00:50.339> so<00:00:51.710> essentially

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
to look at these gauges so essentially

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
to look at these gauges so essentially
what<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.159> on<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.489> there<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:54.000> red

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
what is going on is that there are red

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.450 
what is going on is that there are red
circles<00:00:54.839> and<00:00:55.110> yellow<00:00:55.409> circles<00:00:55.799> that<00:00:56.009> indicate

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
circles and yellow circles that indicate

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.450 
circles and yellow circles that indicate
winning<00:00:56.970> and<00:00:57.150> losing<00:00:57.299> conditions<00:00:58.070> this<00:00:59.070> gauge

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
winning and losing conditions this gauge

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.999 
winning and losing conditions this gauge
down<00:00:59.670> here<00:00:59.939> is<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.299> the<00:01:00.449> purple<00:01:00.839> growth<00:01:01.019> so<00:01:01.710> as

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:02.009 
down here is for the purple growth so as

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.359 
down here is for the purple growth so as
the<00:01:02.699> growth<00:01:02.909> in<00:01:03.479> the<00:01:03.600> game<00:01:03.809> grows<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.500> circle

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the growth in the game grows this circle

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.760 
the growth in the game grows this circle
in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> middle<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:06.119> fulfill<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.770> larger

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
in the middle will fulfill out larger

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.170 
in the middle will fulfill out larger
and<00:01:07.890> larger<00:01:08.009> and<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.579> reaches<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.000> red

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and larger and if it reaches this red

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.359 
and larger and if it reaches this red
circle<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.930> lose<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.860> long<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.220> within

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
circle you lose and long as it's within

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.590 
circle you lose and long as it's within
the<00:01:11.520> yellow<00:01:11.700> circle<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.329> winning

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the yellow circle you're in a winning

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.990 
the yellow circle you're in a winning
condition<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.280> don't<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:14.850> worry

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
condition so you don't have to worry

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.609 
condition so you don't have to worry
about<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.540> long<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.229> few

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
about that as long as it's just a few

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.149 
about that as long as it's just a few
blobs<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.329> here<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.380> for

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
blobs like this this one here is for

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.789 
blobs like this this one here is for
these<00:01:20.429> balls<00:01:20.999> of<00:01:21.270> seeds<00:01:21.569> now<00:01:22.439> these<00:01:22.619> are

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
these balls of seeds now these are

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.069 
these balls of seeds now these are
objects<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.850> game<00:01:23.969> you<00:01:24.149> can't<00:01:24.420> shoot<00:01:24.719> you

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
objects in the game you can't shoot you

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.870 
objects in the game you can't shoot you
can<00:01:25.229> notice

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
can notice

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880 
can notice
you'll<00:01:27.240> get<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> sound<00:01:28.140> effects<00:01:28.469> and<00:01:28.740> you're

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
you'll get a sound effects and you're

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.200 
you'll get a sound effects and you're
not<00:01:29.009> only<00:01:29.159> effective<00:01:29.579> shooting<00:01:29.880> these<00:01:29.969> balls

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
not only effective shooting these balls

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
not only effective shooting these balls
they<00:01:31.130> essentially<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.390> you<00:01:33.390> know<00:01:33.770> threats

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
they essentially are you know threats

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.270 
they essentially are you know threats
that<00:01:35.310> could<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.729> coming<00:01:35.939> from<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.360> sides<00:01:37.280> like

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that could be coming from the sides like

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.499 
that could be coming from the sides like
most<00:01:38.490> exploding<00:01:38.909> stuff<00:01:39.060> later

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
most exploding stuff later

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.240 
most exploding stuff later
they<00:01:40.200> could<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.439> threats<00:01:40.770> coming<00:01:40.979> from<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
they could be threats coming from the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.490 
they could be threats coming from the
side<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.610> screen<00:01:41.929> but<00:01:42.929> instead<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.409> know

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
side of the screen but instead you know

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.690 
side of the screen but instead you know
they're<00:01:43.649> built<00:01:43.829> into<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> level<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> can

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
they're built into the level so you can

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.669 
they're built into the level so you can
kind<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.329> what's<00:01:45.539> coming<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.319> physical

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
kind of see what's coming in a physical

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.679 
kind of see what's coming in a physical
sense<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> color

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
sense and you can see here the color

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.569 
sense and you can see here the color
I'll<00:01:49.319> tell<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.619> what<00:01:49.799> type<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.009> threat<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.429> is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
I'll tell you what type of threat it is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.520 
I'll tell you what type of threat it is
this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.810> germs<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> fly

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this is going to be germs that fly

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.679 
this is going to be germs that fly
through<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> level<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.549> purple<00:01:53.880> our<00:01:54.210> shoots

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
through the level of purple our shoots

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.410 
through the level of purple our shoots
of<00:01:54.869> growth<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> come<00:01:55.470> out<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:57.030> number<00:01:57.299> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
of growth that come out so the number of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.830 
of growth that come out so the number of
these<00:01:58.280> cells<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> game<00:01:59.789> is<00:02:00.060> recorded<00:02:00.569> here

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
these cells in the game is recorded here

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260 
these cells in the game is recorded here
and<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.189> see<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.459> losing<00:02:02.729> conditions<00:02:03.149> on

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and you can see the losing conditions on

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.490 
and you can see the losing conditions on
the<00:02:03.360> outside<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:03.990> too<00:02:04.140> many<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.380> them

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the outside if you have too many of them

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.469 
the outside if you have too many of them
you<00:02:04.679> can<00:02:04.830> lose<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.759> actually<00:02:06.149> doesn't

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
you can lose that actually doesn't

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.630 
you can lose that actually doesn't
happen<00:02:07.349> like<00:02:07.709> I<00:02:07.830> think<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.069> could<00:02:08.220> happen<00:02:08.399> in

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
happen like I think it could happen in

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.190 
happen like I think it could happen in
one<00:02:08.759> or<00:02:08.880> two<00:02:08.970> levels<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:09.509> doesn't

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
one or two levels but it really doesn't

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.500 
one or two levels but it really doesn't
come<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.340> mechanic<00:02:11.880> they'll<00:02:12.030> throw<00:02:12.450> too

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
come up as a mechanic they'll throw too

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.229 
come up as a mechanic they'll throw too
many<00:02:12.690> seeds<00:02:12.989> actually<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.650> but<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:15.030> do

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
many seeds actually like that but you do

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.420 
many seeds actually like that but you do
need<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.599> fight<00:02:16.290> them<00:02:16.470> off<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> point<00:02:17.250> where

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
need to fight them off to a point where

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.960 
need to fight them off to a point where
they<00:02:17.640> come<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.540> yellow<00:02:18.720> circle<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.970> we

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
they come up in this yellow circle so we

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.550 
they come up in this yellow circle so we
don't<00:02:21.120> grind<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.569> level<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.170> very<00:02:22.349> end

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
don't grind the level to the very end

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.229 
don't grind the level to the very end
when<00:02:22.680> there's<00:02:22.829> just<00:02:22.980> one<00:02:23.130> left<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:24.090> need

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
when there's just one left but we need

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.120 
when there's just one left but we need
to<00:02:24.440> defend<00:02:25.440> yourself<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:25.890> tell<00:02:26.040> them

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
to defend yourself and tell them

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.790 
to defend yourself and tell them
something

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
something

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.530 
something
less<00:02:26.980> than<00:02:27.130> 25<00:02:27.610> left<00:02:27.880> that's<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.210> big<00:02:28.360> yellow

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
less than 25 left that's a big yellow

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.020 
less than 25 left that's a big yellow
number<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.260> telling<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:30.520> yellow<00:02:30.790> number

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
number is telling you so yellow number

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.060 
number is telling you so yellow number
here<00:02:31.210> 3,000<00:02:31.990> means<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.380> have<00:02:32.410> 3,000

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
here 3,000 means you have to have 3,000

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.110 
here 3,000 means you have to have 3,000
or<00:02:33.160> less<00:02:33.400> purple<00:02:34.410> growth<00:02:35.410> cells<00:02:36.280> in<00:02:36.820> order<00:02:36.970> to

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
or less purple growth cells in order to

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.090 
or less purple growth cells in order to
win<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.420> level<00:02:37.660> now<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.410> one<00:02:38.650> up<00:02:38.770> here<00:02:38.800> is

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
win the level now this one up here is

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.640 
win the level now this one up here is
your<00:02:39.280> membrane<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.150> any<00:02:40.300> translucent<00:02:41.020> pixel

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
your membrane so any translucent pixel

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.140 
your membrane so any translucent pixel
in<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.220> game<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:43.240> membranes<00:02:43.870> over<00:02:44.260> here<00:02:44.440> this

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
in the game is membranes over here this

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.430 
in the game is membranes over here this
doesn't<00:02:46.150> look<00:02:46.210> exactly<00:02:46.360> like<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.870> membrane<00:02:47.200> but

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
doesn't look exactly like a membrane but

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.290 
doesn't look exactly like a membrane but
it's<00:02:47.800> bone<00:02:48.040> marrow<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.640> sort<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.150> same

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
it's bone marrow is sort of the same

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.360 
it's bone marrow is sort of the same
thing<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.620> bone<00:02:50.800> right<00:02:51.100> now

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
thing in the bone right now

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.860 
thing in the bone right now
so<00:02:52.760> for<00:02:52.909> this<00:02:52.999> the<00:02:53.269> colors<00:02:53.659> are<00:02:53.780> reversed

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
so for this the colors are reversed

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.020 
so for this the colors are reversed
outside<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.859> a<00:02:55.189> good<00:02:55.459> condition<00:02:55.849> you<00:02:55.909> won't

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
outside is a good condition you won't

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.119 
outside is a good condition you won't
have<00:02:56.120> lots<00:02:56.299> of<00:02:56.389> membranes<00:02:56.840> let's<00:02:57.139> yellow<00:02:57.349> but

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
have lots of membranes let's yellow but

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.339 
have lots of membranes let's yellow but
if<00:02:58.249> you<00:02:58.370> used<00:02:58.639> more<00:02:59.359> than<00:02:59.480> half<00:02:59.689> of<00:02:59.780> it

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
if you used more than half of it

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.410 
if you used more than half of it
if<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.799> found<00:03:00.950> less<00:03:01.219> to<00:03:01.370> less<00:03:01.519> than<00:03:01.670> 30,000

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
if you found less to less than 30,000

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.809 
if you found less to less than 30,000
cells<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.530> membrane<00:03:04.069> then<00:03:04.280> you're<00:03:04.700> in<00:03:04.790> a

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
cells of membrane then you're in a

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.220 
cells of membrane then you're in a
losing<00:03:04.999> condition<00:03:05.480> for<00:03:05.599> that<00:03:05.629> so<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.049> have<00:03:06.139> to

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
losing condition for that so you have to

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.369 
losing condition for that so you have to
defend<00:03:06.469> the<00:03:06.560> membrane<00:03:06.950> at<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.609> same<00:03:07.849> time<00:03:08.090> as

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
defend the membrane at the same time as

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.509 
defend the membrane at the same time as
fighting<00:03:09.379> off<00:03:09.469> certain<00:03:09.680> amount<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:10.069> external

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
fighting off certain amount of external

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.030 
fighting off certain amount of external
threats<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.530> keeping<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.650> amount<00:03:12.950> of

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
threats and keeping the amount of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.720 
threats and keeping the amount of
cancerous<00:03:14.030> growth<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.900> minimum<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:16.609> can

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
cancerous growth to a minimum so you can

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.909 
cancerous growth to a minimum so you can
see<00:03:16.909> these<00:03:17.120> seats<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.959> seat<00:03:18.230> gauge<00:03:18.500> here<00:03:18.799> at

showing lines moving in toward it so

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:25.569 
showing lines moving in toward it so
that<00:03:24.500> shows<00:03:24.680> you're<00:03:25.159> getting<00:03:25.370> close<00:03:25.549> to

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
that shows you're getting close to

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.300 
that shows you're getting close to
winning<00:03:25.909> and<00:03:26.480> we've<00:03:27.469> basically<00:03:27.620> waited<00:03:28.159> long

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
winning and we've basically waited long

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.629

you know fought off the seats long

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.920 
you know fought off the seats long
enough<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.799> win<00:03:31.189> that<00:03:31.310> stat<00:03:31.609> the<00:03:32.419> membranes<00:03:32.810> in

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
enough to win that stat the membranes in

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.750 
enough to win that stat the membranes in
a<00:03:32.989> bit<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.139> trouble<00:03:33.199> it<00:03:33.739> wines<00:03:34.189> are<00:03:34.400> coming<00:03:34.639> off

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
a bit of trouble it wines are coming off

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.929 
a bit of trouble it wines are coming off
of<00:03:34.909> it<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.269> so<00:03:36.019> is<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.590> growth<00:03:37.549> here<00:03:37.790> the

of it and so is the growth here the

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.280 
of it and so is the growth here the
growth<00:03:38.090> has<00:03:38.239> got<00:03:38.449> lines<00:03:38.629> coming<00:03:38.870> off<00:03:39.049> and

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
growth has got lines coming off and

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.140 
growth has got lines coming off and
we've<00:03:39.530> got<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.980> little<00:03:40.310> too<00:03:40.489> much<00:03:40.639> purple<00:03:41.000> here

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
we've got a little too much purple here

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.319 
we've got a little too much purple here
so<00:03:41.449> to<00:03:41.900> win<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.169> level<00:03:42.409> now<00:03:42.560> this<00:03:43.549> is<00:03:44.180> this

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
so to win the level now this is this

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.309 
so to win the level now this is this
one's<00:03:44.540> almost<00:03:44.689> there

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
one's almost there

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.619 
one's almost there
we<00:03:45.560> just<00:03:45.739> have<00:03:45.859> to<00:03:45.980> shoot<00:03:46.159> the<00:03:46.419> the<00:03:47.419> growth

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
we just have to shoot the the growth

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.740 
we just have to shoot the the growth
down<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.010> winning<00:03:49.250> state<00:03:49.579> and<00:03:50.239> there<00:03:50.540> we<00:03:50.629> go

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
down to a winning state and there we go

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.990 
down to a winning state and there we go
the<00:03:51.019> membranes<00:03:51.409> being<00:03:51.680> eaten<00:03:51.980> as<00:03:52.519> you<00:03:52.639> can<00:03:52.790> see

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
the membranes being eaten as you can see

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.629 
the membranes being eaten as you can see
the<00:03:53.540> top<00:03:53.780> here<00:03:54.049> is<00:03:54.650> sort<00:03:54.859> of<00:03:54.889> exploding<00:03:55.489> and

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
the top here is sort of exploding and

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.249 
the top here is sort of exploding and
lines<00:03:56.060> of<00:03:56.239> color<00:03:56.389> to<00:03:56.689> kind<00:03:56.840> of<00:03:56.959> give<00:03:57.109> you<00:03:57.199> a

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:57.259 
lines of color to kind of give you a

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.069 
lines of color to kind of give you a
quick<00:03:57.290> indication<00:03:57.919> that<00:03:58.159> here<00:03:58.400> about<00:03:58.909> to<00:03:59.120> lose

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
quick indication that here about to lose

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.610 
quick indication that here about to lose
because<00:04:00.500> you've<00:04:00.620> lost<00:04:00.769> too<00:04:00.979> much<00:04:01.069> membrane<00:04:02.620> so

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
because you've lost too much membrane so

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.099 
because you've lost too much membrane so
in<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:03.799> typical<00:04:03.919> level<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.519> player<00:04:04.759> will<00:04:04.939> be

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
in a typical level the player will be

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.809 
in a typical level the player will be
balancing<00:04:06.109> two<00:04:06.620> tasks<00:04:07.129> one<00:04:07.310> is<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.519> defend

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
balancing two tasks one is to defend

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.119 
balancing two tasks one is to defend
against<00:04:08.180> incoming<00:04:08.810> threats<00:04:09.169> you'll<00:04:09.949> see

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
against incoming threats you'll see

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.069 
against incoming threats you'll see
these<00:04:10.250> sprout<00:04:10.759> in<00:04:10.909> a<00:04:10.970> moment<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.930> other

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
these sprout in a moment and the other

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.530 
these sprout in a moment and the other
is<00:04:12.259> to<00:04:12.409> defend<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:13.030> membrane<00:04:14.030> in<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.239> level

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
is to defend the membrane in the level

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.939 
is to defend the membrane in the level
so<00:04:16.539> one<00:04:17.539> way<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.750> go<00:04:18.229> about<00:04:18.320> defending<00:04:18.769> the

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
so one way to go about defending the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.199 
so one way to go about defending the
level<00:04:19.190> is<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.400> use<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.729> construction

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
level is to use the construction

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.839 
level is to use the construction
mechanic<00:04:20.870> as<00:04:21.139> I'll<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.470> here<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:22.460> kind<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:22.729> zoom

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
mechanic as I'll do here to kind of zoom

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.320 
mechanic as I'll do here to kind of zoom
in<00:04:23.150> and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
in and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.469 
in and
build<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.110> pathway<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:26.400> press<00:04:26.639> X<00:04:26.910> there<00:04:27.210> to

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
build a pathway and press X there to

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.119 
build a pathway and press X there to
zoom<00:04:27.690> in<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.229> you<00:04:28.319> can<00:04:28.349> build<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.710> pathway<00:04:28.949> from

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
zoom in and you can build a pathway from

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.860 
zoom in and you can build a pathway from
a<00:04:29.280> source<00:04:29.550> of<00:04:29.639> antibodies<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.479> membrane

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
a source of antibodies to the membrane

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.219 
a source of antibodies to the membrane
and<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:31.949> will<00:04:32.069> take<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.220> minute<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:33.080> sprout<00:04:34.080> so

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
and this will take a minute to sprout so

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.809 
and this will take a minute to sprout so
in<00:04:34.289> the<00:04:34.349> meantime<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.740> can<00:04:34.860> be<00:04:35.129> -<00:04:35.250> depending

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
in the meantime you can be - depending

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.719 
in the meantime you can be - depending
of<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.000> level<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:37.129> as<00:04:38.129> you<00:04:38.280> can<00:04:38.340> see<00:04:38.400> by

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
of the level so as you can see by

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
to get rid of the purple growth but it

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.290 
to get rid of the purple growth but it
can<00:05:36.009> buy<00:05:37.009> some<00:05:37.279> time<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.490> there's<00:05:37.819> times<00:05:38.180> you

see<00:05:41.150> this<00:05:41.270> level<00:05:41.599> is<00:05:41.659> made<00:05:41.810> up<00:05:41.900> of<00:05:41.990> a<00:05:42.080> bunch<00:05:42.289> of

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
see this level is made up of a bunch of

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.679 
see this level is made up of a bunch of
different<00:05:42.680> types<00:05:42.860> of<00:05:43.069> cells<00:05:43.569> this<00:05:44.569> is

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:44.689 
different types of cells this is

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:46.540 
different types of cells this is
actually<00:05:44.990> a<00:05:45.020> level<00:05:45.319> that<00:05:45.490> fictionally<00:05:46.490> a

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
actually a level that fictionally a

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.659 
actually a level that fictionally a
previous<00:05:47.469> nanotech<00:05:48.469> unit<00:05:48.830> had<00:05:49.310> tried<00:05:49.580> to

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
previous nanotech unit had tried to

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.689 
previous nanotech unit had tried to
defend<00:05:50.000> and<00:05:50.360> left<00:05:51.169> behind<00:05:51.469> some<00:05:51.650> wreckage<00:05:52.009> so

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
defend and left behind some wreckage so

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:53.559 
defend and left behind some wreckage so
this<00:05:52.789> is<00:05:52.879> actually<00:05:53.120> the<00:05:53.180> first<00:05:53.270> time<00:05:53.419> you've

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
this is actually the first time you've

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.059 
this is actually the first time you've
seen<00:05:53.750> some<00:05:54.020> of<00:05:54.110> these<00:05:54.199> types<00:05:54.469> of<00:05:54.589> cells<00:05:54.800> these

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:55.069 
seen some of these types of cells these

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.189 
seen some of these types of cells these
pulsing<00:05:55.849> orange<00:05:56.150> ones<00:05:56.389> are<00:05:56.629> actually<00:05:56.900> a<00:05:57.080> kind

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
pulsing orange ones are actually a kind

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.719 
pulsing orange ones are actually a kind
of<00:05:57.289> a<00:05:57.349> super<00:05:57.620> bomb<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:58.039> will<00:05:58.129> explode<00:05:58.219> and

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
of a super bomb that will explode and

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.990 
of a super bomb that will explode and
save<00:05:59.199> you<00:06:00.199> from<00:06:00.440> disaster<00:06:00.979> sometimes<00:06:01.520> and

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
save you from disaster sometimes and

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.350 
save you from disaster sometimes and
this<00:06:02.629> is<00:06:02.870> a<00:06:02.900> enemy<00:06:03.520> nanotech<00:06:04.520> circuitry<00:06:05.089> which

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
this is a enemy nanotech circuitry which

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.379 
this is a enemy nanotech circuitry which
you'll<00:06:05.539> have<00:06:05.659> to<00:06:05.779> battle<00:06:05.960> later<00:06:06.229> in<00:06:06.409> the<00:06:06.500> game

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
you'll have to battle later in the game

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.619 
you'll have to battle later in the game
so<00:06:08.680> the<00:06:09.680> game<00:06:09.849> will<00:06:10.849> introduce<00:06:11.089> these<00:06:11.360> later

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 
so the game will introduce these later

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:13.990 
so the game will introduce these later
but<00:06:11.750> if<00:06:11.930> some<00:06:12.110> of<00:06:12.229> the<00:06:12.319> mechanics<00:06:12.979> are<00:06:13.219> hinted

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
but if some of the mechanics are hinted

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.369 
but if some of the mechanics are hinted
at<00:06:14.150> but<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:16.009> player<00:06:16.310> is<00:06:16.430> kind<00:06:16.580> of<00:06:16.639> left<00:06:16.939> to

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
at but the player is kind of left to

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.439 
at but the player is kind of left to
decipher<00:06:18.379> how<00:06:18.500> things<00:06:18.770> behave<00:06:18.979> and<00:06:19.520> learn<00:06:20.300> to

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
decipher how things behave and learn to

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:21.790 
decipher how things behave and learn to
use<00:06:20.659> things<00:06:20.930> in<00:06:21.110> the<00:06:21.199> environment

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
use things in the environment

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.770 
use things in the environment
to<00:06:22.099> solve<00:06:22.310> problems<00:06:22.759> so<00:06:23.509> in<00:06:23.599> this<00:06:23.659> particular

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
to solve problems so in this particular

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.740 
to solve problems so in this particular
case<00:06:24.370> you<00:06:25.370> can<00:06:25.490> see<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.759> exploding<00:06:26.270> mechanic

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
case you can see the exploding mechanic

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.350 
case you can see the exploding mechanic
Hammond's<00:06:27.080> this<00:06:27.979> seven<00:06:28.819> set<00:06:28.970> it<00:06:29.090> off<00:06:29.180> as

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
Hammond's this seven set it off as

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.110 
Hammond's this seven set it off as
counting<00:06:29.690> firecrackers<00:06:30.349> in<00:06:30.849> which<00:06:31.849> it<00:06:32.030> hits

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
counting firecrackers in which it hits

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.700 
counting firecrackers in which it hits
some<00:06:32.300> of<00:06:32.389> this<00:06:32.449> purple<00:06:32.870> growth<00:06:33.050> in<00:06:33.379> and

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
some of this purple growth in and

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.230 
some of this purple growth in and
destroy<00:06:34.069> it's<00:06:34.250> almost<00:06:34.460> like<00:06:34.669> sending

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
destroy it's almost like sending

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.119 
destroy it's almost like sending
antibodies<00:06:35.750> through<00:06:35.900> the<00:06:35.990> environment<00:06:36.229> the

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
antibodies through the environment the

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.839 
antibodies through the environment the
player<00:06:37.340> can<00:06:37.520> actually<00:06:38.710> create<00:06:39.710> that<00:06:40.520> them

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
player can actually create that them

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.610 
player can actually create that them
cells<00:06:41.120> and<00:06:41.479> again<00:06:41.870> that's<00:06:42.020> hinted<00:06:42.349> at<00:06:42.440> later

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
cells and again that's hinted at later

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.930 
cells and again that's hinted at later
in<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:42.800> game<00:06:42.919> there's<00:06:43.190> a<00:06:43.250> secret<00:06:43.610> maintenance

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
in the game there's a secret maintenance

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.969 
in the game there's a secret maintenance
and<00:06:44.060> for<00:06:44.210> doing<00:06:44.270> that<00:06:44.539> it's<00:06:45.440> not<00:06:45.560> too<00:06:45.710> hard<00:06:45.919> to

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:45.979 
and for doing that it's not too hard to

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.060 
and for doing that it's not too hard to
figure<00:06:46.099> out<00:06:46.220> but

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
figure out but

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.860 
figure out but
players<00:06:49.070> left<00:06:49.340> to<00:06:49.430> discover<00:06:49.789> and

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
players left to discover and

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.930 
players left to discover and
those<00:06:52.870> can<00:06:53.110> also<00:06:53.290> help<00:06:53.620> destroy<00:06:54.100> these<00:06:54.310> circus

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
those can also help destroy these circus

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.610 
those can also help destroy these circus
here<00:06:55.090> so<00:06:55.270> as<00:06:55.360> I<00:06:55.540> weakened<00:06:55.900> in<00:06:55.960> this<00:06:56.050> circuit<00:06:56.440> by

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
here so as I weakened in this circuit by

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.580 
here so as I weakened in this circuit by
having<00:06:56.980> that<00:06:57.130> explode<00:06:58.050> so<00:06:59.050> essentially<00:06:59.470> the

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
having that explode so essentially the

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.710 
having that explode so essentially the
player<00:06:59.860> is<00:07:00.130> usually<00:07:00.580> shooting<00:07:01.270> and<00:07:01.540> fighting

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
player is usually shooting and fighting

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.910 
player is usually shooting and fighting
again<00:07:02.050> we<00:07:02.200> get<00:07:02.320> threat

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:02.920 
again we get threat

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.960 
again we get threat
occasionally<00:07:03.730> building<00:07:04.150> pathways<00:07:04.750> and

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
occasionally building pathways and

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.990 
occasionally building pathways and
getting<00:07:06.970> that<00:07:07.090> brain<00:07:07.360> and<00:07:08.260> just<00:07:08.790> once<00:07:09.790> in<00:07:09.940> a

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
getting that brain and just once in a

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.550 
getting that brain and just once in a
while<00:07:10.150> glancing<00:07:10.450> at<00:07:10.780> these<00:07:10.930> gauges<00:07:11.230> in<00:07:11.500> the

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
while glancing at these gauges in the

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.460 
while glancing at these gauges in the
corners<00:07:11.950> and<00:07:11.980> see<00:07:12.490> what's<00:07:12.760> the<00:07:13.000> immediate<00:07:13.900> the

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
corners and see what's the immediate the

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.040 
corners and see what's the immediate the
next<00:07:14.770> goal<00:07:15.060> so<00:07:16.060> those<00:07:16.450> are<00:07:16.540> the<00:07:16.600> basics<00:07:16.900> on<00:07:17.020> how

next goal so those are the basics on how

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.170 
next goal so those are the basics on how
to<00:07:17.140> play

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
to play
