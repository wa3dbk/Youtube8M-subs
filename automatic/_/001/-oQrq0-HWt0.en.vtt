00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:15.320
 hello people yesterday it rained 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:18.380
 That's why I do it that way 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 well as it was with the knife the coarsest 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.039
 removed 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.920
 Now comes the cleaning with brush that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.920
 works best with normal gasoline 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.890
 no thinner band did not make it 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.600
 as good as normal operate no 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.600
 petrol just normal rushes 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.100
 Of course it will not be like this 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.980
 Vorwerk off so clean or so nice though 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.980
 that will be better in any case before that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.980
 testify 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.089
 I have already occurred 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.710
 going 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.530
 So without much effort that 's right 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.530
 and away 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.280
 I 'll continue and then I show 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.439
 it has become so i have everything now 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.880
 cleaned 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.850
 I said earlier it will not be like this 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.939
 his work has been looked up 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.409
 any case can be much better off now 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.289
 we seal the whole thing 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.769
 turn the bar back on and then 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.840
 we watch what we still on this 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.840
 do work 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.630
 the things have to be adjusted so long 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:50.840
 we stay on it so that the water 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:53.170
 not the only one in any case better 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.170
 out 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.849
 Now we do the performance 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.180
 continue as soon as it rains a bit 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:10.890
 I would like to show you with which one 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.730
 materials i work that is from 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.610
 mendig offer 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.010
 inner area what you under the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.569
 church ss be introduced that it 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.940
 always flexible and that dries completely 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.090
 yes it completely dries out and that 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.069
 is stable for outer area that too 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.590
 you can also see fashion for high 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.190
 Dare for you and so would have 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.519
 already complete but is permanent 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.680
 elastic which is for external area so 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.060
 a water barrier and that it is for the 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:51.890
 kids afford model in total 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:54.200
 left two things that are important 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.359
 Never use Silicon Valley outdoors 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.640
 make use of silicone only beginner 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:02.150
 this mistake but silicone does not hold 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.319
 long and that's only max with it 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:12.799
 one is now there are two right ones 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:14.510
 material only once and that me 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:19.810
 wanted to show the plates are with 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:24.250
 rivets wound that holds in any case 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.250
 such places must be repaired 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.780
 first thoroughly 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.810
 offer tight 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.840
 then there's here right away 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.500
 so that it is made of which then it is tight 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:07.919
 make and then above it still has to 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.870
 one water barrier with the other with 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:13.740
 be made us 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.500
 I'll show you this after we become 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.780
 Dust protection still move in 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.880
 There are different bosses fit for 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:24.560
 this decidedly with white stripes 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.560
 and so I cut that out here 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:34.460
 if this is plugged in then it works 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:40.360
 pretty much that here 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:45.680
 put it in and then hold it once 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:49.310
 it goes on by itself so i'm done that way 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.990
 must be that can be at 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.660
 Do not touch anyone 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.840
 but it will never be as good as the work 

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.840
 his
