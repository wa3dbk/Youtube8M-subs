00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.779
 hello everyone who speaks is the most 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.699
 20 for you 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.650
 I was without internet any day , people. 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.599
 so formal by the absence and despite 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.910
 hardly anyone notices 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.419
 wanted to comment on the video of 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.159
 gbg linear but if it's just people 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.130
 that project but several dvd's and 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.870
 against several doubts between depends on 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.329
 to be winning or losing betting on 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.160
 channel is for our abilities to 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.440
 have fun too many people took this 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.750
 by the Flemish side and if that I 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.760
 I find it annoying, I find it very offensive. 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.000
 some comments and this talking about 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.090
 it is independent of what some find 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.660
 about the guild or not I think it's boring 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.880
 to demonstrate this is to play three 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.460
 members a role of a tv guide and such 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.010
 then there was no objective of any kind 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.410
 fame is linear or nothing is just a 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.750
 pvp has been reported on the project in 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.790
 the other two that challenged me to 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.890
 linear beast and such is playing at least 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.170
 I win or lose position on the channel 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.730
 it will not make a difference 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.490
 then she is talking a better video 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.230
 about this but for now is not this 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.470
 about the grand chase combos as well 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.320
 guys, I'll go back and do the ones 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.510
 extras and and this is the crowd I've ever 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.340
 I already have the links 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.050
 everything is right and the others 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.970
 commanded by silvio sends me because 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.490
 a lot of people sent me I want 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.780
 make this video really special i guess 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.490
 It'll look really cool, then. 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.740
 People who did not send it yet send me 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.380
 video coming out of combos may be in practice 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.820
 can be in PV can be anything 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.380
 It will be fine at the time it sent the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.900
 link for me is doing this montage 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.049

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.989
 What the hell kind of fuck, what if that? 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.750

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.680
