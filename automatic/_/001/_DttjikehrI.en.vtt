00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
I imagine of course it is illegal and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
I imagine of course it is illegal and
some<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> dogs<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> saw<00:01:25.619> had<00:01:25.890> been

some of the dogs that I saw had been

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.300 
some of the dogs that I saw had been
used<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.490> bait<00:01:26.729> dogs<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.920> they're<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:29.070> really

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
used as bait dogs so they're not really

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.539

lives<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.420> point<00:01:33.720> what's<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
lives up to this point what's the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.960 
lives up to this point what's the
central<00:01:34.770> goal<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.310> bringing<00:01:35.640> together<00:01:35.790> the
