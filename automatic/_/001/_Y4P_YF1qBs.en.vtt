to I'm you know just within the next

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.600 
to I'm you know just within the next
couple<00:01:46.110> weeks<00:01:46.409> try<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.950> change<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
couple weeks try and change it up a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.240 
couple weeks try and change it up a
little<00:01:47.759> bit<00:01:48.140> but<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.470> said<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> will<00:01:49.950> stick

little bit but like I said I will stick

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.950 
little bit but like I said I will stick
to<00:01:50.399> modern<00:01:50.700> warfare<00:01:50.820> 3<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.509> most<00:01:51.689> part

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
to modern warfare 3 for the most part

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.420 
to modern warfare 3 for the most part
because<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> new<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.189> thing

because that is the new and in thing

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.670 
because that is the new and in thing
that's<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:53.909> everyone<00:01:54.210> likes<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.530> I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.850 
that's what everyone likes to see and I
don't<00:01:55.740> blame<00:01:56.040> him<00:01:56.219> because<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.860> just

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
for 3 I heard that model for 3 is

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.100 
for 3 I heard that model for 3 is
actually<00:03:20.670> getting<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.910> new<00:03:21.150> map<00:03:21.420> terminal

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
actually getting a new map terminal

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.690 
actually getting a new map terminal
which<00:03:22.320> actually<00:03:22.770> is<00:03:22.860> not<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.070> new<00:03:23.310> map<00:03:23.489> it's

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
which actually is not a new map it's

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.920 
which actually is not a new map it's
actually<00:03:24.000> an<00:03:24.060> old<00:03:24.239> map<00:03:24.540> but<00:03:24.780> they're

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
actually an old map but they're

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.740 
actually an old map but they're
redesigning<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.910> I'll<00:03:26.910> link<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.480> video

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
the I liked terminal I used to get the

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.430 
the I liked terminal I used to get the
pun<00:03:47.700> nukes<00:03:48.000> on<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.390> game<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.630> lot<00:03:48.930> or<00:03:49.110> on<00:03:49.290> that

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
pun nukes on that game a lot or on that

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.170 
pun nukes on that game a lot or on that
map<00:03:49.650> well<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:49.920> don't<00:03:50.130> know<00:03:50.220> why<00:03:50.400> just<00:03:50.459> would<00:03:51.000> run

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
map well I don't know why just would run

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.630 
map well I don't know why just would run
nuke<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.600> lot<00:03:51.780> on<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:51.989> but<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:52.860> think<00:03:53.340> it's<00:03:53.580> a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
nuke a lot on that but I think it's a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.210 
nuke a lot on that but I think it's a
pretty<00:03:53.760> good<00:03:53.940> map<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.510> if<00:03:55.230> they<00:03:55.620> do<00:03:55.680> drop<00:03:56.070> it

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
pretty good map and if they do drop it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.890 
pretty good map and if they do drop it
apparently<00:03:56.640> it's<00:03:56.790> supposed<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.090> be<00:03:57.239> free<00:03:57.660> as

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
apparently it's supposed to be free as

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.890 
apparently it's supposed to be free as
well<00:03:58.140> which<00:03:58.380> i<00:03:58.530> think<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.770> kind<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.430> cool<00:03:59.660> but<00:04:00.660> I

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
well which i think is kind of cool but I

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.990 
well which i think is kind of cool but I
don't<00:04:00.959> see<00:04:01.290> them<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:02.220> know<00:04:02.250> charging

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
don't see them like you know charging

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.060 
don't see them like you know charging
you<00:04:03.120> for<00:04:03.390> an<00:04:03.480> old<00:04:03.690> map<00:04:03.959> even<00:04:04.530> though<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.980> know

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
you for an old map even though you know

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.620 
you for an old map even though you know
they<00:04:05.250> might<00:04:05.370> do<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.700> through<00:04:05.940> elite<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.480> give

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
they might do it through elite just give

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.240 
they might do it through elite just give
you<00:04:06.750> as<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.930> bonus<00:04:07.410> thing<00:04:07.620> hopefully<00:04:08.040> they<00:04:08.130> do

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
you as a bonus thing hopefully they do

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.790 
you as a bonus thing hopefully they do
drop<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:08.640> for<00:04:08.790> free<00:04:09.170> just<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:10.290> everyone

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
drop it for free just so everyone

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.530 
drop it for free just so everyone
complained<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.340> already<00:04:11.640> have<00:04:11.820> elite<00:04:12.180> but<00:04:12.450> you

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
complained I already have elite but you

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.240 
complained I already have elite but you
know<00:04:12.660> it's<00:04:13.230> like<00:04:13.440> looking<00:04:13.860> out<00:04:13.980> for<00:04:14.100> those

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
know it's like looking out for those

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.000 
know it's like looking out for those
guys<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.459> don't<00:04:14.790> have<00:04:15.030> elite<00:04:15.680> but<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.739> think

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
guys that don't have elite but I think

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.710 
guys that don't have elite but I think
that'd<00:04:17.130> be<00:04:17.220> cool<00:04:17.430> there's<00:04:18.180> some<00:04:18.330> other<00:04:18.450> cool

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
that'd be cool there's some other cool

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.420 
that'd be cool there's some other cool
Maps<00:04:18.960> that<00:04:19.169> uh<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.859> know<00:04:19.890> they<00:04:20.100> can<00:04:20.280> bring

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
Maps that uh you know they can bring

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.610 
Maps that uh you know they can bring
back<00:04:20.640> besides<00:04:20.880> terminal<00:04:21.630> but<00:04:21.810> then<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.410> just

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
back besides terminal but then you just

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.360 
back besides terminal but then you just
be<00:04:22.740> asking

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
be asking

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.310 
be asking
you<00:04:23.430> know<00:04:23.550> old<00:04:23.820> modern<00:04:24.300> warfare<00:04:24.449> 2<00:04:24.660> maps<00:04:25.020> but

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
you know old modern warfare 2 maps but

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.110 
you know old modern warfare 2 maps but
I'm<00:04:25.949> guessing<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.460> reason<00:04:26.610> they're<00:04:26.820> bringing

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
I'm guessing the reason they're bringing

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.610 
I'm guessing the reason they're bringing
back<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.270> map<00:04:27.750> is<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.320> was<00:04:28.440> probably

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
back that map is that it was probably

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.770 
back that map is that it was probably
like<00:04:28.860> uh<00:04:28.889> everyone's<00:04:29.850> favorite<00:04:30.300> map<00:04:30.479> I<00:04:30.630> know<00:04:30.690> a

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
time I was a pretty good map but uh
