what happened to their tech because the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.630

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
and that's so critical here you know I

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.649 
and that's so critical here you know I
think<00:01:43.370> that

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
think that

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.809 
think that
in<00:01:45.049> Brendan's<00:01:45.499> head<00:01:45.679> a<00:01:45.710> little<00:01:45.979> bit<00:01:46.100> from

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
in Brendan's head a little bit from

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.819 
in Brendan's head a little bit from
those<00:01:47.060> Olympic<00:01:47.509> Games<00:01:47.719> and<00:01:47.990> until<00:01:48.319> he<00:01:48.499> shakes

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
those Olympic Games and until he shakes

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.349 
those Olympic Games and until he shakes
it<00:01:48.950> off<00:01:49.100> with<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.340> couple<00:01:49.549> victories<00:01:50.210> over

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
it off with a couple victories over

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.899 
it off with a couple victories over
kitajima<00:01:51.109> it'll<00:01:52.100> still<00:01:52.340> be<00:01:52.490> there<00:01:52.520> now

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
kitajima it'll still be there now

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.389 
kitajima it'll still be there now
probably<00:01:53.299> admit<00:01:53.569> to<00:01:53.929> that<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.679> biggest<00:01:55.130> step

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
probably admit to that the biggest step

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.399 
probably admit to that the biggest step
I<00:01:55.819> think<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.329> montreux<00:01:56.810> when<00:01:57.020> he<00:01:57.079> won<00:01:57.229> those

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
I think in montreux when he won those

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.980 
I think in montreux when he won those
two<00:01:57.439> gold<00:01:57.799> medals<00:01:57.890> last<00:01:58.280> summer<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.600> when<00:01:59.899> he

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
two gold medals last summer and when he

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.660 
two gold medals last summer and when he
broke<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.200> world<00:02:00.439> record<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.890> couple<00:02:01.520> weeks

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
broke the world record a couple weeks

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.340 
broke the world record a couple weeks
ago<00:02:01.789> in<00:02:02.000> irvine<00:02:02.299> was<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.569> fact<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.869> he<00:02:03.020> just

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
ago in irvine was the fact that he just

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.099 
ago in irvine was the fact that he just
swam<00:02:03.709> his<00:02:04.099> own<00:02:04.280> race<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.849> it<00:02:05.270> becomes<00:02:05.630> clichés

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
swam his own race and it becomes clichés

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.320 
swam his own race and it becomes clichés
but<00:02:06.140> he's<00:02:06.439> put<00:02:07.099> those<00:02:07.250> blinders<00:02:07.700> on<00:02:07.880> that's

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
but he's put those blinders on that's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.500 
but he's put those blinders on that's
the<00:02:08.450> simplest<00:02:08.750> way<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.049> can<00:02:09.259> say<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:10.390> in<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
the simplest way you can say it in the
