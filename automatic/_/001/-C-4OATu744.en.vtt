00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
then I realized how much protein had

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.970 
then I realized how much protein had
actually<00:04:36.610> had<00:04:36.820> in<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.360> not<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.780> I'm

protein sensitive but I've used this um

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.980 
protein sensitive but I've used this um
weekly<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:42.820> it<00:04:42.940> became<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.480> get<00:04:43.630> my<00:04:43.750> hair<00:04:43.960> a
