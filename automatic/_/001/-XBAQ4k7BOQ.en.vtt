00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.540 
I'm going to I have a half of a stick of
real<00:02:03.420> butter<00:02:03.660> that<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:04.140> melted<00:02:04.230> and<00:02:05.010> I'm<00:02:05.400> just

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
real butter that I melted and I'm just

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.740
