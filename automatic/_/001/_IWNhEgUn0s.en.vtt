that would be because the only con that
I<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
I can think of for this is that it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
I can think of for this is that it
washes<00:01:39.450> off<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> end<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.079> night<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
washes off at the end of the night but I

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.200 
washes off at the end of the night but I
actually<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
actually like that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.730 
actually like that
some<00:01:42.720> people<00:01:43.020> want<00:01:43.229> something<00:01:43.439> that's<00:01:43.649> gonna

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
some people want something that's gonna

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.310 
some people want something that's gonna
stay<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:44.759> fade<00:01:45.090> away<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:46.079> an

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
stay on and then fade away like an

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.980 
stay on and then fade away like an
actual<00:01:46.649> self-tanner<00:01:47.430> would<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.570> this

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
actual self-tanner would do so this

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.230 
actual self-tanner would do so this
would<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:49.740> best<00:01:49.979> bet<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
would it be your best bet and that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.719 
would it be your best bet and that
honestly<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:52.020> probably<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.770> only<00:01:53.009> con<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.460> can

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
honestly is probably the only con I can

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.510 
honestly is probably the only con I can
think<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.090> about<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.259> product<00:01:55.710> out<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.159> all

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
think of about this product out of all

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.270 
think of about this product out of all
the<00:01:56.640> times<00:01:56.820> I've<00:01:57.000> used<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.649> pros<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.979> could<00:01:59.159> go

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the times I've used it pros I could go

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.980 
the times I've used it pros I could go
on<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> mainland's

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
on and on and on but the mainland's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.050 
on and on and on but the mainland's
would<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:02.009> only<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.520> use<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.700> little

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
would be you only have to use a little

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.840 
would be you only have to use a little
bit<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> product<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.930> get<00:02:04.079> results<00:02:04.670> if<00:02:05.670> you

lighter<00:02:26.780> than<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.710> might<00:02:28.100> want<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.430> use

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
lighter than that you might want to use

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.860 
lighter than that you might want to use
just<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.790> tiny<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.090> bit<00:02:29.120> mixed<00:02:29.690> with<00:02:29.810> the

money's worth out of this no matter what

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.940 
money's worth out of this no matter what
your<00:02:33.830> skin<00:02:34.070> tone<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:35.530> another<00:02:36.530> great<00:02:36.710> thing

your skin tone is another great thing

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.190 
your skin tone is another great thing
for<00:02:37.520> me<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.540> washes<00:02:38.810> off<00:02:38.870> with<00:02:39.080> soap

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
for me is that it washes off with soap

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.850 
for me is that it washes off with soap
and<00:02:39.290> water<00:02:39.470> like<00:02:39.710> I<00:02:39.830> said<00:02:40.840> because<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.230> can<00:02:42.650> just

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
and water like I said because I can just

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.050 
and water like I said because I can just
wash<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.190> off<00:02:43.340> at<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.580> end<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.820> night<00:02:43.910> and

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
wash it off at the end of the night and

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.820 
wash it off at the end of the night and
then<00:02:44.210> let's<00:02:44.720> say<00:02:44.900> one<00:02:45.110> day<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.290> don't<00:02:45.470> feel<00:02:45.650> like

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
then let's say one day I don't feel like

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.680 
then let's say one day I don't feel like
having<00:02:46.100> bronzer<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.090> or<00:02:47.240> anything<00:02:47.420> like<00:02:47.600> that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
having bronzer on or anything like that

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.449 
having bronzer on or anything like that
you<00:02:48.260> don't<00:02:48.380> have<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.680> use<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.040> don't<00:02:49.220> have<00:02:49.370> to

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
you don't have to use it I don't have to

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.910 
you don't have to use it I don't have to
worry<00:02:49.610> about<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.880> tan<00:02:50.030> stain<00:02:50.740> another<00:02:51.740> great

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
worry about the tan stain another great

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.050 
worry about the tan stain another great
thing<00:02:52.040> about<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.280> is<00:02:52.430> if<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.760> use<00:02:52.910> your

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
thing about that is if you use your

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.480 
thing about that is if you use your
hands<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.570> apply<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.870> product<00:02:54.380> then<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.340> can

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
hands to apply the product then you can

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.100 
hands to apply the product then you can
just<00:02:55.640> wash<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:55.880> off<00:02:56.060> when<00:02:56.240> you're<00:02:56.360> done<00:02:56.390> so

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
just wash it off when you're done so

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.570 
just wash it off when you're done so
it's<00:02:57.350> not<00:02:57.500> going<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.709> stay<00:02:57.830> in<00:02:57.860> your<00:02:57.950> palms<00:02:58.250> or

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's not going to stay in your palms or

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.900 
it's not going to stay in your palms or
anything<00:02:58.790> like<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.560> another<00:03:00.560> pro<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.010> me<00:03:01.400> but

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
anything like that another pro to me but

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.790 
anything like that another pro to me but
would<00:03:02.240> probably<00:03:02.390> be<00:03:02.660> classified<00:03:03.620> under

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
would probably be classified under

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.640 
would probably be classified under
neutral<00:03:04.190> for<00:03:04.490> some<00:03:04.640> people<00:03:05.410> would<00:03:06.410> be<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
neutral for some people would be the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.860 
neutral for some people would be the
price<00:03:06.890> it's<00:03:07.310> under<00:03:07.610> $20<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.300> believe<00:03:08.540> it's<00:03:08.690> like

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
price it's under $20 I believe it's like

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.110 
price it's under $20 I believe it's like
16<00:03:09.380> or<00:03:09.440> 18<00:03:09.800> dollars<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:10.340> honestly<00:03:10.790> don't

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
16 or 18 dollars I honestly don't

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.410 
16 or 18 dollars I honestly don't
remember<00:03:11.320> but<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:13.310> for<00:03:13.610> me<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.880> reasonable

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
remember but that for me is reasonable

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.180 
remember but that for me is reasonable
especially<00:03:14.750> since<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.320> is<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.650> product<00:03:15.890> that

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
especially since this is a product that

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.759 
especially since this is a product that
does<00:03:16.490> what<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.880> says<00:03:16.910> it's<00:03:17.180> going<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.540> do<00:03:17.769> so

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
does what it says it's going to do so

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:19.840 
does what it says it's going to do so
some<00:03:19.010> people<00:03:19.130> might<00:03:19.370> think<00:03:19.550> that's<00:03:19.640> too

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
some people might think that's too

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.400 
some people might think that's too
expensive<00:03:20.150> for<00:03:20.360> bronzer<00:03:20.780> some<00:03:21.019> people<00:03:21.260> might

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
expensive for bronzer some people might

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.979 
expensive for bronzer some people might
think<00:03:21.440> that's<00:03:21.890> perfect<00:03:22.310> for<00:03:22.370> bronzer<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.060> it's

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
think that's perfect for bronzer so it's

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.590 
think that's perfect for bronzer so it's
gonna<00:03:24.140> be<00:03:24.320> under<00:03:24.560> neutral<00:03:24.920> pretty<00:03:25.160> much<00:03:25.600> and

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
gonna be under neutral pretty much and

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.620 
gonna be under neutral pretty much and
then<00:03:26.959> another<00:03:27.650> pro<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.430> this<00:03:28.580> is<00:03:28.820> that<00:03:29.510> it

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
then another pro to this is that it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.199 
then another pro to this is that it
doesn't<00:03:30.019> really<00:03:30.170> transfer<00:03:30.890> out<00:03:31.880> of<00:03:32.000> all<00:03:32.120> the

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
doesn't really transfer out of all the

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.610 
doesn't really transfer out of all the
times<00:03:32.390> that<00:03:32.450> I've<00:03:32.600> worn<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:32.989> like<00:03:33.350> just

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
times that I've worn it like just

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.949 
times that I've worn it like just
touching<00:03:34.040> my<00:03:34.160> face<00:03:34.430> like<00:03:35.150> product<00:03:35.750> doesn't

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
touching my face like product doesn't

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.690 
touching my face like product doesn't
like<00:03:36.260> rub<00:03:36.500> off<00:03:36.650> on<00:03:36.860> there<00:03:37.130> unless<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:37.580> I

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
like rub off on there unless like I

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.630 
like rub off on there unless like I
really<00:03:38.000> rub<00:03:38.239> my<00:03:38.390> face<00:03:38.890> hugging<00:03:39.890> people<00:03:40.070> or

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
really rub my face hugging people or

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.030 
really rub my face hugging people or
like<00:03:41.060> changing<00:03:41.480> clothing<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:42.200> didn't<00:03:42.739> get<00:03:42.860> that

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
like changing clothing I didn't get that

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.120 
like changing clothing I didn't get that
much<00:03:43.220> rub<00:03:43.519> off<00:03:43.700> unless<00:03:44.620> like<00:03:45.620> hugging<00:03:45.920> people

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
much rub off unless like hugging people

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.160 
much rub off unless like hugging people
I<00:03:46.190> didn't<00:03:46.459> get<00:03:46.580> any<00:03:46.760> rub<00:03:47.209> off<00:03:47.360> on<00:03:47.630> it<00:03:47.840> at<00:03:48.019> all

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
I didn't get any rub off on it at all

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.140 
I didn't get any rub off on it at all
changing<00:03:49.070> my<00:03:49.160> shirt<00:03:49.370> or<00:03:49.580> something<00:03:49.670> like<00:03:49.910> that

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
changing my shirt or something like that

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.699 
changing my shirt or something like that
where<00:03:50.480> like<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.840> actually<00:03:50.959> brushes<00:03:51.590> up

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
where like it actually brushes up

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.030 
where like it actually brushes up
against<00:03:52.010> my<00:03:52.100> face<00:03:52.340> pretty<00:03:53.000> like<00:03:53.540> roughly

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
against my face pretty like roughly

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.890 
against my face pretty like roughly
there<00:03:55.040> was<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.370> little<00:03:55.700> bit<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:55.880> a<00:03:55.970> transfer<00:03:56.510> but

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
there was a little bit of a transfer but

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.720 
there was a little bit of a transfer but
nothing<00:03:57.830> major<00:03:58.010> as<00:03:58.250> long<00:03:58.370> as<00:03:58.519> you're<00:03:58.640> not

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
nothing major as long as you're not

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.009 
nothing major as long as you're not
wearing<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:59.000> light<00:03:59.150> color<00:03:59.450> you<00:03:59.720> won't<00:03:59.900> really

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
wearing a light color you won't really

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.920 
wearing a light color you won't really
see<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.410> so<00:04:01.400> that<00:04:01.580> could<00:04:01.730> also<00:04:01.940> be<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.209> con<00:04:02.570> is

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
see it so that could also be a con is

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.460 
see it so that could also be a con is
it's<00:04:02.959> not<00:04:03.350> completely<00:04:03.830> transfer<00:04:04.400> resistant

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
it's not completely transfer resistant

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.860 
it's not completely transfer resistant
but<00:04:06.470> I<00:04:07.180> guess<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:08.299> would<00:04:08.420> put<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.660> in<00:04:08.780> a

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
but I guess I would put that in a

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.520 
but I guess I would put that in a
neutral<00:04:08.989> as<00:04:09.350> well<00:04:09.560> because<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:11.209> stays<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:11.660> how

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
neutral as well because it stays on how

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.550 
neutral as well because it stays on how
it<00:04:12.680> should<00:04:12.760> but<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:13.940> doesn't<00:04:14.390> rub<00:04:14.750> off<00:04:14.930> just<00:04:15.410> by

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
it should but it doesn't rub off just by

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.170 
it should but it doesn't rub off just by
like<00:04:15.799> touching<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.400> lightly<00:04:16.880> or<00:04:17.000> anything

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
like touching it lightly or anything

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.330 
like touching it lightly or anything
like<00:04:17.390> that<00:04:17.450> as<00:04:18.200> far<00:04:18.500> as<00:04:18.620> wearability<00:04:18.979> goes

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
like that as far as wearability goes

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.580 
like that as far as wearability goes
this<00:04:20.209> stuff<00:04:20.390> stays<00:04:20.600> on<00:04:20.690> all<00:04:20.720> day<00:04:20.870> for<00:04:21.169> me<00:04:21.260> if

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
this stuff stays on all day for me if

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.270 
this stuff stays on all day for me if
you<00:04:21.979> have<00:04:22.190> a<00:04:22.220> problem<00:04:22.460> with<00:04:22.760> products<00:04:23.180> like

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
you have a problem with products like

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.879 
you have a problem with products like
like<00:04:25.660> migrating<00:04:26.660> off<00:04:26.780> of<00:04:26.960> your<00:04:27.080> face<00:04:27.260> or<00:04:27.560> like

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
like migrating off of your face or like

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.860 
like migrating off of your face or like
melting<00:04:28.400> disappearing<00:04:29.060> that<00:04:29.479> you<00:04:29.569> might<00:04:29.719> want

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
melting disappearing that you might want

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.600 
melting disappearing that you might want
to<00:04:29.900> set<00:04:30.050> this<00:04:30.199> with<00:04:30.379> a<00:04:30.560> powder<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:31.099> normally

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
to set this with a powder I normally

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.860 
to set this with a powder I normally
just<00:04:31.639> set<00:04:31.939> it<00:04:32.060> with<00:04:32.180> like<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.330> blotting<00:04:32.719> powder

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
just set it with like a blotting powder

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.869 
just set it with like a blotting powder
to<00:04:33.229> control<00:04:33.620> its<00:04:33.979> shine<00:04:34.189> and<00:04:34.430> oil<00:04:34.550> throughout

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:34.879 
to control its shine and oil throughout

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.969 
to control its shine and oil throughout
the<00:04:35.000> day<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.389> that's<00:04:36.020> all<00:04:36.289> that<00:04:36.469> I<00:04:36.530> do<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.800> set

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
the day and that's all that I do to set

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.679 
the day and that's all that I do to set
this<00:04:37.129> I<00:04:37.280> don't<00:04:37.460> use<00:04:37.580> anything<00:04:38.030> else<00:04:38.330> with<00:04:38.509> it<00:04:38.539> I

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:38.689 
this I don't use anything else with it I

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.589 
this I don't use anything else with it I
just<00:04:38.780> use<00:04:39.020> it<00:04:39.169> on<00:04:39.289> its<00:04:39.560> own<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:40.610> that's<00:04:40.819> another

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
just use it on its own so that's another

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.510 
just use it on its own so that's another
pro<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.050> me<00:04:42.349> as<00:04:42.500> it<00:04:42.590> actually<00:04:42.889> stays<00:04:43.129> on<00:04:43.280> and

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
pro to me as it actually stays on and

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.360 
pro to me as it actually stays on and
lasts<00:04:43.789> throughout<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.539> whole<00:04:44.719> day<00:04:45.280> even<00:04:46.280> if

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
lasts throughout the whole day even if

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.309 
lasts throughout the whole day even if
you<00:04:46.490> sweat<00:04:46.879> a<00:04:47.030> little<00:04:47.180> bit<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:48.020> is<00:04:48.139> still

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:48.319 
you sweat a little bit this is still

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.709 
you sweat a little bit this is still
gonna<00:04:48.439> stay<00:04:48.710> on<00:04:48.969> but<00:04:49.969> if<00:04:50.120> you're<00:04:50.270> like<00:04:50.419> in<00:04:50.569> the

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
shaved them off to perform now I just

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.499 
shaved them off to perform now I just
draw<00:05:39.440> them<00:05:39.500> on<00:05:39.589> every<00:05:39.800> day<00:05:39.919> no<00:05:40.250> big<00:05:40.400> deal<00:05:40.580> but

draw them on every day no big deal but

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.779 
draw them on every day no big deal but
you<00:05:41.900> can<00:05:42.050> probably<00:05:42.379> tell<00:05:42.680> that<00:05:42.740> this<00:05:43.279> side<00:05:43.520> is

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
you can probably tell that this side is

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.930 
you can probably tell that this side is
a<00:05:43.819> little<00:05:44.000> bit<00:05:44.180> darker<00:05:44.599> than<00:05:44.629> this<00:05:45.349> side<00:05:45.940> and

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
a little bit darker than this side and

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.159 
a little bit darker than this side and
that's<00:05:47.210> because<00:05:47.479> I<00:05:47.629> already<00:05:47.810> put<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.020> bronzer

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
that's because I already put the bronzer

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.279 
that's because I already put the bronzer
on<00:05:48.500> and<00:05:48.680> I<00:05:48.740> just<00:05:48.949> did<00:05:49.069> one<00:05:49.310> light<00:05:49.879> layer<00:05:50.169> to<00:05:51.169> do

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
on and I just did one light layer to do

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.350 
on and I just did one light layer to do
this<00:05:51.469> you<00:05:51.680> can<00:05:51.919> use<00:05:52.159> your<00:05:52.279> hands<00:05:52.789> if<00:05:53.029> you<00:05:53.180> want

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
and then just set everything on my face

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.490 
and then just set everything on my face
with<00:06:38.030> a<00:06:38.240> blotting<00:06:38.480> powder<00:06:38.690> to<00:06:38.930> control<00:06:39.260> shine

with a blotting powder to control shine
I<00:06:39.800> actually<00:06:40.100> did<00:06:40.370> two<00:06:40.490> layers<00:06:40.670> of<00:06:41.240> the<00:06:41.390> liquid

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690

bronzer<00:06:41.810> just<00:06:42.080> so<00:06:42.320> you<00:06:42.410> can<00:06:42.530> see<00:06:42.770> the

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
bronzer just so you can see the

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.520
