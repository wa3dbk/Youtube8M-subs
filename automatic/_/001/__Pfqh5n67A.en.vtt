really<00:02:55.930> good<00:02:56.080> hand<00:02:56.650> presentation<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.459> ball

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
really good hand presentation the ball

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.890 
really good hand presentation the ball
at<00:02:57.760> goodish<00:02:58.060> speed<00:02:58.420> your<00:02:58.570> power<00:02:58.750> move<00:02:59.019> out

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
at goodish speed your power move out

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.530 
at goodish speed your power move out
really<00:03:00.680> really<00:03:00.890> quick<00:03:01.220> like<00:03:01.909> I<00:03:01.940> say<00:03:02.120> maybe<00:03:02.299> got

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
really really quick like I say maybe got

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.990 
really really quick like I say maybe got
caught<00:03:02.750> once<00:03:03.170> maybe<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.590> fraction<00:03:03.860> high<00:03:04.250> your

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
caught once maybe a fraction high your

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.460 
caught once maybe a fraction high your
ability<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.450> skill<00:03:05.750> levels<00:03:06.170> in<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.319> right

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
ability and skill levels in the right

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.930 
ability and skill levels in the right
place<00:03:06.709> likely<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.099> drop<00:03:07.220> back<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.640> bottom

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
place likely to drop back on the bottom

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.460 
place likely to drop back on the bottom
I<00:03:08.239> would<00:03:08.599> just<00:03:08.720> seem<00:03:08.870> over<00:03:09.049> there

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
I would just seem over there

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.140 
I would just seem over there
we<00:03:09.830> don't<00:03:10.010> use<00:03:10.129> these<00:03:10.280> people<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:10.909> we<00:03:11.000> get<00:03:11.120> a

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
we don't use these people so we get a

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.000 
we don't use these people so we get a
bit<00:03:11.299> of<00:03:11.390> variation<00:03:11.690> 1<00:03:12.140> or<00:03:12.230> 2<00:03:12.349> of<00:03:12.470> bounds<00:03:12.799> get<00:03:12.980> a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
bit of variation 1 or 2 of bounds get a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.229 
bit of variation 1 or 2 of bounds get a
little<00:03:13.220> bit<00:03:13.310> lost<00:03:13.459> as<00:03:13.670> challenges<00:03:14.120> there

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
little bit lost as challenges there

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.699 
little bit lost as challenges there
isn't<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.480> looks<00:03:14.870> like<00:03:14.989> a<00:03:15.049> normal<00:03:15.230> day<00:03:15.530> in<00:03:15.620> the

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
isn't it looks like a normal day in the
