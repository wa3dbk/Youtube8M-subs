I've<00:00:10.769> been<00:00:11.010> collecting<00:00:11.250> Pokemon<00:00:12.179> cards<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:12.960> a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
I've been collecting Pokemon cards for a

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.390 
I've been collecting Pokemon cards for a
half<00:00:13.170> year<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:15.299> have<00:00:16.080> caught<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> field

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
half year and I have caught a field

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.130 
half year and I have caught a field
about<00:00:18.560> 100<00:00:19.560> something<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.150> I'll<00:00:21.510> show<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.930> my

about 100 something so I'll show you my

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.109 
about 100 something so I'll show you my
energies<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:25.010> yeah<00:00:26.539> so<00:00:27.539> there's<00:00:28.500> my<00:00:29.119> energy

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
energies so yeah so there's my energy

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.700 
energies so yeah so there's my energy
box<00:00:30.650> sorry<00:00:31.650> for<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.460> favor

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
box sorry for that I favor

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.930 
box sorry for that I favor
so<00:00:34.710> there's<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> energy<00:00:35.579> book<00:00:36.149> stuff<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.899> have

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
so there's the energy book stuff I have

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.000 
so there's the energy book stuff I have
this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.149> not<00:00:39.300> that's<00:00:39.840> why<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> put<00:00:40.320> my<00:00:40.469> energies

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
this is not that's why I put my energies

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.940 
this is not that's why I put my energies
so<00:00:41.790> let<00:00:41.940> me<00:00:42.030> open<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.570> gonna<00:00:42.809> open<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
so let me open it I'm gonna open it and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.389 
so let me open it I'm gonna open it and
take<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.149> energies<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:47.160> some

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
take the energies out I got some

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:56.470 
take the energies out I got some
energies<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:52.280> it<00:00:53.280> goes<00:00:53.640> back<00:00:53.940> there<00:00:54.739> so

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
energies in here it goes back there so

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.439 
energies in here it goes back there so
now<00:00:57.480> I'll<00:00:57.629> show<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.289> interface<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:02.449> got

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
now I'll show you the interface so I got

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:13.250 
now I'll show you the interface so I got
a<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> I'll<00:01:07.409> take<00:01:07.619> each<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:12.260> so

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
a so I'll take each one out so I got so

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:24.590 
a so I'll take each one out so I got so
I<00:01:13.590> got<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:19.040> water<00:01:20.040> energy<00:01:22.790> there<00:01:23.790> let's<00:01:24.240> see

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
I got a a water energy there let's see

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.179 
I got a a water energy there let's see
and<00:01:25.130> then<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.600> fighting<00:01:27.600> energy<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:28.890> is

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and then of fighting energy this one is

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760 
and then of fighting energy this one is
an<00:01:29.369> older<00:01:29.790> version<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.479> an<00:01:30.689> older<00:01:31.590> version

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
an older version and an older version

grass<00:02:00.460> energy<00:02:02.490> that's<00:02:03.490> older<00:02:03.910> worse<00:02:04.120> at<00:02:04.570> the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
grass energy that's older worse at the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.940 
grass energy that's older worse at the
older<00:02:05.230> that's<00:02:05.980> an<00:02:06.130> old<00:02:06.370> one<00:02:06.870> and<00:02:07.870> then<00:02:08.590> there's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
older that's an old one and then there's

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.230 
older that's an old one and then there's
this<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.850> wonder<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.480> bought<00:02:10.869> on<00:02:11.620> Amazon<00:02:12.400> the
