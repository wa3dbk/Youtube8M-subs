00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 the one that crossed your mind in the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.310
 time that elapsed between which charged 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:13.880
 the criminal the Vigliano referee 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:17.450
 and good was transformed into slaughterhouses 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.760
 at the time I had an anguish one 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.250
 sadness invaded all feelings 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.320
 is 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.640
 It was very bad because I could not believe the 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.250
 way that was that we could get to 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.730
 lose the game and in that moment I tried 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.120
 of not thinking of anything to isolate myself a little 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.640
 of all of my colleagues from all that and 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.830
 try to concentrate on the last 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.260
 played in the prison that he knew that although 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.730
 it still has a chance more than 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.240
 could achieve and good luckily it was me 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.280
 gave not hit in the championship 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.110
 if on the pn walk I had a penalty in 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.890
 against exactly very similar to this and 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.480
 I also brought it to the question is when 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.610
 you put your arm and the ball disappeared 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.590
 of the scene where I thought that 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.470
 was in sight when it rose how 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.510
 It was 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.470
 it was kind of weird it was kind of weird because 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.720
 hit on the arm the ball bounces me on 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.300
 the leg and it is suspended in the air 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.670
 and I had time to get back on the fly 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.710
 and you can grab something weird 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.970
 how long after you knew that for 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.970
 yes nor poor he had shouted 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.610
 Then they told me that he had gone to 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.960
 scream everything and the truth is that when I 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.960
 I could see in the night 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.939
 as everything was given because the cameras 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.590
 they focused on him screaming the goal and then 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.539
 like how the fire head grabbed 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.740
 incredible and sending greetings to the banana 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.740
 the air of the neighborhood 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.920
 it's fine is fine daniele built 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.020
 a fortress on that court where is 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.299
 sitting at this moment 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.770
 if I did not thank her for the truth that we 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.979
 we made strong here local 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.619
 we were 21 games which I think 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.990
 that was very important for the raised 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.030
 this team do not think that we made a 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.410
 great tournament a great reduced and I think that 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.810
 we were fair winners so 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.099
 in fact we 180 minutes of the promotion 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.330
 I think we 've been a lot but what 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.330
 we have to have liquidated long before
