because I'm a nice person how this works
okay<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:52.280> pressure<00:01:53.280> plate<00:01:53.990> redstone<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.880> comes

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
okay so pressure plate redstone up comes

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.990 
okay so pressure plate redstone up comes
across<00:01:57.149> up<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:59.100> only<00:01:59.250> way<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.969> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
across up and the only way to get you to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.459 
across up and the only way to get you to
have<00:02:00.119> dispensers<00:02:00.659> make<00:02:00.840> sure<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> is

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
have dispensers make sure that it is

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.510 
have dispensers make sure that it is
level<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.479> game<00:02:03.659> one<00:02:03.869> gain<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.890> Scott

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
level so that's game one gain to Scott

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.770 
level so that's game one gain to Scott
design<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.909> one<00:02:06.090> I'm<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.360> sure<00:02:06.570> what<00:02:06.719> it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
design this one I'm not sure what it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.100 
design this one I'm not sure what it
really<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:08.119> welcome<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.539> game<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.869> luck
