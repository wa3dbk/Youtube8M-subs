considered<00:01:00.359> ultra<00:01:00.960> rares<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:02.010> got<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
considered ultra rares but we got the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.020 
considered ultra rares but we got the
drum<00:01:02.550> set

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
drum set

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.329

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.480 
to but I believe the drumsticks can't
pull<00:01:06.750> out<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.860> play<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> drums<00:01:08.310> if

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
erasers I'm sure most of you watching

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.289 
erasers I'm sure most of you watching
know<00:01:12.810> basically<00:01:13.680> every<00:01:14.010> color<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> piece<00:01:14.640> so

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
know basically every color is a piece so

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.700 
know basically every color is a piece so
if<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> get<00:01:15.570> multiple<00:01:15.840> drum<00:01:16.049> sets<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.590> can

if you get multiple drum sets you can

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.410 
if you get multiple drum sets you can
interchange<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.369> pieces<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.970> make<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> look

really cool and funky and if there's
enough<00:01:22.080> demand<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.770> may<00:01:22.950> try<00:01:23.820> doing

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
enough demand for it I may try doing

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.429 
enough demand for it I may try doing
like<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.299> race<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> day<00:01:24.810> type<00:01:25.080> videos

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
that now actually never a checklist so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.540 
that now actually never a checklist so
much<00:02:25.510> forgotten<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.260> while<00:02:26.620> ago<00:02:26.650> let's

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
much forgotten that a while ago let's

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.640 
much forgotten that a while ago let's
have<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.760> box<00:02:28.270> full<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.600> single<00:02:29.110> packs<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.560> I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
have a box full of single packs that I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.090 
have a box full of single packs that I
just<00:02:29.770> got<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> few<00:02:30.370> out<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:31.030> video<00:02:31.270> so

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
just got a few out of this video so

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.620 
just got a few out of this video so
anyways<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.420> number<00:02:35.050> three<00:02:36.030> we<00:02:37.030> got<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.360> amp

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
anyways and number three we got the amp

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.070 
anyways and number three we got the amp
I<00:02:37.960> think<00:02:38.140> that's<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.320> most<00:02:38.440> common<00:02:38.710> one<00:02:40.080> let's

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
I think that's the most common one let's

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.729 
I think that's the most common one let's
see<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.580> pull<00:02:42.760> off<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:43.000> whole<00:02:43.150> front<00:02:43.590> here

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.599 

the<00:02:47.519> inside<00:02:47.879> you<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.239> take<00:02:48.540> off<00:02:49.159> you<00:02:50.159> can<00:02:50.310> pop

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
the inside you can take off you can pop

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.119 
the inside you can take off you can pop
out<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.120> top<00:02:51.659> part<00:02:53.750> like<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.079> who's<00:02:55.739> got<00:02:55.859> four

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
out the top part like so who's got four

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.259 
out the top part like so who's got four
pieces<00:02:56.719> can<00:02:57.719> interchange<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.319> parts<00:02:58.560> again

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
pieces can interchange the parts again

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.699 
pieces can interchange the parts again
so<00:03:01.129> again<00:03:02.129> I<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:02.849> do<00:03:02.969> a<00:03:03.000> lot<00:03:03.180> more<00:03:03.439> showing<00:03:04.439> the

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
so again I can do a lot more showing the

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.649 
so again I can do a lot more showing the
pieces<00:03:05.099> like<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.280> if<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.819> do<00:03:05.879> erase<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.599> the

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
pieces like that if I do erase for the

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.479 
pieces like that if I do erase for the
day<00:03:06.780> type<00:03:07.079> video<00:03:07.409> still<00:03:07.829> if<00:03:08.129> you<00:03:08.219> do<00:03:08.310> want<00:03:08.459> to

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
try to start that ASAP and our file pad

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.670 
try to start that ASAP and our file pad
here<00:03:15.209> which<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.049> don't<00:03:16.109> think<00:03:16.200> has<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.469> checklist

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
here which I don't think has a checklist

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.369 
here which I don't think has a checklist
either<00:03:17.099> this<00:03:17.939> one<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.359> think<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:19.409> that<00:03:19.470> I

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
either this one I think is that I

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.970 
either this one I think is that I
especially<00:03:22.379> when<00:03:22.500> there's<00:03:22.650> not<00:03:22.829> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
especially when there's not the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.159 
especially when there's not the
checklist<00:03:23.310> inside<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:24.269> can<00:03:24.480> usually<00:03:24.629> feel

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
checklist inside you can usually feel

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.690 
checklist inside you can usually feel
the<00:03:25.409> single<00:03:25.680> packs<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.069> kind<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.250> tell<00:03:26.489> what's

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
the single packs and kind of tell what's

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.729 
the single packs and kind of tell what's
in<00:03:26.849> there<00:03:27.000> before<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.299> open<00:03:27.629> them<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:28.500> most

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
in there before you open them in most

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.509 
in there before you open them in most
cases<00:03:29.359> but<00:03:30.500> I've<00:03:31.500> never<00:03:31.680> find<00:03:32.189> any<00:03:32.340> Keys

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
cases but I've never find any Keys

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.559 
cases but I've never find any Keys
regardless<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.450> okay<00:03:34.379> but<00:03:34.849> a<00:03:35.849> little<00:03:36.269> color<00:03:36.419> it

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
regardless so okay but a little color it

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.390 
regardless so okay but a little color it
is<00:03:36.659> but<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.900> think<00:03:37.200> as<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.560> music<00:03:37.859> player<00:03:38.040> /

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
is but I think as we the music player /
