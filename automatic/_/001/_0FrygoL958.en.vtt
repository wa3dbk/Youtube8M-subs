00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.420
 Chocolate cake and whipped cream 

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:06.812
 for this we will need 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.580
 10 yolks 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.320
 10 egg whites 

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:13.912
 200 gr flour 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.080
 50 gr of cocoa 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.600
 250 g of butter melted and cooled to room temperature 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 300 g of powdered sugar 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.560
 200 grams of black chocolate 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.080
 200 ml liquid whipped cream 

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:30.101
 1L hot milk 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.180
 vanilla 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.940
 and a salt of salt 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.780
 I put a saucepan on the fire where I put the liquid whipped cream 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.040
 I'll put chocolate 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.620
 I will let the chocolate melt and get to the boiling point 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.660
 I put the sugar powder in the mixer bowl 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.060
 and I will add the yolks 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.420
 I will mix them at a very low speed 

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:12.545
 now I will increase the speed slightly 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.860
 now that the yolks have changed their color 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.020
 and are very creamy I will add chocolate with whipped cream 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.600
 I will mix again 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.800
 I will add cocoa 

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:41.525
 and I will mix at a very low speed 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.080
 I will also add the melted butter 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.320
 and cooled to room temperature 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.500
 and now I will add gradually from milk and flour 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.860
 and I'll change the two ingredients until I finish them 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.800
 the composition is ready and I will transfer it to a bowl 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.680
 as you see, we have a liquid composition 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.440
 I'll beat the egg whites with salt dust 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.590
 to get a very strong foam 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.960
 make sure you separate the egg yolks very well 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.780
 I will incorporate foam in the liquid composition 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.780
 I will mix with a phone 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.320
 I will put the vanilla 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.440
 I have milled the vanilla 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.040
 you can use it 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.340
 essence, vanilla extract 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.800
 I incorporated whites 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.940
 I'll put the composition into a tray 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.380
 which I have taped with baking paper 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.860
 My tray has the dimensions of 25/35 cm 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.360
 I'll put the tray on 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.320
 in the oven preheated to 150C for about an hour 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.860
 I removed the oven cake and bake very well 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.040
 put it in the refrigerator 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.400
 2-3 hours after which you can cut and serve 

00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:30.621
 this was the recipe for the smart cake with chocolate and whipped cream 

00:04:30.763 --> 00:04:32.763
 thank you for your attention 

00:04:32.763 --> 00:04:35.900
 and I wish you all the best until the next recipe 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.818
 Bye Bye !!!
