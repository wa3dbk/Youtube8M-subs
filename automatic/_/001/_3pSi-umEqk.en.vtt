00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
brush along the surface I then did a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.100 
brush along the surface I then did a
second<00:01:49.530> highlight<00:01:50.250> over<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.330> areas<00:01:51.539> with<00:01:52.080> a

minister Adam gray for this edge
highlight<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.590> went<00:01:55.740> along<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:56.009> little<00:01:56.280> bit

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
highlight I just went along a little bit

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.020 
highlight I just went along a little bit
further<00:01:57.570> along<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.380> edges<00:01:58.770> than<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> did<00:01:59.939> with

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
further along the edges than I did with

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.249 
further along the edges than I did with
the<00:02:00.119> previous<00:02:00.539> step<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> little<00:02:01.170> bit

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the previous step and a little bit

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.690 
the previous step and a little bit
further<00:02:01.439> away<00:02:01.590> from<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.920> edges<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:02.429> that<00:02:02.460> in

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
further away from the edges so that in

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.109 
further away from the edges so that in
between<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.030> black<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:05.610> administer<00:02:06.030> I'm

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.749 
between the black and the administer I'm
gray<00:02:06.360> would<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> gray<00:02:07.049> liner<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.759> way

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
gray would be the gray liner that way

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.699 
gray would be the gray liner that way
there's<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.239> nice<00:02:09.360> blend<00:02:09.840> from<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709

as with the other highlights ups the
step<00:02:25.830> took<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.070> little<00:02:26.190> bit<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.370> time<00:02:26.670> seeing<00:02:27.300> as

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
step took a little bit of time seeing as

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.180 
step took a little bit of time seeing as
there<00:02:27.570> were<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> lot<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.080> places<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.890> give<00:02:29.040> edge

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
there were a lot of places to give edge

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.190 
there were a lot of places to give edge
highlighting<00:02:29.700> too<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:35.630> with<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.750> armor<00:02:37.020> done

nice even coverage of all the area

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.490 
nice even coverage of all the area
before<00:03:11.850> proceeding<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> shading<00:03:13.350> and

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
before proceeding to the shading and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.600 
before proceeding to the shading and
highlighting<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.970> as<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.260> two<00:03:16.950> dominant

colors<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.300> this<00:03:18.420> model<00:03:18.750> are<00:03:18.900> black<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
colors in this model are black and

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.330 
colors in this model are black and
silver<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.600> step<00:03:21.840> took<00:03:22.110> obviously<00:03:22.710> a<00:03:22.920> lot<00:03:23.190> of

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
silver this step took obviously a lot of

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.220 
silver this step took obviously a lot of
time<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.090> again<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.540> focused<00:03:25.020> on<00:03:25.110> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
time and I again I focused on the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.970 
time and I again I focused on the
tailpipes<00:03:25.710> and<00:03:26.070> all<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.180> trim<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
tailpipes and all the trim of the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.130 
tailpipes and all the trim of the
motorcycle<00:03:28.980> as<00:03:29.130> well<00:03:30.120> as<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.630> armor<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.410> the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
motorcycle as well as the armor of the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.800 
motorcycle as well as the armor of the
chaos<00:03:34.140> Space<00:03:34.440> Marine<00:03:34.800> other<00:03:35.070> than<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
chaos Space Marine other than the the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:51.290 
chaos Space Marine other than the the
gold<00:03:38.270> shoulder<00:03:39.270> pad<00:03:39.450> armor

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.790 

so<00:03:52.300> for<00:03:52.450> this<00:03:52.540> step<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:52.870> recommend<00:03:52.990> taking<00:03:53.680> your

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
so for this step I recommend taking your

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.480 
so for this step I recommend taking your
time<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.600> doing<00:03:55.600> very<00:03:55.840> nice<00:03:56.080> even<00:03:56.830> thin<00:03:57.160> brush

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
time and doing very nice even thin brush

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.700 
time and doing very nice even thin brush
strokes<00:03:57.880> on<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.450> perimeter<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:58.960> the<00:03:59.350> armor

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
strokes on the perimeter of the armor

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.310 
strokes on the perimeter of the armor
and<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.490> trim<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.030> motorcycle<00:04:01.750> as<00:04:02.080> well

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
and the trim of the motorcycle as well

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.670 
and the trim of the motorcycle as well
as<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.980> silver<00:04:03.760> areas<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.810> guns<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:05.500> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
as the silver areas of the guns and the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:36.370 
as the silver areas of the guns and the
insides<00:04:06.100> of<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.640> tires

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.460 

as<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.520> see<00:04:37.700> here<00:04:37.910> I'm<00:04:38.090> doing<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.470> perimeter

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
as you see here I'm doing the perimeter

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.920 
as you see here I'm doing the perimeter
of<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:40.520> friend<00:04:40.760> end<00:04:40.970> of<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.300> motorcycle<00:04:41.750> and

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
of the friend end of the motorcycle and

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.070 
of the friend end of the motorcycle and
getting<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.830> really<00:04:42.980> nice<00:04:43.160> even<00:04:43.460> coat<00:04:43.640> with<00:04:43.910> a

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
getting a really nice even coat with a

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.450 
getting a really nice even coat with a
relatively<00:04:45.080> large<00:04:45.320> brush<00:04:45.710> since<00:04:46.220> it's<00:04:46.400> a

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
relatively large brush since it's a

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.510 
relatively large brush since it's a
large<00:04:46.640> surface<00:04:46.850> area<00:04:47.980> and<00:04:48.980> then<00:04:49.130> I<00:04:49.190> did<00:04:49.370> the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
large surface area and then I did the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.570 
large surface area and then I did the
triangle<00:04:50.770> part

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:05.149 

I<00:05:01.159> really<00:05:02.159> like<00:05:02.400> about<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:04.139> Black<00:05:04.439> Legion<00:05:04.680> is

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
I really like about the Black Legion is

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.249 
I really like about the Black Legion is
the<00:05:05.340> very<00:05:05.639> nice<00:05:05.849> contrast<00:05:06.270> between<00:05:06.719> the<00:05:07.020> very

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
the very nice contrast between the very

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.189 
the very nice contrast between the very
bright<00:05:07.800> silvers<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:08.909> very<00:05:09.150> dark<00:05:09.629> blacks

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
bright silvers and the very dark blacks

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.260 
bright silvers and the very dark blacks
and<00:05:10.680> combine<00:05:11.039> that<00:05:11.159> really<00:05:11.400> does<00:05:11.610> create<00:05:12.240> a

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
and combine that really does create a

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.800 
and combine that really does create a
really<00:05:12.509> nice<00:05:12.659> I<00:05:12.870> pleasing<00:05:13.590> appearance<00:05:13.710> on

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
really nice I pleasing appearance on

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.450 
really nice I pleasing appearance on
this<00:05:15.810> armor<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:18.300> I<00:05:18.389> also<00:05:18.509> painted<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.960> events

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
this armor and I also painted the events

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.159 
this armor and I also painted the events
on<00:05:20.460> his<00:05:20.610> backpack<00:05:20.819> as<00:05:21.270> well<00:05:21.479> as<00:05:21.569> the<00:05:21.659> arrows<00:05:21.990> on

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
on his backpack as well as the arrows on

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.459 
on his backpack as well as the arrows on
his<00:05:22.259> backpack<00:05:22.469> with<00:05:22.949> LED<00:05:23.159> Belcher<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:24.469> when

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
his backpack with LED Belcher and when

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.760 
his backpack with LED Belcher and when
this<00:05:25.590> step<00:05:25.770> was<00:05:26.759> finally<00:05:27.210> complete<00:05:27.599> the<00:05:27.870> next

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
this step was finally complete the next

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.379 
this step was finally complete the next
step<00:05:28.919> is<00:05:29.069> to<00:05:29.190> obviously<00:05:29.310> give<00:05:29.789> it<00:05:29.909> some

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
step is to obviously give it some

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.770 
step is to obviously give it some
shading<00:05:31.020> so<00:05:31.830> I<00:05:31.889> gave<00:05:32.129> all<00:05:32.370> of<00:05:32.639> these<00:05:32.789> areas<00:05:33.270> a

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
shading so I gave all of these areas a

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.580 
shading so I gave all of these areas a
non-oil<00:05:35.330> shading<00:05:36.330> if<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.169> really<00:05:37.349> want<00:05:37.500> to

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
non-oil shading if you really want to

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.499 
non-oil shading if you really want to
give<00:05:37.680> it<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:37.889> dirtier<00:05:38.430> appearance<00:05:38.940> I<00:05:39.090> recommend

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
give it a dirtier appearance I recommend

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.020 
give it a dirtier appearance I recommend
a<00:05:39.569> 1:1<00:05:39.900> mix<00:05:40.169> of<00:05:40.409> non-oil<00:05:40.979> and<00:05:41.280> a<00:05:41.430> trex<00:05:41.699> earth

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
a 1:1 mix of non-oil and a trex earth

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.360 
a 1:1 mix of non-oil and a trex earth
state<00:05:42.360> I<00:05:42.659> just<00:05:43.050> wanted<00:05:43.259> to<00:05:43.379> keep<00:05:43.560> the

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
state I just wanted to keep the

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.520 
state I just wanted to keep the
appearance<00:05:44.669> more<00:05:45.000> pristine<00:05:45.419> so<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.110> went<00:05:46.319> with

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
appearance more pristine so I went with

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.719 
appearance more pristine so I went with
just<00:05:46.830> Nam<00:05:47.340> oil<00:05:47.819> and<00:05:49.069> with<00:05:50.069> this<00:05:50.219> step<00:05:50.430> nearing
