00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.550 
clearly brown but I guess it's kind of
like<00:02:37.830> why<00:02:38.070> they<00:02:38.220> call<00:02:38.430> black<00:02:39.120> people<00:02:39.600> black

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
all that more versatile now there's a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.800 
all that more versatile now there's a
lot<00:04:16.590> of<00:04:16.680> other<00:04:16.799> sectors<00:04:17.220> out<00:04:17.400> there<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:18.060> you

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
lot of other sectors out there that you

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.909 
lot of other sectors out there that you
can<00:04:18.959> probably<00:04:19.109> find<00:04:19.260> pretty<00:04:19.650> cheap<00:04:19.890> but

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
can probably find pretty cheap but

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.790 
can probably find pretty cheap but
considering<00:04:20.790> that<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.090> one<00:04:21.500> sold<00:04:22.500> for<00:04:22.590> so

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
considering that this one sold for so

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.770 
considering that this one sold for so
much<00:04:22.919> originally<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.970> how<00:04:24.300> well<00:04:24.539> it's<00:04:24.720> made

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
much originally and how well it's made

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.840 
much originally and how well it's made
and<00:04:25.260> just<00:04:25.500> how<00:04:25.620> good<00:04:25.979> it

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
and just how good it

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.300 
and just how good it
I<00:04:26.880> think<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:27.960> probably<00:04:28.289> you<00:04:29.160> can

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
I think that this is probably you can

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.580 
I think that this is probably you can
get<00:04:29.460> this<00:04:29.610> for<00:04:29.960> three<00:04:30.960> four<00:04:31.229> hundred<00:04:31.320> bucks

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
get this for three four hundred bucks

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.270 
get this for three four hundred bucks

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.770 
I'd say by all means grab it because
it's<00:04:35.430> not<00:04:35.550> going<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.880> last<00:04:36.030> long<00:04:36.150> wherever<00:04:36.600> it

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
it's not going to last long wherever it
