the<00:02:14.930> counter<00:02:15.230> after<00:02:15.350> if<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.590> used<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:15.980> for<00:02:16.130> a

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the counter after if you used it for a

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:27.559 
the counter after if you used it for a
week<00:02:16.340> or<00:02:16.490> so

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.929 

this<00:02:28.079> is<00:02:28.170> also<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.560> fairly<00:02:28.950> big<00:02:29.280> Cup<00:02:29.549> so<00:02:29.819> it's

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
this is also a fairly big Cup so it's

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.899 
this is also a fairly big Cup so it's
going<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.239> interesting<00:02:31.079> to<00:02:31.230> see<00:02:31.609> how<00:02:32.609> full

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
going to be interesting to see how full

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.459 
going to be interesting to see how full
it<00:02:33.030> actually<00:02:33.359> gets<00:02:33.569> usually<00:02:33.989> these<00:02:34.109> fill<00:02:34.349> it

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
it actually gets usually these fill it

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:47.210 
it actually gets usually these fill it
about<00:02:34.560> halfway

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:03:08.559 

still<00:02:47.850> going

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.989 

I<00:03:08.659> think<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.290> can<00:03:09.439> actually<00:03:09.590> stop<00:03:10.189> it<00:03:10.430> by

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:10.999 
I think I can actually stop it by

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:18.610 
I think I can actually stop it by
pulling<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.290> lever<00:03:12.530> back<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:13.010> neutral
