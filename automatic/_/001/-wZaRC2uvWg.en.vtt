00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello my glossybox is together and 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.940
 somehow the packaging looks like this time 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:18.300
 different from yellow was one namely the pop 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:29.070
 art edition and what do we have here? 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:31.260
 blue box on it was the glossybox looks 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.680
 which are not strictly looks are not made 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.780
 I think that's really nice here 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.360
 that's just stylish how do you set 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.579
 Do not hesitate or ask me 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.590
 In any case, somewhere as a deco me 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.879
 I think that's right 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.710
 would like to ask but the other three 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.890
 this gave it 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.640
 Oh yes, I like it that way 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.640
 but now look in 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.670
 By the way, these were all the means 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.690
 also look what is that in the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.420
 prettiest good question 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.170
 the blue looks chic they 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.210
 actually everything is chic but they 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.369
 actually be a chic character 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.880
 all together so best thoma the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.880
 mobile page 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.580
 We have first application and sense 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:33.190
 pop art in the quartier stock gimmicky 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:38.640
 Colors neon carpet is not cheap 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.640
 but if it's not upbeat, it's not 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.080
 lotion with instructive with cellulose yes there is 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.610
 here also in German 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.110
 The cells are cleaning lynxes 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:57.090
 cleaning and make-up removal yes 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.979
 I think that's fine 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.729
 la vera glossy lips at home one 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:10.019
 Lipgloss color is ok 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.019
 susen barriers what cara once mascara 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.550
 If he is fit eye cream I like that 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.470
 a bit small only three grams but little 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.680
 good if he is fit eye cream I think good 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.090
 and a hand cream are somehow in 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.049
 almost every box in the Viennese hand cream 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.579
 currently in there is vanilla with 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:37.150
 I find pistachios good 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.350
 I think that's good up-to-the-minute 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.760
 right now I have in the next 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.959
 other boxes as much hand creams had 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.860
 that I probably never will 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.510
 can perceive more 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.700
 I will then you on my blog 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.579
 Write if she is technically good 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.000
 now fallen back almost down 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.859
 and I like that but never will 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.829
 I really think that's good 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:59.590
 I see the glossybox as always chic 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.079
 but also has many little things 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.090
 inside but also full size so a good one 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.910
 I have to say that mix is ​​very much 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.040
 varied before the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.370
 product categories I'd say to 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.180
 cleaning hand cream eye cream mascara 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.030
 and lip gloss 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.670
 but that is not balanced 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.230
 there's nothing I can say against that 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.340
 satisfied with the box I'm doing now 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.070
 again to simple dishes boxfresh 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.040
 I really have to think about where I am 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.659
 put down youtube yes how did you do that 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.310
 so box from the outside and from 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.870
 inside and would interest me 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.790
 writing room in the comments 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.260
 and I would say I'm looking for me now 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.459
 putting down a cookie and retirement 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.459
