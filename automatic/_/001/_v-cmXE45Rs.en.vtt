00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.940
 hi previous reviews we already 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.219
 considered motor cultivators and 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.900
 motor forks of the brand ford and on 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.990
 Today we consider a novelty 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.810
 This gasoline tiller forte mk2 to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.060
 Overall, the new model in terms of characteristics 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.119
 similar to the gasoline you already know 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.730
 walker 105 jay but there are a number of differences about 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.189
 which we now tell the engine 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.990
 mk2 models to the same power 7 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.790
 horsepower but the engine size 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.309
 here in two hundred and eight dice 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.710
 which is 12 units more than 105 models 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.420
 for start the manual starter is provided 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.850
 maximum processing width is 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.559
 105 centimeters fuel tank capacity 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.280
 3.6 liters 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.320
 consumption 0.7 liters per hour weight model 105 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.870
 kilogram which is 5 kilograms more than 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.309
 Model 105 has a control stick with 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.410
 using the side clamp is easy 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.180
 adapt to any growth operator 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.789
 walking tractor comes with 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.010
 10-inch pneumatic wheels and detachable 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.989
 one hundred and five centimeter cutter change 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.379
 wheels for prizes and vice versa for a couple 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.270
 minutes 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.189
 First of all I would like to note 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.760
 increased speed 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.619
 4 forward and 2 back essentially 2 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.450
 high and low speeds 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.460
 throwing the belt on the second pulley 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.650
 can get more speed 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.049
 with less power and when using 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.790
 first pulley you get powerful traction 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.580
 but at a lower speed 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.159
 recall that in 105 models there are only 3 2 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.799
 forward and one back ie on the model 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.560
 mk2 to the trailer you get to the place 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.439
 destination faster and in the field speed 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.079
 movements below and traction higher than 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.210
 in the usual 105 models in the second front 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.070
 there is a PTO with a pulley 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.619
 which comes out of the engine has 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.780
 rotation speed 3600 rpm 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.030
 attachments for example rotary 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.850
 mower connects on extremely babes 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.310
 praise and mounted front 105 models 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.960
 PTO shaft is located behind that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.760
 excludes the use of some 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.470
 equipment 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.390
 Well, in the third 100 fifth model 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.910
 physically quite difficult to deploy 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.620
 but in mk2 k differential is provided 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.840
 this simultaneously increases maneuverability 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.090
 and allows holding the right grip 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.280
 lock one wheel and without special 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.140
 effort to deploy a walker in this 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.590
 moment we test the work of the motoblock with 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.810
 plow 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.950
 we changed the wheels on the lugs for 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.950
 better grip 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.459
 And this already standard okuchnik 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.200
 and disc hiller 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.959
 now you see in work 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.959
 potato digger 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.910
 but this is already the standard cutter for 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.910
 cultivations 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.780
 here is my tested new model 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.580
 motoblock with various attachments 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.090
 equipment and satisfied 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.680
 work 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.320
 manufacturer's warranty on all models 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.060
 ford and 1 year cultivators and motoblocks 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.580
 service centers are already in the majority 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.780
 cities of Ukraine all the benefits are evident 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.780
 the choice is yours
