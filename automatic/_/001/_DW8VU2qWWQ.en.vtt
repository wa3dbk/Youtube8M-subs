00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.480
 young people here are again totti me 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.580
 I want you to the second video for today 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.349
 greet today two times already stands 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.869
 stuck for that ultra short game 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.630
 is free for everyone on the map de 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.910
 nuke down with the fhm plays from mx and 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.259
 yes, the cars once belongs to it 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.179
 a gameplay of then give again 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.210
 with the sniper ultras of the player 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.339
 again as always linked below and yes 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.160
 why this video became me today 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.120
 checked several times children alone 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.670
 warrior I would be there myself 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.079
 I wanted to keep it out a bit 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.090
 never been the fan of any 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.739
 chains letters or chains messages 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.989
 or something like that but if so now 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.539
 many want to know that right 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.730
 personal messages as well once 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.800
 thought all must indeed times make 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.629
 I really want to hear then I have that 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.609
 just out as said the player 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.780
 here is linked if I'm honest 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.190
 I do not remember exactly 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.839
 who showed me everything there 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.820
 and before you forget one and the other 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.590
 then mad at me is I about 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.149
 understanding i just do not want any 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.940
 I hope nobody will call me first 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.649
 there can be no more so now the five 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.179
 first ask how are you then 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.649
 I've just come across 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.090
 my football is taken in the garden aisle 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.830
 whether stepped against it as well as the first time 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.410
 gambled on football and if you like my style 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.630
 somewhere game here so console virtual 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.700
 I have to say that my father was already there 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.340
 always relatively interested in such 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.500
 things and my first game is bon 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.929
 been my father showed me that 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.880
 a little child like that and what age can 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.399
 i say bad i like that a lot 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.770
 very small and can not do that anymore 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.050
 to judge correctly so that's me 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.479
 a child is a bit longer like that 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.550
 my first console atari or somehow 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.590
 So there was something with the datacenter 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.550
 this has, I believe above purely to put 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.729
 such a fat thing 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.000
 Well , we already had my first game 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.050
 bonn was called it and the first game was her 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.910
 bought from its own money 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.010
 I think it was resident evil when I was 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.940
 honestly, resident evil 1 was everything 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.800
 I always only have others 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.150
 borrowed or received from colleagues 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.619
 and I just gambled that or 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.680
 my father had already bought yes 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.560
 so I'm fast with him 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.110
 format and now I still have some 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.650
 themes that I will hear there at some point 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.270
 would 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.530
 and I think that's all 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.510
 somehow it has already been covered 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.220
 video to have made if this video 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.350
 will be seen here because I know 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.650
 Not at all when I will bring now 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:35.100
 daily just alfred jodocus kwak 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.310
 I think spongebob winnie puuh homer 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.140
 simpson and megan fox and then I am 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.950
 As always, my husband and I say out 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.950
 hope that every now and then
