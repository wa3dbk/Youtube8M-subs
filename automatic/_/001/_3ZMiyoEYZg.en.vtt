the<00:00:00.840> first<00:00:01.110> step<00:00:01.380> in<00:00:01.589> constructing<00:00:01.770> these

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
the first step in constructing these

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.680 
the first step in constructing these
foam-core<00:00:03.120> floats<00:00:03.920> for<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.069> e<00:00:05.100> flight<00:00:05.549> t28<00:00:06.450> is

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
foam-core floats for the e flight t28 is

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.570 
foam-core floats for the e flight t28 is
to<00:00:07.529> install<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.490> upper<00:00:09.019> carbon<00:00:10.019> rods<00:00:10.580> in

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
to install the upper carbon rods in

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.829 
to install the upper carbon rods in
order<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.179> install<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.990> upper<00:00:13.290> carbon<00:00:13.710> rods

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
order to install the upper carbon rods

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.540 
order to install the upper carbon rods
I've<00:00:15.839> drilled<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.529> hole<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:17.279> accept<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.270> rear

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
I've drilled a hole to accept the rear

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.679 
I've drilled a hole to accept the rear
landing<00:00:20.550> gear<00:00:21.090> supports<00:00:22.020> as<00:00:22.910> you<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.090> see<00:00:24.330> on

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
landing gear supports as you can see on

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.660 
landing gear supports as you can see on
my<00:00:24.960> completed<00:00:25.380> model<00:00:28.160> once<00:00:29.160> you've<00:00:29.340> drilled

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
my completed model once you've drilled

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.950 
my completed model once you've drilled
that<00:00:29.910> hole<00:00:30.289> you<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:31.769> install<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
that hole you can then install the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.840 
that hole you can then install the
carbon<00:00:34.469> rod<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.210> floats<00:00:37.399> I'm<00:00:38.399> only<00:00:38.579> going

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
carbon rod in the floats I'm only going

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.190 
carbon rod in the floats I'm only going
to<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.510> one<00:00:39.809> for<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> video<00:00:44.629> get<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.719> lined<00:00:45.989> up

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to do one for the video get it lined up

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.080 
to do one for the video get it lined up
with<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.530> hole<00:00:47.570> for<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> rear<00:00:48.840> support<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
with the hole for the rear support and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.010 
with the hole for the rear support and
then<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.629> technique<00:00:52.110> I've<00:00:52.320> developed<00:00:52.710> is

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
then the technique I've developed is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.389 
then the technique I've developed is
basically<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.770> take<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.539> 3m<00:00:57.539> fast<00:00:58.079> cure<00:00:58.399> 5200

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
basically to take some 3m fast cure 5200

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.700 
basically to take some 3m fast cure 5200
you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.670> use<00:00:59.820> regular<00:01:00.059> cure<00:01:00.480> 5,200<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.500> well

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you can use regular cure 5,200 as well

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.850 
you can use regular cure 5,200 as well
doesn't<00:01:02.430> matter

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
doesn't matter

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:13.490 
doesn't matter
and<00:01:05.270> basically<00:01:11.450> apply<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> glue<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and basically apply the glue in the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.920 
and basically apply the glue in the
upper

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.060 

crack<00:01:18.590> that's<00:01:18.890> leftover<00:01:19.370> that<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:19.790> see<00:01:21.070> and

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
crack that's leftover that you see and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.390 
crack that's leftover that you see and
then<00:01:22.250> what<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.520> do<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.180> work<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.660> carbon<00:01:24.080> rod

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
then what I do is I work the carbon rod

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.560 
then what I do is I work the carbon rod
around<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:27.620> get<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.070> glue<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.490> go<00:01:28.640> down<00:01:28.940> inside

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.120 

make<00:01:32.570> sure<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.900> get<00:01:33.080> plenty<00:01:33.290> of<00:01:33.680> glue<00:01:33.830> in

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
make sure you get plenty of glue in

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.540 
make sure you get plenty of glue in
there

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
there

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:44.440 
there
to<00:01:35.150> hold<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:35.540> carbon<00:01:36.080> rod<00:01:43.030> okay<00:01:44.030> I'm<00:01:44.270> working

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
to hold that carbon rod okay I'm working

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.740 
to hold that carbon rod okay I'm working
on<00:01:44.720> installing<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.560> upper<00:01:45.890> carbon<00:01:46.310> rod<00:01:46.750> and

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
on installing the upper carbon rod and

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.080 
on installing the upper carbon rod and
as<00:01:47.870> you<00:01:48.080> can<00:01:48.200> see<00:01:48.470> I've<00:01:48.710> got<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.010> 5200<00:01:49.940> in

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
as you can see I've got the 5200 in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.540 
as you can see I've got the 5200 in
there<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:52.400> just<00:01:53.200> smoothing<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.350> out<00:01:54.550> with

okay<00:02:51.260> now<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.680> top<00:02:52.040> stringer<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.790> dry<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:54.739> can

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
okay now the top stringer is dry you can

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.260 
okay now the top stringer is dry you can
go<00:02:55.670> ahead<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.209> cut<00:02:56.570> it<00:02:57.310> even<00:02:58.310> with<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.700> rear

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
go ahead and cut it even with the rear

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.590 
go ahead and cut it even with the rear
of<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.570> float<00:02:59.840> on<00:03:00.530> both<00:03:00.800> floats<00:03:01.239> as<00:03:02.239> I've

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
of the float on both floats as I've

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.350 
of the float on both floats as I've
already<00:03:02.959> done<00:03:03.760> then<00:03:04.760> you're<00:03:04.940> going<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.180> take

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
already done then you're going to take

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.479 
already done then you're going to take
the<00:03:05.540> third<00:03:05.810> stringer<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:08.650> cut<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.830> into<00:03:10.040> two

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.850 
the third stringer and cut it into two
15<00:03:11.330> inch<00:03:11.660> pieces<00:03:12.200> for<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.920> spreader<00:03:13.250> bars<00:03:13.519> I

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
15 inch pieces for the spreader bars I

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.900 
15 inch pieces for the spreader bars I
guess<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:18.650> want<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.010> keep<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.340> floats<00:03:19.610> on<00:03:19.850> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
guess you want to keep the floats on the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.699 
guess you want to keep the floats on the
cradle<00:03:20.660> when<00:03:20.810> you're<00:03:20.930> gluing<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.380> spreader

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
cradle when you're gluing the spreader

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.390 
cradle when you're gluing the spreader
bars<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:23.320> I'm<00:03:24.320> just<00:03:24.560> gonna<00:03:24.709> try<00:03:25.070> out<00:03:25.130> fit

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
bars in I'm just gonna try out fit

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:36.770 
bars in I'm just gonna try out fit
everything<00:03:25.880> right<00:03:26.090> now

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.350 

when<00:03:37.780> you're<00:03:37.930> gluing<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:38.470> together<00:03:39.360> you

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
when you're gluing this together you

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.580 
when you're gluing this together you
want<00:03:40.570> to<00:03:40.660> keep<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.990> thrust<00:03:41.350> of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.620> floats<00:03:41.950> I

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
want to keep the thrust of the floats I

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.840 
want to keep the thrust of the floats I
normally<00:03:44.590> push<00:03:44.830> them<00:03:45.010> up<00:03:45.130> against<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:45.640> wall

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
normally push them up against the wall

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.160 
normally push them up against the wall
to<00:03:46.030> keep<00:03:46.180> them<00:03:46.390> straight<00:03:48.780> I'm<00:03:49.780> going<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.020> keep

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
to keep them straight I'm going to keep

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.040 
to keep them straight I'm going to keep
the<00:03:50.350> front<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.800> float<00:03:51.010> straight<00:03:51.490> and<00:03:55.050> okay

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
the front of the float straight and okay

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.140 
the front of the float straight and okay
this<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.560> final<00:03:56.920> step<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:57.460> glue<00:03:57.790> the

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
this is the final step to glue the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.280 
this is the final step to glue the
spreader<00:03:58.570> bars<00:03:58.930> in<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.060> floats<00:04:01.360> now<00:04:01.660> a

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
spreader bars in to the floats now a

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.870 
spreader bars in to the floats now a
couple<00:04:02.500> things<00:04:02.650> you'll<00:04:02.950> want<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.190> remember<00:04:03.490> is

couple things you'll want to remember is
make<00:04:04.870> sure<00:04:04.900> when<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.410> glue<00:04:05.650> this<00:04:05.890> all

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
make sure when you glue this all

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.010 
make sure when you glue this all
together<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.120> floats<00:04:07.390> are<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.780> their

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
together that the floats are in their

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.590 
together that the floats are in their
cradles<00:04:08.260> number<00:04:08.800> one<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:10.180> want<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.420> make<00:04:10.570> sure
