00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.780
 the holy book of marbles 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.480
 tells that limits 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.480

 the stones passes 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.260
 the testimonials add 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
 on space 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.810
 since the dawn of time, beings from heaven have visited 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.620
 water handed down 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.090
 tell the visit of the gods 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.970
 you can still read today, for example, about the books of the cazzuti data 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.810
 in these texts. descriptions continually occur to see in what 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.450

 where they are collected 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.340
 for a passage of the mahabharata 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.140
 an Indian poem said the Milanist 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.140
 here too we find disconcerting traces 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.090
 I wish more beautiful than sea 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.160
 celestial machines able to navigate great heights with the help of a

 mighty slept propellers 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.819
 these legends cannot be just the product of a Chinese 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:22.649
 fantasy 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.139
 otherwise 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.139
 we should be common to all the peoples of the earth 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.589
 1947 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:37.819
 flights found by near the Dead Sea in manuscripts dating back to 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.049
 over 2000 years ago

 I come from us they disappeared 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.709
 clouds of smoke 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.449
 the tombstone 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:16.509
 he is a man sitting in an apparently metallic structure 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.359
 busy checking tools 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.849
 not just manually 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.849
 but also with platform 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:28.059
 front air intakes can be identified

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.349
 the stone figure would represent the Mayan kukulkan god hanging from the stars 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.499
 about 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.679
 on the back we see objects of fairy tales expelled from the tour 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.069
 is the position of a modern space pilot 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.479
 there are about twenty fertilizers 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:50.389
 but they are only coincidences, it is not an astronaut divinity 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:00.109
 another extraordinary testimony and the plain of nazca inter 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.239
 flying over, the live clinics seen from the ground are not meeting us 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.900
 nothing but furrows drawn in the ground no less than 2000 years ago 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.289
 observing the bellerio ground at great height we suddenly notice 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.289
 that these are gigantic drawings 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.120
 a hummingbird 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.580
 Peacock 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.580
 an eagle 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.969
 none of these epicurean 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:42.590
 recognizable by you 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.150
 there are no mountains from which it is possible to look down on the flood 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.889
 they had to be destined for someone 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.599
 that came from the sea 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.939
 a reference point for travelers from space 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.539
 even the Bible confirms to us that yesterday's angels are the extraterrestrials 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.719
 of today 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:10.240
 flying objects 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.719
 are described with presence of 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.469
 I don't love you too 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.469
 he is kidnapped into the sky 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:22.669
 wiseheimer asks 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.979
 who are they who fly like in one 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.979
 as dark aldo doves 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:36.789
 the bucket and on the river you meet a big cloud with the center 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.850
 fire logo that once landed 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.270
 described so 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.270
 in the middle of another concert, keep your eyes 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.589
 now I sleep if it is guided by the usual nude 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.370
 that at night it is a pillar of fire that all the people 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.439
 can see 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.499
 the cloud will save Jews from Egyptian soldiers 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.030
 and in the cloud 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.030
 Moses will meet with the Lord Ti 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.719
 the comet star rubei magic the cave where jesus is born 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.049
 this strange star during the long journey from the east stops and then 

00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:16.049
 restarts several times 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:21.860
 the prophet also bible three days and three nights in the belly of a fish 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.939
 fighting was a fish 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.599
 certainly at that time they could not call flying saucers an astrolabe 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.259
 we could call them extraterrestrials 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.259
 the three divine beings he met near a love 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.380
 some lot to ask if the angels I visited came from somewhere 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.029
 other planet 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:45.249
 or solar system 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:49.849
 yet guilty cries strange clouds of chariots of fire are filled the sacred 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:52.289
 scriptures 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.839
 andros means messenger 

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:57.839
 but messengers of whom 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.570
 messeger sent by god 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.660

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:07.110

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:11.289
 the Florentine city 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:14.520
 I was annihilated I say 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.340
 a story that could be repeated
