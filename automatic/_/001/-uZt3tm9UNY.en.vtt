to scab up your face I made the mistake

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.890

of<00:01:16.170> using<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.009> bigger<00:01:17.460> disc<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:18.600> face

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
of using a bigger disc on my face

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.469 
of using a bigger disc on my face
because<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.430> my<00:01:20.520> cheek<00:01:20.820> area<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
because it was on my cheek area I

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
because it was on my cheek area I
figured<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> bigger<00:01:23.130> area<00:01:23.430> i

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
figured it you know it's a bigger area i

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.030 
figured it you know it's a bigger area i
might<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.119> well<00:01:24.150> use<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> bigger<00:01:24.659> disc<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.830> it

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
might as well use the bigger disc but it

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
might as well use the bigger disc but it
did<00:01:26.220> scratch<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:26.729> my<00:01:26.850> face<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.330> i<00:01:27.900> got<00:01:28.140> some
