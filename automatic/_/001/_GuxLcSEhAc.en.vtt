hey my friends welcome back to falcones

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.740 
hey my friends welcome back to falcones
RC<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.679> here<00:00:10.950> we<00:00:11.040> have<00:00:11.070> again<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.150> Learjet<00:00:13.019> 55

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
RC and here we have again the Learjet 55

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.779 
RC and here we have again the Learjet 55
late<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.960> fly<00:00:16.199> again<00:00:16.440> guys<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.250> actually

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
late to fly again guys I actually

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.779 
late to fly again guys I actually
already<00:00:18.180> had<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> successful<00:00:19.289> made<00:00:20.160> him<00:00:20.369> fly<00:00:20.640> on

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
already had a successful made him fly on

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.410 
already had a successful made him fly on
this<00:00:20.939> jet<00:00:21.210> probably<00:00:22.170> about<00:00:22.320> two<00:00:22.590> weeks<00:00:22.800> ago<00:00:23.420> it

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
this jet probably about two weeks ago it

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.920 
this jet probably about two weeks ago it
was<00:00:24.949> successful<00:00:26.180> only<00:00:27.180> about<00:00:27.330> ninety<00:00:27.810> percent

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
was successful only about ninety percent

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.830 
was successful only about ninety percent
I<00:00:28.380> guess<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.710> can<00:00:28.830> say<00:00:29.010> because<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.510> final

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
I guess we can say because on the final

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.170 
I guess we can say because on the final
approach<00:00:31.109> my<00:00:31.560> wires<00:00:32.130> they<00:00:32.850> were<00:00:33.000> actually

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
approach my wires they were actually

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.229 
approach my wires they were actually
plug<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> ballot<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.710> two<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.820> three

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
plug in the ballot is two to the three

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.959 
plug in the ballot is two to the three
controllers<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.770> plastic<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.370> car<00:00:38.579> got

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
controllers the plastic on the car got

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.150 
controllers the plastic on the car got
overheated<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> plastic

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
overheated and you see the plastic

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
overheated and you see the plastic
melted<00:00:41.579> around<00:00:41.850> these<00:00:42.030> things<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.600> basically

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
melted around these things and basically

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.709 
melted around these things and basically
the<00:00:43.230> plant<00:00:43.559> landed<00:00:44.280> itself<00:00:44.700> probably<00:00:45.539> about

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the plant landed itself probably about

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.700 
the plant landed itself probably about
10<00:00:46.020> foods<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.520> ground<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.600> usually<00:00:49.410> lost

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
10 foods on the ground I usually lost

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
10 foods on the ground I usually lost
everything<00:00:50.250> nope<00:00:50.670> no<00:00:50.940> power<00:00:51.270> no<00:00:52.370> no<00:00:53.370> control

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
everything nope no power no no control

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.100 
everything nope no power no no control
of<00:00:53.760> nothing<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.239> mean<00:00:54.329> caused<00:00:54.570> i<00:00:54.719> apply<00:00:54.930> love

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
of nothing I mean caused i apply love

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.889 
of nothing I mean caused i apply love
the<00:00:55.230> bodies<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.520> plane<00:00:56.760> juice<00:00:57.030> settled

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the bodies and the plane juice settled

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.510 
the bodies and the plane juice settled
you<00:00:58.109> know<00:00:58.140> basically<00:00:58.559> kept<00:00:58.770> kept<00:00:59.039> gliding<00:00:59.430> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you know basically kept kept gliding I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.060 
you know basically kept kept gliding I
just<00:00:59.760> settle<00:01:00.300> itself<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> ground<00:01:01.199> which

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
just settle itself on the ground which

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.310 
just settle itself on the ground which
probably<00:01:02.699> landed<00:01:03.180> better<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.140> would<00:01:04.290> have

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
probably landed better then I would have

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.690 
probably landed better then I would have
done<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:05.150> anyway<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:07.250> fixed<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> problem

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
done it anyway I fixed the problem

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
done it anyway I fixed the problem
already<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.630> notice<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.979> will

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
already and as you notice if you will

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
already and as you notice if you will
see<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.430> plane<00:01:11.700> before<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.659> new<00:01:12.810> wings

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
see this plane before I have new wings

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.649 
see this plane before I have new wings
on<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.640> main<00:01:14.820> team<00:01:14.970> player<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.240> did<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
on it and the main team player I did I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.630 
on it and the main team player I did I
did<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.350> these<00:01:16.500> wings<00:01:16.799> which<00:01:17.070> are<00:01:17.310> which

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
did it with these wings which are which

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.090 
did it with these wings which are which
are<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.299> original<00:01:18.659> wings<00:01:18.900> from<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> Learjet

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
are the original wings from the Learjet

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.670 
are the original wings from the Learjet
the<00:01:21.090> difference<00:01:21.570> something<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.350> notice

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the difference something I notice

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
the difference something I notice
basically<00:01:23.130> guys<00:01:23.250> his<00:01:23.430> day<00:01:24.229> he<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.259> flying

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
basically guys his day he was flying

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
basically guys his day he was flying
requiring<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.090> bit<00:01:27.210> too<00:01:27.390> much<00:01:27.509> power<00:01:27.810> I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
requiring a little bit too much power I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
requiring a little bit too much power I
wahey<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:29.100> needing<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.939> probably<00:01:30.329> about

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
wahey was needing to be probably about

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.690 
wahey was needing to be probably about
three<00:01:30.960> fourths<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.829> throttle<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
three fourths of the throttle all the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
three fourths of the throttle all the
time<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.390> keep<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.689> flying<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.619> he<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.950> pretty

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
time to keep it flying and he was pretty

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
time to keep it flying and he was pretty
fast<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.579> mean<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:35.909> installer<00:01:36.360> speed<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
fast I mean he was installer speed it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.740 
fast I mean he was installer speed it
was<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.259> was<00:01:37.409> trying<00:01:37.650> fast<00:01:38.240> but<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> didn't<00:01:39.600> like

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
was it was trying fast but I didn't like

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.679 
was it was trying fast but I didn't like
that<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.290> wanted<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.220> available<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.119> fire<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
that I wanted to be available to fire it

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.690 
that I wanted to be available to fire it
slower<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.259> know<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:44.009> was<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.280> having<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
slower you know we was on having to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.330 
slower you know we was on having to
force<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.420> motors<00:01:45.780> too<00:01:45.960> much<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> build<00:01:47.220> my

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
force the motors too much so I build my

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.940 
force the motors too much so I build my
new<00:01:47.670> wings<00:01:48.049> these<00:01:49.049> ones<00:01:49.200> are<00:01:49.350> actually<00:01:49.500> caught

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
new wings these ones are actually caught

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.760 
new wings these ones are actually caught
with<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> hot<00:01:50.700> wire<00:01:50.970> cutter<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
with a hot wire cutter this is the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.469 
with a hot wire cutter this is the
airfoil<00:01:53.280> i<00:01:53.430> use<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.850> basically<00:01:54.299> flat

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
airfoil i use on it basically flat

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.929 
airfoil i use on it basically flat
bottom<00:01:54.899> I'd<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.170> there<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.590> thicker<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.759> know

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
bottom I'd be there for thicker you know

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.109 
bottom I'd be there for thicker you know
this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:58.310> inside<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.790> these<00:01:59.909> are<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
this is the inside and these are the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.399 
this is the inside and these are the
wingtips<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.719> know<00:02:00.810> how<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:00.990> comes<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.259> on

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
wingtips you know how it comes out on

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.069 
wingtips you know how it comes out on
the<00:02:01.469> wing<00:02:01.590> tips<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.009> use<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.119> hot<00:02:03.509> wire<00:02:03.719> cutter

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the wing tips I use a hot wire cutter

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.310 
the wing tips I use a hot wire cutter
thing<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> made<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> arch<00:02:05.939> rather

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
thing that I made that's the arch rather

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.990 
thing that I made that's the arch rather
and<00:02:07.320> over<00:02:07.560> here<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.099> box<00:02:08.369> basically<00:02:08.700> i

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
and over here I have the box basically i

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.780 
and over here I have the box basically i
made<00:02:09.619> this<00:02:10.619> box<00:02:11.039> what<00:02:11.220> i<00:02:11.280> plug<00:02:11.550> everything

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
made this box what i plug everything

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.660 
made this box what i plug everything
into<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
into it

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.809 
into it
everything<00:02:13.560> there<00:02:14.560> was<00:02:14.590> bullet<00:02:15.430> connectors

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
everything there was bullet connectors

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.630 
everything there was bullet connectors
very<00:02:16.300> simple<00:02:16.599> very<00:02:16.660> easy<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.050> make<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.640> can

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
very simple very easy to make you can

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.460 
very simple very easy to make you can

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
that it's very simple brain way I'm

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.500 
that it's very simple brain way I'm
ready<00:02:23.770> I'm<00:02:24.069> excited<00:02:24.640> actually<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:25.030> take<00:02:25.390> it

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
ready I'm excited actually to take it

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.440 
ready I'm excited actually to take it
out<00:02:25.599> again<00:02:25.630> now<00:02:26.050> within<00:02:26.500> these<00:02:26.860> new<00:02:27.099> wings

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
out again now within these new wings

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.960 
out again now within these new wings
which<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.750> actually<00:02:28.950> wing<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.190> make<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.580> about

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
which I actually wing and make it about

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.180 
which I actually wing and make it about
an<00:02:31.120> inch<00:02:31.270> while<00:02:31.989> longer<00:02:32.350> basically<00:02:32.980> it's<00:02:33.130> a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
an inch while longer basically it's a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.309 
an inch while longer basically it's a
little<00:02:33.370> bit<00:02:33.489> longer<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.600> winning<00:02:34.840> span<00:02:35.170> is

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
little bit longer the winning span is

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.190 
little bit longer the winning span is
the<00:02:35.440> same<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.700> i<00:02:36.850> haven't<00:02:37.300> get<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> tips<00:02:38.020> on

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
the same and i haven't get the tips on

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.800 
the same and i haven't get the tips on
it<00:02:38.319> as<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.440> can<00:02:38.680> see<00:02:38.830> on<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.980> jet<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
it as you can see on a jet and the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.000 
it as you can see on a jet and the
thickness<00:02:41.110> orbital<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.739> little<00:02:41.920> bit

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
thickness orbital is a little bit

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.860 
thickness orbital is a little bit
thicker<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.970> ones<00:02:43.180> are<00:02:43.360> about<00:02:43.569> an<00:02:43.720> inch

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
thicker this ones are about an inch

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.979 
thicker this ones are about an inch
thick<00:02:44.290> only<00:02:45.030> those<00:02:46.030> are<00:02:46.269> they<00:02:46.390> are<00:02:46.540> an<00:02:46.750> inch

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
thick only those are they are an inch

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.220 
thick only those are they are an inch
and<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.230> half<00:02:47.310> which<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.630> increase<00:02:49.989> my

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
and a half which is going to increase my

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.680 
and a half which is going to increase my
left<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.819> again<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:52.030> know<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.239> airfoil<00:02:52.569> on

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
left to again you know the airfoil on

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.600 
left to again you know the airfoil on
this<00:02:52.840> one<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.080> forgot<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.470> mention<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:54.280> one<00:02:54.459> is

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
this one I forgot to mention this one is

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.670 
this one I forgot to mention this one is
more<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.090> semi<00:02:55.360> symmetrical<00:02:55.989> airfoil<00:02:56.110> more

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
more of a semi symmetrical airfoil more

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.580 
more of a semi symmetrical airfoil more
like<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:57.040> sport<00:02:57.549> airfoil<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.840> requires<00:02:59.350> more

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
like I sport airfoil so it requires more

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.860 
like I sport airfoil so it requires more
speed<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.459> one<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.880> more<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.420> trainer

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
speed this one is more of a trainer

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.660 
speed this one is more of a trainer

with<00:03:38.109> magnets<00:03:38.560> I'm<00:03:38.859> not<00:03:38.980> sure<00:03:39.040> yet<00:03:39.370> what<00:03:39.549> I'm

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
with magnets I'm not sure yet what I'm

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.780 
with magnets I'm not sure yet what I'm
gonna<00:03:39.910> call<00:03:40.720> of<00:03:40.900> stone<00:03:41.079> think<00:03:41.470> someplace<00:03:41.790> also

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
to be inside the airplane you know but I

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.270 
to be inside the airplane you know but I
was<00:03:46.870> having<00:03:47.170> troubles<00:03:47.620> with<00:03:47.680> precision

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
was having troubles with precision

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.770 
was having troubles with precision
basically<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.000> didn't<00:03:49.359> like<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.540> these

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
basically I didn't like that these

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.030 
basically I didn't like that these
things<00:03:49.959> were<00:03:50.140> having<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.500> little<00:03:50.739> too<00:03:50.890> much

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
things were having a little too much

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.590 
things were having a little too much

flex now they don't have known that all
because<00:03:53.440> I<00:03:53.470> move<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.829> servos<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.790> tail

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
because I move the servos to the tail

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.509 
because I move the servos to the tail

here I'd you started retractable landing

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.779 
here I'd you started retractable landing
gear<00:04:33.780> for<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.259> because<00:04:35.009> I<00:04:35.250> love<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.639> white

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
blue and I think the serfs on the tracks

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.369 
blue and I think the serfs on the tracks
on<00:04:38.159> it<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:39.800> they<00:04:40.800> are<00:04:40.860> electric<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:42.509> main<00:04:42.690> said

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
on it so they are electric the main said

on it so they are electric the main said
I<00:04:43.409> got<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.860> from<00:04:44.009> RC<00:04:44.460> groups<00:04:44.699> from<00:04:45.180> our<00:04:45.330> guide
