have<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.820> very<00:01:15.119> specific<00:01:15.450> way<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.200> working<00:01:16.950> so

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
have a very specific way of working so

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.719 
have a very specific way of working so
if<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:17.970> inside<00:01:18.210> my<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.720> arm<00:01:19.140> hut<00:01:20.040> as

if I just go inside my little arm hut as

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.550 
if I just go inside my little arm hut as
you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> fire<00:01:22.290> here

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
you can see we have to have a fire here

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560 
you can see we have to have a fire here
so<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:22.920> got<00:01:23.040> some<00:01:23.159> netherrack<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.000> then<00:01:24.509> we

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
so we got some netherrack and then we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
so we got some netherrack and then we
have<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> file<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
have to have a file and then we have to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.880 
have to have a file and then we have to
have<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.610> kind<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.060> um<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.500> chimney<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
have this kind of um a chimney here and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.620 
have this kind of um a chimney here and
if<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> look<00:01:29.790> that's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
if you actually have a look that's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.980 
if you actually have a look that's
actually<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.170> hollow<00:01:31.799> block<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
actually a hollow block and what that

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.090 
actually a hollow block and what that
does<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.710> actually<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.820> multiplies

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
does is that actually just multiplies

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.469 
does is that actually just multiplies
the<00:01:38.100> flame<00:01:38.369> from<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> fire<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.329> don't

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the flame from the fire so if you don't

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.060 
the flame from the fire so if you don't
have<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> fire<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.439> won't<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.860> anything

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
have a fire this won't do anything

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
have a fire this won't do anything
because<00:01:41.340> listen<00:01:41.640> basically<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.450> multiplies

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
because listen basically just multiplies

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.490 
because listen basically just multiplies
it<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.399> as<00:01:44.579> many<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.119> these<00:01:45.240> as

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
it and you can have as many of these as

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.440 
it and you can have as many of these as
you<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.829> top<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.299> keep

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you want on top are so just keep

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.210 
you want on top are so just keep
multiplying<00:01:48.930> your<00:01:49.170> flames<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.799> they<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.070> go

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
multiplying your flames so they can go

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.490 
multiplying your flames so they can go
as<00:01:50.430> high<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.210> want<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
as high as you really want so if you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649 
as high as you really want so if you
fancy<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.670> tall<00:01:53.880> chimney<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.479> go

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
fancy a really tall chimney you can go

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.480 
fancy a really tall chimney you can go
ahead<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:56.219> looks<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.399> it's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
ahead and do that and it looks like it's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.910 
ahead and do that and it looks like it's
taking<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.939> while<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:57.659> come<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.829> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
taking a while there they come and if I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.340 
taking a while there they come and if I
just<00:01:59.070> go<00:01:59.189> back<00:01:59.369> down<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.450> once<00:02:01.079> you've<00:02:01.229> decided

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
just go back down so once you've decided

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.289 
just go back down so once you've decided
how<00:02:01.710> tall<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.130> want<00:02:02.280> them<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.090> go<00:02:03.180> ahead

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
how tall you want them you just go ahead

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.069 
how tall you want them you just go ahead
and<00:02:03.570> put<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.259> your<00:02:04.969> chimney<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.180> that's<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
and put on your chimney and that's the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.410 
and put on your chimney and that's the
decorative<00:02:07.469> bit<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.270> looks

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
decorative bit and that just looks

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.880 
decorative bit and that just looks
really<00:02:09.690> nice<00:02:09.810> they're<00:02:10.080> really<00:02:10.349> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.649> small

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
really nice they're really kind of small

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.440 
really nice they're really kind of small
they're<00:02:11.129> not<00:02:11.280> as<00:02:11.370> big<00:02:11.670> as<00:02:11.879> I'd<00:02:12.150> quite<00:02:12.390> like

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
they're not as big as I'd quite like

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.610 
they're not as big as I'd quite like
them

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
them

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.869 
them
but<00:02:13.799> there<00:02:13.950> are<00:02:13.980> quite<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.430> lot<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.849> you

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
but there are quite a lot so you

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.729 
but there are quite a lot so you
actually<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.420> wooden<00:02:15.930> chimney<00:02:16.349> which<00:02:16.530> I

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
actually have a wooden chimney which I

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.960 
actually have a wooden chimney which I
don't<00:02:17.040> think<00:02:17.280> that's<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.580> very<00:02:17.700> good<00:02:17.819> idea

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
don't think that's a very good idea

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.899 
don't think that's a very good idea
probably<00:02:18.299> catch<00:02:18.659> fire<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.500> brick<00:02:20.280> chimney<00:02:20.760> I'm

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
probably catch fire a brick chimney I'm

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.940 
probably catch fire a brick chimney I'm
not<00:02:21.150> even<00:02:21.360> sure<00:02:21.390> what<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.720> looks<00:02:21.989> like<00:02:22.049> so

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
not even sure what that looks like so

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.410 
not even sure what that looks like so
just<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.430> give<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.640> an<00:02:23.760> idea<00:02:23.879> of<00:02:24.090> what<00:02:24.330> they

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
just to give you an idea of what they

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.089 
just to give you an idea of what they
actually<00:02:24.540> looked<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:24.989> there's<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.590> brick<00:02:25.890> one

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
actually looked like there's a brick one

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.740 
actually looked like there's a brick one
and<00:02:26.310> i'll<00:02:26.489> actually<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.940> go<00:02:27.030> ahead<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.239> lay

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and i'll actually just go ahead and lay

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.319 
and i'll actually just go ahead and lay
them<00:02:27.930> all<00:02:28.080> out<00:02:28.230> okay<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.099> as<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.849> see<00:02:30.090> we

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
them all out okay so as you can see we

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.729 
them all out okay so as you can see we
have<00:02:30.360> basically<00:02:30.840> lots<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.440> different

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
have basically lots of different

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.339 
have basically lots of different
versions<00:02:32.129> of<00:02:32.310> three<00:02:33.180> different<00:02:33.569> types<00:02:34.049> of

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
versions of three different types of

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.890 
versions of three different types of
chimneys<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.849> we<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.180> here<00:02:36.360> what<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.599> like<00:02:36.780> to

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
chimneys so we have here what I like to

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.680 
chimneys so we have here what I like to
call<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.379> square<00:02:37.769> doughnut<00:02:38.159> we<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.329> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
call the square doughnut we have the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.410 
call the square doughnut we have the
double<00:02:40.170> tubed<00:02:40.650> kind<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.519> old-fashioned<00:02:42.269> ones

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
double tubed kind of old-fashioned ones

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.809 
double tubed kind of old-fashioned ones
like<00:02:42.690> you'd<00:02:42.840> expect<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.319> see<00:02:43.409> I<00:02:43.829> suppose<00:02:44.519> on<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
like you'd expect to see I suppose on a

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.420 
like you'd expect to see I suppose on a
middle-aged<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.780> English<00:02:46.349> house<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.590> we

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
middle-aged like English house and we

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.860 
middle-aged like English house and we
have<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.879> a<00:02:48.060> single<00:02:48.930> cubed<00:02:49.910> square<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.269> really

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
have like a single cubed square I really

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.330 
have like a single cubed square I really
do<00:02:52.079> not<00:02:52.200> know<00:02:52.349> what<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.620> call<00:02:52.650> these<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.310> that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
do not know what to call these so that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.940 
do not know what to call these so that
we'll<00:02:53.640> have<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.940> do<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.329> single<00:02:54.989> cubed<00:02:55.440> square

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
we'll have to do a single cubed square

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.640 
we'll have to do a single cubed square
chimney<00:02:56.430> um<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.480> as<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.049> see<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.470> can

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
chimney um so as you can see you can

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.170 
chimney um so as you can see you can
make<00:02:58.799> loads<00:02:59.129> of<00:02:59.310> different<00:02:59.459> types<00:02:59.819> you've<00:03:00.030> got

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
make loads of different types you've got

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.330 
make loads of different types you've got
cobblestone<00:03:00.480> one<00:03:00.930> there<00:03:01.140> emerald<00:03:01.920> gold

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
cobblestone one there emerald gold

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.750 
cobblestone one there emerald gold
diamond<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.620> wooden<00:03:04.620> cobblestone<00:03:05.340> I've<00:03:05.549> said

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
diamond a wooden cobblestone I've said

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.300 
diamond a wooden cobblestone I've said
that<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.180> there<00:03:06.810> are<00:03:07.019> actually<00:03:07.500> ones<00:03:07.680> made

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
that and there are actually ones made

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.069 
that and there are actually ones made
out<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.549> marble<00:03:08.879> now<00:03:09.299> I<00:03:09.510> don't<00:03:09.629> know<00:03:09.870> there's<00:03:10.019> a

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
out of marble now I don't know there's a

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.099 
out of marble now I don't know there's a
crafting<00:03:10.500> recipe<00:03:10.769> for<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:10.950> marble<00:03:11.310> ones<00:03:11.489> yet

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
crafting recipe for the marble ones yet

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.420 
crafting recipe for the marble ones yet
let<00:03:13.109> me<00:03:13.200> see<00:03:13.319> if<00:03:13.409> I<00:03:13.440> can<00:03:13.590> find<00:03:13.739> an<00:03:13.890> example<00:03:14.340> of

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
let me see if I can find an example of

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.280 
let me see if I can find an example of
the<00:03:14.579> marble<00:03:14.940> ones<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.780> go<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.019> is<00:03:16.049> a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
the marble ones there you go that is a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.530 
the marble ones there you go that is a
black<00:03:16.620> with<00:03:16.980> white<00:03:17.190> marble<00:03:17.790> chimney<00:03:18.269> style

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
black with white marble chimney style

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.990 
black with white marble chimney style
one<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.650> if<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.769> put<00:03:19.919> that<00:03:19.980> down<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.549> white<00:03:20.760> bit

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
one so if I put that down the white bit

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.259 
one so if I put that down the white bit
is<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.299> marble<00:03:21.720> arm<00:03:22.099> and<00:03:23.099> I<00:03:23.459> do<00:03:23.519> believe<00:03:23.970> I'll

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
is the marble arm and I do believe I'll

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.729 
is the marble arm and I do believe I'll
know<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:25.019> marble<00:03:25.319> it's<00:03:25.500> going<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.680> be

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
know it's not marble it's going to be

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.559 
know it's not marble it's going to be
added<00:03:25.950> it's<00:03:26.099> actually<00:03:26.370> granite<00:03:26.819> so<00:03:27.030> maybe<00:03:27.299> in

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
added it's actually granite so maybe in

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.940 
added it's actually granite so maybe in
the<00:03:27.599> next<00:03:27.870> version<00:03:28.139> of<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.590> one<00:03:28.620> point

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
the next version of this in one point

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.619 
the next version of this in one point
four<00:03:29.160> point<00:03:29.190> eight<00:03:29.579> wherever<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.090> you

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
four point eight wherever it is you

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.390 
four point eight wherever it is you
might<00:03:30.780> actually<00:03:30.989> get<00:03:31.290> some<00:03:31.500> granite<00:03:31.829> chimneys

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
might actually get some granite chimneys

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.430 
might actually get some granite chimneys
so<00:03:33.209> other<00:03:33.569> than<00:03:33.690> these<00:03:33.900> chimneys<00:03:34.169> you

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
so other than these chimneys you

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.319 
so other than these chimneys you
actually<00:03:34.799> do<00:03:34.950> have<00:03:35.129> these<00:03:35.190> mantelpiece<00:03:36.090> kind

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
actually do have these mantelpiece kind

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.490 
actually do have these mantelpiece kind
of<00:03:36.450> things<00:03:36.629> and<00:03:36.840> I've<00:03:36.900> tried<00:03:37.109> to<00:03:37.319> make<00:03:37.470> one

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
of things and I've tried to make one

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.530 
of things and I've tried to make one
here<00:03:37.829> it<00:03:38.340> doesn't<00:03:38.730> really<00:03:38.910> match<00:03:39.180> very<00:03:39.450> well

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
here it doesn't really match very well

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.789 
here it doesn't really match very well
but<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.079> what<00:03:40.200> I've<00:03:40.290> managed<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.620> come<00:03:40.769> up

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
but this is what I've managed to come up

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.949 
but this is what I've managed to come up
with<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.340> unfortunately<00:03:41.819> this<00:03:42.389> little<00:03:42.720> arm

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
with and unfortunately this little arm

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.229 
with and unfortunately this little arm
this<00:03:43.410> thing<00:03:43.620> doesn't<00:03:43.799> really<00:03:44.069> work<00:03:44.370> for<00:03:44.400> me<00:03:44.639> so

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
this thing doesn't really work for me so

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.430 
this thing doesn't really work for me so
if<00:03:45.329> you<00:03:45.389> get<00:03:45.569> rid<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.989> actually<00:03:46.109> looks

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
if you get rid of it it actually looks

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.650 
if you get rid of it it actually looks
better<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.980> if<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:47.639> go<00:03:47.730> ahead<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.060> grab<00:03:48.510> a

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
better and if I just go ahead and grab a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.439 
better and if I just go ahead and grab a
flint<00:03:49.169> and<00:03:49.319> steel<00:03:49.739> or<00:03:50.549> we<00:03:50.760> can<00:03:50.910> light<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.180> and

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
flint and steel or we can light it and

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.939 
flint and steel or we can light it and
show<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.750> what<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.079> mantelpiece<00:03:52.560> actually

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
show you what the mantelpiece actually

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.309 
show you what the mantelpiece actually
looks<00:03:53.190> like<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:54.299> you<00:03:54.359> have<00:03:54.599> one<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.840> them<00:03:54.989> there

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
looks like so you have one of them there

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.259 
looks like so you have one of them there
we<00:03:55.470> go<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:56.129> actually<00:03:56.280> looks<00:03:56.609> pretty<00:03:56.730> good<00:03:57.000> and

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
we go it actually looks pretty good and

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.819 
we go it actually looks pretty good and
if<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.750> want<00:03:57.989> those<00:03:58.079> people<00:03:58.290> who<00:03:58.379> builds<00:03:58.739> as

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
if you want those people who builds as

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.039 
if you want those people who builds as
amazing<00:03:59.400> huge<00:03:59.669> mansions<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.780> could<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.019> a

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
amazing huge mansions you could have a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
great big fireplace and then I guess you

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.629 
great big fireplace and then I guess you
could<00:04:03.540> have<00:04:03.780> your<00:04:03.870> chimney<00:04:04.349> going<00:04:04.680> up<00:04:04.829> let's

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
just see if we can get one of them

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.830 
just see if we can get one of them
chimney<00:04:08.160> these<00:04:08.819> are<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> Holly<00:04:09.299> ones<00:04:09.510> here<00:04:09.690> so

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
as you can see again loads of different

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.699 
as you can see again loads of different
types<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:11.790> we<00:04:12.449> have<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.750> traditional<00:04:12.900> brick

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
types and we have the traditional brick

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.379 
types and we have the traditional brick

to get the marble one because it goes

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.860 
to get the marble one because it goes
with<00:04:17.039> this<00:04:17.160> color<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.760> if<00:04:18.329> we<00:04:18.419> just<00:04:18.570> plop<00:04:18.840> it

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
with this color and if we just plop it

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.830 
with this color and if we just plop it
there<00:04:19.229> we<00:04:20.220> can<00:04:20.340> have<00:04:20.519> our<00:04:20.549> chimney<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.269> if<00:04:21.750> we

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
there we can have our chimney and if we

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.110 
there we can have our chimney and if we
make<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.109> nice<00:04:22.409> and<00:04:22.680> tool<00:04:23.219> we<00:04:23.460> can<00:04:23.610> have<00:04:23.820> a

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
make that nice and tool we can have a

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.200 
make that nice and tool we can have a
little<00:04:24.900> diamond<00:04:25.530> chimney<00:04:25.890> pot<00:04:26.070> on<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.430> top

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
little diamond chimney pot on the top

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.999 
little diamond chimney pot on the top
and<00:04:27.330> there<00:04:27.569> we<00:04:27.690> are<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.169> can<00:04:28.500> have<00:04:28.650> loads

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
and there we are so you can have loads

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.129 
and there we are so you can have loads
of<00:04:29.220> different<00:04:29.400> types<00:04:30.060> loads<00:04:30.780> of<00:04:30.990> different

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
of different types loads of different

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.170 
of different types loads of different
designs<00:04:31.530> as<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:31.800> can<00:04:31.919> see<00:04:32.069> over<00:04:32.190> here<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.550> I

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
designs as you can see over here and I

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.460 
designs as you can see over here and I
think<00:04:33.360> they<00:04:33.419> had<00:04:33.539> just<00:04:33.569> really<00:04:34.020> really<00:04:34.289> cool

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
think they had just really really cool

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.620 
think they had just really really cool
so<00:04:35.009> again<00:04:35.310> if<00:04:35.550> you're<00:04:35.849> making<00:04:36.180> some<00:04:36.389> sort<00:04:36.539> of

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
so again if you're making some sort of

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.870 
so again if you're making some sort of
village<00:04:37.020> each<00:04:37.530> house<00:04:38.009> could<00:04:38.370> have<00:04:38.520> like<00:04:38.729> a

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
village each house could have like a

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.360 
village each house could have like a
different<00:04:39.449> chimney<00:04:39.960> or<00:04:40.110> maybe<00:04:40.710> if<00:04:41.009> minecraft

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
different chimney or maybe if minecraft

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.879 
different chimney or maybe if minecraft
decided<00:04:42.270> minecraft<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.139> notch<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.590> Jeb

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
decided minecraft a notch and Jeb

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.550 
decided minecraft a notch and Jeb
decided<00:04:44.729> to<00:04:44.849> include<00:04:45.270> these<00:04:45.660> into<00:04:46.319> the

decided to include these into the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.129 
decided to include these into the
villages<00:04:47.009> or<00:04:47.220> maybe<00:04:47.880> each<00:04:48.150> little<00:04:48.539> but<00:04:48.960> the

mods<00:04:59.669> but<00:05:00.360> i<00:05:00.389> think<00:05:00.660> personally<00:05:01.050> these<00:05:01.289> are

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
mods but i think personally these are

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.890 
mods but i think personally these are
both<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.650> most<00:05:01.860> realistic<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:02.910> boast

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
both the most realistic and the boast

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.320 
both the most realistic and the boast
are<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.680> most<00:05:04.860> nicest<00:05:05.400> looking<00:05:06.030> which

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
are the most nicest looking which

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.240 
are the most nicest looking which
doesn't<00:05:06.539> really<00:05:06.599> make<00:05:06.780> sense<00:05:06.840> are<00:05:07.530> but<00:05:08.009> some

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
doesn't really make sense are but some

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.159 
doesn't really make sense are but some
