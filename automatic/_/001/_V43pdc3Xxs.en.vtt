channel and they're going to be taking a

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.190 
channel and they're going to be taking a
look<00:04:46.260> at<00:04:46.500> using<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.890> camera<00:04:47.070> by<00:04:47.400> itself<00:04:48.200> lens

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
look at using the camera by itself lens

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.600 
look at using the camera by itself lens
options<00:04:50.090> audio<00:04:51.090> recorder<00:04:51.690> options<00:04:52.140> and<00:04:52.610> other

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
options audio recorder options and other

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.150 
options audio recorder options and other
things<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:54.750> can<00:04:54.930> add<00:04:55.170> to<00:04:55.530> your<00:04:55.560> camera

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
things that you can add to your camera

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.390 
things that you can add to your camera
to<00:04:56.700> create<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.150> fully<00:04:58.140> fledged<00:04:58.590> rig<00:04:59.130> like<00:04:59.370> a

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
to create a fully fledged rig like a

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.540 
to create a fully fledged rig like a
professional<00:04:59.910> camera<00:05:00.390> rig<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.340> think

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
professional camera rig and I think

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.070 
professional camera rig and I think
that's<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.790> really<00:05:02.820> good<00:05:03.150> idea<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.720> do<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:03.900> in

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
that's a really good idea to do it in

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.840 
that's a really good idea to do it in
staged<00:05:04.440> videos<00:05:05.010> so<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:05.430> can<00:05:05.460> see<00:05:05.700> the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
staged videos so you can see the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.210 
staged videos so you can see the
progression<00:05:06.050> from<00:05:07.050> just<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.410> normal<00:05:07.890> camera

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
progression from just the normal camera

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.630 
progression from just the normal camera
to<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.000> fully<00:05:09.660> fledged<00:05:10.110> camera<00:05:11.100> rig<00:05:11.310> so

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
to the fully fledged camera rig so

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.160 
to the fully fledged camera rig so
that's<00:05:11.820> coming<00:05:12.150> really<00:05:12.330> soon<00:05:12.450> not<00:05:12.990> going<00:05:13.110> to

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
that's coming really soon not going to

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.780 
that's coming really soon not going to
tell<00:05:13.320> you<00:05:13.350> what<00:05:13.500> camera<00:05:13.830> is<00:05:13.950> yet<00:05:14.340> though<00:05:14.370> I

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
to show you this new format of video

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.780 
to show you this new format of video
that<00:05:39.120> i've<00:05:39.690> been<00:05:39.840> playing<00:05:40.320> out<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:40.890> my<00:05:41.280> mind

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
that i've been playing out in my mind

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.010 
that i've been playing out in my mind
and<00:05:42.270> I<00:05:42.780> think<00:05:43.229> that<00:05:43.590> it's<00:05:43.770> worth<00:05:44.010> trying<00:05:44.310> I

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
and I think that it's worth trying I

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.170 
and I think that it's worth trying I
think<00:05:46.020> it'll<00:05:46.169> work<00:05:46.260> I'm<00:05:46.970> convinced<00:05:47.970> it<00:05:48.090> will

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
think it'll work I'm convinced it will

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.659 
think it'll work I'm convinced it will
actually<00:05:48.419> I<00:05:48.900> just<00:05:49.169> hope<00:05:49.590> you<00:05:49.800> like<00:05:50.010> as<00:05:50.250> well<00:05:50.280> so

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
actually I just hope you like as well so

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.070 
actually I just hope you like as well so
I've<00:05:50.760> got<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:51.000> planned<00:05:51.419> as<00:05:51.630> well<00:05:51.780> for<00:05:52.020> the

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
I've got that planned as well for the

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.810 
I've got that planned as well for the
channel<00:05:52.440> of<00:05:52.770> course<00:05:53.040> when<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.250> camera<00:05:53.370> first

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
channel of course when the camera first

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.640 
channel of course when the camera first
comes<00:05:54.090> into<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.479> studio<00:05:54.840> I'll<00:05:55.260> do<00:05:55.560> an

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
comes into the studio I'll do an

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.400 
comes into the studio I'll do an
unboxing<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:56.580> a<00:05:56.640> video<00:05:56.790> test<00:05:57.270> for<00:05:57.540> you<00:05:57.720> just

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
unboxing and a video test for you just

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.290 
unboxing and a video test for you just
so<00:05:58.500> you<00:05:58.530> get<00:05:58.680> to<00:05:58.830> see<00:05:58.979> how<00:05:59.160> it<00:05:59.280> performs<00:05:59.610> the

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
so you get to see how it performs the

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.270 
so you get to see how it performs the
reason<00:06:00.600> I<00:06:00.660> don't<00:06:00.840> do<00:06:01.020> that<00:06:01.050> too<00:06:01.410> often<00:06:01.620> now<00:06:02.010> is

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
reason I don't do that too often now is

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.570 
reason I don't do that too often now is
because<00:06:03.320> you've<00:06:04.320> seen<00:06:04.620> it<00:06:04.770> all<00:06:04.860> before<00:06:05.010> you

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
because you've seen it all before you

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.340 
because you've seen it all before you
know<00:06:05.729> you've<00:06:05.910> seen<00:06:06.120> unboxings<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.080> video

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
know you've seen unboxings and video

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.950 
know you've seen unboxings and video
tests<00:06:07.890> and<00:06:08.400> I<00:06:08.520> want<00:06:08.760> to<00:06:08.790> put<00:06:09.000> my<00:06:09.030> edge<00:06:09.540> to<00:06:09.840> the

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
tests and I want to put my edge to the

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.040 
tests and I want to put my edge to the
video<00:06:10.229> so<00:06:10.890> that's<00:06:11.550> why<00:06:11.790> I<00:06:11.820> sort<00:06:12.180> of<00:06:12.270> keep

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
video so that's why I sort of keep

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.050 
video so that's why I sort of keep
things<00:06:13.290> quiet<00:06:13.590> a<00:06:13.830> little<00:06:13.950> bit<00:06:14.190> sometimes<00:06:14.460> and

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
things quiet a little bit sometimes and

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.120 
things quiet a little bit sometimes and
then<00:06:15.180> try<00:06:15.630> something<00:06:15.930> new<00:06:16.110> sometimes<00:06:16.830> people

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
then try something new sometimes people

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.760 
then try something new sometimes people
don't<00:06:17.910> like<00:06:18.300> me<00:06:18.330> trying<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:19.169> new<00:06:19.200> thing<00:06:19.620> they

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
don't like me trying the new thing they

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.530 
don't like me trying the new thing they
say<00:06:19.979> why<00:06:20.220> have<00:06:20.310> you<00:06:20.400> done<00:06:20.520> that<00:06:20.580> one<00:06:21.360> of<00:06:21.479> the

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
say why have you done that one of the

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.880 
say why have you done that one of the
things<00:06:21.660> I<00:06:21.840> did<00:06:21.900> try<00:06:22.229> they've<00:06:22.470> got<00:06:22.560> really<00:06:22.770> good

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
things I did try they've got really good

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.230 
things I did try they've got really good
response<00:06:23.220> has<00:06:23.610> been<00:06:23.640> outside<00:06:23.970> doing<00:06:24.120> the

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
response has been outside doing the

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.570 
response has been outside doing the
multicam<00:06:24.810> angles<00:06:25.380> and<00:06:25.890> people<00:06:26.250> said<00:06:26.400> wow

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
multicam angles and people said wow

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.830 
multicam angles and people said wow
that's<00:06:26.820> really<00:06:27.120> nice<00:06:27.330> because<00:06:27.540> it<00:06:27.690> adds

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
that's really nice because it adds

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.900 
that's really nice because it adds
another<00:06:28.050> dimension<00:06:28.200> to<00:06:28.710> the<00:06:28.890> video<00:06:29.130> and<00:06:29.580> then

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
another dimension to the video and then

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.460 
another dimension to the video and then
I<00:06:30.000> didn't<00:06:30.300> do<00:06:30.390> it<00:06:30.510> for<00:06:30.540> some<00:06:30.900> videos<00:06:31.260> when

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
I didn't do it for some videos when

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.810 
I didn't do it for some videos when
people<00:06:31.740> said<00:06:31.890> why<00:06:32.100> are<00:06:32.130> you<00:06:32.250> doing<00:06:32.550> it<00:06:32.640> will

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
people said why are you doing it will

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.930 
people said why are you doing it will
for<00:06:33.570> multicam<00:06:34.169> or<00:06:34.410> multi-angle<00:06:35.039> videos<00:06:35.640> it's

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
for multicam or multi-angle videos it's

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.850 
for multicam or multi-angle videos it's
not<00:06:36.090> worth<00:06:36.270> doing<00:06:36.510> that<00:06:36.840> for<00:06:37.169> every<00:06:37.560> single

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
not worth doing that for every single

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.810 
not worth doing that for every single
product<00:06:38.070> i'm<00:06:38.490> doing<00:06:38.700> a

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
product i'm doing a

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.990 
product i'm doing a
case<00:06:39.000> unboxing<00:06:39.300> and<00:06:40.200> review<00:06:40.650> or<00:06:41.190> case<00:06:41.610> test

for<00:06:42.330> one<00:06:42.450> of<00:06:42.570> a<00:06:42.630> better<00:06:42.810> term<00:06:43.110> or<00:06:43.830> if<00:06:44.070> I'm<00:06:44.220> doing

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
for one of a better term or if I'm doing

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.360 
for one of a better term or if I'm doing
maybe<00:06:45.120> some<00:06:45.660> headphones<00:06:45.900> or<00:06:46.530> earphones<00:06:46.830> that

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
maybe some headphones or earphones that

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.820 
maybe some headphones or earphones that
might<00:06:48.300> not<00:06:48.510> warrant<00:06:48.960> setting<00:06:49.380> up<00:06:49.440> multi

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
might not warrant setting up multi

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.740 
might not warrant setting up multi
camera<00:06:50.070> and<00:06:50.370> the<00:06:50.430> extra<00:06:50.760> editing<00:06:51.180> but<00:06:51.630> from

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
camera and the extra editing but from

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.390 
camera and the extra editing but from
doing<00:06:51.930> a<00:06:51.990> mainstream<00:06:52.380> product<00:06:52.770> like<00:06:53.160> a<00:06:53.190> new

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
doing a mainstream product like a new

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.520 
doing a mainstream product like a new
smartphone<00:06:53.670> or<00:06:54.120> tablet<00:06:54.510> release<00:06:54.660> then<00:06:55.320> that

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
smartphone or tablet release then that

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.350 
smartphone or tablet release then that
warrants<00:06:55.920> it<00:06:56.130> so<00:06:56.340> that's<00:06:56.490> why<00:06:56.670> you<00:06:56.730> see<00:06:57.030> a<00:06:57.060> mix

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
warrants it so that's why you see a mix

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.410 
warrants it so that's why you see a mix
of<00:06:57.650> single<00:06:58.650> angle<00:06:58.830> and<00:06:59.250> multi<00:06:59.670> angle<00:06:59.880> videos

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
of single angle and multi angle videos

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.870 
of single angle and multi angle videos
on<00:07:00.690> the<00:07:01.050> channel<00:07:01.130> so<00:07:02.130> anyway<00:07:02.370> there's<00:07:02.610> the<00:07:02.730> few

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880
