wouldn't<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> first<00:01:06.630> dumb<00:01:07.020> thing<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
wouldn't be the first dumb thing that

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.280 
wouldn't be the first dumb thing that
I've<00:01:07.500> done<00:01:07.680> anyways<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:09.090> grabbed<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.900> one<00:01:09.960> up

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
I've done anyways I grabbed this one up

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.140 
I've done anyways I grabbed this one up
because<00:01:10.530> that's<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.490> know<00:01:11.520> why<00:01:11.850> wouldn't<00:01:12.090> you

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
because that's you know why wouldn't you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
I guess it's the most logical thing to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.100 
I guess it's the most logical thing to
do<00:01:15.479> anyways<00:01:16.110> I'm<00:01:16.229> gonna<00:01:16.549> climb<00:01:17.549> up<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.600> pool

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
do anyways I'm gonna climb up this pool

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.130 
do anyways I'm gonna climb up this pool
here<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.780> more

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
here and what do you know more

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.380 
here and what do you know more
platforming<00:01:22.920> isn't<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:24.090> wonderful<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
platforming isn't that just wonderful I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.530 
platforming isn't that just wonderful I
prefer<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.810> do<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.579> met<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.119> handstand

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
prefer to do the met like the handstand

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.950 
prefer to do the met like the handstand
and<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.180> jump<00:01:33.180> off<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.689> just

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and then the jump off like that just

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.999 
and then the jump off like that just
because<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.229> feel<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> little<00:01:34.890> more

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
because I feel like it's a little more

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
because I feel like it's a little more
accurate<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:36.030> could<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.479> been<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> close

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
accurate that could have been a close

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.230 
accurate that could have been a close
call<00:01:36.990> also<00:01:37.590> go<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:38.159> slowly<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:39.060> these

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
call also go very slowly on all these

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.450 
call also go very slowly on all these
platforms<00:01:39.590> including<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> elevators<00:01:41.159> even

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
platforms including the elevators even

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.219 
platforms including the elevators even
although<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> elevators<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.360> think<00:01:42.720> will<00:01:42.869> fall

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
although the elevators I think will fall

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.010 
although the elevators I think will fall
if<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.220> stay<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:44.939> too<00:01:45.149> long<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.869> they've

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
if you stay on too long when they've

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.230 
if you stay on too long when they've
like<00:01:46.259> hit<00:01:46.470> via<00:01:46.649> next<00:01:47.040> elevator<00:01:47.280> or<00:01:47.700> go<00:01:48.000> around

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
like hit via next elevator or go around

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.330 
like hit via next elevator or go around
that<00:01:48.329> pole<00:01:48.540> or<00:01:48.689> whatever<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:50.009> again

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
that pole or whatever but really again

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.149 
that pole or whatever but really again
it's<00:01:50.490> not<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.820> bad<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.170> die<00:01:52.409> again

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it's not that bad if you do die again

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.889 
it's not that bad if you do die again
like<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> last<00:01:53.670> level<00:01:54.000> you'll<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.659> start

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
like the last level you'll just start

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.810 
like the last level you'll just start
from<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> volcano<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.159> did<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.729> soon

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
from the volcano like I just did as soon

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.550 
from the volcano like I just did as soon
as<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.030> jump<00:01:57.210> into<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> painting<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
as you jump into the painting so that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.420 
as you jump into the painting so that
wasn't<00:01:58.890> too<00:01:59.159> bad<00:01:59.189> by<00:01:59.579> any<00:01:59.610> means

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
wasn't too bad by any means

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.040 
wasn't too bad by any means
you<00:02:01.030> might<00:02:01.210> take<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.420> little<00:02:01.570> bit<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.840> get<00:02:01.930> the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
you might take a little bit to get the

jumping<00:02:02.350> down<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:02.710> don't<00:02:03.070> know<00:02:03.220> why<00:02:03.400> I<00:02:03.430> grabbed

a Luigi cap I didn't think you would
need<00:02:05.440> it<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:05.770> think<00:02:06.130> really<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.460> only<00:02:06.580> thing

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
need it I think really the only thing

the extra like little flutter jump that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.710 
the extra like little flutter jump that
he<00:02:11.560> does<00:02:11.740> if<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.160> need<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.670> use<00:02:12.820> that<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.540> get

from like one elevator to the next or

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.670 
from like one elevator to the next or
something<00:02:15.570> it's<00:02:16.570> not<00:02:16.720> obviously<00:02:17.320> it's<00:02:17.530> not

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
something it's not obviously it's not

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.830 
something it's not obviously it's not
required<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.640> can<00:02:18.970> deal<00:02:19.120> with<00:02:19.150> Mario<00:02:19.600> you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
required so you can deal with Mario you

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.120 
required so you can deal with Mario you
can<00:02:19.959> probably<00:02:20.380> also<00:02:20.500> do<00:02:20.770> it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
can probably also do it

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.480 
can probably also do it
