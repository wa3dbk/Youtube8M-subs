 very well subject and they will not suffer 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.030
 no bend no thing at all 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.979
 forms are designed as a possible 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.840
 it means that it was donated easily from the

 that the chassis is folded thus protecting 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.649
 the fundamental parts in this case 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.689
 protects the radiator protects the covers 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.179
 of the tank and protects the engine cover

 also the shape of the slider the way in 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.719
 the plastic piece that is in 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.850
 Injected polypropylene is designed from 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.380
 this way with the angles like that so 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.390
 when the motorcycle is sliding in case 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.979
 from a fall a right angle does not make 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.049
 stop and the motorcycle starts 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.700
 catapult for that is designed from 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.439
 this rounded shape in all the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.969
 angles means that you can shoot 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.069
 about this about this or color of 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.869
 any of the faces without leaving 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.310
 to brake against the soon an edge 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.649
 some gap that you find soon 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.939
 on the road back I repeat it is

 say that this one is designed to be 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.509
 double a lot before you get to double

 some of the parts of the chassis 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.709
 thus protecting the fundamental parts 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.299
 of the motorcycle if necessary 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.549
