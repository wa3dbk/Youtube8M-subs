time that I have I'm you know I also try

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.869 
time that I have I'm you know I also try
for<00:02:08.519> it<00:02:08.549> i'll<00:02:08.789> still<00:02:09.000> try<00:02:09.179> for<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.879> how

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
for it i'll still try for it but how

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.440 
for it i'll still try for it but how
with<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.269> amount<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.629> time

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
with the amount of time

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.199 
with the amount of time
you<00:02:14.170> know<00:02:14.319> I<00:02:14.349> think<00:02:14.830> maybe<00:02:15.190> like<00:02:15.430> 50<00:02:15.790> plus<00:02:16.000> is

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
you know I think maybe like 50 plus is

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.020 
you know I think maybe like 50 plus is
more<00:02:16.450> reasonable<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.290> i'll<00:02:17.790> see<00:02:18.790> what<00:02:18.910> i<00:02:18.940> could

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
more reasonable so i'll see what i could

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.000 
more reasonable so i'll see what i could
do<00:02:19.239> is<00:02:19.269> start<00:02:19.720> farming<00:02:19.959> up<00:02:20.200> some<00:02:20.379> keys<00:02:20.620> start

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
do is start farming up some keys start

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.699 
do is start farming up some keys start
grinding<00:02:21.700> those<00:02:21.819> greater<00:02:22.180> rifts<00:02:22.629> um<00:02:22.870> I'm<00:02:23.379> sure

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
grinding those greater rifts um I'm sure

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.140 
grinding those greater rifts um I'm sure
it<00:02:23.890> won't<00:02:24.010> take<00:02:24.250> too<00:02:24.280> long<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.760> last<00:02:24.940> time<00:02:25.120> I

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
it won't take too long the last time I

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.710 
it won't take too long the last time I
did<00:02:25.269> 50<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:25.840> mine<00:02:26.019> on<00:02:26.170> season<00:02:26.709> in<00:02:26.890> error<00:02:27.160> too<00:02:27.720> so

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
did 50 on mine on season in error too so

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.110 
did 50 on mine on season in error too so
um<00:02:29.310> if<00:02:30.310> we<00:02:30.640> look<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.200> leaderboards<00:02:33.120> normal

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
um if we look at the leaderboards normal

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.660 
um if we look at the leaderboards normal
um<00:02:36.599> there<00:02:37.599> we<00:02:37.690> go<00:02:37.840> all<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:39.069> way<00:02:39.099> down<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.340> 12

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
um there we go all the way down to 12

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.020 
um there we go all the way down to 12
now<00:02:40.349> alright<00:02:41.349> well<00:02:41.530> anyways<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.489> was<00:02:42.790> actually

a couple days but I mean it really comes
down<00:02:55.569> to<00:02:55.750> farming<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.620> perfect<00:02:57.099> riff<00:02:57.310> that

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
down to farming that perfect riff that

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.920 
down to farming that perfect riff that
has<00:02:57.930> stone<00:02:58.930> singer<00:02:59.319> at<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.560> end<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.239> mean

has stone singer at the end so I mean
getting<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.650> greater<00:03:02.890> rift<00:03:03.160> clear<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.610> almost

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
getting a greater rift clear is almost

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.330 
getting a greater rift clear is almost
as<00:03:04.269> orangey<00:03:04.720> is<00:03:04.750> getting<00:03:05.410> an<00:03:05.769> ancient<00:03:06.160> furnace

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340

after I finished up all my stuff here
and<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.209> was<00:03:40.389> down<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.930> like<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.350> very<00:03:41.650> end<00:03:41.980> of

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
and I was down to like the very end of

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.860 
and I was down to like the very end of
you<00:03:42.579> know<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.700> figured<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.329> season<00:03:43.660> would<00:03:43.780> be

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
you know I figured the season would be

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.590 
you know I figured the season would be
like<00:03:44.079> 3-4<00:03:44.859> months<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.519> on<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.329> know<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.569> last

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
like 3-4 months so on you know the last

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.629 
like 3-4 months so on you know the last
month<00:03:47.350> or<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.769> could<00:03:48.069> have<00:03:48.130> gone<00:03:48.250> into<00:03:48.459> the

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
month or so I could have gone into the

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.940 
month or so I could have gone into the
PTR<00:03:49.030> figured<00:03:49.450> out<00:03:49.569> all<00:03:49.750> this<00:03:49.870> stuff<00:03:50.139> but<00:03:50.889> uh

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
PTR figured out all this stuff but uh

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.800 
PTR figured out all this stuff but uh
this<00:03:51.310> kind<00:03:51.579> of<00:03:51.639> sucks<00:03:51.880> because<00:03:52.150> it's<00:03:52.600> going<00:03:52.720> to

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
this kind of sucks because it's going to

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.809 
this kind of sucks because it's going to
be<00:03:52.930> hard<00:03:53.170> for<00:03:53.410> me<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.739> get<00:03:53.859> my<00:03:54.010> hands<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.519> all

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
be hard for me to get my hands on all
