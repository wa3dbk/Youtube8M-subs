to practice their English every day

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.330 
to practice their English every day

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
which is something that they don't get

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.250 
which is something that they don't get
it<00:03:17.459> at<00:03:17.970> school<00:03:18.299> in<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.540> school<00:03:18.690> system<00:03:19.170> of

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
course so the end result is that

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.349
