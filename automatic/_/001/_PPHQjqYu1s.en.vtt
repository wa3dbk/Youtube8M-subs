00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.810
 hello how about youtube friends how 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.340
 they are here I arrived with new video in 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.349
 this time we are going to use how can 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.630
 make a server in the pirate minecraft 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.490
 with hams and in an easy way and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.529
 simple we have a video 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.090
 previously how to do it for pc in 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.369
 this time we are going to see him to death 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.839
 so we started well my friends what 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.120
 first thing we have to do is go to the 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:38.649
 official page to mark 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.649
 and we are going to remove it 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.680
 ok if you're going to do it for windows you're going 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.290
 to download this to the server 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.800
 minecraft for windows if you're going to do it 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:54.080
 at sea as in my case we sting this 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.080
 we explain here and we give you download 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.650
 we put ourselves here 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.129
 we close and we will put it inside 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.970
 a folder 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.490
 A) Yes 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.750
 are the same steps for windows is 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.830
 same as it is exactly the same 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.830
 as we have here in 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.170
 we open the folder as you can see in 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.860
 screen and double click 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 we'll see 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.750
 and as you can see several have been created 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.880
 folders within the game that I have 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:38.630
 let's hope they say here and we close it 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:41.860
 well says service 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.070
 we click and we open it with 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.440
 we chop another one we go down and we'll see 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.040
 with 3 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.670
 in windows they will do it with name 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.140
 alright now let's go to the machine 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.830
 if you do not have it actually the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.000
 description 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.620
 we see here open 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.530
 and we are going to create a new network 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.220
 If you are the house , who will know what 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.920
 what is the network server and create 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.680
 a black xxi 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.590
 here and here you will write the name that 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.470
 you want to give it and let's put 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.220
 then 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.220
 Minecraft 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.819
 then teacher and the code that we want 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.740
 about 3 1 2 3 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.390
 and as you can see they already have it 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.800
 so the game minecraft 2 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.800
 and the here creates 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.920
 maybe as you can see on the screen and 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.450
 says one of five can play up 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.280
 five people in one 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.530
 if I after kissing the world to a 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.890
 friend obviously then and my friend who 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.640
 are downloaded to machine we will go to 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.440
 network 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.410
 this the same for both windows and 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.230
 for mac exactly and they are going to join 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.510
 as you can see here now big 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.090
 instant 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.090
 and what happens here the fire 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.560
 Minecraft 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.860
 and step 3 1 2 3 and it gives 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.290
 automatically then you are going to fall here 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.360
 down will not fall down here like here 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.080
 how can you see on the screen that I'm in 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.360

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.360
 mark 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.159
 we're here for the Bous 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:10.840
 obviously we will apply here we go 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.840

 we can copy what minimum 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.570
 A) Yes 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.330
 and we are going to copy that is in my case 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.230
 it would be 25 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.120
 point 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.160
 42 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.540
 point 92 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.430
 point 1 1 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.250
 obviously 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.930
 we have to also always have in my 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.139
 forgiveness case 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.780
 this always has to be there 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.639
 and we are going to give it here finished if 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.150
 you did well you will come out what is 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.580
 these bars how to design in green this 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.279
 it means that the job is fine 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.629
 if we want a friend to join us 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.629
 is going to give here the direct connection 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:29.020
 and will write the same 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.020
 to write 5 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.900
 35 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.440
 point 42 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.440
 point 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:43.620
 and 92 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.620
 point 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.300
 and if you did it well obviously for the 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.040
 two are going to be on the same server 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.389
 obviously, up to five people 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:58.900
 can play and well the act depends on 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:07:01.479
 the state box connection depends on the 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.190
 plan that there is on the server and of my 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:07.030
 friends like that is the way you can 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:11.440
 make a pirate server using a 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:13.260
 machine running to my friends this 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.270
