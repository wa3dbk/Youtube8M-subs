build<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.630> hotel<00:00:21.869> which<00:00:22.710> I'm<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.100> doing<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:25.910> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
build a hotel which I'm now doing I you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.120 
build a hotel which I'm now doing I you
know<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.510> not<00:00:27.750> really<00:00:27.990> using<00:00:28.320> much<00:00:28.650> reference

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
know I'm not really using much reference

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.009 
know I'm not really using much reference
on<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> think<00:00:29.939> I'm<00:00:30.210> kind<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.840> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
on this one I think I'm kind of going to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.250 
on this one I think I'm kind of going to
originally<00:00:31.650> create<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.369> hotel<00:00:33.950> meaning<00:00:36.260> it's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
originally create a hotel meaning it's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.830 
originally create a hotel meaning it's
not<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.649> look<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.829> other<00:00:38.600> hotels<00:00:39.600> i

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
not going to look like other hotels i

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.420 
not going to look like other hotels i
guess<00:00:40.730> i<00:00:41.750> will<00:00:42.750> say<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.320> probably<00:00:43.800> will<00:00:43.980> not<00:00:44.190> be

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
guess i will say it probably will not be

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.400 
guess i will say it probably will not be
a<00:00:44.460> massive<00:00:45.090> hotel<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.750> coffin<00:00:46.260> chair

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
a massive hotel because coffin chair

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.920 
a massive hotel because coffin chair
doesn't<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:46.770> need<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.600> also<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> don't

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
doesn't really need one also I don't

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.430 
doesn't really need one also I don't
want<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> build<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.590> massive<00:00:49.950> hotel<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.780> Brett

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
want to build a massive hotel like Brett

want to build a massive hotel like Brett
MC<00:00:52.920> made<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.789> crazy<00:00:54.390> large<00:00:55.020> hotel

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
MC made this really crazy large hotel

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.900 
MC made this really crazy large hotel
this<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.370> more<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.690> smaller

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
this is going to be more of a smaller

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
this is going to be more of a smaller
hotel<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:02.809> I'm<00:01:03.809> thinking<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> rooms<00:01:04.530> won't

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
hotel like I'm thinking the rooms won't

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.330 
hotel like I'm thinking the rooms won't
be<00:01:05.040> particularly<00:01:05.670> large<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:07.290> don't<00:01:08.100> know<00:01:08.189> how

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
be particularly large I don't know how

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.469 
be particularly large I don't know how
many<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:08.970> able<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> get<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
many I'm going to be able to get on a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450 
many I'm going to be able to get on a
floor<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.110> don't<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.470> exactly<00:01:10.920> how<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.280> going

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
floor I don't know exactly how I'm going

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.289 
floor I don't know exactly how I'm going
to<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:13.760> probably<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.150> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
to do it probably going to have to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210 
to do it probably going to have to
figure<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.509> some<00:01:15.810> way<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.320> elevators

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
figure out some way to do elevators

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.340 
figure out some way to do elevators
because<00:01:17.460> i<00:01:17.549> don't<00:01:17.729> i<00:01:18.030> might<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.080> water

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
because i don't i might do like water

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.649 
because i don't i might do like water
elevators<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.210> seems<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.540> people

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
elevators because it seems like people

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.740 
elevators because it seems like people
use<00:01:22.110> those<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> lot<00:01:22.759> but<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> other<00:01:24.240> hand<00:01:24.330> i

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
use those a lot but on the other hand i

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.350 
use those a lot but on the other hand i
may<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.530> i'm<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.220> figure<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:26.880> some<00:01:27.119> sort<00:01:27.240> of

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
may not i'm a figure out some sort of

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.179 
may not i'm a figure out some sort of
stair<00:01:27.600> system<00:01:28.400> because<00:01:30.619> whatever<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:32.070> I'm

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
stair system because whatever but I'm

stair system because whatever but I'm
making<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.579> white<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.020> noticed<00:01:34.530> that

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
making it white because I noticed that

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.600 
making it white because I noticed that
nice<00:01:35.759> hotels<00:01:36.270> either<00:01:36.570> tend<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:36.990> white<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:37.610> a
