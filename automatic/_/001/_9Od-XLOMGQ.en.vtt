00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
back that it seems to me that this

back that it seems to me that this
series<00:02:06.030> there's<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.630> lot<00:02:06.810> of

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
series there's going to be a lot of

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.589 
series there's going to be a lot of
textured<00:02:07.740> sculpting<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.390> like

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
textured sculpting going on and I like

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.790 
textured sculpting going on and I like
what<00:02:09.810> they<00:02:09.899> did<00:02:09.929> with<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> gray<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
what they did with the gray and the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.160 
what they did with the gray and the
black<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
black and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.140 
black and
the<00:02:12.709> painting<00:02:13.099> on<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.280> boots<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.819> painting

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
the painting on the boots the painting

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.490 
the painting on the boots the painting
on<00:02:14.239> her<00:02:14.270> gauntlets<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.930> think<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.200> paint<00:02:15.410> on

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
on her gauntlets I think the paint on

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.630 
on her gauntlets I think the paint on
this<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.709> pretty<00:02:15.830> clean<00:02:16.069> even<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.430> little

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
this is pretty clean even that little

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.150 
this is pretty clean even that little
red<00:02:16.819> widow<00:02:17.569> symbol<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> middle<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.980> all

red widow symbol in the middle this all

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.440 
red widow symbol in the middle this all
turned<00:02:19.340> out<00:02:19.400> pretty<00:02:19.520> good<00:02:19.760> she's<00:02:20.150> got<00:02:20.300> really

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
turned out pretty good she's got really

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.949 
turned out pretty good she's got really
clean<00:02:20.750> hands<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.650> most<00:02:21.830> part<00:02:22.630> as<00:02:23.630> far<00:02:23.870> as

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
clean hands for the most part as far as

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.020 
clean hands for the most part as far as
the<00:02:24.050> finger<00:02:24.319> tips<00:02:24.500> coming<00:02:24.739> through<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.250> really

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
the finger tips coming through I really

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.720 
the finger tips coming through I really
like<00:02:26.180> what<00:02:26.300> they<00:02:26.360> did<00:02:26.420> with<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:26.690> figure<00:02:27.730> now

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
like what they did with this figure now

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.729 
like what they did with this figure now
if<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:28.910> take<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> look<00:02:29.269> at<00:02:29.480> her<00:02:29.750> head

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
if you take a look at her head

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.110 
if you take a look at her head
just<00:02:31.099> take<00:02:31.220> some<00:02:31.430> time<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.060> my

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
just take some time this is my

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.630 
just take some time this is my
recommendation<00:02:32.650> it's<00:02:33.650> all<00:02:33.920> basically<00:02:34.489> one

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
recommendation it's all basically one

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.110 
recommendation it's all basically one
red<00:02:35.360> plastic<00:02:35.599> piece<00:02:35.989> so<00:02:36.230> some<00:02:36.500> faces<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:38.090> know

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
red plastic piece so some faces you know

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.309 
red plastic piece so some faces you know
aren't<00:02:38.420> painted<00:02:38.750> all<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.959> way<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.140> I

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
aren't painted all the way so I

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.750 
aren't painted all the way so I
recommend<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:39.830> take<00:02:39.980> your<00:02:40.099> time<00:02:40.220> looking<00:02:40.519> for

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
recommend you take your time looking for

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.970 
recommend you take your time looking for
a<00:02:40.790> good<00:02:40.940> face<00:02:41.239> paint<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:41.569> this<00:02:41.720> figure<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.830> one

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
a good face paint on this figure the one

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.289 
a good face paint on this figure the one
that<00:02:43.069> I<00:02:43.130> got<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.430> pretty<00:02:43.519> good<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.910> like<00:02:43.970> the

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
that I got is pretty good I like the

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.020 
that I got is pretty good I like the
eyes<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.750> eyebrow<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.670> hair<00:02:46.850> line

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
eyes and the eyebrow and the hair line

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.430 
eyes and the eyebrow and the hair line
is<00:02:47.239> pretty<00:02:47.420> simple<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.019> they<00:02:48.110> did<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.290> really

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
is pretty simple but they did a really

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.979 
is pretty simple but they did a really
good<00:02:48.530> job<00:02:48.850> sculpting<00:02:49.850> in<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:49.970> grooves<00:02:50.209> now

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
good job sculpting in the grooves now

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.270 
good job sculpting in the grooves now
one<00:02:51.350> of<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.530> things<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.769> don't<00:02:51.830> like<00:02:52.160> about

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
one of the things I don't like about

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.340 
one of the things I don't like about
bobble<00:02:52.790> heads<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.209> spring<00:02:53.750> inside<00:02:54.049> can

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
bobble heads is the spring inside can

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.479 
bobble heads is the spring inside can
sometimes<00:02:54.709> be<00:02:54.799> put<00:02:55.010> in<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.190> weird<00:02:55.370> position

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
sometimes be put in a weird position

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.089 
sometimes be put in a weird position
that<00:02:56.299> causes<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.840> head<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.140> askew<00:02:57.680> his

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
that causes the head to be askew his

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.949 
that causes the head to be askew his
head<00:02:58.340> should<00:02:58.580> be<00:02:58.730> here<00:02:59.060> nice<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.390> center<00:02:59.780> and

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
head should be here nice and center and

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.750 
head should be here nice and center and
instead<00:03:00.080> it<00:03:00.410> pops<00:03:01.010> all<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.310> way<00:03:01.370> over<00:03:01.549> to<00:03:01.670> the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
instead it pops all the way over to the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.449 
instead it pops all the way over to the
side<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.900> really<00:03:03.410> wish<00:03:03.560> Funko<00:03:03.950> would<00:03:04.099> stop

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
side and I really wish Funko would stop

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.979 
side and I really wish Funko would stop
doing<00:03:04.730> bobble<00:03:05.030> heads<00:03:05.209> for<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.569> very<00:03:05.780> reason

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
doing bobble heads for this very reason

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.390 
doing bobble heads for this very reason
because<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.380> compromises<00:03:06.860> like<00:03:07.069> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
because it compromises like the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
because it compromises like the
integrity<00:03:07.849> of<00:03:08.030> what<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.410> figure<00:03:09.709> should<00:03:09.980> be

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
integrity of what the figure should be

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.120 
integrity of what the figure should be
maybe<00:03:11.420> one<00:03:11.510> day<00:03:11.810> they'll<00:03:12.019> stop<00:03:12.349> but<00:03:12.620> for<00:03:12.980> right

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
maybe one day they'll stop but for right

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.009 
maybe one day they'll stop but for right
now<00:03:13.280> they<00:03:13.459> seem<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.880> keep<00:03:14.150> going<00:03:14.360> with<00:03:14.510> bobble

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
now they seem to keep going with bobble

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.680 
now they seem to keep going with bobble
heads<00:03:15.170> for<00:03:15.380> Marvel<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.890> Star<00:03:16.519> Wars<00:03:16.670> but<00:03:17.359> let's

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
heads for Marvel and Star Wars but let's

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.449 
heads for Marvel and Star Wars but let's
focus<00:03:17.900> on<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.230> positive<00:03:18.620> look<00:03:19.100> at<00:03:19.250> all<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
focus on the positive look at all the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010

how<00:05:13.400> this<00:05:13.940> Winter<00:05:14.270> Soldier<00:05:14.480> turned<00:05:14.750> out

how this Winter Soldier turned out

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.200

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
because his head is on center but I

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.640 
because his head is on center but I
