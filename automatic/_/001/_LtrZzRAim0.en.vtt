that we could add a nice profit if we

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.809 
that we could add a nice profit if we
actually<00:02:37.049> pick<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.560> one<00:02:37.709> up<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.129> I<00:02:38.489> would

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
actually pick that one up and I would

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.369 
actually pick that one up and I would
get<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.090> do<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.360> lot<00:02:39.540> better<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.959> market

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
get to do this a lot better the market

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.289 
get to do this a lot better the market
it's<00:02:40.500> completely<00:02:40.950> months<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.430> moment<00:02:41.790> and

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
it's completely months at the moment and

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.850 
it's completely months at the moment and
it's<00:02:42.480> got<00:02:42.690> lots<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.959> good<00:02:43.019> players<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.650> an

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
it's got lots of good players so an

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.650 
it's got lots of good players so an
example<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.579> good<00:02:44.730> player<00:02:44.970> would<00:02:45.510> be

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
example of a good player would be

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.900 
example of a good player would be
someone<00:02:46.079> like<00:02:46.110> Egwene<00:02:46.650> someone<00:02:47.280> high<00:02:47.459> rated

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
someone like Egwene someone high rated

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.569 
someone like Egwene someone high rated
that<00:02:48.450> some<00:02:48.810> people<00:02:49.110> do<00:02:49.260> buy<00:02:49.500> no<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.340> like<00:02:50.549> you

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
that some people do buy no one like you

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.750 
that some people do buy no one like you
could<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.060> baby<00:02:51.540> find<00:02:52.079> Hernandez<00:02:52.650> or<00:02:52.829> PK<00:02:53.340> stuff

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
could it baby find Hernandez or PK stuff

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.640 
could it baby find Hernandez or PK stuff
like<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.329> you'll<00:02:55.110> be<00:02:55.200> able<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.410> get<00:02:55.530> them

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
like that and you'll be able to get them

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.100 
like that and you'll be able to get them
for<00:02:55.860> like<00:02:55.950> 700<00:02:56.610> 800<00:02:56.760> coins<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.450> maybe<00:02:57.780> sell<00:02:58.019> em

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
for like 700 800 coins and maybe sell em

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.400 
for like 700 800 coins and maybe sell em
on<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.290> about<00:02:58.410> 1.5<00:02:58.709> k<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.900> 1.3<00:03:00.900> k<00:03:01.049> stuff<00:03:01.260> like

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
on for about 1.5 k a 1.3 k stuff like

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.259 
on for about 1.5 k a 1.3 k stuff like
that<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.650> not<00:03:01.860> too<00:03:02.099> much<00:03:02.190> profit<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:03.060> you're

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
that it's not too much profit but you're

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.150 
that it's not too much profit but you're
not<00:03:03.450> profit<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.170> actually<00:03:04.560> get<00:03:04.739> some<00:03:04.920> coins

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
not profit you actually get some coins

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.940 
not profit you actually get some coins
and<00:03:05.400> make<00:03:05.780> progress<00:03:06.780> with<00:03:07.170> your<00:03:07.290> trading<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:07.920> I

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
and make progress with your trading so I

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.580 
and make progress with your trading so I
know<00:03:08.129> it's<00:03:08.489> not<00:03:08.640> ideal<00:03:09.200> trading<00:03:10.200> method<00:03:10.500> but

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
know it's not ideal trading method but

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.500 
know it's not ideal trading method but
this<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.890> just<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.099> little<00:03:11.220> sure<00:03:11.549> one<00:03:11.819> just<00:03:12.360> so

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
this is just a little sure one just so

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.850 
this is just a little sure one just so
you<00:03:12.569> guys<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.810> make<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.290> little<00:03:13.500> bit<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.650> profit

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
you guys can make a little bit of profit

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.309 
you guys can make a little bit of profit
if<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.220> guys<00:03:14.519> don't<00:03:15.120> know<00:03:15.780> aren't<00:03:16.170> really

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
if you guys don't know aren't really

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.870
