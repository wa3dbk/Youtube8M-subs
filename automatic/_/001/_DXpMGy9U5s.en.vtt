00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:13.574
 It is very easy to criticize and every one of us can handle it very well. 

00:00:14.512 --> 00:00:16.512
 But we do not want to criticize. 

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:19.901
 On the contrary, we want to advise. And today on the theme of pastry. 

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:29.587
 We and Carolina are here to explain to you how and by what criteria to choose the pastries that help us and not harm them. 

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:37.478
 You always find the product from which the product is composed, at least the basic information. 

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.961
 This bread is, we read, rye-wheat. 

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:45.086
 According to legislation, raw materials must be sorted in descending order in the order in which they are used. 

00:00:46.332 --> 00:00:49.332
 The term rye-wheat bread refers to the fact that rye flour predominates in it. 

00:00:50.332 --> 00:00:53.332
 If wheat bread is rye, it means that wheat is the most common. 

00:00:53.778 --> 00:00:55.778
 Rye stuff is a good choice. 

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.121
 It has more fiber and more vitamins and minerals. 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.900
 Plus, rye pastries are tastier and last longer! 

00:01:03.278 --> 00:01:07.778
 We encourage you to buy high-fiber pastries. 

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:11.716
 6 percent or more, or 6 grams of fiber in 100 grams of bread. 

00:01:12.588 --> 00:01:17.588
 If you find the wording "High in Fiber" on the product, you don't have to go further. 

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:21.454
 According to legislation, such a product already contains 6% or more of fiber. 

00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:24.244
 So you can be completely calm. 

00:01:24.343 --> 00:01:27.843
 Note: "Small cereal baguette". 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.500
 Why does the manufacturer say he has a red strawberry? 

00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:36.421
 What else does pastry produce other than cereal? 

00:01:37.153 --> 00:01:39.153
 Cereal is actually cereal! 

00:01:39.738 --> 00:01:41.740
 And all the pastries are made from cereals. 

00:01:42.153 --> 00:01:46.150
 So cereal can be ordinary white bread! 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.210
 If you want to eat healthy, look for the word "whole grain" and not "cereal". 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 And we have bought! 

00:01:57.014 --> 00:01:59.010
 And now we're looking at the pastry! 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.000
 Let's start with wholemeal. 

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:06.390
 Wholegrain is made primarily of wholegrain flour. That is right! 

00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:10.240
 Wholegrain bread is made from whole wheat. 

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:13.460
 This means that everything remains in it. 

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:19.920
 Neither the rim nor the germ is removed, so there is a higher fiber content and a higher mineral content. 

00:02:20.876 --> 00:02:22.880
 Wholegrain bread is nutritionally more valuable. 

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:27.740
 Multigrain means that more types of flour are used. 

00:02:29.778 --> 00:02:35.780
 For example, wheat, rye, oat, but it does not mean that you will find wholegrain flour in multigrain bread. 

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.470
 Here we can show a multigrain pastry. 

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:42.480
 By color, you can see that rye flour, which is darker, will probably be the basis. 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:49.190
 But surely there will be an admixture of wheat flour, barley and oat. 

00:02:48.978 --> 00:02:53.980
 But the dark color is never a guarantee of wholegrain bread. This is a major mistake. 

00:02:54.148 --> 00:02:58.150
 What is dark may be colored or may be rye. 

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:06.920
 In essence, graham pastry is wholemeal flour, so we have bran in it and we find high fiber content. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500
 That is right! 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:16.730
 The Kaiserka was founded somewhere between 1850 and 1900 in Vienna, because the Viennese mistresses did not want to eat wholegrain pastries. 

00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:18.560
 White seemed better to them. 

00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:24.310
 Today, however, the Kaiser is synonymous with wholegrain bread. But beware! 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.470
 Only the color and seeds on the surface cause the whole grain impression. 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:33.060
 In fact, it is a pastry that is made more or less of white flour. 

00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:39.880
 Beware, this is an example where the manufacturer will tell you that it is a cereal pastry. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Whether I'm looking for fiber, the raw fiber there is really a minimal amount. 

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:54.350
 Fiber is very valuable because it produces a feeling of satiety and acts as a toothbrush in our intestine 

00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:59.700
 and protect us, for example, from intestinal cancer. It is also a prevention of constipation. 

00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:06.160
 This bread is not made of what we call flour, 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.170
 but it is made of what our cows are making to give us more milk, that is, scrap. 

00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:17.940
 In this case, the grain is ground very coarsely and the fiber is the most of all types of pastry. 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.830
 As part of the review, I know what follows four criteria: 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 content of saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, sodium and simple carbohydrates. 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.730
 Some foods also monitor fiber content and total energy value. 

00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:48.080
 As far as the mark is concerned, I know what I eat in pastry, so there is a problem in meeting the fiber content. 

00:04:47.983 --> 00:04:50.980
 Sodium content is also hazardous. 

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:58.780
 Pastry as such so far I know what it does not have. For this you will find the bread making mix on the market. 

00:05:00.173 --> 00:05:06.170
 Look for this stamp, which alone, guarantees both salt content and fiber content. 

00:05:06.794 --> 00:05:11.790
 And you are sure that such food is beneficial to your health and not harmful. 

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:19.040
 The Significance of the Logo I know what lies primarily in the fact that it facilitates the customer's orientation in the selection of foodstuffs. 

00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:28.310
 Be careful of the advice of crazy nutritionists who say, "Not especially bread!" 

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:32.740
 On the contrary, pastry yes, but good quality and whole grain! You don't have to worry about him.
