behind

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
behind

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.180 
behind
here<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.740> is<00:02:13.830> where<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:13.980> gets<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.160> little

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
here so this is where it gets a little

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.190 
here so this is where it gets a little
tricky<00:02:14.610> for<00:02:14.640> some<00:02:14.880> people<00:02:15.150> there's<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.870> number

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
tricky for some people there's a number

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.250 
tricky for some people there's a number
of<00:02:16.320> different<00:02:16.890> ways<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:18.050> every<00:02:19.050> putt

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
of different ways to do this every putt

of different ways to do this every putt
mechanic<00:02:19.710> ass<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.980> choice<00:02:20.160> doing<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.760> can

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
mechanic ass is choice doing it you can

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.790 
mechanic ass is choice doing it you can
remove<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.300> motor<00:02:21.510> switch<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.350> remove<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800

remove the motor switch and remove the
little<00:02:23.670> spring<00:02:24.150> mechanism<00:02:24.300> on<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.780> back<00:02:24.930> and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
little spring mechanism on the back and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.420 
little spring mechanism on the back and
then<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.230> could<00:02:25.380> grab<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> shaft<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.010> way<00:02:26.160> I

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
then you could grab the shaft that way I

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.070 
then you could grab the shaft that way I
like<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.300> cheat<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.570> little<00:02:27.780> because<00:02:28.020> I'm

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
like to cheat a little because I'm

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.560 
like to cheat a little because I'm
careful<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.970> use<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> small<00:02:30.180> pair<00:02:30.540> of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
careful I use a small pair of

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.190 
careful I use a small pair of
channellocks

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
channellocks

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.650 
channellocks
and<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.280> look<00:02:32.490> for<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.700> big<00:02:32.970> thick<00:02:33.240> section

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
and I look for this big thick section

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.480 
and I look for this big thick section
right<00:02:33.840> here<00:02:33.990> in<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.140> back<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.500> motor<00:02:34.680> on

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
right here in the back of the motor on

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.580 
right here in the back of the motor on
the<00:02:35.640> spring<00:02:35.880> assembly<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.570> grab<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.410> really

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
the spring assembly I grab it really

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.090 
the spring assembly I grab it really
tight<00:02:37.890> my<00:02:38.850> channel<00:02:39.180> locks<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.810> I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
tight my channel locks just like that I

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.810 
tight my channel locks just like that I
grab<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.130> seal<00:02:43.700> impeller

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
grab the seal impeller

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.150 
grab the seal impeller
and<00:02:45.000> then<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:45.990> turn<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.410> slowly<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:46.890> like

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and then I just turn it slowly just like

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.030 
and then I just turn it slowly just like
that<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.960> then<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.020> palette<00:02:49.230> comes<00:02:49.320> off<00:02:49.560> now<00:02:49.770> a

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
that and then a palette comes off now a

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.800 
that and then a palette comes off now a
lot<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.670> times<00:02:50.880> it's<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> lot<00:02:51.180> harder<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.720> get

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
lot of times it's a lot harder to get

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.050 
lot of times it's a lot harder to get
these<00:02:51.960> off<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.280> may<00:02:53.430> need<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.880> use<00:02:53.940> a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
these off so you may need to use a

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.490 
these off so you may need to use a
bigger<00:02:54.330> pair<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.690> channellocks<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.380> grab

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
bigger pair of channellocks and grab

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.370 
bigger pair of channellocks and grab
that<00:02:55.650> back<00:02:55.830> there<00:02:56.360> sometimes<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.990> may<00:02:58.110> want

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
that back there sometimes you may want

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.900 
that back there sometimes you may want
to<00:02:58.410> remove<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.830> motor<00:02:59.040> switch<00:02:59.280> we<00:02:59.640> can<00:02:59.760> use

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
to remove this motor switch we can use

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.430 
to remove this motor switch we can use
the<00:03:00.000> same<00:03:00.180> nut<00:03:00.390> driver<00:03:00.600> for<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.320> could

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
the same nut driver for it you could

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.600 
the same nut driver for it you could
loosen<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:01.740> motor<00:03:01.980> switch<00:03:02.190> up<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.550> like

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
loosen this motor switch up just like

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.390 
loosen this motor switch up just like
this<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:07.260> will<00:03:07.410> give<00:03:07.470> me<00:03:07.650> more<00:03:07.860> room<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.220> grab

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
this that will give me more room to grab

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.510 
this that will give me more room to grab
with<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> bigger<00:03:09.240> pair<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.540> channellocks

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
with a bigger pair of channellocks

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.270 
with a bigger pair of channellocks
like<00:03:11.520> that<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:13.350> then<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:13.860> can<00:03:13.950> grab<00:03:14.070> that

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
like that and then you can grab that

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.490 
like that and then you can grab that
impeller<00:03:14.580> better

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
impeller better

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.850 
impeller better
okay<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.650> we'll<00:03:16.800> leave<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:16.950> off<00:03:17.160> for<00:03:17.280> now<00:03:17.400> and
