and shade is lawful

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.070 
and shade is lawful
there<00:00:08.469> is<00:00:08.710> no<00:00:09.040> aspect<00:00:09.670> of<00:00:09.969> rendering<00:00:10.540> that

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
accurately when you use the law you

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.590 
accurately when you use the law you

control the size and relationships of
objects<00:00:32.590> and<00:00:32.950> I'll<00:00:33.100> show<00:00:33.430> you<00:00:33.489> how<00:00:33.760> to

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
objects and I'll show you how to

as<00:00:37.450> we<00:00:37.990> gain<00:00:38.350> more<00:00:38.380> and<00:00:39.310> more<00:00:39.370> experience<00:00:40.350> this

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
as we gain more and more experience this

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
as we gain more and more experience this
is<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.620> top<00:00:42.040> view<00:00:42.070> on<00:00:42.850> a<00:00:42.910> circle<00:00:43.840> divided<00:00:44.739> into

is a top view on a circle divided into

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.440 
is a top view on a circle divided into
several<00:00:45.790> segments<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.810> the<00:00:47.290> equal<00:00:47.800> distance

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
several segments of the equal distance

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.389 
several segments of the equal distance
when<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.630> lines<00:00:49.899> have<00:00:50.260> brought<00:00:50.500> down<00:00:50.860> to<00:00:51.280> the

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
when the lines have brought down to the

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.970 
when the lines have brought down to the
foreground<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.390> Rings<00:00:52.660> you'll<00:00:53.560> notice

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
foreground of the Rings you'll notice

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.610 
foreground of the Rings you'll notice
that<00:00:54.160> they're<00:00:54.340> getting<00:00:54.550> closer<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:56.440> one

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
that they're getting closer to one

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.370 
that they're getting closer to one
another<00:00:56.649> as<00:00:57.370> we<00:00:57.610> approach<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.270> end<00:00:58.300> on<00:00:58.750> both

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
another as we approach the end on both

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.330 
another as we approach the end on both
sides<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:01.390> same<00:01:01.750> concept<00:01:02.440> can<00:01:02.530> be<00:01:02.710> used<00:01:02.860> in

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
sides the same concept can be used in

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.789 
sides the same concept can be used in
putting<00:01:04.239> your<00:01:04.360> shading<00:01:04.930> in<00:01:05.110> knowing<00:01:05.560> what

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
putting your shading in knowing what

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.870 
putting your shading in knowing what
values<00:01:06.369> to<00:01:06.670> use<00:01:06.850> in<00:01:07.390> each<00:01:07.690> segment<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.820> is

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
values to use in each segment this is

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.450 
values to use in each segment this is
the<00:01:10.180> same<00:01:10.450> process<00:01:11.049> to<00:01:11.080> scribe<00:01:11.620> over<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.220> over

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
the same process to scribe over and over

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.210 
the same process to scribe over and over
again<00:01:12.720> you'll<00:01:13.720> notice<00:01:14.140> that<00:01:14.290> these<00:01:14.500> lines<00:01:14.890> are

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
again you'll notice that these lines are

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.180 
again you'll notice that these lines are
getting<00:01:16.120> closer<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.659> closer<00:01:16.930> as<00:01:17.500> we<00:01:17.830> approach

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
getting closer and closer as we approach

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.789 
getting closer and closer as we approach
the<00:01:18.460> end<00:01:18.640> of<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.970> bowl<00:01:19.150> we<00:01:19.840> varied<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.470> shape

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
the end of the bowl we varied the shape

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.490 
the end of the bowl we varied the shape
somewhat<00:01:21.369> so<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:21.970> can<00:01:22.210> see<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.659> emphasis<00:01:22.869> on

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
somewhat so you can see the emphasis on

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.100 
somewhat so you can see the emphasis on
the<00:01:23.710> lines<00:01:23.950> in<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.850> middle<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.600> line<00:01:25.869> is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
the lines in the middle the line is

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.060 
the lines in the middle the line is
straight<00:01:26.500> on<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.430> right<00:01:27.670> it's<00:01:28.180> curved<00:01:29.070> toward

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
straight on the right it's curved toward

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.289 
straight on the right it's curved toward
this<00:01:30.280> half<00:01:30.580> shape<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.180> on<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.840> left<00:01:32.110> side<00:01:32.530> we

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
this half shape and on the left side we

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.490 
this half shape and on the left side we
changed<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.450> direction<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.049> curvature

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
changed the direction of the curvature

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.640 
changed the direction of the curvature
that<00:01:35.950> helps<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:37.000> control<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.689> shading<00:01:38.200> the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
that helps you control the shading the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.609 
that helps you control the shading the
shading<00:01:38.680> runs<00:01:39.340> up<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:40.060> lines<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.840> so<00:01:41.560> you

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
shading runs up to the lines and so you

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.130 
shading runs up to the lines and so you
keep<00:01:41.920> easing<00:01:42.580> on<00:01:42.729> your<00:01:42.939> pressure<00:01:43.270> or<00:01:43.990> if

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
keep easing on your pressure or if

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.740 
keep easing on your pressure or if
you're<00:01:44.260> working<00:01:44.439> with<00:01:44.830> paint<00:01:45.159> you<00:01:45.520> begin<00:01:46.479> to

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
you're working with paint you begin to

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.520 
you're working with paint you begin to
thin<00:01:47.680> out<00:01:47.890> shading<00:01:48.820> so<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.600> starts<00:01:50.200> dark

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
thin out shading so that starts dark

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.789 
thin out shading so that starts dark
whether<00:01:50.860> it's<00:01:51.100> dark<00:01:51.670> green<00:01:52.060> or<00:01:52.390> dark<00:01:52.420> gray<00:01:53.049> you

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
whether it's dark green or dark gray you

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.920 
whether it's dark green or dark gray you
lighten<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.520> gray<00:01:54.759> as<00:01:55.000> you're<00:01:55.180> going<00:01:55.330> to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
lighten the gray as you're going to

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.499 
lighten the gray as you're going to
these<00:01:56.110> different<00:01:56.619> areas<00:01:57.100> where<00:01:57.909> it's<00:01:58.119> light

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
these different areas where it's light

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.560 
these different areas where it's light
you<00:01:59.170> darken<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.860> inside<00:02:00.340> where<00:02:01.030> it's<00:02:01.180> dark

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
you darken the inside where it's dark

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.260 
you darken the inside where it's dark
you<00:02:01.930> lighten<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.650> inside<00:02:03.189> this<00:02:03.790> will<00:02:04.000> help

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
you lighten the inside this will help

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.870 
you lighten the inside this will help
bring<00:02:04.840> out<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.200> shape<00:02:05.439> and<00:02:05.740> form<00:02:05.799> of<00:02:06.670> the
