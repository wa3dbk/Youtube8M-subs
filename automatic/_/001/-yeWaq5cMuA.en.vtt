00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.179 
hi rich guru before bowling-ball calm
let's<00:00:05.779> talk<00:00:06.019> about<00:00:06.170> a<00:00:06.319> turn<00:00:06.620> then<00:00:06.859> we<00:00:06.950> hear

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
let's talk about a turn then we hear

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:08.980 
let's talk about a turn then we hear
pretty<00:00:07.729> regularly<00:00:08.179> at<00:00:08.360> the<00:00:08.389> bowling<00:00:08.840> lanes

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
pretty regularly at the bowling lanes

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.080 
pretty regularly at the bowling lanes
around<00:00:09.320> the<00:00:09.590> Pro<00:00:09.800> Shop<00:00:09.830> in<00:00:10.280> bowling<00:00:10.640> circles

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
around the Pro Shop in bowling circles

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.330 
around the Pro Shop in bowling circles
and<00:00:11.600> that's<00:00:11.720> called<00:00:12.080> angle<00:00:12.470> of<00:00:12.650> entry<00:00:13.010> and

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
and that's called angle of entry and

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.190 
and that's called angle of entry and
what<00:00:13.490> that<00:00:13.640> refers<00:00:14.030> to<00:00:14.059> is<00:00:14.330> the<00:00:14.660> angle<00:00:15.050> that

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
what that refers to is the angle that

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.470 
what that refers to is the angle that
your<00:00:15.349> bowling<00:00:15.680> ball<00:00:15.830> enters<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.880> pocket<00:00:17.330> and

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
your bowling ball enters the pocket and

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.100 
your bowling ball enters the pocket and
impact<00:00:18.230> with<00:00:18.440> the<00:00:18.560> pins<00:00:18.860> now<00:00:19.760> you<00:00:20.539> know<00:00:20.660> the

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
can leave fewer corner pins and you'll

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.190 
can leave fewer corner pins and you'll
get<00:01:07.880> better<00:01:08.060> pin<00:01:08.420> action<00:01:08.630> if<00:01:08.929> you<00:01:09.049> get<00:01:09.170> a

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
get better pin action if you get a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.519 
get better pin action if you get a
fairly<00:01:09.499> strong<00:01:09.889> angle<00:01:10.279> of<00:01:10.399> entry<00:01:10.759> but<00:01:11.630> we<00:01:12.319> can

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:12.529 
fairly strong angle of entry but we can

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:15.669 
fairly strong angle of entry but we can
debate<00:01:12.799> if<00:01:13.100> six<00:01:13.490> degrees<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:14.119> is<00:01:14.509> better<00:01:15.439> than

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
debate if six degrees is is better than

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.249 
debate if six degrees is is better than
five<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.159> a<00:01:16.189> half<00:01:16.369> or<00:01:16.609> five<00:01:16.819> but<00:01:17.420> between<00:01:17.869> 4

five and a half or five but between 4
and<00:01:18.529> 6<00:01:18.859> is<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.340> typical<00:01:19.819> angle<00:01:20.119> of<00:01:20.179> entry<00:01:20.569> for

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
and 6 is the typical angle of entry for

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.809 
and 6 is the typical angle of entry for
most<00:01:21.289> of<00:01:21.439> you<00:01:21.560> bowlers<00:01:21.950> watching<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:22.429> video

produce a lot of good pin carry can

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.349 
produce a lot of good pin carry can
still<00:01:28.099> carry<00:01:28.279> strengths<00:01:28.759> like<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.909> 4<00:01:29.240> degree

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
still carry strengths like a 4 degree

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.359 
still carry strengths like a 4 degree
angle<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.899> entry<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.439> that's<00:01:30.859> for<00:01:31.099> bowlers

angle of entry and that's for bowlers
who<00:01:31.490> then<00:01:31.639> have<00:01:31.849> a<00:01:31.880> sharp<00:01:32.240> angle<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.659> entry<00:01:33.020> or
