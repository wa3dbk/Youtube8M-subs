00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.179
 good morning all the boys are sir 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.529
 the wolf of strategy games italy today 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.210
 I'm here to show you a program 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.289
 very useful to all those who have 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.180
 steam estimates mover and what it serves as well 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.500
 you know steam installs games that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.060
 download to your folder 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.859
 main 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.410
 if you then installed steam on the disk 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.300
 main disc c this will put us 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.940
 really very little to fill up views 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.290
 the size of today's games 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.170
 thus slowing down the system considerably 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.860
 operating with estimation mover we will go to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.260
 move games from the disc to a disc 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.140
 to our liking thus making the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.460
 disk c lighter and thus allowing 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.739
 the operating system to run more 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.640
 quickly 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.180
 first of all, let's download sti 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.520

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.160
 look for it with google find sti mover 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.879

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.940

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.080
 scroll all the way down to version 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.299

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.830
 zip file 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.270
 as you can see below it does not have 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.240
 need installation to an executable 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.650
 just start it 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.259
 open the zip file and you will have yours 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.640
 beautiful icon of steam hoover fairies 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.070
 run start the program e 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.869
 this is the main screen 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.570
 then at the top left the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.280
 default where steam where you all have 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.439

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.329
 right and you will have the opportunity through 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.939
 the key to choose the destination 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.360
 where to move the games as you can 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.680
 see already 30 gig of moved games 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.060
 freed from the disc c 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.460
 now I'm going to move the last one I have 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.850
 downloaded war room vikings is about 6 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.670
 gb 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.409
 here you can see my local disk c 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.579
 at 174 gb the disc is available and 168 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.799
 remember that then I will show you to the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.700
 order to move it is simple enough 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.280
 Click on the game you want to move e 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.640
 Click on the small arrow below 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.130
 we click 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.099
 now the program will start to move 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.640
 the game as you see opens a front e 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.709
 he is exposed all the files from the disk c 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.200
 we leave the destination disk now 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.610
 it takes very little work for one 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.470
 6 GB game 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.200
 I don't think a game for a minute 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.379
 heavy type rome total war 2 20 gb 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.090
 admitted approximately 45 minutes this 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.310
 should do so fast 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.530
 let him work 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.069
 that's it, he moved the whole game 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.780
 all game files on the other disc 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.900
 as you can see the disc now 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.569
 local about 180 gb of available space 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:50.420
 while the local disk is 161 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.250
 as you can see on the record and there are 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.500
 all games with their folder 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.780
 while instead in the disc china one 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.870

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.920
 original steam folder there are only 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.200
 the links to the games this does not 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.120
 precludes fish or anything else because yes 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.840
 install directly in the game therefore 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.180
 there is no problem if it's all 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.440
