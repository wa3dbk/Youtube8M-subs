00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.389
 cast 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:13.139
 and everything is activated and years new my 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.880
 people and I still like 9 10 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.529
 hours out there so with yours to 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.940
 share to spend it in fact and to put 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.500
 do this movie right now it counts 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.119
 with a deadline to luisa that you are 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.710
 thawed and it goes sandoval of this 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.710
 very simple way 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.019
 we have here and it takes a quarter of a cup of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.150
 whipping oil play the nuggets of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.769
 done you put them in oil and do so 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.500
 and all this is what is going to color 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.350
 characteristic and rich slavia mind the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.860
 add flavor we have here well cool two 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.690
 spoonfuls of sofrito I believe my friends 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.930
 so that it has the divine flavor of 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.789
 stir-fry this that the tub is optional 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 but vinegar is going well 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.810
 add approximately one tablespoon 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.450
 of vinegar and white 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.370
 if you do not have the fresh garlic of the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.350
 garlic cloves this is the equivalent to 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.060
 8 cloves of garlic 10 cloves of garlic 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.570
 approximately we have half a cup of 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:08.180
 garlic powder we will also add 2 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.780
 teaspoons ground oregano 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.090
 Imagine a teaspoon of cumin that 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.190
 it goes very well and I love them 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.890
 say 8 of danger moment to finish 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.270
 with its ingredient add the flowers to 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.380
 this movie that is here was from 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.140
 yesterday submerged in water with salt to 5 cups 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.970
 of water a half cup of salt a day to 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.430
 another one arrives until by house car you do not have 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.310
 time of the day before and it was a vessel 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.740
 of water and add to the 5 cups of 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.530
 water and about half a cup of salt 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.330
 is what you are going to do is that he already 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.860
 keep seeing that saladito you know already 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.600
 only what you have to add the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.970
 Adobo leave it about an hour or 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.860
 just put it in the oven and already he 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.690
 is going to taste like salt so if 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.240
 you are no longer a really cool technique 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.310
 we are going then only a little 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.050
 that hour about half a spoonful 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.850
 of salt and we add pepper 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.340
 about half a teaspoon of 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.810
 pepper if I have salt and pepper and here 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.250
 to add on the outside what 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.520
 what can we do in mole all these 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.520
 ingredients 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.660
 and this happens 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.130
 and for this we add a little more 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.660
 oil we always succeed here at 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.660
 side and we add a little bit better 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.010
 another thing that this allow has is that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.080
 in this part decisions as they can 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.910
 observe here what cut first you 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.040
 invoked with the knife and then the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.940
 small squares that has been left 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.940
 like this one that is here 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.810
 once baked it can start the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.510
 songs and we'll put it in a 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.310
 container here and we make some cuts 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.480
 Well, I came here please, we've 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.310
 cuts here true 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.740
 then we put the knife over here 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.560
 inside really quite deep and 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.480
 this something we are going to start to bathe 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.630

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.160

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.060
 put it in a bag like this one 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.680
 we add salt and pepper for the part of 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.150
 up to enhance the flavor and we're going 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.980

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.780
