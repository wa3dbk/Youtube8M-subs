00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
little bit southwestern and style subtle

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.630 
little bit southwestern and style subtle
but<00:01:35.549> very<00:01:35.579> cute<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> inside<00:01:37.640> they

but very cute and on the inside they
have<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.150> zipper<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.720> comes<00:01:39.930> most<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> way

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
have a zipper that comes most of the way

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.550 
have a zipper that comes most of the way
up<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.250> shaft<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.720> open<00:01:43.049> that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
up the shaft so when you open that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.170 
up the shaft so when you open that
zipper<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.009> makes<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.369> easier<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> get

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
zipper it makes it easier for you to get

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.050 
zipper it makes it easier for you to get
your<00:01:45.270> foot<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.630> pull<00:01:45.960> them<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:47.060> overall

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
your foot in and pull them on overall

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.870 
your foot in and pull them on overall
these<00:01:48.360> fit<00:01:48.600> pretty<00:01:48.810> true<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.530> size<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.460> only

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
these fit pretty true to size the only

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.030 
these fit pretty true to size the only
issue<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.509> they<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> little<00:01:52.470> bit<00:01:52.740> snug

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
issue is that they are a little bit snug

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.010 
issue is that they are a little bit snug
so<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.729> you're<00:01:53.880> between<00:01:54.060> sizes<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.930> you
