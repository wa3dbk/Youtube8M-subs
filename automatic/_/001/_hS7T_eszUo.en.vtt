00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.799 
and this is basically just a big update
for<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.460> ipad<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.150> you'll<00:00:59.360> get<00:00:59.480> lots<00:00:59.629> of

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
for the ipad so you'll get lots of

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.350 
for the ipad so you'll get lots of
multi-touch<00:01:00.559> gestures<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:01.790> i'll<00:01:02.150> tell<00:01:02.330> you

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
multi-touch gestures and i'll tell you

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.860 
multi-touch gestures and i'll tell you
that<00:01:02.510> in<00:01:02.600> just<00:01:02.629> seconds<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:04.430> main<00:01:04.909> gesture

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
that in just seconds so a main gesture

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.600 
that in just seconds so a main gesture
would<00:01:06.110> be<00:01:06.290> like<00:01:06.500> when<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:06.680> pinch<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.130> screen

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
would be like when you pinch the screen

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.280 
would be like when you pinch the screen
it<00:01:08.000> would<00:01:08.120> go<00:01:08.270> back<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.480> your<00:01:08.600> home<00:01:08.780> screen<00:01:08.960> so

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
it would go back to your home screen so

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.980 
it would go back to your home screen so
that's<00:01:09.470> pretty<00:01:09.710> cool<00:01:09.800> a<00:01:10.360> swipe<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:11.659> you<00:01:11.720> take

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
that's pretty cool a swipe so you take

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.810 
that's pretty cool a swipe so you take
your<00:01:12.110> fingers<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:12.470> swipe<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.340> that<00:01:13.520> would<00:01:13.670> go

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
your fingers and swipe so that would go

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.230 
your fingers and swipe so that would go
to<00:01:13.880> your<00:01:14.770> multitasking<00:01:15.770> bar<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.610> if<00:01:17.120> you

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
to your multitasking bar and if you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.730 
to your multitasking bar and if you
swipe<00:01:17.450> left<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.900> right<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.350> will<00:01:18.500> go<00:01:18.620> between

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
swipe left to right that will go between

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.530 
swipe left to right that will go between
your<00:01:19.100> apps<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:19.520> that's<00:01:19.700> pretty<00:01:19.940> cool<00:01:20.060> and

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
your apps so that's pretty cool and

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.140 
your apps so that's pretty cool and
another<00:01:21.200> thing<00:01:21.290> is<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:21.800> Apple's<00:01:22.430> there's

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
another thing is that Apple's there's

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.940 
another thing is that Apple's there's
been<00:01:23.300> just<00:01:23.330> rumors<00:01:24.050> going<00:01:24.290> around<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.590> Apple

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
been just rumors going around the Apple

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.380 
been just rumors going around the Apple
will<00:01:25.040> take<00:01:25.250> out<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.550> home<00:01:25.790> button<00:01:26.060> for<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
will take out the home button for the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.210 
will take out the home button for the
next<00:01:26.600> iPad<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.350> iphones<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:27.890> ipod

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
next iPad and the iphones and ipod

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.310 
next iPad and the iphones and ipod
touches<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.480> never<00:01:29.600> know<00:01:29.840> that<00:01:29.870> could<00:01:30.050> be

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
touches so you never know that could be

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.040 
touches so you never know that could be
good<00:01:30.470> could<00:01:30.650> be<00:01:30.860> bad<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:31.550> if<00:01:32.120> they<00:01:32.540> do<00:01:32.600> they'll

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
good could be bad so if they do they'll

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.160 
good could be bad so if they do they'll
be<00:01:33.170> lots<00:01:33.410> more<00:01:33.620> just<00:01:34.400> multi-touch<00:01:35.210> its<00:01:35.690> that'd

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
be lots more just multi-touch its that'd

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.320 
be lots more just multi-touch its that'd
be<00:01:36.320> like<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> really<00:01:36.950> cool<00:01:37.250> thing<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:37.610> think<00:01:37.970> it's

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
be like a really cool thing I think it's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.930 
be like a really cool thing I think it's
just<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:38.810> whole<00:01:39.080> phone<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.740> ipod<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.520> even<00:01:40.880> the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
just a whole phone and ipod and even the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.480 
just a whole phone and ipod and even the
ipad<00:01:41.330> would<00:01:41.480> all<00:01:41.750> be<00:01:41.990> just<00:01:42.680> multi-touch<00:01:43.250> and

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
ipad would all be just multi-touch and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.040 
ipad would all be just multi-touch and
no<00:01:43.610> buttons<00:01:43.880> i<00:01:44.240> think<00:01:44.540> that's<00:01:44.660> pretty<00:01:44.810> cool

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
no buttons i think that's pretty cool

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.150 
no buttons i think that's pretty cool
you<00:01:45.260> guys<00:01:45.380> should<00:01:45.560> tell<00:01:45.680> me<00:01:45.770> what<00:01:45.890> you<00:01:46.010> guys

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
you guys should tell me what you guys

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.000 
you guys should tell me what you guys
think<00:01:46.220> in<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.700> comments<00:01:47.510> below<00:01:47.770> another<00:01:48.770> cool

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
think in the comments below another cool

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.910 
think in the comments below another cool
thing<00:01:49.070> would<00:01:49.550> be<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:50.630> lock<00:01:50.900> rotation<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:51.830> on

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
thing would be the lock rotation so on

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.610 
thing would be the lock rotation so on
the<00:01:52.040> ipad<00:01:52.910> where<00:01:53.150> there's<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.690> toggle<00:01:54.560> that

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
the ipad where there's the toggle that

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.830 
the ipad where there's the toggle that
