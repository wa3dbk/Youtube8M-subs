 winner of the club's golden cup is the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.370
 last seen came to 2015 are groups 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.780
 players that a tragedy changed them 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.780
 the guide the story the next 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.000
 so that it is finished 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.890
 last whistle in the club final of the 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.650
 seven vineyard 2015 and a team celebrates its 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.660
 first gold cup the players of the 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.939
 reds immediately remind a 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.890
 partner who was always present in 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.890
 their minds throughout the championship 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.750
 of the Belgians 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.820
 before everyone in a friends club 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.050
 so the team loved it I know 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.690
 we are a sector team characterized 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.620
 in hand and we are very happy for the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.230
 cinema and by the team that we are 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.840
 achieving the goals every year 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.090
 tim is the nickname of cristian dÃ­az 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.360
 deceased in a surprising way and 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.340
 sudden in July 2011 a loss 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.650
 which meant a tragedy for a 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.470
 small game in a group of players that 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.020
 they only met in their second year in their 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.180
 return to first division of head already 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.030
 that nevertheless united them as a 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.040
 family and I think since it started 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.620
 happened that 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.900
 it's not more like club 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.490
 and good and we have achieved achievements that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.160
 I think that at that time it was very difficult 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.160
 and at the moment as I was saying by a 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.530
 super moment of grief and sadness but 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.660
 over time it was translated into 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.830
 joys and in strength to follow 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.010
 growing was what we wanted to continue 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.320
 doing as a club 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.050
 graduates mostly from school 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.840
 redland the players of a network were 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.900
 growing and reaching cup achievements 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.630
 silver in rne and 15 the 2013 classification 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.150
 moose in vineyard the final 2014 of the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.150
 opening that year and a new glass of 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.640
 silver the successes have solidified to the 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.610
 institution keys have been the union of 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.710
 group and work in the lower network 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.930
 they follow with very familiar club very 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.899
 lovable so he also heard from 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.270
 other people other clubs and we are 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.220
 we are who we are, we come from a 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.410
 school but we accept people too 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.480
 out of poetry could a club that if 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.910
 the school is born and a tour to 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.780
 south africa all of that we are an open club 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.180
 Not like others 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.890
 of British school things and that we 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.250
 like to receive people outside 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.500
 this 2015 on network goes for more 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.020
 rosso the golden group of the king ni 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.500
 national the year before and now dreams 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.000
 when to enter the eight best 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.950
 now in this moment that what not only 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.280
 that does not get to get back a 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.650
 final and I hope to win it and this year also 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.370
 be inside the championship side 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.140
 already the idea is not wanting the story 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.700
 do not go step by step and we believe 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.620
 that we have gone well in that sense has been 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.540
 taking things cool comes to us 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.000
 but I think that one goal is to stay in 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.170
 the one of 2015 that is the golden cup and 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.050
 I hope the fours will fight 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.989
 a group that a tragedy hit from 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.510
 brutal way almost four years ago but 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.030
 she did not join compactly and now 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.150
 together they walk the path of success 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.250
 Remembering your friend as always 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.250
