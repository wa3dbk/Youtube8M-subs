looks<00:00:23.550> awesome<00:00:23.970> all<00:00:24.600> those<00:00:24.869> bottles<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
looks awesome all those bottles of the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.700 
looks awesome all those bottles of the
stuff<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:26.240> transmits<00:00:27.240> reflect<00:00:27.779> refract<00:00:28.320> light

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
you control in those type of scenes is

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.770 
you control in those type of scenes is
just<00:00:34.649> your<00:00:34.829> camera<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.520> make<00:00:36.059> sure<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.510> check

forever I guaranteed so let's move on to
tutorial<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.320> step<00:00:49.559> 1<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> build<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.820> set

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
tutorial of the step 1 is to build a set

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.900 
tutorial of the step 1 is to build a set
you<00:00:52.469> know<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.280> complex<00:00:53.670> lighting

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you know to have a very complex lighting

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.970 
you know to have a very complex lighting
we<00:00:54.239> first<00:00:54.449> need<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> very<00:00:55.440> complex

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
we first need to have a very complex

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.029 
we first need to have a very complex
scene<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.699> our<00:00:56.969> disposal<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.469> go<00:00:58.680> ahead<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
scene at our disposal so go ahead and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.729 
scene at our disposal so go ahead and
create<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.340> complex<00:00:59.789> stack<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.359> crap<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.590> in

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
create a complex stack of crap and in

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.619 
create a complex stack of crap and in
case<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.250> scene<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:03.000> chosen<00:01:03.329> those

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
case of my scene I have chosen those

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
case of my scene I have chosen those
bottles<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> glass

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
bottles because I know that the glass

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.580 
bottles because I know that the glass
material<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> subtle<00:01:07.020> interactions

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
material and the subtle interactions

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.859 
material and the subtle interactions
between<00:01:08.159> those<00:01:08.700> bottles<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.510> terms<00:01:09.750> of

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
between those bottles in terms of

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.719 
between those bottles in terms of
lighting<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.530> produce<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:11.010> very<00:01:11.340> interesting

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
lighting will produce a very interesting

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.719 
lighting will produce a very interesting
picture<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.570> maybe<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.740> also<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.100> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
picture and maybe it's also because I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
picture and maybe it's also because I
read<00:01:14.970> about<00:01:15.210> Hunter<00:01:15.750> Thompson<00:01:16.470> gonzo

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
read about Hunter Thompson gonzo

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
read about Hunter Thompson gonzo
journalist<00:01:17.610> articles<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.450> wanted<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> make

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
journalist articles and I wanted to make

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.620 
journalist articles and I wanted to make
something<00:01:19.320> similar<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.130> go<00:01:21.030> ahead<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.450> add<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
something similar so go ahead and add a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.050 
something similar so go ahead and add a
simple<00:01:22.110> light<00:01:22.380> source<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:23.549> already<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
simple light source we already have a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
simple light source we already have a
freakin<00:01:24.630> two<00:01:24.750> geometry<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.770> equation<00:01:26.250> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
freakin two geometry and the equation is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.420 
freakin two geometry and the equation is
here<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:27.180> simple<00:01:27.509> light<00:01:27.630> source<00:01:27.960> plus<00:01:28.500> many

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
here one simple light source plus many

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.730 
here one simple light source plus many
different<00:01:29.939> bottles<00:01:30.270> equals<00:01:30.900> amazingly

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
different bottles equals amazingly

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.999 
different bottles equals amazingly
complex<00:01:32.310> lighting<00:01:32.579> that's<00:01:33.509> very<00:01:33.810> very

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
complex lighting that's very very

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.810 
complex lighting that's very very
scientific<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.549> create<00:01:36.090> area<00:01:37.049> light<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.820> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
scientific so create area light and the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.010 
scientific so create area light and the
angle<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.299> position<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.780> light<00:01:39.990> source

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
angle and position of the light source

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.350 
angle and position of the light source
doesn't<00:01:40.590> matter<00:01:40.860> very<00:01:40.950> much<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.299> are

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
doesn't matter very much because we are

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.510 
doesn't matter very much because we are
going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.020> navigate<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.890> search<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.430> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
with creating a camera come on anybody

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.130 
with creating a camera come on anybody
can<00:02:16.050> create<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.860> don't<00:02:17.400> forget<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.820> press

camera alright and after you do it I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.350 
camera alright and after you do it I
recommend<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.650> constrain<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.790> visible

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
recommend you to constrain the visible

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.890 
recommend you to constrain the visible
area<00:02:27.540> just<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.410> what<00:02:28.560> camera<00:02:29.130> sees<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:30.720> make

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
area just to what camera sees so make

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.410 
area just to what camera sees so make
sure<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.350> drink<00:02:31.560> up<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.920> Alpha<00:02:32.430> setting<00:02:33.240> in

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
sure to drink up the Alpha setting in

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.380 
sure to drink up the Alpha setting in
the<00:02:33.570> passport<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.170> tab<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.880> our<00:02:35.880> next<00:02:36.120> step<00:02:36.270> is

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the passport to tab and our next step is

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.180 
the passport to tab and our next step is
to<00:02:36.480> constrain<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.840> render<00:02:37.290> region<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:38.040> this

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
to constrain the render region to this

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.280 
to constrain the render region to this
area<00:02:38.520> by<00:02:38.730> pressing<00:02:39.150> should<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.720> dragging

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
area by pressing should be and dragging

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.830 
area by pressing should be and dragging
the<00:02:40.410> rectangle<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.790> other<00:02:41.970> words<00:02:42.240> we<00:02:42.450> ensure

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the rectangle in other words we ensure

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.690 
the rectangle in other words we ensure
that<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.170> camera<00:02:43.440> isn't<00:02:43.650> render<00:02:44.070> anything

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that the camera isn't render anything

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.990 
that the camera isn't render anything
that<00:02:45.240> we<00:02:45.360> don't<00:02:45.570> need<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.230> render<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.000> also

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that we don't need it to render and also

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.150 
that we don't need it to render and also
it's<00:02:48.150> quite<00:02:48.480> advisable<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.110> limit<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.860> light

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
it's quite advisable to limit the light

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
it's quite advisable to limit the light
bounces<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:51.150> 2<00:02:51.540> or<00:02:51.930> maybe<00:02:52.140> up<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.560> 1<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:53.640> depends

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
bounces to 2 or maybe up to 1 it depends

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.540 
bounces to 2 or maybe up to 1 it depends
on<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.390> scene<00:02:54.660> you're<00:02:54.840> creating<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.550> reduce

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
on the scene you're creating and reduce

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.940 
on the scene you're creating and reduce
very<00:02:57.270> soon<00:02:57.600> we'll<00:02:57.840> need<00:02:57.959> all<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.260> viewport

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
very soon we'll need all the viewport

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.699 
very soon we'll need all the viewport
speed<00:02:59.280> we<00:02:59.430> can<00:02:59.610> get<00:02:59.900> right<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.080> just<00:03:01.380> before

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
speed we can get right and just before

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.040 
speed we can get right and just before
moving<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> actual<00:03:02.870> navigation<00:03:03.870> in

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
moving on to the actual navigation in

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.990 
moving on to the actual navigation in
the<00:03:04.200> scene<00:03:04.470> I'm<00:03:04.680> gonna<00:03:05.040> turn<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.670> film

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the scene I'm gonna turn on the film

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.630 
the scene I'm gonna turn on the film
emulation<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.870> we<00:03:07.620> need<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.950> emulate<00:03:08.250> these

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
emulation and we need to emulate these

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.330 
emulation and we need to emulate these
and<00:03:09.000> now<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> film<00:03:09.900> responds<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.920> lighting

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
and now a film responds to lighting

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.970 
and now a film responds to lighting
because<00:03:11.970> we<00:03:12.209> are<00:03:12.360> going<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.810> pretend<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.620> we

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
because we are going to pretend that we

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.449 
because we are going to pretend that we
are<00:03:14.310> operating<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:15.540> real<00:03:15.780> camera<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:17.310> know

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
are operating a real camera you know

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.940 
are operating a real camera you know
it's<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.790> simulation<00:03:18.300> of<00:03:18.540> photography<00:03:19.140> mm-hmm

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
it's a simulation of photography mm-hmm

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.850 
it's a simulation of photography mm-hmm
so<00:03:20.730> let's<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:21.060> select<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.420> few<00:03:21.570> this<00:03:22.200> tab<00:03:22.530> and

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
so let's just select a few this tab and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.190 
so let's just select a few this tab and
then<00:03:23.550> I'm<00:03:23.670> gonna<00:03:23.790> sweep<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.450> exposure<00:03:24.900> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
then I'm gonna sweep the exposure and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.740 
then I'm gonna sweep the exposure and
the<00:03:25.500> gamma<00:03:25.709> settings<00:03:26.250> till<00:03:27.090> everything<00:03:27.570> looks

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
the gamma settings till everything looks

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.620 
the gamma settings till everything looks
more<00:03:27.989> awesome<00:03:28.440> than<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.680> was<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.510> also<00:03:30.510> I'm

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
more awesome than it was and also I'm

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.020 
more awesome than it was and also I'm
gonna<00:03:30.840> tweak<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.380> curves<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:32.550> wash<00:03:32.760> out<00:03:33.000> the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
gonna tweak the curves to wash out the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.470 
gonna tweak the curves to wash out the
blacks<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.720> bit<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.489> also<00:03:35.489> maybe<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.850> will<00:03:36.030> play

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
blacks a bit and also maybe I will play

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.910 
blacks a bit and also maybe I will play
with<00:03:36.510> some<00:03:36.930> channels<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.560> get<00:03:37.709> those

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
with some channels to get those
