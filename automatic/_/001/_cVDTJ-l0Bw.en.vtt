00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.620
 and it has come out 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.720
 people 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.240
 well there they are 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.169
 good good night welcome when 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.169
 you want to comment 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.519
 in this that such a good night Jesus 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.530
 Marquez to win your radio what rating 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.690
 makes the party is left with a bad 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.320
 flavor could get more chop today the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.320
 sevilla athletic 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.810
 man from the point of view of 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.340
 of the domain of the game I think we 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.980
 we have dominated the game 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.160
 as for the game maybe we have not 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.870
 managed to translate all that domain into 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.360
 many occasions of blow because no 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.370
 we had many and then the sevilla 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.960
 he played us with a little more 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.940
 space and especially with strategy 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.080
 in which they are very very strong and 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.520
 that the party has been disputed man 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.170
 yes it is true that we could know 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.969
 that we can think that we could 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.820
 have taken three points we failed 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.340
 a penalty with 11 but it is also true 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.119
 that the floor that has been a good match 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.560
 we have come here with the intention of 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.020
 we have maintained it since the minute 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.469
 1 to 90 at the end as well not have 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.280
 Could be but I would have been satisfied 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:39.409
 for how we have been today despite the fact that 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.580
 and maybe if I miss having had 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.310
 some relationships remain as more 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.920
 clear to translate all the domain that 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.130
 we have had good goal situations 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.310
 goals in the end only Alberto black 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.780
 radio euskadi a ernesto I know that when 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.190
 you do not win maybe it's hard to get to 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.659
 this conclusion but it is the party in the 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.509
 that the team you liked the most out of 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.979
 house that on the one hand and on the other hand 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.200
 It was Susaeta who was in charge of 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.090
 penalty is going to end some day with 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.440
 this curse 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.850
 if legal framework each and in the end 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.850
 Well, we'll keep looking for 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.850
 let's have 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.760
 bad luck and not from now on but from 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.129
 we have been failing for years 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.379
 good cant 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.379
 but we'll keep insisting 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.560
 and I think we 've been fine with the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.110
 matches that we played outside I think 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.470
 that always rescues games by 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.290
 moments 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.290
 there are certain times maybe it's a 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.360
 global level or level too well 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.930
 but we have been lacking in the village to say 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.400
 create a little more goal chances to 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.530
 so that it was all 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.549
 so it was a little more complete and 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.010
 then also keep in mind in the 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.150
 rival entity because they are a 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.989
 good team is a strong team a 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.939
 team is called to be up 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.319
 So that does reinforce us the 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.329
 made of the game here 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.409
 in this way and what I'm satisfied 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.290
 above all it is that we have shown 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.480
 always ambition to go for the party 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.640
 good night and see antenna 3 at least 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.300
 this tie although a victory so 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.910
 reinforces that candidacy to champions 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.000
 man we are in fourth place 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.000
 We are there 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.409
 the tie does not distance us much from 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.939
 those of our rivals I do not know if we are 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.159
 candidates to be is in this room 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.780
 put at the end of season right now 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.209
 we are because we are there I think that 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.870
 our attention is therefore good to follow 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.350
 adding points and then when the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.450
 moment 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.150
 when there are fewer matches left and we continue 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.180
 maintaining we are in this area then 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.030
 posing in a little more way 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.410
 clear right now of course the party 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.400
 of wines if it strengthens us as regards 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.049
 game 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.280
 and I do not know how to increase then if it is to maintain 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.870
 that fourth place while we can 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.640
 I think anyone would make 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.920
 javier ortiz of mail topics 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.020
 What is your assessment of the arbitration of 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.040
 undiano a referee with whom his team 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.050
 I did not have good background because of 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.070
 larios has not been 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.720
 let's go well you would not have to see all 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.880
 all the plays repeated over and over 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.380
 once the truth that the penalty if I have it 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.240
 to say there you see a little 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.889
 difference between equipment 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.289
 to the same party very clear criminal 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.970
 from my situation now I do not see it in 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.470
 the television I do not know if now I have 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.940
 said that it is a penalty but for me 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.380
 been very clear and what I most 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.120
 surprised that my players do not 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.259
 even because they were and yet 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.699
 all of Sevilla was why it was 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.750
 that it was not for you and for me it had been 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.750
 a clear penalty I do not know 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.919
 I do not know, I think the referee is very good 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.669
 has always seen us try to do it 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.669
 better than they can 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.280
 the fact that the athletic has lost 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.340
 some parties with malian undiano no 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.310
 It will be all the fault we have 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.110
 is one of the biggest but the team has 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.870
 been the defensive strategy and on the other 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.220
 part that has inclined you to bet on 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.990
 of frames to the detriment of andoni iraola 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.250
 I'm not really agree with that that 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.320
 one of the dogs was the 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.370
 defensive strategy because that is 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.810
 precisely the 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:18.120
 let's go the fort of Seville is a team 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.210
 that has very powerful players by 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.979
 above 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.780
 we have even changed our allergies 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:30.520
 to try to alleviate the problems that 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.520
 they could generate us but they 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.509
 in height they clearly exceeded us 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.069
 and we have to be prepared and 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.360
 still the first play well one plays 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.069
 prepared 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.189
 because good because unai emery in this 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:45.289
 is the best we go because he always has 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:46.250
 a repertoire that when you think that 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.780
 has high players that you are 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.030
 worried about that always then you the 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.710
 they take you down and surprise you despite 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:56.040
 that you know that they will do it to you then 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.890
 I'm with that and with respect to 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:02.820
 a halo of andoni and I preferred it to be 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.260
 of frames a player who can play in 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.760
 that position perfectly and also that 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.150
 you are going to have 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.150
 yes
