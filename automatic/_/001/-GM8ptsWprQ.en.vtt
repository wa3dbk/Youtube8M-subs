break<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.319> was<00:03:19.440> more<00:03:19.680> routine<00:03:20.609> it<00:03:20.970> was<00:03:21.090> a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
break it was more routine it was a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.330 
break it was more routine it was a
preventative<00:03:21.810> measure<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.709> make<00:03:23.040> sure

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
preventative measure to just make sure

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.309 
preventative measure to just make sure
that<00:03:23.579> his<00:03:23.700> right<00:03:23.970> knee<00:03:24.209> was<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.139> stable
