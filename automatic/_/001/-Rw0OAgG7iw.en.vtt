 BMW Motorrad develops and produces with exactly the same passion 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.549
 We wanted a coach like van Bommel Investments in the market 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.550

 and for us the traffic is one 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.140
 it also looks good 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.240
 A first prototype is created based on a DCF model 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.660

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.940
 the zero dynamic behavior of the race is in the in-house wind tunnel 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.940
 optimized 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.630
 in the calculation, Hammer proof of the World Cup is much because of its weather resistance 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.290
 more than 250 liters per minute what should here on the Havel 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.490

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.569
 Precision that is indispensable in the paint shop 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.299
 The new development of a BMW motorcycle lasts up to one and a half years 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.849
 Bringing a new one on the market is a big challenge 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.849
 we wanted to surpass the competition and ourselves 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.059
 The helmets will continue to be used during series production 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.059
 randomly tested 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.449
