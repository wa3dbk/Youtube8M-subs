00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900

burst<00:02:27.480> where<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.050> one<00:02:28.170> we've<00:02:28.350> got<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.740> more

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
burst where is the one we've got is more

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.520 
burst where is the one we've got is more
sort<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.730> consistently<00:02:30.360> colored<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.350> way

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
sort of consistently colored in this way

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.490 
sort of consistently colored in this way
yeah<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.940> took<00:02:33.090> some<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.420> those<00:02:33.510> ones<00:02:34.380> that

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
yeah but we took some of those ones that

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.840 
yeah but we took some of those ones that
are<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.860> sort<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.160> blue<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.610> green

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
are like the sort of the blue to green

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.240 
are like the sort of the blue to green
fades<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.600> everything<00:02:36.959> stunning<00:02:37.770> finishes

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
fades and everything stunning finishes

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.390 
fades and everything stunning finishes
and<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.540> my<00:02:39.870> point<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.709> somebody<00:02:41.040> comes

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.610 
and so to my point is if somebody comes
into<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> shop<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.030> there<00:02:42.750> they<00:02:42.959> want<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.290> spend

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
apply it to guitar so no I some of it I

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.540 
apply it to guitar so no I some of it I
have<00:04:06.020> ideas<00:04:06.380> about<00:04:06.410> some<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:07.130> they<00:04:07.310> bring

have ideas about some of it they bring

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.840 
have ideas about some of it they bring
to<00:04:07.580> me<00:04:07.850> yeah<00:04:08.330> but<00:04:08.690> at<00:04:09.200> this<00:04:09.410> point<00:04:09.850> they're

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
to me yeah but at this point they're

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.610 
to me yeah but at this point they're
doing<00:04:11.180> most<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.480> this<00:04:11.630> wild<00:04:12.050> stuff<00:04:12.290> on<00:04:12.470> their

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
doing most of this wild stuff on their

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.770 
doing most of this wild stuff on their
own<00:04:12.770> and<00:04:13.340> I<00:04:13.520> think<00:04:13.760> it's<00:04:13.910> awesome<00:04:14.120> all<00:04:14.600> right

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
own and I think it's awesome all right

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.949 
own and I think it's awesome all right
but<00:04:15.080> I<00:04:15.110> guess<00:04:15.380> my<00:04:15.410> point<00:04:15.800> that<00:04:16.360> it<00:04:17.360> needs<00:04:17.660> if

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
but I guess my point that it needs if

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.430 
but I guess my point that it needs if
