00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.900
 so want to streaming this year 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.150
 with a bit of bedding, rid four am 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.460
 afternoon, and I have one today 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.169
 The new weapons of the naval strike this 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.369
 with at the start of it a new one recently 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.290
 patch was closed 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.559
 and here also the weapons for 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.640
 were made available 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.030
 Today, the first thing is about this 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.100
 assault rifle 160 this part was made in 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.199
 year 2008 by the Italian company 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.660
 better manufactured and represents with it 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.370
 one of the latest storm rifles this 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.870
 time since that's mostly out 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.579
 polymer dangerous and therefore 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.590
 pretty easy and can also be over 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.750
 to reduce a shortage quite nicely 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.980
 Of course, this is only possible in the reallife 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.390
 I can say that I share the hand 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.620
 taken and the thing goes off like 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.539
 schmidts cat i got it right away 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.270
 in love the thing is really awesome 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.430
 But first to the net the ar 160th 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.140
 can be in both the single and in the 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.210
 use fully automatic mode 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.670
 Here you have a magazine capacity 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.250
 of 30 plus one which is standard basic for 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.200
 every assault rifle in battlefield 4 to 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.780
 is on the scale and shoots this 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.789
 the standard dimensions ammunition the karenz 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.710
 for this weapon is 700 rounds per 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.119
 minute and yes is more in line 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.380
 bit in the lower part of the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.170
 storm rifles 1 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.840
 but as far as damage is concerned, the ar 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.810
 160 in the average value 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.299
 say 25 per hit on corresponding 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.710
 distance I give no deduction what 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.900
 but the weapon is so special 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.140
 the fact that it is places in 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.390
 battlefield 4 currently with the highest 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.090
 reach is this makes the weapons before 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.979
 everything for conquest extremely horny and 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.020
 effective because of course most of the time 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.149
 at higher distances against others 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.250
 player must fight and thus this 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.290
 Weapon really pays off 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.049
 also a pretty good and high 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.719
 precision and the weapon alone reminds 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.250
 here a bit to the m4 16 what 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.160
 safe to use by battlefield 4 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.959
 could stand out and now 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.250
 but not really used that much anymore 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.769
 At least I will not see it anymore 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.510
 very often on the server and I am 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.440
 but I believe and will 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.959
 of course my part to contribute 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.940
 that these tricks now take this place 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.570
 occupy is hopped before shows up 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.459
 the 160 in the well , on average 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.490
 however , the weapon is also from the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.630
 shot cadence resp 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.010
 us per minute what he already did 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.440
 also did not really listen for 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.840
 convent situation designed and this 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.650
 should you also something if possible 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.930
 bypass 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.090
 only the stability is in this 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.160
 rather to arrange the weapon in the lower segment 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.690
 However, due to the high range 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.280
 and the correspondingly good precision 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.840
 Can you do that with the appropriate 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.150
 helbling where you really fast 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.310
 No st come well compensate 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.170
 and makes this weapon really top 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.930
 the new speed is me 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.730
 I measured it just under two seconds 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.900
 and about half to whole 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.730
 second more 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.860
 of course, if you shot an empty one 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.020
 you can unlock the magazine you can 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.670
 the good piece in the context of the mountain home 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.010
 sniper chapman 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.710
 here you only need 33 for evans 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.780
 as well as 20 headshots with assault rifle 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.830
 So we should get him 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.420
 So I had the patch 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.370
 downloaded the game started and 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.350
 the a 160 immediately taken in hand 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.560
 because I know you maybe one 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.240
 Crass storm is there or assault rifle 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.430
 player so i have to tell you that 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.410
 have some really good, and I 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.070
 really played what shooter 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.650
 As for 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.630
 but battlefield and this knotted feels 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.520
 really good at what the handling 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.130
 but also concerns the protective behavior 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.050
 in itself within the framework of ricoh is showing 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.960
 a very strong nicole the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.690
 starts at the top vertically up 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.190
 However, if you are here accordingly 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.900
 you do not have to counter it 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.060
 you can counter that much 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.710
 control recall really well and also 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.000
 just in the context of the best for the time being 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.590
 Of course, I also give you a small one 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.090
 distance for which these weapons 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.510
 Of course it is also recommended 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.370
 would 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.620
 can you really with this weapon 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.690
 super accurate shooting also in the complete 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.510
 raw state so without lever hirt egemen 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.210
 this weapon is really really good 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.400
 designed for a great fight because 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.680
 only the visor or the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.600
 ironside is shown as that one 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.160
 really what is good in front of you 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.049
 Visier likes this one or the other 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.450
 be a bit negative to others 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.400
 through this special ironside sighting 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.130
 any opponents maybe a few 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.080
 meters next to it are not really that way 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.910
 but in the sight are completely honest though 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.650
 her in battlefield 4 in front of two opponents 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.100
 is the look on you and on you 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.410
 to fire 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.240
 after marriage no chance what the run 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.650
 and gun mentality matters to me 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.830
 Personally, yes, quite important is there 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.960
 I just like that 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.270
 player type I'm not saying that 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.670
 ar 160 is going great 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.780
 i have tested it in running 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.030
 position or 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.190
 moving position on different 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.080
 opponents or targets shot and could 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.480
 because of the fact that this 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.100
 Weapon really precise is a good hit 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.960
 land and keep moving 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.550
 So I can only recommend tackled by 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.010
 another server in the server 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.090
 browser and try out these powers 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.980
 I'm really of the opinion that 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.680
 this weapon has its place in the upper one 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.080
 rows of service will take what 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.660
 the ability to play or on the 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.490
 fun factor due to the corresponding 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:23.440
 skill kde graduation rate really go off 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.640
 it will be like a cat, that's it 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.600
 again from a small one 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.640
 update or review on the 160 from the label 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.790
 strike dlc for battlefield 4 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.320
 if you have more tips tricks or even 4 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.000
 and also have the coming weapons 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.800
 I would definitely recommend 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.570
 the abo button anger for nothing 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.080
 miss and keep up to date 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.160
 stay 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.160
 In this sense , goal was always in the eye 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
 is
