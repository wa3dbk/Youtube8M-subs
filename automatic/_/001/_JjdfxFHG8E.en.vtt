 they will be of great interest to you 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.699
 so water is synonymous with life 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.920
 life of what is synonymous with this 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.429
 Tiziano Terzani answers this way 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.530

 when I wake up I tell myself how nice 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.229
 another round of carousel 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.940
 so let's talk about the problems for a moment 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.280
 of the water of your house if you live in one 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.530
 any Italian European city it is 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.069
 the limestone problem in the city 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.350
 the big problem if you have a tube 

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:56.749
 a hypothesis is the thermal plant pipe 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.309
 of your home or plumbing to these 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.629
 size with the passage of time 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.329
 youtube size you will have to 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.509
 very much maybe even up to a 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.820
 infinitesimal number the tube at the end 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.890
 will end up splitting radiators also i 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.920
 large water appliances of the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.200
 home water heater washing machine dishwasher 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.060
 etc. they will spoil they will have life 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.979
 very short what is this big problem 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.170
 it is the limestone the city waters 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.689
 unfortunately the vast majority are 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.899
 full of limestone what you suggest water 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.899
 share 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.160
 will solve the limestone problem of 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.650
 Your home plumbing thermal plants 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.140
 your water appliances 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.420
 they will work beautifully to the fullest 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.000
 of their power because the limestone does not 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.250
 it only reduces the energy potential 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.350
 thermal plant but even 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.090
 reduces detergent cleaning power 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.130
 of detergents a crazy thing and therefore 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.900
 it will end up polluting more with heating 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.280
 less water is a thing on time 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.660
 squeezes I have to pass necessarily 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.370
 regards 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.380

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.700

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.100

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.270

 travels in space at 1,500 km per hour 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.690
 herself and 107 thousand kilometers per hour 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.850
