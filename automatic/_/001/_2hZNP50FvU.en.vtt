00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
does work it can work but generally what

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.480 
does work it can work but generally what
happens<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.860> see<00:01:02.040> from<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.310> dog's

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
happens is if you see from the dog's

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.520 
happens is if you see from the dog's
perspective<00:01:02.790> he's<00:01:03.300> thirty<00:01:03.750> yards<00:01:04.049> over<00:01:04.170> there

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
perspective he's thirty yards over there

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.120 
perspective he's thirty yards over there
and<00:01:04.799> he<00:01:05.220> feels<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.610> little<00:01:05.880> stimulation<00:01:06.360> now

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.260 
and he feels this little stimulation now
and<00:01:08.130> that's<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.490> course<00:01:08.520> if<00:01:08.790> they're<00:01:08.909> using<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and that's of course if they're using a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
and that's of course if they're using a
low<00:01:09.600> level<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.259> the<00:01:10.890> dog<00:01:11.040> feels<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.520> kind<00:01:11.759> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
low level but the dog feels just kind of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.370 
low level but the dog feels just kind of
this<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.180> tiny<00:01:12.329> stimulation<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.170> things

this little tiny stimulation and things
like<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.549> nothing<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> dog's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
like that and so nothing in the dog's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.719 
like that and so nothing in the dog's
mind<00:01:15.930> registers<00:01:16.560> oh<00:01:16.860> something's<00:01:17.520> tickling

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
mind registers oh something's tickling

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.340 
mind registers oh something's tickling
my<00:01:17.970> neck<00:01:18.179> I<00:01:18.329> should<00:01:18.630> run<00:01:18.780> back<00:01:18.929> to<00:01:19.079> the<00:01:19.200> owner

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
my neck I should run back to the owner

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499 
my neck I should run back to the owner
but<00:01:19.670> often<00:01:20.670> times<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:20.999> you<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.270> from<00:01:21.359> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
but often times if you see from the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.969 
but often times if you see from the
owners<00:01:21.719> perspective<00:01:21.899> they're<00:01:22.289> like<00:01:22.409> darn<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
owners perspective they're like darn it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.739 
owners perspective they're like darn it
it's<00:01:23.249> not<00:01:23.369> working<00:01:23.579> the<00:01:23.789> dogs<00:01:23.969> not<00:01:24.210> coming<00:01:24.539> and

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:24.749 
it's not working the dogs not coming and

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:26.719 
it's not working the dogs not coming and
so<00:01:25.380> maybe<00:01:25.619> they'll<00:01:25.799> use<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> higher<00:01:26.189> level<00:01:26.219> or

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
so maybe they'll use a higher level or

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.739 
so maybe they'll use a higher level or
maybe<00:01:26.850> they'll<00:01:27.090> keep<00:01:27.270> hitting<00:01:27.569> it<00:01:27.630> or

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
maybe they'll keep hitting it or

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:29.660 
maybe they'll keep hitting it or
whatever<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.319> so<00:01:28.950> from<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.460> dogs

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
whatever and so from the dogs

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
whatever and so from the dogs
perspective<00:01:30.389> they're<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.200> man<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.590> is

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
perspective they're like man this is

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.349 
perspective they're like man this is
painful<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.249> don't<00:01:32.429> like<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.819> sometimes<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
painful I don't like this sometimes you

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.120 
painful I don't like this sometimes you
even<00:01:33.780> see<00:01:34.049> people<00:01:34.319> train<00:01:34.560> their<00:01:34.590> dogs<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.950> run

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
even see people train their dogs to run

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.160 
even see people train their dogs to run
away<00:01:35.429> because<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.630> they'll<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:36.929> is<00:01:37.020> they'll

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
away because what they'll do is they'll

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.080 
away because what they'll do is they'll
hit<00:01:37.319> the<00:01:37.350> button<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.189> dog<00:01:38.399> is<00:01:38.609> like<00:01:38.789> so

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
hit the button the dog is like so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.249 
hit the button the dog is like so
freaked<00:01:39.420> out<00:01:39.509> he<00:01:39.659> runs<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.929> opposite

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
freaked out he runs the opposite

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.249 
freaked out he runs the opposite
direction<00:01:40.819> and<00:01:41.819> so<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.749> need<00:01:42.929> to<00:01:42.959> do<00:01:43.170> is

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
direction and so what we need to do is

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.529 
direction and so what we need to do is
we<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.439> take<00:01:43.709> time<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.159> teach<00:01:44.459> the<00:01:44.759> dog<00:01:44.939> what

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
we can take time and teach the dog what

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.899 
we can take time and teach the dog what
the<00:01:45.569> little<00:01:45.959> stimulation<00:01:46.380> means<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.880> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the little stimulation means this is a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.809 
the little stimulation means this is a
language<00:01:48.709> it's<00:01:49.709> a<00:01:49.829> language<00:01:49.859> like<00:01:50.340> any<00:01:50.579> other

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and so she has no idea what it means

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.389 
and so she has no idea what it means
what<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.179> does<00:02:06.420> any<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.959> that<00:02:07.139> and<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.409> how<00:02:08.340> do
