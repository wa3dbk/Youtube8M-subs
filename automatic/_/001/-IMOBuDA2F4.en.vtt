00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello everyone how are I my name is mine 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.879
 and today we are going to do the review of 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.879
 men and women of haruki murakami 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.390
 well I want to start by saying that this 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.550
 is the first book of murakami that I read and 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.529
 Of course I have heard many 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.390
 nice things about this author do not know 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.880
 how many people had recommended it to me and 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.590
 I was dying to enter his world and the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.570
 truth is that I did not know very well with what 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.700
 book start so one day it was 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.920
 walking around and I saw this book of men and 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.600
 women so I asked the people 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.090
 cute planet that is always 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.220
 willing to give me a book and read 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.110
 I have to say and confess that I 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.090
 I completely fell in love with this author 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.489
 Japanese to see this book is about 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.530
 seven stories of men who for 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.390
 Various reasons are without a woman 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.940
 necessarily because of them or of 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.260
 them but simply because they are 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.969
 I hope this is the only thing 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.070
 they need to know to enter to read this 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.600
 book that's the only thing I knew well 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.760
 I do not want to tell you much more to 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.770
 do not support us advance them something that 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.060
 time you do not want to hear but good if 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.610
 he wants to give you my opinions with 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.620
 about this book and definitely 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.320
 these are stories that are very intimate 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.950
 in perspectives where the most important 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.979
 it's not rushing and getting here 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.250
 but instead stop to savor 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.360
 every word with which he writes murakami 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.670
 get involved in the feelings that 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.430
 really transmits and really 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.040
 enjoy that of the softness of each 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.020
 story and a very nice thing that I've 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.509
 found from a cam and it's that it makes 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.240
 the everyday becomes really 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.729
 interesting and that is very very nice of 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.970
 read and if I really believe that it is very 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.020
 particular of the Asian authors who 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.899
 another thing that I liked 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.240
 very much is that not necessarily the 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.130
 stories have a complete closure and what 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.659
 The main thing is not to answer all 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.940
 questions that there are throughout the 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.190
 stories you can do or understand 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.350
 completely to the characters and rather it 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.659
 focus on leaving something for the imagination 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.069
 this is something that I really enjoy that 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.840
 really leave you thinking and 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.759
 asking you things that are not 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.410
 he has necessarily answered is quite 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.269
 quite interesting and I felt that 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.730
 as you go along with the book the 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.100
 stories are having a little more 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.330
 of dark not quite but let's say that 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.550
 if it is getting a bit more 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.620
 interesting and that's why the last 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.180
 true favorites so they continued not 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.040
 I want to advance them a lot, but 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.960
 true that if this is going to sound like something 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.970
 that you may be interested in 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.620
 Do not read this book because it has 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.320
 delighted it is to say that I have 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.730
 put 5 out of 5 stars and for people 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.530
 like me who wants to start reading 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.530
 murakami I really recommend this 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.540
 because it was very good for me 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.980
 eager to read more things about him and 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.900
 in addition also the people who 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.550
 like Asian culture almost all 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.350
 stories here stood in japan 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.420
 so I think that's going to be something 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.310
 very interesting for many and if you 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.140
 they have way to read it I hope they tell me 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.240
 if you have also put 55 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.890
 stars and you know that if you have
