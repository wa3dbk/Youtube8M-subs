00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 yesterday in san siro from the port for a network a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.130
 zero 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.630
 here are the images of San Siro with one 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.250
 opportunity here for nails 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.539
 the port goalkeeper has been at least 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.480
 two or three circumstances very ready in 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.000
 come out on both nails before and now 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.500
 see on antonelli that he had worked 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.930
 a nice action with quick exchanges but yes 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.079
 he said he was worried about this 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.450
 mila that fails to score 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.489
 in practice he made only one goal 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.149
 in matches in recent games 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.760
 official only one goal with nails 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.700
 in the game won against the avellino e 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.260
 for all other matches and the team 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.750
 mini play failed to score 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.600
 the most worrying thing is really 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.030
 this lack of concretization of the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.210
 other gaming volume 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.270
 quite valid at the time of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.720
 concretize the game salamis and go 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.210
 in goal 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.290
 and here are all the goals of last fifteenth 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.600
 of the second half albertosi knocked down on 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.500
 you see this as Milan players 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.810
 they despair because they understand the weight of 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.049
 having to reassemble at this point 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.390
 two goals since the first 0 0 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.000
 and force the Milan to score at least 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.580
 we see two goals to make up for it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.929
 still for the third time the goal of 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.390
 budan that already in the forward meeting 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:40.830
 had been the protagonist of a beauty 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.590
 game with always dangerous actions with 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.929
 these shots from afar that they had 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.240
 exalted in the first leg the 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.550
 timeliness of ricky interventions 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.770
 albertosi beaten this time by this 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.009
 very fine free kick 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.659
 very insidious wood confirmed the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.869
 its excellent quality 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.409
 his specialty of these and shoots and for 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.049
 milan was the elimination 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.899
 let's review the long action that leads to 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.769
 the best opportunity with a pole hit 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.230
 from bigon but at this point not even one 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.190
 one would have been sufficient for the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.190
 Rossoneri team
