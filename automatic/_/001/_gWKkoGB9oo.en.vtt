00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.609
 new video I'm just about to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.740
 impeller to save and one 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.320
 to prepare another video and thought 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.259
 me that I now as an address for 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.179
 today's chronological prop of 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.660
 sick was what the hard dude of me 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.189
 installed in his npd and the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.859
 does not work out of the right way 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.519
 reason because the cable or 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.099
 the cover is misplaced so misplaced 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.019
 is not that great house 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.920
 drink that has also regional 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.780
 pretty short cables have to do that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 Let's show you how to do that today 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.570
 especially sprung mpg reasonable 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.219
 I can move or lay properly 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.670
 I wish you much fun and we 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.810
 We'll see you first 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.030
 the 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.350
 the cap of the chronology prop 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.810
 up away then we take a 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.370
 clear 2 mm release in the clamp 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.260
 screw it out that I screw 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.760
 try it yourself just to the house 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.550
 it does not work because he pulls 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.550
 gebÃ¤rdet is so little screw out 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.840
 then the cable from the cable ties 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.930
 click here to see more detail in the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.520
 bend that the train was clicked on 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.300
 best once with a side cutter 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.820
 Pulling through a center to draw house 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.710
 the top of the handle to pull out overwrap 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.710
 Train everything completely 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.070
 then we take the new shimano 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.469
 first lay them down provisionally 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.810
 once so where you want to have so long 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.810
 with cable ties eva so attracts him where 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.100
 cable ties 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.030
 then moved again to the frame and where 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.390
 you want to have and clips on 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.490
 according to the length from so new salt 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.820
 Introduce the octopus like you 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.470
 Look is also complete with the new one 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.520
 page not forget there is a 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.480
 little green discs inside the distance 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.550
 pattern in front of rheinrich rhine about 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.640
 three to four against thread things outside 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:44.730
 let salts have a bit good 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.810
 Teflon fat when you coated Teflon 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.810
 into the grave 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.069
 to perform the inside too nicely 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.890
 needed is a regular one 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.560
 sweetheart we also in the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.690
 gears and also the 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.500
 Outside it would be a regular outdoor stage 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.500
 for sound trains 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.510
 but now february after we have the 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.600
 have brought our overwrap to measure 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.790
 the shock by pay attention that the 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.140
 sound-examined here comes not and cover 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:36.780
 on it sits well feathers and wall pinch 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.780
 lip on the scarf train on it 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.610
 reinstall the scarves socks 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.360
 little 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.360
 pull 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.640
 Tighten clamp nut 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.640
 a short function test 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.980
 cut off treasure hunt on appropriate 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:04.340
 length I would say so is 23 mm 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.769
 you're a little over and you like it 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.980
 then with the side cutter so on 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.360
 begging a bit for protection 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.870
 gifted I've tried too 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.280
 pull 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.019
 that's not the when the 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.669
 Chemnitzian man is not equal to the 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.669
 whole train is pulled out 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.639
 on it 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.039
 and so it all looks afterwards 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.940
 neatly laid 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.940
 on the frame 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:43.169
 once at the saddle tube high behind the 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:44.699
 vibrator but briefly attached if the 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.969
 colleague now swinging then you see 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:52.469
 exactly that nothing moves 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:54.779
 the outer shell of the treasure sheet stuck and 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:58.550
 the function of chronology 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:58.550
 Seat post again take it 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:02.699
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.360
 and you can do something with it 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.889
 to begin 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.409
 We would be over a thumbs up 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.999
 very happy if you no longer have videos 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.740
 If I miss the vice a miss 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.789
 Just click here in the top 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.069
 corner on the button 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.719
 I will keep going now 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.270
 Take care of how to tread a treadmill 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:21.620
