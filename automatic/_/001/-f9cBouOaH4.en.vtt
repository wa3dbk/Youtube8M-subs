00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.440
 marie money we all want us to have them 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.269

 Ix are visible everywhere , I mean by loads 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.920
 days to print a few banknotes vnukovo 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.109
 but they are nothing special 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.359
 it's just paper and ink on it 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.250
 really bills so hard to make 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.179
 is honesty really the only thing 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.700
 stops us 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.469
 only handicrafts would spin 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.940
 took money as a form of payment 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.489
 money you passed 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.960
 you might love paper back 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.430
 natural both for example 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.340
 pay for goods and services 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 sacks of flour 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:54.930
 bundles of hay once two three 4 5 and nancy 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.219
 it will cost you two loaves of bread 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.840
 one fish 50 potatoes so we went 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.850
 Further so you see that in our own 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.720
 interests so that the money was the maximum 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.720
 impossible to fake 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.770
 but what is it in these pieces of paper why so 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.660
 hard to copy believe me or not but 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.700
 part of the answer to this question can be found 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.950
 in your laundry if your money 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.080
 ever come across those you possibly 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.509
 noticed one of their paper features 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.400
 usually breaks into pieces falling into 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.470
 this mess but it is money 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.220
 there is one lie on the jar you are slow 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.930
 in common with jeans than we are with linden paper 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.670
 money is not made of wood as 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.890
 the usual from here you do them with 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.380
 clapping why because 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.479
 banknotes should serve years ross 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.940
 money can do the same because both 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.990
 to touch they differ from the usual 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.910
 papers and about people constantly having 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.460
 make money can determine 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.610
 fake by touch and it's not just 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.730
 paper itself on real money a lot 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.940
 different irregularities this is due 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.470
 way to print money 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.480
 process known as gravure printing 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.520
 appeared almost as long ago in the frame itself 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.040

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.930
 printing plate first covered by mobile 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.930
 and I then pressed into the paper with 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.600
 great power it creates on paper a lot 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.820
 bumps 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.250
 printing process used today 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.530
 looks high-tech mountain 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.360
 who do on these machines on well 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.230
 what a lot of delusion can hang 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.270
 people learn can do say 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.440

 separate modern laser 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.490
 copy machine and blender gave 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:55.210
 opportunities for ordinary citizens would be butt 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.210
 counterfeiting forgery 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.910
 the government led a number of new defensive 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.840
 signs on banknotes trying to get ahead 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.820
 emerging technologies for example if you 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.430
 take new american bank notes 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.770

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.150
 tiny letters printed vertically 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.570

 invisible 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.230
 need to happen because the letters are made 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.780
 of the finest threads 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.580
 wicker paper you can see them 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.220
 only when the light goes straight through 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.290
 banknote laser copiers 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.480
 use reflected light to 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.250
 coffee production so they don't see 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.230
 of these threads and unplayable 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.300
 if you consider the new Canadian 20 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.650

 she just plays the echoes uniform 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.049
 line 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.530

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.900
 mixture at the end of the production process 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.660

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.270
 new means of protection protect our 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:41.159

 Sorry to be objects of fraud 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:46.199

 new technologies are all at risk 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.969

 these types of crafts are almost impossible 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.390
 to reveal 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.170
 for every step of the government to protect 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.470
 us from fakes 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.130
 scammers have to come up with some 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.350
 high-tech response step 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.100
 all that remains is a ruler to be on 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.780
 step ahead in this game but before were 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.330
 complicates the technology is capable of Are 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.760
 they are so they will not be able to stop
