00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.510 
track day press the button a light comes
up<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:15.090> means<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.950> SD<00:01:16.950> storing<00:01:17.400> is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
up and that means the SD storing is

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.289 
up and that means the SD storing is
active<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:19.729> all<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> three<00:01:21.090> parameters

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
active and then all the three parameters

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.170 
active and then all the three parameters
go<00:01:21.780> into<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> CSV<00:01:22.650> file<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.369> analyze

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
go into a CSV file that you can analyze

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.870 
go into a CSV file that you can analyze
in<00:01:24.450> Excel<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.799> addition<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> have

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
in Excel and in addition to that I have

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.120 
in Excel and in addition to that I have
added<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.299> external<00:01:27.780> accelerometer<00:01:28.439> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
added an external accelerometer that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.590 
added an external accelerometer that
provides<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:30.380> lateral<00:01:31.380> acceleration<00:01:31.860> between

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
provides a lateral acceleration between

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.219 
provides a lateral acceleration between
minus<00:01:33.600> point<00:01:34.409> 1<00:01:34.799> point<00:01:34.829> 5<00:01:35.189> 2<00:01:35.490> plus<00:01:35.729> 1.5<00:01:36.270> G's<00:01:36.509> so

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
minus point 1 point 5 2 plus 1.5 G's so

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.080 
minus point 1 point 5 2 plus 1.5 G's so
that's<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> accelerometer<00:01:38.400> yes<00:01:38.700> mounted

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that's the accelerometer yes mounted

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.810 
that's the accelerometer yes mounted
vertically<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.110> get<00:01:40.290> sideways

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
vertically so we can get sideways

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.789 
vertically so we can get sideways
acceleration<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.810> next<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
acceleration and then next to it on the

that's<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.030> simulator<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.049> over

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
that's a simulator that we have over

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.440 
that's a simulator that we have over
here<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.310> piece<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.910> piece<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
here so this piece this piece is the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
here so this piece this piece is the
vehicle<00:02:09.599> simulator<00:02:10.020> yeah<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.649> then<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.069> so

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
vehicle simulator yeah and then this so

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.910 
vehicle simulator yeah and then this so
this<00:02:11.610> would<00:02:11.790> be<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> connector<00:02:12.540> which<00:02:12.690> is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
this would be the connector which is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.860 
this would be the connector which is
under<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.220> day<00:02:13.430> exactly<00:02:14.060> that's<00:02:14.390> go<00:02:14.569> under

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
under the day exactly that's go under

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.530 
under the day exactly that's go under
your<00:02:15.020> dash<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.440> connected<00:02:15.980> in<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.239> very

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
your dash you connected in a in a very

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.839 
your dash you connected in a in a very
final<00:02:18.470> version<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.099> device<00:02:19.430> this<00:02:19.670> could

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
final version of this device this could

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.550 
final version of this device this could
be<00:02:19.940> totally<00:02:20.330> eliminated<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.170> can<00:02:21.349> have

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
be totally eliminated and you can have

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
be totally eliminated and you can have
the<00:02:22.430> obd<00:02:23.030> port<00:02:23.500> free<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.800> scanning<00:02:25.550> device

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
the obd port free for a scanning device

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.530 
the obd port free for a scanning device
and<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:26.270> could<00:02:26.450> be<00:02:26.599> sort<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.190> spliced<00:02:28.190> in<00:02:28.540> and

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
and this could be sort of spliced in and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.660 
and this could be sort of spliced in and
find<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.020> behind<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.560> port<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:30.890> then<00:02:31.040> you

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
find the behind the port and then you

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.150 
find the behind the port and then you
have<00:02:31.970> complete<00:02:32.720> mobility<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.319> do<00:02:33.530> other<00:02:33.739> obd

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
have complete mobility to do other obd

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.260 
have complete mobility to do other obd
stuff<00:02:34.370> as<00:02:34.489> well<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:37.040> you're<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.790> reiterate

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
stuff as well so you're to reiterate

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.400 
stuff as well so you're to reiterate
then<00:02:38.630> you're<00:02:38.840> logging<00:02:39.280> lateral<00:02:40.280> acceleration

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
then you're logging lateral acceleration

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.410 
then you're logging lateral acceleration
vehicle<00:02:42.410> speed<00:02:42.650> in<00:02:42.800> SB<00:02:43.250> everything<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.209> in

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
vehicle speed in SB everything is in

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.990 
vehicle speed in SB everything is in
Northern<00:02:45.230> America<00:02:45.290> North<00:02:45.680> America<00:02:45.800> units<00:02:46.489> so

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
Northern America North America units so

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.330 
Northern America North America units so
in<00:02:47.330> miles<00:02:47.660> per<00:02:47.780> hour<00:02:48.019> there<00:02:48.590> are<00:02:48.739> PMS<00:02:49.220> and

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
in miles per hour there are PMS and

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.210 
in miles per hour there are PMS and
coolant<00:02:50.090> temperature<00:02:50.330> environments<00:02:51.220> very

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
coolant temperature environments very

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.030 
coolant temperature environments very
nice<00:02:52.400> thank<00:02:52.850> you
