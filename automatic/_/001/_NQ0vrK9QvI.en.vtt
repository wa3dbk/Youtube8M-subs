00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
finger on with this second episode the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.020 
finger on with this second episode the
kind<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.380> style<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.920> think<00:00:13.950> shaft<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.759> using

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
kind of style I think shaft is using

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.430 
kind of style I think shaft is using
here<00:00:15.150> that's<00:00:15.330> most<00:00:15.540> comparable<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.170> another

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
here that's most comparable to another

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.170 
here that's most comparable to another
one<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.710> there<00:00:16.890> works<00:00:17.130> because<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.760> know

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
one that there works because you know

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.070 
one that there works because you know
shaft<00:00:18.510> has<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> lot<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:20.270> set<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.480> techniques<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
shaft has a lot of a set of techniques I

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.290 
shaft has a lot of a set of techniques I
would<00:00:22.109> say<00:00:22.439> where<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> lot<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.519> them<00:00:23.670> overlap<00:00:24.269> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
would say where a lot of them overlap a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.870 
would say where a lot of them overlap a
lot<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.779> stylizations<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.010> various
