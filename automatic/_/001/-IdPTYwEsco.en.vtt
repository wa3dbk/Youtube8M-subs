00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
okay so let's talk about where the

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.680 
okay so let's talk about where the
rubber<00:00:04.410> hits<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.859> road<00:00:04.980> so<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.549> speak<00:00:05.940> the

can do it with high-level cnc machining
which<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:32.820> did<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.239> several<00:00:33.690> prototypes<00:00:33.960> of

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
which we did on several prototypes of

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.740 
which we did on several prototypes of
development<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.210> an<00:00:36.360> expensive

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
development but it's an expensive

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.200 
development but it's an expensive
process<00:00:37.230> once<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.370> get<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.670> down<00:00:38.700> though<00:00:39.149> you

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
process once you get it down though you

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.780 
process once you get it down though you
can<00:00:39.540> create<00:00:39.780> really<00:00:40.260> unique<00:00:40.620> features<00:00:41.129> one<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
can create really unique features one of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.150 
can create really unique features one of
which<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.149> when<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.540> turn<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.079> over<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:44.129> see

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
which is when I turn it over you can see

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.910 
which is when I turn it over you can see
you're<00:00:44.670> able<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.360> how<00:00:45.750> many<00:00:45.809> areas<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.590> this

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
you're able is how many areas like this

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.420 
you're able is how many areas like this
to<00:00:47.640> take<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:48.120> unnecessary<00:00:49.110> waste<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:50.039> wait

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
to take out unnecessary waste is wait

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.119 
to take out unnecessary waste is wait
that's<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.629> area<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.199> has<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.530> been<00:00:52.649> more

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
that's that area what has just been more

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
that's that area what has just been more
weight<00:00:53.370> you're<00:00:53.670> cleaning<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.930> more

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
weight you're cleaning in but more

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.709 
weight you're cleaning in but more
importantly<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.520> look<00:00:56.730> at<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.149> cavity

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
importantly if we look at this cavity

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.709 
importantly if we look at this cavity
design<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.469> here<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.579> actually<00:00:59.969> where

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
design right here this is actually where

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
design right here this is actually where
the<00:01:01.109> water<00:01:01.379> travels<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.340> your<00:01:02.520> bathroom

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the water travels this is your bathroom

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.170 
the water travels this is your bathroom
cabinet<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:04.439> been<00:01:04.710> designed<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
cabinet and it's been designed so as the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.370 
cabinet and it's been designed so as the
unit<00:01:06.540> rotates<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.560> helps<00:01:08.340> pump<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.750> water<00:01:09.780> up

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
unit rotates it helps pump the water up

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.890 
unit rotates it helps pump the water up
through<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.280> vacuum<00:01:11.460> system<00:01:12.299> that's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
through the vacuum system that's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.289 
through the vacuum system that's
something<00:01:13.470> that's<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:13.860> been<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.610> units<00:01:15.119> in

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
something that's not been on units in

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.260 
something that's not been on units in
the<00:01:15.390> past<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.409> every<00:01:17.100> component<00:01:17.549> when<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.030> look

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the past so every component when we look

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.120 
the past so every component when we look
at<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.659> look<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.290> how<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.950> enhance

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
at this we look at how can we enhance

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.480 
at this we look at how can we enhance
the<00:01:21.090> cleaning<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.070> removal<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.189> water

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the cleaning and the removal of water

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.719 
the cleaning and the removal of water
which<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.210> critical<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.990> successful

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
which is so critical to a successful

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.609 
which is so critical to a successful
carpet<00:01:26.729> cleaning<00:01:26.970> shopping<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.229> success

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
carpet cleaning shopping and the success

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.870 
carpet cleaning shopping and the success
of<00:01:28.770> our<00:01:28.890> customers<00:01:30.110> as<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.350> move<00:01:31.530> forward

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
of our customers as we move forward

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.940 
of our customers as we move forward
another<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.180> important<00:01:33.869> thing<00:01:34.110> was<00:01:34.740> we

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
another really important thing was we

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.890 
another really important thing was we
needed<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.909> able<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.180> ride<00:01:36.479> over

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
needed this to be able to ride over

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.819 
needed this to be able to ride over
multiple<00:01:37.560> surfaces<00:01:38.930> predecessors<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.259> the

multiple surfaces predecessors to the
hod<00:01:41.630> haven't<00:01:42.630> always<00:01:42.780> been<00:01:43.079> good<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.409> moving

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
hod haven't always been good at moving

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.300 
hod haven't always been good at moving
from<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.329> commercial<00:01:45.329> glue<00:01:45.930> down<00:01:46.170> carpet<00:01:46.649> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
commercial glue down carpet so it really

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.990 
commercial glue down carpet so it really
is<00:01:52.079> challenged<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:53.070> they're<00:01:53.369> uneven<00:01:53.549> in

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
is challenged because they're uneven in

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.139 
is challenged because they're uneven in
nature<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.070> predecessor<00:01:56.070> units<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.820> find

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
nature and predecessor units you find

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.410 
nature and predecessor units you find
those<00:01:57.360> uneven<00:01:58.020> areas<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.590> jump<00:01:59.090> omaha's<00:02:00.090> has

those uneven areas and jump omaha's has

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.560 
those uneven areas and jump omaha's has
a<00:02:00.450> unique<00:02:00.869> feature<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.860> these<00:02:02.100> head

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
a unique feature in that these head

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.690 
a unique feature in that these head
actually<00:02:03.570> close<00:02:04.049> i'm<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> show<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.340> why

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
actually close i'm going to show you why

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.490 
actually close i'm going to show you why
that's<00:02:06.450> because<00:02:06.869> they've<00:02:07.049> been<00:02:07.079> placed

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that's because they've been placed

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.729 
that's because they've been placed
there's<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.399> polymer<00:02:09.119> material<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:10.259> that

there's a polymer material here that

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.080 
there's a polymer material here that
actually<00:02:10.979> fit<00:02:12.200> right<00:02:13.200> inside<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:14.010> area<00:02:14.489> so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
actually fit right inside that area so

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.960 
actually fit right inside that area so
that<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.260> lockdown<00:02:16.640> solid<00:02:17.640> seal

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
that this is not a lockdown solid seal

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.930 
that this is not a lockdown solid seal
it<00:02:18.750> allows<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.530> actually<00:02:19.920> move<00:02:20.520> as<00:02:20.910> you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
it allows that to actually move as you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.080 
it allows that to actually move as you
can<00:02:21.239> see<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.780> rock<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.290> inside<00:02:23.129> of<00:02:23.370> there<00:02:23.550> so

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
can see I can rock it inside of there so

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.110 
can see I can rock it inside of there so
every<00:02:24.720> one<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.110> these<00:02:25.290> contact<00:02:26.099> points<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:27.090> be

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
every one of these contact points can be

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.170 
every one of these contact points can be
at<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.540> different<00:02:27.720> height
