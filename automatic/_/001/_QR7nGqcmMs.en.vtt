00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
close that now what I meant by you can

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.229 
close that now what I meant by you can
sort<00:03:22.079> of<00:03:22.170> customize<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.940> can

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
sort of customize it is that you can

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.259 
sort of customize it is that you can
actually<00:03:24.510> name<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.230> something<00:03:25.650> else<00:03:26.209> if<00:03:27.209> you

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
actually name this something else if you

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.410 
actually name this something else if you
do<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.200> basically<00:03:28.670> have<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.910> name<00:03:30.090> that

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
do that you basically have to name that

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.300 
do that you basically have to name that
the<00:03:30.630> same<00:03:30.870> thing<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.500> then<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:31.920> have<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.190> name

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
the same thing and then you have to name

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.370 
the same thing and then you have to name
that<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.819> same<00:03:33.030> thing<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.870> that's<00:03:34.200> why<00:03:34.350> it's

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
that the same thing so that's why it's

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.960 
that the same thing so that's why it's
probably<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:35.010> easier<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.459> do<00:03:35.730> what<00:03:35.880> I'm

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
probably just easier to do what I'm

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.120 
probably just easier to do what I'm
doing<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.049> can<00:03:37.260> do<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.410> if<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.769> want

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
doing but you can do that if you want

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.130 
doing but you can do that if you want
there's<00:03:38.459> not<00:03:38.640> really<00:03:38.760> any<00:03:38.970> point<00:03:39.209> but<00:03:39.780> oh<00:03:39.840> yeah

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
there's not really any point but oh yeah

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.720 
there's not really any point but oh yeah
so<00:03:40.500> once<00:03:40.859> you've<00:03:40.980> done<00:03:41.100> that<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.489> want<00:03:41.640> to
