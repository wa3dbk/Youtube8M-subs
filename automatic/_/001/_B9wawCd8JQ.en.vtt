power steering pump where you just

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:26.309 
power steering pump where you just
ground<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.689> bevel<00:03:04.109> off

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.199 

the<00:03:27.319> final<00:03:27.650> couple<00:03:27.799> of<00:03:27.980> steps<00:03:28.220> are<00:03:28.459> on<00:03:28.909> the

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
the final couple of steps are on the

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.330 
the final couple of steps are on the
power<00:03:29.810> steering<00:03:30.200> pulley<00:03:30.379> there's<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.129> little

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
power steering pulley there's a little

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.030 
power steering pulley there's a little
key<00:03:31.519> way<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:32.599> have<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:33.079> you<00:03:33.379> may<00:03:33.530> have<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.829> file

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
key way you have to you may have to file

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.740 
key way you have to you may have to file
that<00:03:34.280> down<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.549> little<00:03:34.700> bit<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.329> it<00:03:35.480> will<00:03:35.569> fit

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
that down a little bit so it will fit

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:47.890 
that down a little bit so it will fit
through<00:03:36.019> there<00:03:46.359> after<00:03:47.359> you've<00:03:47.510> made<00:03:47.720> the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
through there after you've made the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.170 
through there after you've made the
pulley<00:03:48.109> to<00:03:48.200> where<00:03:48.409> the<00:03:48.530> keyway<00:03:48.859> will<00:03:49.069> fit<00:03:49.340> all

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
pulley to where the keyway will fit all

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.449 
pulley to where the keyway will fit all
that's<00:03:50.659> left<00:03:50.930> is<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.349> attach<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.680> lock<00:03:52.069> nut<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
that's left is to attach the lock nut to

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.920 
that's left is to attach the lock nut to
the<00:03:52.489> front<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:52.879> the<00:03:52.939> pulley<00:03:53.269> tighten<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:53.900> down

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
the front of the pulley tighten it down

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.670 
the front of the pulley tighten it down
with<00:03:54.170> an<00:03:54.319> impact<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.069> you're<00:03:55.250> good<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.519> go
