00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:09.229
 Warriors 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:17.950
 so we use that word warriors 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.160
 very often 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:25.780
 by facebook I'm constantly watching 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.400
 great literary contributions of athletes of 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.320
 People who practice bodybuilding the 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.869
 fitness 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.869
 the people who train they talk 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:43.540
 with epic words they write 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.120
 phrases of his or not taken from novels 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.160
 sword and sorcery genre sword and 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:54.220
 witchcraft of heroes 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:57.580
 and let's say the conclusion of what 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.430
 many and many of those that 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.470
 you practice 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.510
 to the bodybuilding weight training 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.930
 in search the hypertrophy of the improvement 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.930
 personal 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.370
 post auto denominates iron warriors 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.300
 metaphorically it may be fine but 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:21.030
 I'm sincerely starting to be tired 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:25.020
 that that term is used 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.979
 to create a kind of caste sect 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.509
 of social elite of those who are called 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.890
 iron warriors sacrificed people 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.680
 people who do leg training 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.450
 about to vomit or vomit people who are going 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.310
 go home to diet and stop eating 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.520
 burgers to eat a breast of 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.240
 chicken and that's a suffering 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.560
 indescribable and a value 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.740
 personal 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.649
 exaggerated 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.299
 I would tell you, I would tell you that everything 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.189
 that deep down does not lead to anything 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.799
 good because it makes us 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.100
 let's think we're better than the rest 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.100
 just for the fact 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.770
 to have better physique 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.850
 and obviously do everything 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.490
 involves getting that best physique 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.090
 that can take us many times to a 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.090
 kind of 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.510
 separation of reality and 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.910
 move away from society and even from 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.400
 that we are more time looking at the 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.400
 mirror that looking at our partner 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.370
 it can be an egocentricity if you also 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.280
 it can be 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.599
 maybe we should understand that the one 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.980
 train sacrifices fight is overcome and 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.090
 does the things he has to do to 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.090
 have better physique 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.090
 he does it because he has understood that that 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.980
 makes a person better 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.720
 but to be a better person 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.370
 you have to understand that there are people who do not 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.050
 does or does not have the will to do it 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.910
 or do not find it convenient to do it 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.670
 but they are people who also have 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.930
 your values your intelligence 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.930
 your capacity of that building 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.470
 perhaps otherwise focused so 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.400
 this is a bit a criticism to all 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.810
 us that ever another we 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.810
 we have attributed 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.210
 this word as own 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.740
 thinking that we are better than the rest 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.060
 the final message that I want that 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.380
 you understand is that what makes us 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.230
 better than the rest is 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.240
 learn every day and try to be better 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.080
 not only physically but 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:50.290
 intellectually and spiritually 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.290
 that will make you better people 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.599
