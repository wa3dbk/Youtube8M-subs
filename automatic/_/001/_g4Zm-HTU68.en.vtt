00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
possibly go through for a third reboot

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.970 
possibly go through for a third reboot
and<00:03:00.480> Marvel<00:03:01.200> has<00:03:01.290> still<00:03:01.500> been<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.890> fence

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
and Marvel has still been on the fence

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.380 
and Marvel has still been on the fence
but<00:03:02.160> really<00:03:02.460> what<00:03:02.640> Marvel<00:03:03.000> has<00:03:03.150> such<00:03:03.360> a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
but really what Marvel has such a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.300 
but really what Marvel has such a
powerhouse<00:03:03.780> right<00:03:04.140> now<00:03:04.290> they<00:03:04.650> can<00:03:04.680> go<00:03:05.010> forward

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
powerhouse right now they can go forward

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.040 
powerhouse right now they can go forward
without<00:03:05.550> spider-man<00:03:06.030> they<00:03:06.420> can<00:03:06.600> go<00:03:06.720> forward

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
without spider-man they can go forward

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.950 
without spider-man they can go forward
with<00:03:07.500> cap<00:03:07.740> three<00:03:08.100> doing<00:03:08.490> civil<00:03:08.730> war<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.240> using

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
with cap three doing civil war and using

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.770 
with cap three doing civil war and using
the<00:03:10.080> Black<00:03:10.260> Panther<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.280> replace<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.390> role<00:03:12.600> of

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
the Black Panther to replace the role of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.070 
the Black Panther to replace the role of
spider-man<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.250> think<00:03:14.400> even<00:03:15.060> even<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:15.870> they

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
spider-man so I think even even if they

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.450 
spider-man so I think even even if they
don't<00:03:16.200> we<00:03:16.470> don't<00:03:16.620> get<00:03:16.770> that<00:03:16.800> cameo<00:03:17.280> we're

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
don't we don't get that cameo we're

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.190 
don't we don't get that cameo we're
still<00:03:17.670> going<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.880> see<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> pretty<00:03:18.420> solid<00:03:18.720> film

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
still going to see a pretty solid film

yeah she can come back as Mary Jane yeah
that's<00:03:58.470> like<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:59.010> what<00:03:59.130> i<00:03:59.160> read<00:03:59.730> i<00:03:59.910> would<00:04:00.180> buy

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
that's like that what i read i would buy

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.180 
that's like that what i read i would buy
it<00:04:00.570> if<00:04:00.990> it<00:04:01.200> were<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.500> be<00:04:01.530> rebooted<00:04:02.010> i<00:04:02.070> would

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
it if it were to be rebooted i would

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.830 
it if it were to be rebooted i would
love<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.490> see<00:04:02.610> Miles<00:04:02.820> Morales<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.780> think

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
love to see Miles Morales and I think

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.660 
love to see Miles Morales and I think
that<00:04:04.020> would<00:04:04.230> be<00:04:04.290> an<00:04:04.650> interesting<00:04:05.010> way<00:04:05.640> to

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
that would be an interesting way to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.720 
that would be an interesting way to
explore<00:04:06.330> that<00:04:07.110> world<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.980> because<00:04:08.400> it's<00:04:08.550> so

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
explore that world that because it's so

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.670 
explore that world that because it's so
expensive<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.570> really<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:09.990> and<00:04:10.260> we<00:04:10.320> only<00:04:10.530> just

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
expensive it really is and we only just

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.560 
expensive it really is and we only just
touch<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> surface<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.820> then<00:04:12.180> we<00:04:12.270> just<00:04:12.300> keep

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
touch the surface and then we just keep

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.050 
touch the surface and then we just keep
rebooting<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.200> again<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.590> again<00:04:13.830> so<00:04:14.460> I<00:04:14.910> think

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
rebooting it again and again so I think

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.300 
rebooting it again and again so I think
there's<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.360> lot<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.510> potential<00:04:15.900> there<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.470> do

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
there's a lot of potential there I do

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.060 
there's a lot of potential there I do
hope<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.450> they<00:04:18.750> let<00:04:19.020> it<00:04:19.170> go<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.650> give<00:04:20.040> it

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
hope that they let it go and give it

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.950 
hope that they let it go and give it
back<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.370> Marvel<00:04:20.850> because<00:04:21.120> Marvel<00:04:21.510> knows<00:04:21.750> what

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
back to Marvel because Marvel knows what

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.300 
back to Marvel because Marvel knows what
they're<00:04:22.080> doing<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.590> they<00:04:22.740> always<00:04:22.920> have<00:04:23.220> an

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
they're doing and they always have an

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.550 
they're doing and they always have an
exit<00:04:23.610> strategy<00:04:23.670> with<00:04:24.630> their<00:04:24.870> business<00:04:25.290> plans

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
exit strategy with their business plans

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.560 
exit strategy with their business plans
and<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.920> seems<00:04:26.130> like<00:04:26.220> Sony<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.790> like<00:04:26.970> let's<00:04:27.360> put

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
and it seems like Sony is like let's put

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.940 
and it seems like Sony is like let's put
out<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.690> spider-man<00:04:28.050> movie<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.530> see<00:04:28.800> what

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
out a spider-man movie and see what

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.980 
out a spider-man movie and see what
happens<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.640> it's<00:04:30.180> always<00:04:30.480> like<00:04:30.630> we'll<00:04:30.840> make

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
happens and it's always like we'll make

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.140 
happens and it's always like we'll make
another<00:04:31.320> one<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.710> see<00:04:31.920> what<00:04:31.950> happens<00:04:32.490> last

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
another one and see what happens last

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.930 
another one and see what happens last
one<00:04:33.420> was<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.600> bit<00:04:33.840> of<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.050> mess<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.680> was<00:04:34.920> a<00:04:34.950> mess<00:04:35.460> it

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
one was a bit of a mess it was a mess it

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.960 
one was a bit of a mess it was a mess it
was<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.450> was<00:04:36.630> awful<00:04:37.080> yeah<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:38.250> think<00:04:38.400> Marvel

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
was it was awful yeah I think Marvel

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.010 
was it was awful yeah I think Marvel
does<00:04:39.150> know<00:04:39.330> what<00:04:39.450> they're<00:04:39.600> doing<00:04:39.870> they've

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
does know what they're doing they've

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.420 
does know what they're doing they've
proved<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.410> again<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.770> again<00:04:40.860> with<00:04:41.250> their

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
proved it again and again with their

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.370 
proved it again and again with their
cinematic<00:04:41.820> universe<00:04:41.990> so<00:04:42.990> maybe<00:04:43.170> that

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
cinematic universe so maybe that

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.870 
cinematic universe so maybe that
wouldn't<00:04:43.590> be<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.830> worst<00:04:43.860> idea<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.610> like<00:04:44.730> you

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
wouldn't be the worst idea that like you

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.670 
wouldn't be the worst idea that like you
said<00:04:45.120> i<00:04:45.270> didn't<00:04:45.510> realize<00:04:45.540> a<00:04:46.020> black<00:04:46.410> panther
