00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello and welcome so great 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.520
 Role in this video I want you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.670
 show how to easily enter 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.950
 can crochet hair scrub so you can 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.099
 either spice up the hair band or man 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.320
 It can also be worn as a bracelet afterwards 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:21.600
 and I start by just doing it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.910
 first the thread around the hair band 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.250
 around knothe and such a bit 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.550
 let us survive again afterwards 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.640
 knot with the tail after educator 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.930
 you can do it again 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.059
 want to take and also just one 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.910
 corresponding hairpin like you on 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.040
 best fits i use this pink 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.079
 scrunchy and in contrast to that 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.469
 environment 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:55.340
 then I go in that get me the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:57.320
 thread around once and drive through 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.660
 and 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.660
 crochet two simple stitches 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.950
 and that once around always the 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.470
 damage underneath recover 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.740
 into the land and sting the thread 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.740
 by 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.450
 and that once around 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.380
 I am here now at the end I have here 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.329
 still a bit of space every day now 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.039
 still a solid mass in and then 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.710
 I beat the whole but I leave 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:51.560
 here a piece trans and in the future 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.259
 pull it off and then it works 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.299
 continue with a fine needle and me 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.789
 then go with the colors and with the 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.390
 flag needle here in the first mesh the 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.390
 I did 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.109
 pull through once 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.470
 and then back to the mesh 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.470
 put out comes 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.300
 so I have a closed up here 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.330
 mesh picture and here at the side 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.950
 once the two knotted in tears 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.950
 to fix the whole thing again 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.610
 here at the side is then true 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.680
 small knot I still fix with 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.050
 a drop of victory and leo that he on 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.340
 no case again, I am just one 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.340
 very small trippy industries 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.580
 The whole thing gets hard immediately and I can 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.570
 then just recommend the two completely 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.570
 short cut 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.340
 the whole is done now 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.270
 elasticity of the h gomez remains natural 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.980
 receive 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.770
 This allows the whole thing completely 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.660
 easy to wear as a bracelet 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.580
 you could also mesh instead 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.920
 Crochet larger stitches, for example 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.810
 half stevia or chopsticks or here 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.440
 crochet a second layer on it 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.940
 that is totally flexible and you have it all 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.360
 easy and no quick easy one 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.800
 nice crochet on the band depending on what 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.600
 had them for a color one sees 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.740
 shining through here so easily 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.830
 Can you do different effects 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.300
 join in and as I said the whole is 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.470
 super flexible you can do the whole thing 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.020
 Of course, still as a hair gum 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.580
 use and have you all 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.750
 if you like the idea and 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.620
 perhaps has lust it a try 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.120
 try 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.770
 then let me take a lady upstairs 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.060
 because if you still have ideas or suggestions 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.780
 have suggestions for me or 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.520
 maybe even a little one 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.960
 wish it just write me in the 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.190
 comments then I'll look something else 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.840
 is beautiful for you can do 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.310
 and yes maybe you have fun with it 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.720
 to watch me in the channel and me 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.610
 maybe an abo to let that look forward 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.290

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.560
