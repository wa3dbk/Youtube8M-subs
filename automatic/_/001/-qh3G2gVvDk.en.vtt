00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
is not sure if I said that right but

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.340 
is not sure if I said that right but
let's<00:00:18.060> take<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> look<00:00:18.510> at<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.900> device<00:00:19.140> itself

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
let's take a look at the device itself

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.859 
let's take a look at the device itself
so<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> pre-production<00:00:20.720> model<00:00:21.720> that

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
so this is a pre-production model that

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.929 
so this is a pre-production model that
we've<00:00:21.990> got<00:00:22.260> here<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.859> these<00:00:23.130> specification

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
we've got here so these specification

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.910 
we've got here so these specification
features<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.779> what<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.080> could<00:00:25.560> change

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
features and what have you could change

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.970 
features and what have you could change
before<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.060> comes<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.480> market<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.380> I've

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
before it comes to market but I've

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.109 
before it comes to market but I've
reason<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.400> believe<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> stay

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
reason to believe it's going to stay

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.770 
reason to believe it's going to stay
fairly<00:00:30.480> similar<00:00:31.040> to<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.480> see

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
fairly similar to this so as you can see

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.930 
fairly similar to this so as you can see
it's<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.280> blackberry<00:00:35.280> esque<00:00:35.930> style<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
it's a blackberry esque style with a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.450 
it's a blackberry esque style with a
screen<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.090> top<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:40.070> physical<00:00:41.070> keypad

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
screen at the top and a physical keypad

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.959 
screen at the top and a physical keypad
at<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.300> bottom<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> touchscreen<00:00:44.340> so

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
at the bottom this is a touchscreen so

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.660 
at the bottom this is a touchscreen so
is<00:00:45.239> comparable<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.039> likes<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:49.670> HTC

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
is comparable to the likes of the HTC

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.119 
is comparable to the likes of the HTC
chacha<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.410> has<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> touch<00:00:53.100> screen

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
chacha because that has a touch screen

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.869 
chacha because that has a touch screen
and<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:54.090> physical<00:00:54.690> keyboard<00:00:55.430> like<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.640> said

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and a physical keyboard like this said

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.020 
and a physical keyboard like this said
to<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> product<00:00:57.859> similar<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.399> some<00:00:59.670> respects

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to you product similar in some respects

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.260 
to you product similar in some respects
again<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.600> HTC<00:01:01.530> snap<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:02.219> well<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.789> any

of those windows mobile users out there

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.550 
of those windows mobile users out there
in<00:01:07.830> terms<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.600> thickness<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.900> fairly

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
in terms of thickness it's fairly

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.990 
in terms of thickness it's fairly
comparable<00:01:11.549> perhaps<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.689> fraction<00:01:13.350> thicker

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
comparable perhaps a fraction thicker

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.450 
comparable perhaps a fraction thicker
not<00:01:15.000> quite<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:16.100> tall<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.520> snap<00:01:19.250> but<00:01:20.250> let's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
not quite as tall as the snap but let's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.320 
not quite as tall as the snap but let's
have<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> quick<00:01:20.939> look<00:01:20.970> at<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:22.020> device<00:01:22.790> then<00:01:23.790> so
