00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
seeds are coming right now same reason

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.270 
seeds are coming right now same reason
you<00:00:53.879> peel<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> hard-boiled<00:00:54.840> egg<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.710> under<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you peel a hard-boiled egg and under the

you peel a hard-boiled egg and under the
running<00:00:56.610> water<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.210> sink<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.719> helps<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> skin

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
running water the sink it helps the skin

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.349 
running water the sink it helps the skin
come<00:00:58.739> off<00:00:58.829> having<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> moisture<00:01:00.239> around

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
come off having the moisture around

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.090 
come off having the moisture around
these<00:01:00.629> seeds<00:01:00.930> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> helps<00:01:01.559> them<00:01:01.739> peel<00:01:01.949> out

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
these seeds kind of helps them peel out

these seeds kind of helps them peel out
of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> skin<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.750> other<00:01:03.930> reason<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.680> if

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
of the skin the other reason is is if

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
of the skin the other reason is is if
you<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.189> peel<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.090> seeds<00:01:06.299> off<00:01:06.479> right<00:01:06.720> here

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you just peel the seeds off right here

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.910 
you just peel the seeds off right here
in<00:01:06.990> front<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.320> you're<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> score

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
in front of you you're going to score

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.210 
in front of you you're going to score
juice<00:01:08.220> everywhere

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.610 

so<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.120> just<00:01:13.300> get<00:01:13.540> as<00:01:13.660> many<00:01:13.840> seeds<00:01:14.140> out<00:01:14.320> as<00:01:14.500> you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
so you just get as many seeds out as you

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.410 
so you just get as many seeds out as you
can<00:01:14.980> and<00:01:16.770> you'll<00:01:17.770> notice<00:01:18.010> that<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.910> white<00:01:19.120> is
