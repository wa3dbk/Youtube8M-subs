00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.780
 special pieces of music like Wagner's 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.209

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.940
 these regular emotions are in everyone 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.040

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.480
 seen something else you have something new 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.660
 in trumpet area because more short 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.370

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.319
 This year a new model here 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.819
 so 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.160
 a concrete beet with a novel 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.870

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.610
 one-piece trains if you like that 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:07.459
 Once demonstrated that is you can see 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.350
 here is otherwise stated in the guild 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.420

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.530
 different game feeling 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.670
 Maybe that's what you mean 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.230
 have special on this instrument 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:31.000
 This mechanical engineering can be relatively large 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.350
 piece and therefore on their firm 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.799
 you can do that on a large scale 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.230
 I play what wonderful orchestra I still play 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.640

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.940
 The castle alone last year was that 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.750

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.940

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.320
 programs as a show instrument 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.910
