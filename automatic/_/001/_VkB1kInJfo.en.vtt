think<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.159> said<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.670> yesterday's

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
think this like I said in yesterday's

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.749 
think this like I said in yesterday's
video<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:43.170> tank<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.950> definitely<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> best

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
video this tank is definitely the best

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.060 
video this tank is definitely the best
out<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.840> out<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> ones<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.649> played<00:01:46.890> so

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
out of the out of the ones I played so

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.940 
out of the out of the ones I played so
far<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.549> haven't<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.810> tried<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.619> fast

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
far I haven't actually tried the fast

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.999 
far I haven't actually tried the fast
firing<00:01:50.250> gun<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:51.299> i<00:01:51.659> thought<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.890> this

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
firing gun but i thought this that this

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.679 
firing gun but i thought this that this
autoloader<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:53.939> fun<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.210> i<00:01:54.450> didn't

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
autoloader was just so fun that i didn't

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.230 
autoloader was just so fun that i didn't
really<00:01:54.810> need<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.649> sure<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.340> non

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
really need to I'm sure the non

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.819 
really need to I'm sure the non
autoloading<00:01:57.869> version<00:01:58.320> will<00:01:58.439> also<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
autoloading version will also be a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.770 
autoloading version will also be a
viable<00:01:59.009> option<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.520> well<00:01:59.549> its<00:01:59.850> got<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.210> 2.5

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
viable option as well its got like a 2.5

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.760 
viable option as well its got like a 2.5
second<00:02:01.079> reload<00:02:01.290> or<00:02:01.409> something<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:01.710> that

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
second reload or something like that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.510 
second reload or something like that
very<00:02:01.950> very<00:02:02.219> good<00:02:02.549> rate<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.450> fire<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.130> in

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
very very good rate of fire and in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.670 
very very good rate of fire and in
comparison<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> t71<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.469> don't

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
comparison to the t71 I really don't

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.290 
comparison to the t71 I really don't
know<00:02:07.770> what<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.220> tank<00:02:10.580> what<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.790> sorry<00:02:12.150> what

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
know what this tank what the sorry what

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.580 
know what this tank what the sorry what
the<00:02:12.390> t71<00:02:12.810> has<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.319> thing

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
the t71 has this thing

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.050 
the t71 has this thing
does<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.980> mean<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.220> tank<00:02:14.459> does<00:02:14.640> everything

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
does it I mean this tank does everything

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.600 
does it I mean this tank does everything
it's<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.540> little<00:02:15.750> bit<00:02:15.870> bigger<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.230> guess<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
it's a little bit bigger I guess but the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.640 
it's a little bit bigger I guess but the
autoloader<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.150> better<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:19.200> got<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.470> same

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
autoloader is better it's got the same

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.630 
autoloader is better it's got the same
pen<00:02:19.980> I'm<00:02:20.819> not<00:02:21.239> sure<00:02:21.300> about<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.750> health<00:02:22.370> HP<00:02:23.370> of

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
pen I'm not sure about the health HP of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.490 
pen I'm not sure about the health HP of
the<00:02:23.849> t71<00:02:24.330> but<00:02:24.780> I'm<00:02:24.870> sure<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.290> pretty

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the t71 but I'm sure it's pretty

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.410 
the t71 but I'm sure it's pretty
comparable<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.489> your<00:02:26.610> seven<00:02:26.849> light<00:02:27.000> tank<00:02:27.239> I

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
comparable to your seven light tank I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.670 
comparable to your seven light tank I
mean<00:02:27.569> this<00:02:27.750> thing<00:02:28.019> is<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.230> going<00:02:28.530> to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
completely outshine the t71 and for that

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
actually that bad i think it's like

25<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:28.050> 30<00:04:28.350> seconds<00:04:28.800> really<00:04:29.340> not<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:29.580> bad<00:04:29.730> at

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
25 to 30 seconds really not that bad at

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.300 
25 to 30 seconds really not that bad at
all<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.570> when<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:30.960> have<00:04:30.990> 1500<00:04:31.560> burst<00:04:31.740> maybe

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
all and when you have 1500 burst maybe

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.950 
all and when you have 1500 burst maybe
really<00:04:32.730> just<00:04:32.970> cannot<00:04:33.210> complain<00:04:33.540> about<00:04:33.690> that

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
really just cannot complain about that

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
really just cannot complain about that
and<00:04:34.670> this<00:04:35.670> game<00:04:35.880> actually<00:04:36.720> we<00:04:36.960> end<00:04:37.170> up<00:04:37.410> I<00:04:37.620> think

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
and this game actually we end up I think

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.500 
and this game actually we end up I think
when<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.700> game<00:04:38.850> moment<00:04:39.180> speed<00:04:39.330> up<00:04:39.420> a<00:04:39.480> little

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
when the game moment speed up a little

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.360 
when the game moment speed up a little
bit<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.050> end<00:04:40.200> because<00:04:40.320> we<00:04:40.470> basically<00:04:40.620> end

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
bit of the end because we basically end

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.830 
bit of the end because we basically end
up<00:04:41.490> searching<00:04:41.730> for<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.090> last<00:04:42.270> guy<00:04:42.450> for

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
up searching for the last guy for

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.660 
up searching for the last guy for
forever<00:04:43.320> he<00:04:43.740> ends<00:04:43.980> up<00:04:44.040> being<00:04:44.220> behind<00:04:44.370> their

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
forever he ends up being behind their

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.430 
forever he ends up being behind their
base<00:04:44.850> so<00:04:45.450> I'm<00:04:45.540> not<00:04:45.630> really<00:04:45.750> sure<00:04:45.870> how<00:04:46.080> he<00:04:46.140> snuck

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440

chance to shoot me he would have even it

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.159 
chance to shoot me he would have even it
would<00:05:14.880> have<00:05:14.970> hit<00:05:15.030> me<00:05:15.210> still<00:05:15.780> when<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:16.020> killed

would have hit me still when it killed
me<00:05:16.320> and<00:05:16.500> I<00:05:16.530> wouldn't<00:05:16.770> be<00:05:16.830> able<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:16.980> finish<00:05:17.130> him

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310

me and I wouldn't be able to finish him
off<00:05:17.340> with<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.580> rest<00:05:17.730> of<00:05:17.820> my<00:05:17.910> clip<00:05:18.150> so

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
off with the rest of my clip so

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.670 
off with the rest of my clip so
basically<00:05:18.750> you<00:05:18.840> can<00:05:18.960> look<00:05:19.080> at<00:05:19.200> any<00:05:19.260> tank<00:05:19.560> with

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
basically you can look at any tank with

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.950 
basically you can look at any tank with
1500<00:05:20.190> hit<00:05:20.280> points<00:05:20.640> and<00:05:20.790> you<00:05:21.390> can<00:05:21.540> say<00:05:21.690> ok

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
1500 hit points and you can say ok

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.960 
1500 hit points and you can say ok
you'll<00:05:22.380> probably<00:05:22.590> die<00:05:22.830> be<00:05:23.190> as<00:05:23.370> long<00:05:23.640> as<00:05:23.820> you're

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
you'll probably die be as long as you're

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.040 
you'll probably die be as long as you're
flanking<00:05:24.360> him<00:05:24.419> as<00:05:24.570> long<00:05:24.690> as<00:05:24.720> you're<00:05:24.930> going

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
flanking him as long as you're going

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.450 
flanking him as long as you're going
around<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.320> back<00:05:25.470> this<00:05:25.950> thing<00:05:26.160> just<00:05:26.310> has

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
around the back this thing just has

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.760 
around the back this thing just has
amazing<00:05:27.000> burst<00:05:27.210> potential<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.840> it<00:05:28.500> cruises

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
amazing burst potential and it cruises

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.800 
amazing burst potential and it cruises
around<00:05:28.950> at<00:05:29.190> 72<00:05:29.550> kilometers<00:05:30.000> pretty<00:05:30.360> much<00:05:30.570> no

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
around at 72 kilometers pretty much no

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.320 
around at 72 kilometers pretty much no

to<00:05:33.390> speed<00:05:33.570> it<00:05:33.600> up<00:05:33.720> here<00:05:33.960> because<00:05:34.440> what<00:05:34.590> ends<00:05:34.740> up

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
to speed it up here because what ends up

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.550 
to speed it up here because what ends up
happening<00:05:34.890> is<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:36.180> don't<00:05:36.570> actually<00:05:36.810> know<00:05:37.020> where

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
they're going to do to it I would assume

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.230

that<00:05:59.250> they're<00:05:59.430> going<00:05:59.550> to<00:05:59.640> drop<00:05:59.850> it<00:05:59.910> down<00:06:00.180> a

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
that they're going to drop it down a

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.460 
that they're going to drop it down a
little<00:06:00.630> bit<00:06:00.810> in<00:06:01.020> terms<00:06:01.350> of<00:06:02.750> stats<00:06:03.750> because<00:06:04.080> it

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
little bit in terms of stats because it

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.409 
little bit in terms of stats because it
just<00:06:04.680> seems<00:06:04.979> really<00:06:05.520> really<00:06:05.910> strong<00:06:06.210> at<00:06:06.330> the
