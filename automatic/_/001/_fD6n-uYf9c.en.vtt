Strymon el capistan tape echo

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.989 
Strymon el capistan tape echo
it's<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:42.230> new<00:00:42.379> tape<00:00:43.129> echo<00:00:43.280> pedal<00:00:43.670> from<00:00:43.730> Strom

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999 
it's the new tape echo pedal from Strom

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:46.239 
it's the new tape echo pedal from Strom
and<00:00:44.030> it's<00:00:44.239> incredible<00:00:44.960> then<00:00:45.379> from<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:45.980> output

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
and it's incredible then from the output

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.819 
and it's incredible then from the output
of<00:00:46.309> that<00:00:46.460> it's<00:00:46.640> going<00:00:46.820> back<00:00:46.999> into<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.960> return

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
of that it's going back into the return

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.549 
of that it's going back into the return

and the wet signal which is the B miss
diamond<00:02:23.780> I've<00:02:24.530> just<00:02:24.680> set<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:25.070> for<00:02:25.300> my<00:02:26.300> maximum

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
diamond I've just set up for my maximum

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.240 
diamond I've just set up for my maximum
wet<00:02:27.260> time

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.370 

right

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
right

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.840 
right
so<00:02:32.860> what's<00:02:33.040> going<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.220> happen<00:02:33.280> there<00:02:33.670> when<00:02:33.820> I

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
so what's going to happen there when I

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.780 
so what's going to happen there when I
use<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.210> volume<00:02:34.390> pedal<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.310> point<00:02:39.520> pedal

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
use the volume pedal to the point pedal

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.300 
use the volume pedal to the point pedal
out

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.230 

and<00:02:45.190> what<00:02:46.190> I'm<00:02:46.310> playing<00:02:46.490> now<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.880> unaffected

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
and what I'm playing now is unaffected

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.490 
and what I'm playing now is unaffected
by<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.540> delay<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.600> basically<00:02:50.959> using<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
by the delay so basically using the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.170 
by the delay so basically using the
volume<00:02:51.890> pedal<00:02:52.069> now<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.370> volume<00:02:52.640> pedal<00:02:53.000> has

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
volume pedal now the volume pedal has

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.230 
volume pedal now the volume pedal has
become<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.750> on/off<00:02:54.200> for<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.530> delay<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:56.000> with

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
become the on/off for the delay so with

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.940 
become the on/off for the delay so with
Vaughn<00:02:56.420> paddle<00:02:56.750> down<00:03:00.670> there's<00:03:01.670> no<00:03:01.790> delay<00:03:02.950> does

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
Vaughn paddle down there's no delay does

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:13.480 
Vaughn paddle down there's no delay does
it<00:03:04.069> blend<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.340> by<00:03:04.459> pedal<00:03:04.819> in

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.910 

put<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.910> volume<00:03:14.030> pedal<00:03:14.270> out<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.590> echo

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
put the volume pedal out and that echo

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.360 
put the volume pedal out and that echo
will<00:03:16.100> continue<00:03:16.640> I<00:03:17.800> don't<00:03:18.800> play<00:03:18.920> ever<00:03:19.070> top<00:03:19.280> of

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
will continue I don't play ever top of

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:45.940 
will continue I don't play ever top of
that

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.950 

cool
