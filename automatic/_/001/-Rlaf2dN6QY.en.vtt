 5 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.380
 in short it was Saturday morning when a friend 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.570
 send me a message in his message and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.680
 who had scored I seem to you ten bullets 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.390
 that if you play two chips that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.660
 will understand 20 as I was not good 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.940
 woke up I received this message once 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.170
 twice three times 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 I finally understood I was happy 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.739
 then I went back to sleep two hours 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.020
 after I woke up I went 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.340
 eat take the car falls to the grass 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.080
 what did I finally go to light 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
 tell them I replied to my friend that 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.000
 I would not have his challenge I see you October 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.809
 I downloaded the game it bugged me 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.809
 I'm pissed off complicating life 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.309
 I will vote the charges and it worked 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 I was happy I had to choose one of 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:18.870
 sisters of characters when I saw them 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:20.310
 names of characters says laughing no 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.320
 but the entrance I stopped laughing 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.540
 so watched I'm going to look at me 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.950
 watched the parties finally I 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.990
 chose an old grandpa when I find that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.550
 not really too stylish I fell 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.460
 in a video word and I saw a monster 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:40.909
 I attack them and I'm dead 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:42.830
 I hit my keyboard finally I 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.150
 played for a week non stop and 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.320
 I sent a message from my friend 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.170
 let's say I understood the game 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.700
 fleas and who owed me to bac my friend 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.979
 sent me a question mark on 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.560
 the shot I did not understand but actually 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.720
 I forgot one thing my friend 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.720
