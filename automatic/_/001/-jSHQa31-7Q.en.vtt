we<00:00:15.300> wanted<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.719> find<00:00:15.900> out<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.349> it<00:00:16.470> takes<00:00:16.500> to

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
we wanted to find out what it takes to

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.400 
we wanted to find out what it takes to
make<00:00:17.099> a<00:00:17.130> vehicle<00:00:17.610> move<00:00:17.820> itself<00:00:18.410> autonomously

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
make a vehicle move itself autonomously

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.279 
make a vehicle move itself autonomously
and<00:00:19.770> regular<00:00:20.250> traffic<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.330> said<00:00:21.539> let's<00:00:22.140> go

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
and regular traffic so we said let's go

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.300 
and regular traffic so we said let's go
and<00:00:22.410> check<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.740> out<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:24.289> about<00:00:25.289> 100<00:00:25.770> kilometers

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and check it out on about 100 kilometers

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.530 
and check it out on about 100 kilometers

we<00:00:38.760> did<00:00:38.940> not<00:00:39.060> just<00:00:39.300> pick<00:00:39.630> any<00:00:39.870> rat<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.560> very

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
we did not just pick any rat but a very

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.290 
we did not just pick any rat but a very

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
special one the route were two bands

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000 
special one the route were two bands
made<00:00:42.540> history<00:00:42.900> a<00:00:43.050> hundred<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.590> twenty<00:00:43.830> five

the<00:00:50.039> challenges<00:00:50.609> were<00:00:50.789> enormous<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
the challenges were enormous from the

precise enough we needed a localization
