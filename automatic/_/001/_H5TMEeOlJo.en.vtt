00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929 

I<00:00:00.979> think<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.070> public<00:00:02.399> health<00:00:02.580> dental

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
I think the public health dental

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.599 
I think the public health dental
hygienist<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.080> next<00:00:04.380> step<00:00:04.589> in<00:00:04.920> private

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
hygienist is the next step in private

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.400 
hygienist is the next step in private
practice<00:00:05.940> you<00:00:05.970> may<00:00:06.210> not<00:00:06.420> see<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.960> underserved

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
practice you may not see the underserved

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.190 
practice you may not see the underserved
population<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:09.090> way<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.480> see<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.080> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
population the way that I see it in the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.020 
population the way that I see it in the
school<00:00:10.469> systems<00:00:10.950> we<00:00:11.219> can<00:00:11.370> take<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.730> skills

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
school systems we can take the skills

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.700 
school systems we can take the skills
that<00:00:12.120> we've<00:00:12.330> learned<00:00:12.360> as<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.870> hygienist<00:00:13.530> and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
that we've learned as a hygienist and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.369 
that we've learned as a hygienist and
apply<00:00:14.099> them<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.179> different<00:00:15.630> setting<00:00:15.929> I

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
apply them in a different setting I

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.470 
apply them in a different setting I
think<00:00:16.500> there<00:00:16.920> are<00:00:16.949> many<00:00:17.359> hygienists<00:00:18.359> out

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
think there are many hygienists out

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.720 
think there are many hygienists out
there<00:00:18.840> who<00:00:19.350> would<00:00:19.830> really<00:00:20.070> love<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
there who would really love the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.420 
there who would really love the
opportunity<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.539> be<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.800> non-traditional

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
opportunity to be in a non-traditional

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.540 
opportunity to be in a non-traditional
setting<00:00:24.420> with<00:00:24.990> all<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.529> challenges<00:00:25.800> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
setting with all of the challenges and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.819 
setting with all of the challenges and
rewards

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829

over their career and bring that to an
alternative<00:01:01.129> setting<00:01:01.430> basically<00:01:02.180> what<00:01:02.360> we're

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
alternative setting basically what we're

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.689 
alternative setting basically what we're
trying<00:01:02.659> to<00:01:02.960> do<00:01:03.110> is<00:01:03.320> reach<00:01:03.530> a<00:01:03.680> population<00:01:04.460> that

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
trying to do is reach a population that

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.540 
trying to do is reach a population that
is<00:01:05.119> considered<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.050> underserved<00:01:06.680> population

the parent in regards to the child if
they<00:01:26.149> need<00:01:26.360> dental<00:01:26.810> services<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.619> when<00:01:28.160> we

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
they need dental services and when we

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.520 
they need dental services and when we

make that call not all families speak

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.050 
make that call not all families speak
English<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.580> can<00:01:31.729> be<00:01:31.850> difficult

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
English and that can be difficult

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.820 
English and that can be difficult
because<00:01:32.539> you're<00:01:32.869> not<00:01:32.990> always<00:01:33.170> certain<00:01:33.679> that

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
because you're not always certain that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.680 
because you're not always certain that
the<00:01:33.979> parent<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.490> understanding<00:01:35.119> your<00:01:35.149> message

the parent is understanding your message

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.440 
the parent is understanding your message
and<00:01:35.960> in<00:01:36.530> some<00:01:36.740> cases<00:01:37.009> we<00:01:37.369> may<00:01:37.399> require<00:01:38.000> an

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
and in some cases we may require an

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.040 
and in some cases we may require an
interpreter<00:01:39.140> for<00:01:39.950> some<00:01:40.220> students<00:01:40.840> when<00:01:41.840> they
