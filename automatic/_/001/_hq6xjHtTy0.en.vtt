00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
thought you know I'd do something about

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.140 
thought you know I'd do something about
that<00:00:20.250> because<00:00:22.130> it<00:00:23.130> seems<00:00:23.369> quite<00:00:23.580> interesting

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
that because it seems quite interesting

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.359 
that because it seems quite interesting
I<00:00:24.330> thought<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.170> could<00:00:25.230> put<00:00:25.619> your<00:00:25.800> box<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I thought if I could put your box and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.179 
I thought if I could put your box and
Dragons<00:00:27.359> together<00:00:27.990> then<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.949> would<00:00:29.039> work

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
Dragons together then that would work

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.220
