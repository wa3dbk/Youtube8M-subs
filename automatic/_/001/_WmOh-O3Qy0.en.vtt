00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.899
 good all the rockies of the welcome 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.160
 this park boyfriend and 4 in this 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.110
 opportunity I will show you a new 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.509
 hysteria that this is about a 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.549
 new mission called ghost apprentice 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.050
 let's say it's the second step of 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.119
 another mission that had already gone up that 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.859
 He called for faults then for the 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.300
 that the government the previous video was the 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.820
 will leave in the inscription is the 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.900
 first phase that they have to unlock 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.000
 then let's say that they have to do what 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.380
 same that explains in this video but with 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.630
 another key to something different 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.220
 then for those who have not done 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.870
 The first thing they have to do is for 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.760
 obviously the first step that I eat 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.500
 I tell you I leave the link in the inscription 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.539
 so do the second step then 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.820
 it is this that is called the apprentice 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.739
 ghost that we're going to unlock another 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.120
 mission then basically it's the same 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.770
 the last video for people and the 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.930
 government but the people who have not 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.579
 seen the previous video because it equaled or 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.109
 explain then what they have to 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.760
 do to see this hysteria and 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.800
 obviously unblock the mission of 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.750
 ghost attendis is to enter with your 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.010
 count to stop what then then there 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.320
 there is the address you already know 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.150
 how to enter they just come in with their 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.500
 account and what we are going to do is what 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.690
 next then what it does is 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.909
 go to where it says soldier and then 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.280
 let's go where it says missions then 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.990
 we click there and we will see all 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.299
 the missions that we have done we are going to 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.850
 look for the ones that starts in missions in gold 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.979
 then the version is already unlocked 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.240
 previous is what is called sought 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.999
 ghosts but what you do not know what 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.709
 you learned before macri how it looks there 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.770
 we know how to unlock not just 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.659
 he says play as a prize and then here 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.310
 comes the part of the isstey that is what 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.990
 we have to do to be able to 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.849
 unlock and know what are the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.530
 requirements to get this 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:39.670
 mission then what we are going to do is 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.299
 just go here where it says 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.009
 markers and then then we go down 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.530
 we have to go to the lower part there 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.610
 a skull opens this skull 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.560
 we are just going to click and 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.390
 appears on that line is like code 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.280
 as I said the bride this simply 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.629
 will identify us will tell us the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.489
 things and there goes to say that already 

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:59.530
 we did the first phase so I say 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:01.149
 to the people who until now are 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.349
 doing this for the first time that 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.849
 they mention those have not done the first 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:05.799
 easy because first they have to do 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.359
 eat 10 big went by do not worry 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.369
 because lines of code are not going to 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.019
 spend anything your computer then what 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.380
 only they will do is write with 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.500
 spaces the link 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.450
 and there it is written there I already show them 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.790
 also so they know how to write and 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.280
 just wash wait doing this 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.320
 let's say that activate the second part 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.270
 someone is going to say that the second phase 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.520
 has been unlocked and the only thing 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.350
 let's do now then it 's 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.480
 return them but they will not be done 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.610
 touch close this page but do not leave 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.890
 to leave the browser what they will do 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.510
 is simply to click on this x that 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.800
 it would be up here then it is 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.160
 simply so that they do not go to 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.470
 fail 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.780
 doing that follow back to soldier 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.400
 where it says missions and here we go to 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.770
 go back down to find the one called 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.810
 Instant apprentice doing this 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.240
 obviously we are going to realize that and 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.890
 is unlocked and she can 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.500
 we really have to do then 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.170
 says we have to do two and 200 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.900
 deaths with piston to 20 dead with 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.630
 10 and have 2 shotgun galleons in one 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.210
 roma zone then doing this then 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.500
 obviously we can already get, let's say 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.590
 that the mission and that's going to unlock us 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.989
 a 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.030
 as a camouflage we say that 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.230
 special only for people 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.239
 who have unlocked this mission 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.519
 then it's that simple 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.310
 we complete the second part let's say that 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.440
 this dress is easy to leave the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.540
 ghost seeker and apprentice faults 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.980
 then nothing for all people I 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.900
 nothing asked many things have me 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.700
 asked what I know what can be done 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.010
 for the next mission then here 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.599
 you can unlock it then this 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.069
 It was all I wanted to show you 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.720
 so I hope you liked it in 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.670
