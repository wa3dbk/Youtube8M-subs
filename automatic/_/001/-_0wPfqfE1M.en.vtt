a suit I've been looking for for a very
long<00:00:21.630> time<00:00:21.689> finally<00:00:22.500> picked<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.769> up<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:22.920> about

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
long time finally picked it up for about

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.240 
long time finally picked it up for about
forty<00:00:23.400> dollars<00:00:23.699> pretty<00:00:24.119> happy<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:25.250> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
forty dollars pretty happy with that the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.210 
forty dollars pretty happy with that the
head<00:00:26.930> goes<00:00:27.930> pretty<00:00:28.289> far<00:00:28.529> forward<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.039> pretty

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
head goes pretty far forward and pretty

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.179 
head goes pretty far forward and pretty
far<00:00:29.429> back<00:00:30.230> you've<00:00:31.230> got<00:00:31.380> decent<00:00:31.650> side-to-side

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
far back you've got decent side-to-side

far back you've got decent side-to-side
movement<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.770> bit<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.920> an

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
movement this was a little bit of an

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.470 
movement this was a little bit of an
older<00:00:35.340> robot<00:00:35.610> damashii<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.239> think<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
older robot damashii but I think it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.330 
older robot damashii but I think it
still<00:00:36.690> holds<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.410> arms<00:00:37.860> wilco<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
still holds up the arms wilco out a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.299 
still holds up the arms wilco out a
little<00:00:38.700> bit<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> 360<00:00:40.469> no<00:00:40.800> problem

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
little bit you can do a 360 no problem

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
little bit you can do a 360 no problem
and<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:43.379> shoulder<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> hinge<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
and the shoulder is on a hinge so you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.110 
and the shoulder is on a hinge so you
can<00:00:46.020> go<00:00:46.140> about<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.379> far<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:47.120> articulation

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
can go about that far up as articulation

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.630 
can go about that far up as articulation
above<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> elbow<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.370> articulation<00:00:50.370> at<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
above the elbow and articulation at the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.529 
above the elbow and articulation at the
elbow<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.690> bad<00:00:52.789> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> pretty

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
elbow is not so bad you can get a pretty

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.500 
elbow is not so bad you can get a pretty
decent<00:00:54.660> bend<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:56.210> hands<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
decent bend out of it hands are on a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.170 
decent bend out of it hands are on a
ball-joint<00:00:59.180> the<00:01:00.180> foot<00:01:00.719> will<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.559> forward

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
ball-joint the foot will go forward

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.719 
ball-joint the foot will go forward
really<00:01:03.180> far<00:01:03.539> which<00:01:03.750> kind<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.019> exposes<00:01:04.729> these

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
really far which kind of exposes these

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.690 
really far which kind of exposes these
Pistons<00:01:06.979> you'll<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.159> side<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.869> side<00:01:10.700> forward

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
Pistons you'll go side to side forward

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.550 
Pistons you'll go side to side forward
and<00:01:12.560> backwards<00:01:13.560> straight<00:01:14.430> forward<00:01:14.820> pre<00:01:15.000> far

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
and backwards straight forward pre far

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.780 
and backwards straight forward pre far
nice<00:01:16.560> big<00:01:16.890> bend<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.490> knee

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
nice big bend at the knee

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.900 
nice big bend at the knee
and<00:01:19.410> pretty<00:01:20.410> decent<00:01:20.830> kick<00:01:21.310> forward<00:01:22.770> now

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
and pretty decent kick forward now

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.340 
and pretty decent kick forward now
backwards<00:01:24.910> you<00:01:25.510> will<00:01:25.660> wiggle<00:01:25.870> that<00:01:26.050> far

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
backwards you will wiggle that far

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.080 
backwards you will wiggle that far
because<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.680> skirt<00:01:27.040> is<00:01:27.070> fixed<00:01:29.790> side<00:01:30.790> skirt

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
because the skirt is fixed side skirt

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.340 
because the skirt is fixed side skirt
will<00:01:31.240> allow<00:01:31.480> for<00:01:31.720> that<00:01:31.750> much<00:01:32.080> with<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.920> kick-out

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
will allow for that much with a kick-out
