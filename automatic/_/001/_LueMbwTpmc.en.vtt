00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.000
 had the eggs come here better 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.730

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.750
 not four soldiers, but a 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.759
 specialized whole squadron does not 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.860
 I can promise that we will all return with 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.920
 life but there is something that we will return 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.569
 everyone home alive or dead I remember 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.299

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.220
 ready for the adventure I'm ready 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.220

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.909

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.660
