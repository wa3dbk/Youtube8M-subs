00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
two saddles in a spawner in the tutorial

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
two saddles in a spawner in the tutorial
world<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.560> everybody<00:00:19.830> can<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.490> really

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
can then go ahead and find the spawner

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.150 
can then go ahead and find the spawner
then<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.080> you<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.380> to<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.800> make<00:00:41.010> your

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
is go over to this kind of staircase

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.150 
is go over to this kind of staircase
here<00:01:03.090> looking<00:01:03.480> over<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> farm<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
here looking over the farm and then I

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.790 
here looking over the farm and then I
just<00:01:05.700> pulled<00:01:05.910> up<00:01:05.940> my<00:01:06.090> map<00:01:06.300> here<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.710> you

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
just pulled up my map here so what you

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.920 
just pulled up my map here so what you
want<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.490> make<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.270> way<00:01:09.420> over<00:01:09.660> to<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
want to do is make your way over to the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.420 
want to do is make your way over to the
coordinates<00:01:10.650> X<00:01:11.520> minus<00:01:12.060> 40<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.690> z0<00:01:13.430> don't

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
coordinates X minus 40 and z0 don't

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.520 
coordinates X minus 40 and z0 don't
worry<00:01:14.610> about<00:01:14.700> why<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.510> that's<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.050> kind

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
worry about why because that's the kind

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.140 
worry about why because that's the kind
of<00:01:16.590> up-and-down<00:01:17.220> level<00:01:17.550> that<00:01:17.670> you're<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
of up-and-down level that you're on I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.670 
of up-and-down level that you're on I
say<00:01:18.660> don't<00:01:18.720> need<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> worry<00:01:19.140> about<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.470> but

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
say don't need to worry about that but

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.100 
say don't need to worry about that but
yeah<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.010> make<00:01:20.130> over<00:01:20.400> 2x<00:01:20.729> minus<00:01:21.000> 40<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.600> Z

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
yeah just make over 2x minus 40 and Z

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.550 
yeah just make over 2x minus 40 and Z
zero<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:23.010> just<00:01:23.790> made<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.510> tower<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.350> so

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
zero I just made a little tower there so

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.980 
zero I just made a little tower there so
I<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:26.010> how<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.160> get<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.990> wouldn't

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
I know how to get there and wouldn't

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.180 
I know how to get there and wouldn't
take<00:01:28.170> too<00:01:28.229> long<00:01:28.410> trying<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> find<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
take too long trying to find it for you

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.800 
take too long trying to find it for you
guys<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:29.700> yeah<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.420> there's<00:01:30.660> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
guys but yeah you can see there's the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810 
guys but yeah you can see there's the
coordinates<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.610> want<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
coordinates and then you just want to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.160 
coordinates and then you just want to
dig<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.240> down<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.660> okay<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.050> this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
dig your way down it's okay in this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.540 
dig your way down it's okay in this
scenario<00:01:34.500> because<00:01:34.770> you'll<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.070> drop<00:01:35.250> right

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
scenario because you'll just drop right

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.630 
scenario because you'll just drop right
outside<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.090> spawner<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.310> kill

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
outside the spawner so then you can kill

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.150 
outside the spawner so then you can kill

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
don't just jump down there and I was

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.039 
don't just jump down there and I was
actually<00:02:39.000> pretty<00:02:39.360> hard<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.570> do<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.840> whilst

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
you're on a pig so I'd recommend getting

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.539 
you're on a pig so I'd recommend getting
off<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.019> breaking<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.889> just<00:02:44.190> hoping<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
off it breaking it and just hoping the

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.690 
off it breaking it and just hoping the
pizza<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:44.970> jump<00:02:45.120> down<00:02:45.299> there

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
pizza and jump down there

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.210 
pizza and jump down there

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
and then once once you're on your pick

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.559 
and then once once you're on your pick
and<00:02:48.489> you've<00:02:48.670> kind<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.000> removed<00:02:49.270> your<00:02:49.360> berry
