00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.789 
taken away so you see the damage it does
without<00:01:46.109> the<00:01:46.259> B<00:01:46.560> shield<00:01:48.229> when<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> hit<00:01:49.530> someone

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
without the B shield when I hit someone

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.370 
without the B shield when I hit someone
so<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.149> pretty<00:01:51.329> good<00:01:51.539> damage<00:01:51.719> not<00:01:52.109> it's<00:01:52.259> not

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
