I think right out of the box you'll be
having<00:00:45.190> fun<00:00:45.309> with<00:00:45.640> it<00:00:45.820> and<00:00:46.170> if<00:00:47.170> you<00:00:47.320> want<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.559> go

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
might be kind of funky so I turned it on

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.900 
might be kind of funky so I turned it on
I<00:02:28.500> had<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.920> sort<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.190> slide<00:02:29.370> around<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.730> find

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
I had to sort of slide around and find

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.480 
I had to sort of slide around and find
what<00:02:30.090> key<00:02:30.240> it's<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:30.600> but<00:02:31.320> once<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.710> did<00:02:31.770> the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.820 
what key it's in but once I did the
sound<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.060> track<00:02:33.330> inspired<00:02:33.870> me<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.350> want

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
sound of the track inspired me to want

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.360 
sound of the track inspired me to want
to<00:02:34.920> play<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:35.790> style<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:41.010> know<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.220> one

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.280 
to play in that style you know the one
thing<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.390> usually<00:02:42.900> tune<00:02:43.080> down<00:02:43.230> a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
thing that I do is I usually tune down a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.020 
thing that I do is I usually tune down a
half<00:02:43.530> step<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:44.160> know<00:02:44.280> my<00:02:44.490> whole<00:02:44.610> guitar<00:02:44.790> is

half step you know my whole guitar is
tuned<00:02:45.210> down<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.510> e-flat<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.110> every<00:02:46.320> string<00:02:46.560> is

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
tuned down to e-flat so every string is

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.370 
tuned down to e-flat so every string is
like<00:02:46.800> one<00:02:46.950> half<00:02:47.160> step<00:02:47.280> lower<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:49.110> lot<00:02:49.350> of

sort of my foundation as a musician and
so<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> lot<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.010> tracks<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.520> put<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:08.940> you

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
so a lot of the tracks that I put in you

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.910 
so a lot of the tracks that I put in you
know<00:03:09.750> they<00:03:09.959> would<00:03:10.110> probably<00:03:10.440> have<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.709> use

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
know they would probably have to use

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.350 
know they would probably have to use
like<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.340> minor<00:03:11.550> you're<00:03:11.910> like<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> minor

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
like the minor you're like a minor

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.910 
like the minor you're like a minor
pentatonic<00:03:12.720> scale<00:03:13.230> which<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.590> probably<00:03:13.770> the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
pentatonic scale which is probably the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.270 
pentatonic scale which is probably the
most<00:03:14.420> popular<00:03:15.420> scale<00:03:15.770> so<00:03:16.770> if<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.950> go<00:03:16.980> back<00:03:17.100> to

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
most popular scale so if I go back to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.430 
most popular scale so if I go back to
this<00:03:17.550> 144<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.420> created<00:03:18.750> if<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.050> listen<00:03:19.320> to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
this 144 that I created if you listen to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.300 
this 144 that I created if you listen to
it<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:22.260> know<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.530> in<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.709> key<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:22.890> E<00:03:23.070> minor

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
it you know it's in the key of E minor

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.650 
it you know it's in the key of E minor
but<00:03:23.610> it's<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.850> half<00:03:24.000> step<00:03:24.209> down<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.540> it's

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
but it's a half step down so it's

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.810 
but it's a half step down so it's
actually<00:03:24.870> flat<00:03:25.170> minor<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.130> if<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.430> put<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.730> on

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
actually flat minor so if you put it on

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.280 
actually flat minor so if you put it on
and<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.120> even<00:03:27.360> stand<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.720> which<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:27.989> guitar

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and you even stand in which this guitar

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.350 
and you even stand in which this guitar
is<00:03:28.320> standard<00:03:28.769> right<00:03:28.890> now<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:30.060> would<00:03:30.180> play

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
is standard right now you would play

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.949 
is standard right now you would play
like<00:03:30.570> a<00:03:30.600> pentatonic<00:03:31.140> scale

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.150 

here<00:03:37.959> at<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.170> eleventh<00:03:38.530> fret<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.920> could<00:03:39.040> play

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
here at the eleventh fret you could play

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:56.080

an<00:03:39.220> E<00:03:39.340> minor<00:03:39.490> pentatonic<00:03:39.910> scale

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.460 

well<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.210> scale<00:03:57.420> is<00:03:57.510> going<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.690> work<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.320> play
