00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.710
 hi all guys i'm rough and 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.720
 this is the 29th episode of fifa 12 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.640
 of towards glory 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.290
 and how you saw the team that is 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.460
 using is not the series team at i 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.810
 fans and I don't know if you read the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.550
 description of the last video I have 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.529
 done but if you haven't read it or if 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.029
 you didn't understand by reading I try to 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.310
 explain a little to you what the problem is 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.930
 which occurred this time 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 practically it was still a problem 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.360
 of connection ie I was playing 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.970
 always with the chimenti but online and put 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.500
 disconnected but not have the bonus a 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.480
 end of the game of the percentage of 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.340
 retreats nor that is put under the one 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.720
 I wanted to recreate it another time 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.310
 set-ups but the problem is that when 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.190
 I went on the internet 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.880
 the player to the other account without 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.640
 then become another time 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.140
 simply through exchanges then 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.480
 in the other kant than when I entered 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.670
 asked me to check with the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.080
 secret word and I didn't remember it e 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.480
 I don't want a court I had five attempts 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.310
 maximum to use then 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.689
 the other account is blocked and not me 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.600
 I don't even remember which e-mail is there 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.799
 password to go online on 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.360
 then playstation through the for 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.060
 social networks so for now those 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.530
 players are stuck and I don't know for 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.689
 how many days I don't know for how long 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.530
 wherever I hope he will be able to solve 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.140
 this problem 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.940
 the good hurry possible and indeed for 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.500
 now i'm playing with players from 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.110
 bronze since I made three at the beginning 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.670
 parks with between 23 and 40 I made of 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.740
 good goals straight but we play with the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.570
 right broth players for not 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.040
 stop that serious one to continue 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.510
 even if it will be something different 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.890
 however I will invent something not 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.240
 worry even if you trust that 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.280
 in the next few episodes they will no longer be 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.479
 beautiful of these because I have already registered 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.820
 also the next episode and I can 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.670
 ensure that there is a goal that has me 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.130
 made to scream a lot so not 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.330
 complain right away if Syria does not 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.190
 you like it 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.600
 in this way but wait for the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.900
 president italy do you tell me if the goals 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.640
 they are not not beautiful and unfortunately not 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.430
 I can do anything about it so be satisfied 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 this is another reason too 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.080
 how have you seen and left 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.150
 I won all three though not 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.439
 you saw the last one and I have to say that 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.970
 this track they did a little bit 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.319
 turn the balls since the last goal 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.520
 he was avoidable and not even he to do 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.319
 probably because simply 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.760
 sent to understand it match found 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.020
 his one-on-one free striker 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.270
 with ports I would have tried to get it out 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.860
 but okay we were pretty good at 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.950
 pass the ball the attacker then has 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.330
 at the empty door he did not make a mistake and the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.980
 third game together with the one where 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.930
 I make more goals even if I have to say that in 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.700
 this episode the goals are not beautiful 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.010
 but trust you must wait for the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.050
 next episode and how you all see it 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.030
 all those you played against had 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.350
 the initial team while I already have 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.880
 made three games more or less have me 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.310
 I bought some players so I can 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.780
 give you advice when you start with 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.390
 otherwise maybe you are not so much 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.980
 good don't not buy players immediately 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.780
 gold to try to make it yours 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.000
 dream team to start the players 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.340
 type ii bronze cost 200 v 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.870
 bought players of the same form 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.430
 and then of the same championship of a 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.170
 same nation example I'm doing the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.030
 English team so I always chose 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.040
 as way from 4 1 2 1 2 since 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.420
 the one with which I am better and then 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.690
 decided to buy English players 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.320
 put the price of which has the cost 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.660
 maximum of 200 so you get one 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.519
 team with 2,200 criticisms not only not 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.709
 there are so many in 34 games you can do it 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.770
 and then ok when you have credits in 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.510
 the more you buy the reserves or routes 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.090
 you can change players for example 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.070
 got the striker donaldson that one 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.990
 a little darker than the others and has it 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.970
 paid a thousand and unfortunately true movie of 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.320
 possibility it still injures us 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.760
 they have nothing to worry about enough 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.130
 it seems to me to keep him on the bench 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.280
 four games are a bit are a bit 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.900
 but just wait so you do fairies 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.430
 so that in my opinion it is excellent as things 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.050
 to begin with for those who may not yet 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.000
 it is not so clever to invert the 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.710
 the game won 5 0 even if the goals 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.720
 you saw they were not beautiful 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.950
 got enough credits and then tell me 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.690
 you even if you know any players 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.340
 I don't know how strong English bronze 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.390
 any of you know them 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.680
 however, I hope the weighs are there 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.240
 liked that it was clear enough 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.350
 explain to me what happened and if a 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.350
 all guys at the next episode
