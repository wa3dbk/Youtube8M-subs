00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.760
 I'm going to give you some tips on how to best conserve our vegetables and 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.210
 our fruits in this festival and ficosa 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.870
 that sounds very easy but surely there is some trick that you do not know seems to you 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.710
 beyond six for example let's take the cauliflower 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.730
 who does not like our vegetables that every day in almost every 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.490
 houses 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.300
 others something with vegetables 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.720
 Well, the usual thing is that we carry shopping supermarkets 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.909
 or well she with labors or 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.170
 plastic supermarket 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.270
 gentleman 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.769
 here there is work to do there we put everything and the same 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.380
 also with the leeks with the no 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.070
 with any vegetable 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.720
 I am going to give you a recommendation that surely something you know has happened to us 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.910
 ever 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.980
 that in the bottom of the refrigerator drawers 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.390
 he is alive when he takes out and if in addition he even 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.020
 in the lettuce and all below sumier cellista 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.950
 you can go 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.120
 good so that this does not happen 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.750
 our vegetables 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.980
 on paper 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.090
 not in plastic and paper because the plastic affect them 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.200
 moisten more in this case with simple paper 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.640
 because the paper of secarte of vocento the kitchens protects it 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.140
 because it is what the paper does 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.710
 that absorbs the Indian moisture has contact with the vaccine this case with the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.250
 vegetable 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.090
 fruits the same in santiago and cited 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.840
 what we have 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.840
 we can not get the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.260
 and the same 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.490
 to the drawer of the refrigerator 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.740
 something else for example watermelon 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.710
 the normal thing is that we have 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.670
 and that we put the cinema 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.350
 I do not think we are in order 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.400
 there are people who do not put anything please protect it with something I'm going to 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.420
 recommend 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.390
 Kennedy film paper 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.560
 let's do it 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.560
 with aluminum foil 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.039
 If you do not join the project, it remains in the cold air 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.109
 aluminum and zinc fazel 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.249
 Young 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.249
 neighbor of a term so that either 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.439
 humidity is made with the fridge 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.859
 beautiful sight and healthy 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.049
 to the drawer and which endorse the refrigerator 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.899
 it is simply we accept it 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.379
 There is another thing that also remained 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.939
 both bananas and hands 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:42.709
 Never 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.589
 and the peaches it is highly recommended that we protect them combat 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.809
 because in addition it is not hard anymore 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:54.379
 the hardships and the potatoes never halves in the fridge because you know 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.280
 how well 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.240
 potatoes and carrots 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.560
 they are coming 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.910
 and then from that julito that they take out you should never mix with the potatoes 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.029
 because people who put in the potato drawer 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:07.299
 the ceoe aims 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.599
 was to separate it please that it will last much longer 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.279
 both the quality and the potato 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.239
 and finally 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.629
 let's talk about the coffee in our cafe baqué 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:24.000
 When the coffee is open it is highly recommended that this is what the 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.019
 factory 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.899
 of bacqué that we imitate 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:30.350
 once opened the coffee in the fridge as we have it here 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.579
 and this tuquillo who has given them 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.579
 that we put in a container 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.049
 a little coffee 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.849
 we put the two 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.549
 to the refrigerator 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.219
 and you know what he does 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.699
 that absorbs all our hands colors 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:55.219
 I am sure that today we have learned something more to take care of our fruits 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:00.119
 both vegetables and fruits and also know how to use our fridge better 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:01.069
 ofilio and
