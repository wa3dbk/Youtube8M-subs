00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
the time doesn't go backwards and for

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.950 
the time doesn't go backwards and for
the<00:02:22.670> most<00:02:22.850> part<00:02:23.060> don't<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.510> redo<00:02:23.930> all

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
the most part don't have to redo all

that<00:02:24.290> stuff<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:24.860> did<00:02:25.250> you'll

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
that stuff that you just did you'll

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.760 
that stuff that you just did you'll
finish<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.960> front<00:02:27.200> lines<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.560> first

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
finish one of the front lines the first

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.200 
finish one of the front lines the first
time<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.310> you're<00:02:28.400> gonna<00:02:28.550> want<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.790> go<00:02:28.910> back<00:02:29.060> in

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
time and you're gonna want to go back in

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.130 
time and you're gonna want to go back in
the<00:02:29.270> finish<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.600> different<00:02:29.870> way<00:02:29.960> because

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
the finish in a different way because

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.410 
the finish in a different way because
you<00:02:30.380> didn't<00:02:30.620> realize<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.550> could<00:02:31.730> use<00:02:32.000> this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
you didn't realize you could use this

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.090 
you didn't realize you could use this
weapon<00:02:32.870> or<00:02:33.020> this<00:02:33.230> vehicle<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.800> happened<00:02:34.040> to

weapon or this vehicle that happened to

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.320 
weapon or this vehicle that happened to
be<00:02:34.220> near<00:02:34.400> an<00:02:34.459> objective<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:35.150> really

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
be near an objective so it's really

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.479 
be near an objective so it's really

gameplay which an FPS is pretty rare

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.110

because<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.130> lot<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.489> games<00:02:40.700> are<00:02:40.880> very

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340

every<00:02:44.959> time<00:02:47.470> we<00:02:48.470> really<00:02:48.709> like<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.010> allow<00:02:49.190> for

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
huge vehicle battles and just make it

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.920 
huge vehicle battles and just make it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
Western coalition tank it's kind of

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.610 
Western coalition tank it's kind of
lighter<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.330> faster<00:02:56.570> while<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.170> red<00:02:57.380> star

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
on and currently having service what's

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.840 
on and currently having service what's
in<00:03:03.530> coalition<00:03:03.890> has<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.040> javelin<00:03:04.459> rocket

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
in coalition has a javelin rocket

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.540 
in coalition has a javelin rocket
launcher<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:06.530> what<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:06.830> do<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.160> lock<00:03:07.340> in

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
launcher so what you do is you lock in

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.820 
launcher so what you do is you lock in
the<00:03:07.760> actual<00:03:08.120> vehicle<00:03:08.600> they<00:03:08.750> want<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.709> can

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
the actual vehicle they want and you can

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.199 
the actual vehicle they want and you can
shoot<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.489> what<00:03:10.580> I'll<00:03:10.670> do<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:10.940> come<00:03:11.090> on

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
shoot so that it what I'll do is come on

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.250 
shoot so that it what I'll do is come on
a<00:03:11.239> downward<00:03:11.510> trajectory

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
a downward trajectory

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.050 
a downward trajectory
pop<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.800> top<00:03:12.980> up<00:03:13.220> say<00:03:13.370> like<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.670> tank<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.030> goes

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
pop the top up say like the tank it goes

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.699 
pop the top up say like the tank it goes
for<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.360> soft<00:03:14.600> spots<00:03:14.930> on<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.440> western

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
for the soft spots on the western

for the soft spots on the western
coalition<00:03:15.830> side<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.670> first<00:03:16.850> thing<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.209> get

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
coalition side the first thing to get

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.050 
coalition side the first thing to get
they'd<00:03:18.600> launch<00:03:19.160> next<00:03:20.160> upgrade<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:21.030> a

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
they'd launch next upgrade to that is a

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.360 
they'd launch next upgrade to that is a
railgun<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:22.080> red<00:03:22.230> star<00:03:22.470> side<00:03:22.710> we<00:03:23.010> changed<00:03:23.280> up

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
railgun the red star side we changed up

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.280 
railgun the red star side we changed up
a<00:03:23.460> bit<00:03:23.610> we're<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.880> first<00:03:24.030> ones<00:03:24.270> minigun<00:03:24.660> and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
a bit we're the first ones minigun and

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.070 
a bit we're the first ones minigun and
then<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.470> next<00:03:25.680> one<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.040> sentry<00:03:26.400> gun<00:03:26.990> one<00:03:27.990> of

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
then the next one is a sentry gun one of

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.380 
then the next one is a sentry gun one of
the<00:03:28.140> big<00:03:28.380> hits<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.890> game<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.670> recon
