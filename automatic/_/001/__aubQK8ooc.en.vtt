take<00:01:57.039> a<00:01:57.069> look<00:01:57.279> at<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:57.579> so<00:01:58.420> here<00:01:58.659> are<00:01:58.749> the<00:01:58.869> two

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
take a look at that so here are the two

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.719 
take a look at that so here are the two
pieces<00:01:59.229> of<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.649> shell<00:01:59.679> before<00:02:00.039> anyone

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
pieces of the shell before anyone

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.089 
pieces of the shell before anyone
comments<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.389> the<00:02:01.479> notes<00:02:01.719> below<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:02.409> and<00:02:02.649> says

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
comments in the notes below and and says

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:04.739 
comments in the notes below and and says
why<00:02:03.700> didn't<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:03.969> actually<00:02:04.240> take<00:02:04.389> it<00:02:04.509> apart

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
why didn't you actually take it apart

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.779 
why didn't you actually take it apart
and<00:02:04.810> put<00:02:04.929> the<00:02:05.079> iPhone<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:05.439> on<00:02:05.889> camera<00:02:06.399> it's

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
and put the iPhone in on camera it's

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.910 
and put the iPhone in on camera it's
because<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.240> actually<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.779> relatively<00:02:08.470> slow

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
because it actually is a relatively slow

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.000 
because it actually is a relatively slow
process<00:02:09.850> that<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.869> little<00:02:11.380> bit<00:02:11.530> cumbersome

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
process that is a little bit cumbersome

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.339 
process that is a little bit cumbersome
good<00:02:12.940> protection<00:02:13.540> doesn't

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
good protection doesn't

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.099 
good protection doesn't
without<00:02:14.709> some<00:02:15.069> effort<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.969> just<00:02:16.239> it's

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
without some effort and it just it's

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.530 
without some effort and it just it's
really<00:02:17.560> almost<00:02:18.060> impossible<00:02:19.060> for<00:02:19.090> me<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.299> do<00:02:19.450> it

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
really almost impossible for me to do it

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.879 
really almost impossible for me to do it
on<00:02:19.629> camera<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:20.139> a<00:02:20.230> way<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:20.499> doesn't<00:02:20.709> look

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:20.889 
on camera in a way that doesn't look

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.800 
on camera in a way that doesn't look
completely<00:02:21.310> ridiculous<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.120> make<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.659> seem

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
completely ridiculous and make it seem

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.690 
completely ridiculous and make it seem
even<00:02:23.109> more<00:02:23.139> difficult<00:02:23.889> and<00:02:24.040> more<00:02:24.219> challenging

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
even more difficult and more challenging

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.619 
even more difficult and more challenging
than<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:24.879> actually<00:02:25.060> is

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
than it actually is

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.860 
than it actually is
so<00:02:26.079> you<00:02:26.379> have<00:02:26.620> here<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.010> back<00:02:27.579> piece<00:02:27.969> you<00:02:28.659> have

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
so you have here the back piece you have

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.140 
so you have here the back piece you have
a<00:02:28.900> vanity<00:02:29.230> window<00:02:29.620> but<00:02:29.799> it's<00:02:29.920> covered<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.909> do

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
a vanity window but it's covered you do

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.119 
a vanity window but it's covered you do
have<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.870> camera<00:02:32.409> microphone<00:02:32.829> and<00:02:32.950> flash

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
have the camera microphone and flash

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.020 
have the camera microphone and flash
area<00:02:33.519> is<00:02:33.700> open<00:02:34.139> but<00:02:35.139> the<00:02:35.829> vanity<00:02:36.579> window<00:02:36.849> is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
area is open but the vanity window is

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.610 
area is open but the vanity window is
covered<00:02:37.329> which<00:02:37.599> is<00:02:37.750> fine<00:02:38.019> I<00:02:38.049> don't<00:02:38.290> love

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
covered which is fine I don't love

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.159 
covered which is fine I don't love
vanity<00:02:39.010> windows<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.519> leave<00:02:39.760> areas<00:02:40.689> exposed

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.169 
vanity windows that leave areas exposed

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.080 
vanity windows that leave areas exposed
this<00:02:41.680> doesn't<00:02:42.280> because<00:02:42.609> there<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.879> protection

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
this doesn't because there is protection

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.149 
this doesn't because there is protection
over<00:02:43.659> it<00:02:43.780> inside<00:02:44.590> here<00:02:44.769> you<00:02:44.919> have<00:02:45.069> the

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159

OtterBox<00:02:45.519> name<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.879> you<00:02:45.939> can<00:02:46.090> see<00:02:46.269> there's

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
OtterBox name and you can see there's

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.990 
OtterBox name and you can see there's

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
that's part of the protection system for

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.149 
that's part of the protection system for
the<00:02:51.579> iPhone<00:02:52.000> if<00:02:52.419> we<00:02:53.199> look<00:02:53.379> at<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.650> front<00:02:53.919> piece

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
the iPhone if we look at the front piece

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.490 
the iPhone if we look at the front piece
it<00:02:54.790> actually<00:02:54.819> is<00:02:55.299> completely<00:02:55.810> covered<00:02:56.139> even

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
it actually is completely covered even

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.319 
it actually is completely covered even
the<00:02:56.590> home<00:02:56.799> button<00:02:57.099> is<00:02:57.219> covered<00:02:57.609> but<00:02:58.060> it's<00:02:58.239> a

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
the home button is covered but it's a

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.699 
the home button is covered but it's a
different<00:02:58.629> material<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.139> that<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.349> can<00:02:59.530> use

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
different material so that you can use

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.129 
different material so that you can use
touch<00:02:59.919> ID<00:03:00.250> with<00:03:00.699> it<00:03:00.909> but<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.689> do<00:03:01.840> have<00:03:02.019> an

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
touch ID with it but you do have an

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.349 
touch ID with it but you do have an
opening<00:03:02.500> here<00:03:02.709> for<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.949> camera<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:03.639> the

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
opening here for the camera so that the

opening here for the camera so that the
front<00:03:04.959> facing<00:03:05.169> camera<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.680> selfie<00:03:06.129> camera<00:03:06.340> is

not<00:03:07.269> disrupted<00:03:07.840> by<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.739> film<00:03:09.280> over<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:10.290> as<00:03:11.699> you

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:12.699 
not disrupted by the film over it as you

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.339 
not disrupted by the film over it as you
can<00:03:12.939> see<00:03:13.150> there<00:03:13.359> are<00:03:13.510> these<00:03:13.659> little<00:03:13.930> tags

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
can see there are these little tags

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.069 
can see there are these little tags
along<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:15.069> side<00:03:15.340> these<00:03:15.909> are<00:03:15.969> a<00:03:16.150> lock<00:03:16.569> the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
along the side these are a lock the

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.559 
along the side these are a lock the
shell<00:03:17.379> around<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.010> iPhone<00:03:18.159> let's<00:03:19.030> take<00:03:19.359> an

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
shell around the iPhone let's take an

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.039 
shell around the iPhone let's take an
iPhone<00:03:20.019> 6<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.919> pop<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.609> inside<00:03:21.939> so<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.930> iPhone

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
iPhone 6 and pop it inside so the iPhone

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.349 
iPhone 6 and pop it inside so the iPhone
sits<00:03:23.560> nicely<00:03:23.859> right<00:03:24.250> inside<00:03:24.729> and<00:03:24.939> as<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.209> can

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
sits nicely right inside and as you can

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.270 
sits nicely right inside and as you can
see<00:03:25.659> there<00:03:25.900> are<00:03:26.019> cutouts<00:03:26.379> here<00:03:26.620> for<00:03:26.979> the

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
see there are cutouts here for the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.520 
see there are cutouts here for the
volume<00:03:27.639> button<00:03:27.909> the<00:03:28.090> mute<00:03:28.299> toggle<00:03:28.530> everything

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
volume button the mute toggle everything

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.050 
volume button the mute toggle everything
and<00:03:29.709> then<00:03:29.859> you<00:03:29.889> take<00:03:30.129> the<00:03:30.250> front<00:03:30.489> piece<00:03:30.759> of<00:03:30.970> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
and then you take the front piece of the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.819 
and then you take the front piece of the
shell<00:03:31.509> and<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.750> put<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.019> in<00:03:32.109> place<00:03:32.290> let's<00:03:32.650> do

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
shell and you put it in place let's do

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.710 
shell and you put it in place let's do
that<00:03:32.949> right<00:03:33.159> now<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:33.639> it<00:03:34.060> actually<00:03:34.359> went<00:03:34.540> in

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
that right now so it actually went in

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.689 
that right now so it actually went in
fairly<00:03:35.139> easily<00:03:35.409> and<00:03:35.859> once<00:03:36.040> it's<00:03:36.189> inside<00:03:36.489> now

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
fairly easily and once it's inside now

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.670 
fairly easily and once it's inside now
you<00:03:36.729> can<00:03:36.970> see<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.329> you<00:03:37.419> have<00:03:37.569> full<00:03:37.900> access<00:03:38.169> to

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
you can see that you have full access to

speaker the lightning connector and then

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:26.750 
speaker the lightning connector and then
over<00:04:26.469> here

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
over here

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.850 
over here

got the volume up and down and the mute

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.420 
got the volume up and down and the mute
toggle<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:34.290> next<00:04:34.560> step<00:04:34.710> obviously<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:35.220> to

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
toggle the next step obviously is to

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.980 
toggle the next step obviously is to
take<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.730> shell<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.330> put<00:04:36.480> it<00:04:36.570> inside<00:04:36.840> the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
take the shell and to put it inside the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.840 
take the shell and to put it inside the
slipcover<00:04:37.410> we're<00:04:37.920> gonna<00:04:38.010> go<00:04:38.220> off<00:04:38.340> camera<00:04:38.670> for

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
slipcover we're gonna go off camera for

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.360 
slipcover we're gonna go off camera for
a<00:04:38.880> minute<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.210> do<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.540> right<00:04:39.780> now

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
a minute and do that right now

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.550 
a minute and do that right now
so<00:04:41.370> getting<00:04:41.730> the<00:04:41.940> slipcover<00:04:42.390> over<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.320> shell

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
so getting the slipcover over the shell

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.410 
so getting the slipcover over the shell
is<00:04:43.770> as<00:04:43.980> simple<00:04:44.250> as<00:04:44.400> placing<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.940> shell<00:04:45.120> inside

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
is as simple as placing the shell inside

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.810 
is as simple as placing the shell inside
and<00:04:45.660> then<00:04:45.780> slowly<00:04:46.110> working<00:04:46.620> right<00:04:47.160> round<00:04:47.460> the

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
and then slowly working right round the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.460 
and then slowly working right round the
sides<00:04:48.120> here<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.600> just<00:04:48.930> getting<00:04:49.200> everything

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
sides here and just getting everything

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.170 
sides here and just getting everything
in<00:04:49.710> position<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.490> actually<00:04:50.730> goes<00:04:51.030> on

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
in position and it actually goes on

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.180 
in position and it actually goes on
fairly<00:04:51.540> quickly<00:04:51.990> but<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:52.710> do<00:04:52.860> want<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.070> be

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
fairly quickly but you do want to be

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.770 
fairly quickly but you do want to be
thorough<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.790> get<00:04:53.970> everything<00:04:54.420> in

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
thorough so you get everything in

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.560 
thorough so you get everything in
position<00:04:54.960> properly<00:04:55.590> here's<00:04:56.190> why<00:04:56.460> once<00:04:57.330> it's

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
position properly here's why once it's

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.270 
position properly here's why once it's
in<00:04:57.720> place<00:04:57.870> you<00:04:58.200> have<00:04:58.230> this<00:04:58.500> nice<00:04:58.740> protective

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
in place you have this nice protective

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.300 
in place you have this nice protective
soft<00:05:00.000> layer<00:05:00.300> here<00:05:00.780> on<00:05:00.930> this<00:05:01.860> side<00:05:02.100> you<00:05:02.280> have

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
soft layer here on this side you have

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.310 
soft layer here on this side you have
covers<00:05:03.090> over<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.600> volume<00:05:03.990> up<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.260> down

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
covers over the volume up and down

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.230 
covers over the volume up and down
buttons<00:05:04.800> which<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.430> nice<00:05:05.640> because<00:05:05.880> without

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
buttons which is nice because without

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.390

the slipcover on with just the shell

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.040 
the slipcover on with just the shell
it's<00:05:08.700> very<00:05:08.970> difficult<00:05:09.420> to<00:05:09.630> reach<00:05:09.810> them

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
it's very difficult to reach them

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.080 
it's very difficult to reach them
because<00:05:10.140> they're<00:05:10.410> bedded<00:05:10.800> inside<00:05:11.310> now<00:05:12.030> you

from dust it is still difficult to reach

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.990 
from dust it is still difficult to reach
but<00:05:22.830> it's<00:05:22.980> a<00:05:23.070> large<00:05:23.310> enough<00:05:23.520> opening<00:05:23.640> that

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
but it's a large enough opening that

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.420 
but it's a large enough opening that
even<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:24.540> can<00:05:25.140> reach<00:05:25.320> it<00:05:25.500> with<00:05:25.530> my<00:05:25.680> relatively

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
covered but now is much more usable

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.730 
covered but now is much more usable
because<00:05:35.310> it's<00:05:35.670> not<00:05:35.970> recessed<00:05:36.450> inside<00:05:36.750> the

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
because it's not recessed inside the

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.770 
because it's not recessed inside the
shell<00:05:38.040> here<00:05:38.640> on<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.850> bottom<00:05:39.000> you<00:05:39.390> have<00:05:39.420> an

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
opening here for the speaker so it's

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.820 
opening here for the speaker so it's
never<00:05:41.670> covered<00:05:42.120> you<00:05:42.630> do<00:05:42.810> have<00:05:43.020> a<00:05:43.050> cover<00:05:43.470> over

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
never covered you do have a cover over

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.520 
never covered you do have a cover over
the<00:05:44.190> Lightning<00:05:44.610> dock<00:05:44.820> connector<00:05:45.450> so<00:05:46.260> that<00:05:46.410> you

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
the Lightning dock connector so that you

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.070
