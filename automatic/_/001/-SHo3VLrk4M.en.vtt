00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 than itunes before because they are very good 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.040
 good and the last videos of the day already 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.230
 will upload videos today but hey this is 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.900
 important because I believe how they know 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.880
 I say again in today's videos was 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.119
 in the stream of the ones 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.490
 Top developers and johan responding 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.050
 to questions about 0.11 zero point and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.510
 I uploaded the summary that will have it in the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.320
 description and other video as news 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.439
 exclusive that was this one of the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.570
 new developers will be able to find 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.570
 but well I think this video is from 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.730
 the most important news this and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.250
 this johan finally confirmed how it is that 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.649
 the corners will work on me 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.320
 kraft and they said that if definitely 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.570
 is going to be added at 0.12 point zero 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.180
 of that there is no doubt that they said but as 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.100
 I tell them so it does not happen that maybe you can 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.550
 be that it does not happen because they can thus 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.410
 use 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.780
 they may not do it because some 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.789
 unforeseen always at the end there may be 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.710
 unforeseen events did not go away with me 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.040
 what they fuck but well I 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.260
 only what I do without form 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.130
 then guys this has confirmed that 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.780
 the corners for the 0.11 point 0 and 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.580
 also tell them that there will be three 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.980
 forms of progressions who has already 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.380
 configured also by johan the first 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.630
 option is going to be having only the skin 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.370
 of steve or the skin of alix that good if 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.650
 They do not know who Alex is, he's like a 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.600
 character that was implemented got into 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.490
 they thought that minecraft is if not 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.280
 I'm wrong it's like a character from 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.590
 a woman who is also like since 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.450
 it comes in the minecraft but it's a good 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.759
 already typical character that according to is 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.979
 doing as a famous ok they are like 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.600
 let's say this as the characters that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.930
 is the one who describes it the idea would be like 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.590
 the corners by default not ok then the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.000
 second way of putting skin would be 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.800
 uploading a custom file is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.990
 say your own is who created by you 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.670
 which I think is perfect because 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.940
 I believe that most people 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.070
 they have their own skins and he did not say 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.960
 still johan exactly how or 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.550
 where to upload your skin 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.130
 but well, his soon promoted 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.420
 they will say and he did not say if you need a 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.420
 account by dint of the cheese 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.770
 I suppose it's going to be like that because 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.750
 that's how it works what are the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.880
 accounts I started more or less than you have 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.200
 have your mobile account and good 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.300
 that do not have minecraft account and 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.670
 yet why not because it has little to 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.470
 they went to play minecraft and this one 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.510
 soon to open again I guess 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.980
 because when there were the real everything 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.280
 the world had to create its own account 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.739
 with its unique and exclusive name that 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.600
 nobody else could have it then this one 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.180
 if maybe I think that's how it's going to be 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.800
 how they will use the skins and 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.470
 regarding external servers is 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.850
 They said they are not sure how it goes 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.209
 to be that they are going to implement what the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.830
 corner that will have to load it and guys 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.350
 finally tell them that you are also going to 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.049
 Having skin packs is the third way to 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.360
 powers skins have elusive as the 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.000
 xbox and in play this have not said or 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.769
 plans of what kind of skins know who 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.569
 is you there are a lot of skins of several 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.090
 characters from other games of things 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.410
 In fact, there is news that 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.360
 skins were also going to come out of the 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.549
 simpsons but well those are the three 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.010
 ways that there will be now to have 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.689
 skins 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.580
 that the truth is quite enough 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.349
 good come which one you like the most 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.209
 you say that the personalized in 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.500
 my opinion and I hope nothing has 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.959
 liked the last video of today 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.849
 I love you very much and see you in a 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.849
 next video goodbye
