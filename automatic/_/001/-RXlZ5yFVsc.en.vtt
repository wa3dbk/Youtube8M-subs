floral arrangements or whatever you like
this<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:12.450> here<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.660> wired<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.290> doesn't<00:00:13.500> have

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
this one here is wired it doesn't have

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.310 
this one here is wired it doesn't have
to<00:00:13.769> be<00:00:13.889> wired<00:00:14.269> in<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.450> size<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:16.080> can<00:00:16.230> be

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
to be wired in the size it can be

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.810 
to be wired in the size it can be
anything<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:17.039> chose<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.430> because<00:00:17.580> it'd

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
anything I just chose this because it'd

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.660 
anything I just chose this because it'd
be<00:00:17.850> easier<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.449> show<00:00:18.480> ya<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:20.189> start<00:00:20.520> your

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
be easier to show ya so to start your

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.160 
be easier to show ya so to start your
bow<00:00:20.850> what<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.210> want<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.930> want<00:00:22.109> to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
bow what you want to do is you want to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.470 
bow what you want to do is you want to
make<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> loop<00:00:22.650> around<00:00:22.859> your<00:00:23.100> thumb<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:24.210> what

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
make a loop around your thumb and what

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
make a loop around your thumb and what
you'll<00:00:24.630> do<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.960> you'll<00:00:25.080> end<00:00:25.109> up<00:00:25.350> with

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
you'll do is you'll end up with

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.099 
you'll do is you'll end up with
basically<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.279> circle<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.109> when

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
basically just a circle like that when

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.750 
basically just a circle like that when
you<00:00:28.199> get<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.500> circle<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.070> want<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.340> take<00:00:29.550> your

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
you get the circle you want to take your

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.160 
you get the circle you want to take your
tail<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:31.140> want<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.740> twist<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.219> once

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
tail and you want to just twist it once

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.209 
tail and you want to just twist it once
and<00:00:34.170> when<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.380> twist<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.860> want<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> kind

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
and when you twist it you want to kind

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.569 
and when you twist it you want to kind
of<00:00:35.309> bring<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.940> make<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:37.370> make<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.399> all

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
of bring it out and make it make it all

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.139 
of bring it out and make it make it all
pretty<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.649> make<00:00:40.649> your<00:00:40.800> first<00:00:41.010> loop<00:00:41.399> all

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
pretty so you make your first loop all

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.819 
pretty so you make your first loop all
you<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.840> twist<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.440> back<00:00:43.620> again

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
you do is you twist it in the back again

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.950 
you do is you twist it in the back again
and<00:00:44.280> hold<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.760> finger<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:48.149> make

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and hold it with your finger and make

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.540 
and hold it with your finger and make
your<00:00:49.170> second<00:00:49.530> loop<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:51.710> making<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.800> bow<00:00:53.010> really

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
your second loop and making a bow really

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.470 
your second loop and making a bow really
isn't<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.090> difficult<00:00:58.760> what<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> like<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> do

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
isn't that difficult what I like to do

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
isn't that difficult what I like to do
is<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> graduate<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:01.800> loops<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.219> little

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
is I like to graduate my loops a little

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.450 
is I like to graduate my loops a little
bit<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.000> makes<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.300> nicer<00:01:03.600> looking<00:01:03.870> bow

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
bit I think it makes a nicer looking bow

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.890 
bit I think it makes a nicer looking bow
you<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.689> choose

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
you don't have to do that if you choose

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
you don't have to do that if you choose
not<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> again<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.130> kind<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.369> make<00:01:12.210> them

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
not to and again just kind of make them

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.340 
not to and again just kind of make them
different<00:01:13.110> sizes<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.810> take<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
different sizes so you take it to the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.499 
different sizes so you take it to the
back<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.729> pinch<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.810> grab<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
back and you pinch it and you grab it

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.700 
back and you pinch it and you grab it
and<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.630> bow<00:01:21.780> will<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.140> twist<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and your bow will kind of twist up a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.020 
and your bow will kind of twist up a
little<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.280> hold<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> with<00:01:23.820> your

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
little bit but just hold it with your

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.330 
little bit but just hold it with your
other<00:01:24.119> hand<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.689> straighten<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.130> for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
other hand and straighten it out and for

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.740 
other hand and straighten it out and for
this<00:01:29.430> demonstration<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> make

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
this demonstration I'm not going to make

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.870 
this demonstration I'm not going to make
a<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.200> large<00:01:31.409> bow<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
a really large bow because it's just the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.200 
a really large bow because it's just the
same<00:01:33.119> process<00:01:33.360> over<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.170> over<00:01:34.290> again<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.150> you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
same process over and over again so you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.960 
same process over and over again so you
make<00:01:36.479> your<00:01:36.659> loop<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.460> put<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> back

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
make your loop you put it in the back

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.760 
make your loop you put it in the back
you<00:01:39.930> hold<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.979> twist<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
you hold it and you twist it and like I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.160 
you hold it and you twist it and like I
said<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:44.159> ribbon<00:01:44.399> will<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> little<00:01:44.850> bit

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
said your ribbon will get a little bit

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.270 
said your ribbon will get a little bit
tangled<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.229> you're<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:46.979> making

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
tangled because you're you're making

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:56.880 
tangled because you're you're making
loops<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.299> straighten<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> back<00:01:48.869> out

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.560 

so<00:01:57.400> I<00:01:57.490> go<00:01:57.820> ahead<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.150> make<00:01:58.270> another<00:01:58.300> loop

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.469 

and<00:02:03.570> twist<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:08.490> we'll<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.820> do<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.180> last

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
and twist it and we'll just do this last

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.300 
and twist it and we'll just do this last
loop<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:12.440> now<00:02:13.440> when<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.680> have<00:02:13.800> your<00:02:13.860> tail

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
loop here now when you have your tail

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.370 
loop here now when you have your tail
and<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.510> said<00:02:15.570> if<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.840> was<00:02:15.990> going<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.290> an

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
and like I said if I was going to do an

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.990 
and like I said if I was going to do an
actual<00:02:16.680> bow<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> few<00:02:17.490> there'd<00:02:17.700> be<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.850> lot

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
actual bow for a few there'd be a lot

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.850 
actual bow for a few there'd be a lot
more<00:02:18.060> loops<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.530> shows<00:02:19.680> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
more loops to it so this just shows you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.210 
more loops to it so this just shows you
how<00:02:19.890> how<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.460> get<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.910> loops<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:22.040> but<00:02:23.040> once

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
how how to get the loops going but once

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.370 
how how to get the loops going but once
you<00:02:23.400> have<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:23.760> large<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.270> want<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.690> what

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
you have it as large as you want it what

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.660 
you have it as large as you want it what
you<00:02:25.440> want<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> do<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.100> want<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.280> take<00:02:26.460> your

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
you want to do is you want to take your

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.860 
you want to do is you want to take your
tail<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:30.720> little<00:02:31.350> bit<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.760> then<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.420> bring<00:02:33.660> it

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
tail a little bit and then just bring it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.630 
tail a little bit and then just bring it
now<00:02:34.320> this<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.620> going<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.830> be<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.010> actual<00:02:35.160> tail

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
now this is going to be the actual tail

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.190 
now this is going to be the actual tail
so<00:02:35.940> if<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.120> want<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.420> longer<00:02:36.840> you're<00:02:36.990> going<00:02:37.140> to

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
so if you want it longer you're going to

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.440 
so if you want it longer you're going to
have<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.530> make<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.710> longer<00:02:38.150> because<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.300> will

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
have to make it longer because this will

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.640 
have to make it longer because this will
be<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.720> length<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.820> take<00:02:41.820> your<00:02:42.000> other

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
be the length of it take your other

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.280 
be the length of it take your other
ribbon<00:02:43.650> there<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.780> just<00:02:45.810> want<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.200> hold

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
ribbon there and you just want to hold

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.320 
ribbon there and you just want to hold
it<00:02:46.440> there<00:02:46.500> now<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.190> used<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:47.580> pipe<00:02:47.760> cleaner<00:02:48.060> so

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
it there now I used a pipe cleaner so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.610 
it there now I used a pipe cleaner so
that<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.540> guys<00:02:48.660> could<00:02:48.840> see<00:02:49.020> what<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.170> was<00:02:49.200> doing

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
that you guys could see what I was doing

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.010 
that you guys could see what I was doing
but<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.830> can<00:02:49.980> use<00:02:50.100> wire<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.630> use<00:02:51.690> ribbon

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
but you can use wire you can use ribbon

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.990 
but you can use wire you can use ribbon
if<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.380> want<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.620> tie<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.770> with<00:02:52.950> ribbon<00:02:53.370> but

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
if you want to tie it with ribbon but

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.350 
if you want to tie it with ribbon but
you<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.300> put<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.630> through<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.990> actual<00:02:55.350> loop

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
you just put it through the actual loop

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.070 
you just put it through the actual loop
you<00:02:57.360> bring<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.780> through<00:02:59.210> to<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.510> bottom<00:03:00.720> of

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
you bring it through to the bottom of

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.800 
you bring it through to the bottom of
your<00:03:01.230> bow<00:03:01.820> like<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.670> twists

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.890 

and<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:10.080> just<00:03:10.350> take<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> pair<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.830> scissors<00:03:11.900> and

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
and I just take a pair of scissors and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.410 
and I just take a pair of scissors and
cut<00:03:13.110> your<00:03:13.500> ribbon<00:03:16.970> get<00:03:17.970> all<00:03:18.090> done<00:03:18.270> with<00:03:18.390> that

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
cut your ribbon get all done with that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.210 
cut your ribbon get all done with that
and<00:03:18.840> like<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.410> said<00:03:19.590> your<00:03:19.740> ribbons<00:03:20.040> gonna

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
and like I said your ribbons gonna

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.770 
and like I said your ribbons gonna
probably<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.610> more<00:03:20.850> loops<00:03:21.120> than<00:03:21.390> this<00:03:21.540> this

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
probably have more loops than this this

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.809 
probably have more loops than this this
is<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.319> show<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:23.370> all<00:03:23.520> you<00:03:23.640> do

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
is just to show you but then all you do

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:31.160 
is just to show you but then all you do
is<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.270> kind<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:25.790> bring<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.819> out<00:03:30.170> and

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
is you just kind of bring it out and

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.910 
is you just kind of bring it out and
place<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:31.950> how<00:03:32.069> you<00:03:32.130> want<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:34.560> like<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.860> said

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
place it how you want to and like I said

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.340 
place it how you want to and like I said
any<00:03:35.280> size<00:03:35.550> ribbon<00:03:35.940> works<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.480> could<00:03:36.600> be<00:03:36.720> wired

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
any size ribbon works it could be wired

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.930 
any size ribbon works it could be wired
or<00:03:37.650> not<00:03:37.800> wired<00:03:38.069> it<00:03:38.340> doesn't<00:03:38.640> matter

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
or not wired it doesn't matter

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.210 
or not wired it doesn't matter
and<00:03:39.180> then<00:03:39.840> here's<00:03:40.080> your<00:03:40.290> your<00:03:40.620> tails<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.190> a

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
and then here's your your tails and a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.160 
and then here's your your tails and a
lot<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.430> times<00:03:41.580> what<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:41.760> like<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.090> do<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.600> just

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
lot of times what I like to do is just

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.360 
lot of times what I like to do is just
cut<00:03:43.560> them<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:43.769> an<00:03:43.860> angle<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.680> when<00:03:47.130> you're<00:03:47.250> all

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
cut them on an angle and when you're all

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.680 
cut them on an angle and when you're all
done<00:03:49.550> they'll<00:03:50.550> have<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> cute<00:03:51.090> little<00:03:51.180> bow<00:03:51.450> that

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
done they'll have a cute little bow that

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.890 
done they'll have a cute little bow that
you<00:03:51.720> can<00:03:51.989> use<00:03:52.170> for<00:03:52.440> anything<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.860> want
