00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
today I'm driving a world-first the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.230 
today I'm driving a world-first the
world's<00:00:05.460> first<00:00:05.759> diesel<00:00:06.240> electric<00:00:06.779> hybrid<00:00:07.740> car

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
world's first diesel electric hybrid car

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.270 
world's first diesel electric hybrid car
the<00:00:09.240> Peugeot<00:00:09.860> 3008<00:00:11.030> hybrid<00:00:12.030> 4<00:00:12.830> you<00:00:13.830> can<00:00:14.009> see<00:00:14.070> a

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the Peugeot 3008 hybrid 4 you can see a

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.300 
the Peugeot 3008 hybrid 4 you can see a
video<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.089> 3008<00:00:16.010> elsewhere<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
video of the 3008 elsewhere on the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.750 
video of the 3008 elsewhere on the
website<00:00:21.320> what's<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.740> special<00:00:22.890> about<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
website what's really special about the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.060 
website what's really special about the
hybrid<00:00:24.240> 4<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.230> four-wheel<00:00:25.710> drive

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
hybrid 4 is that it's four-wheel drive

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.269 
hybrid 4 is that it's four-wheel drive
it<00:00:26.460> has<00:00:26.820> 200<00:00:27.150> brake<00:00:27.599> horsepower<00:00:28.170> combined<00:00:28.740> so

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it has 200 brake horsepower combined so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.630 
it has 200 brake horsepower combined so
it<00:00:29.429> isn't<00:00:29.789> slow<00:00:30.119> yet<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> emits<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.470> 99<00:00:32.219> g/km

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it isn't slow yet it emits just 99 g/km

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.020 
it isn't slow yet it emits just 99 g/km
co2<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.829> London<00:00:35.280> congestion<00:00:35.579> charge

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
co2 so it's London congestion charge

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.780 
co2 so it's London congestion charge
exempt<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.890> don't<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.460> pay<00:00:38.610> any
