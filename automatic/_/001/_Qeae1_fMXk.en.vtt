00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.530 
in about a month some people sit in
longer<00:01:51.479> than<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.259> me<00:01:53.299> it's<00:01:54.299> just

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
longer than that but for me it's just

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.270 
longer than that but for me it's just
not<00:01:54.720> optimal<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.409> me<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.740> keep<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.070> any<00:01:56.219> longer

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
not optimal for me to keep it any longer

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.090 
not optimal for me to keep it any longer
than<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.729> without<00:01:57.390> redoing<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> do

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
than that without redoing it what I do

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.429 
than that without redoing it what I do
think<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.759> if<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.090> redo<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.659> again<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.350> you
