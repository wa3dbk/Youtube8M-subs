core<00:02:50.540> i3<00:02:50.900> processor<00:02:54.130> how<00:02:55.130> do<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.459> don't<00:02:55.730> want<00:02:55.910> to

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
core i3 processor how do I don't want to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.490 
core i3 processor how do I don't want to
drop<00:02:56.209> this<00:02:56.480> because<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.750> would<00:02:57.019> be<00:02:57.170> really

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
drop this because that would be really

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.250 
drop this because that would be really
bad<00:02:57.860> luck<00:02:58.100> for<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.459> first<00:02:58.700> day<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.989> as<00:03:00.110> you

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
bad luck for the first day and as you

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.289 
bad luck for the first day and as you
can<00:03:00.440> see<00:03:00.820> here<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:03.580> it<00:03:04.580> doesn't<00:03:05.060> have

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
can see here it is and it doesn't have

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.610 
can see here it is and it doesn't have
it<00:03:05.510> has<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:06.110> think<00:03:06.290> an<00:03:06.709> anti-glare<00:03:07.400> screen<00:03:07.549> so

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
it has I think an anti-glare screen so

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.110 
it has I think an anti-glare screen so
you're<00:03:09.620> not<00:03:09.769> even<00:03:10.040> seeing<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.400> reflection<00:03:10.970> of

you're not even seeing the reflection of

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.100 
you're not even seeing the reflection of
the<00:03:11.269> Mac<00:03:12.070> but<00:03:13.070> I<00:03:13.610> can<00:03:13.880> assure<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.870> Mac

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
HDMI but it's the future so I think it's

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.390 
HDMI but it's the future so I think it's
it's<00:06:46.220> good<00:06:46.340> that<00:06:46.490> it<00:06:46.610> has<00:06:46.820> it<00:06:48.040> it's<00:06:49.040> just<00:06:49.250> a

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
the battery life from the reviews are

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.100 
the battery life from the reviews are
like<00:06:54.950> four<00:06:55.550> hours<00:06:56.330> or<00:06:56.750> so<00:06:57.580> let's<00:06:58.580> see<00:06:59.110> what

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
like four hours or so let's see what

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.290 
like four hours or so let's see what
else<00:07:00.200> is<00:07:00.440> there<00:07:00.650> to<00:07:00.830> report<00:07:01.160> on<00:07:01.460> this<00:07:01.640> thing

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
else is there to report on this thing

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.060 
else is there to report on this thing
haven't<00:07:02.930> really<00:07:03.080> perused<00:07:03.590> it<00:07:03.740> for<00:07:03.950> myself

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
haven't really perused it for myself

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.940 
haven't really perused it for myself
this<00:07:04.400> is<00:07:04.610> just<00:07:04.850> from<00:07:05.620> readings<00:07:06.620> that<00:07:06.770> I've

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:06.950 
this is just from readings that I've

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.860 
this is just from readings that I've
done<00:07:07.220> because<00:07:07.520> I<00:07:07.730> always<00:07:08.090> do<00:07:08.300> a<00:07:08.330> time<00:07:08.600> reading

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
done because I always do a time reading

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.170 
done because I always do a time reading
before<00:07:09.200> I<00:07:09.230> spend<00:07:09.710> any<00:07:09.950> money<00:07:10.220> and<00:07:10.900> I<00:07:13.180> guess

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 
before I spend any money and I guess

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.510 
before I spend any money and I guess
that's<00:07:14.420> it<00:07:14.630> so<00:07:14.660> I<00:07:15.260> have<00:07:16.070> to<00:07:16.100> choose<00:07:16.370> the

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 
that's it so I have to choose the

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.130 
that's it so I have to choose the
language<00:07:16.910> and<00:07:17.060> everything<00:07:17.150> like<00:07:17.690> that<00:07:17.750> but

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
language and everything like that but

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.410 
language and everything like that but
it's<00:07:18.680> a<00:07:18.830> really<00:07:18.860> good<00:07:19.130> laptop<00:07:19.550> I'm<00:07:19.730> in<00:07:20.060> love

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:20.420

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 
with a keyboard because it actually

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.260
