down there we have some like sockets so

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.550 
down there we have some like sockets so

we can plug things in if we're outside

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.410 
we can plug things in if we're outside
like<00:01:24.860> it's<00:01:25.400> less<00:01:25.610> summer<00:01:25.850> day<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.210> want<00:01:26.360> to

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
like it's less summer day we want to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.360 
like it's less summer day we want to
listen<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.720> radio<00:01:26.840> something<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.680> then

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
listen to radio something and then

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.550 
listen to radio something and then
anyways<00:01:28.880> also<00:01:29.390> above<00:01:29.840> that<00:01:30.020> is<00:01:30.170> just<00:01:30.409> a

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
anyways also above that is just a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.740 
anyways also above that is just a
horseshoe<00:01:31.159> because<00:01:31.610> I<00:01:31.940> guess<00:01:32.210> it's<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.420> symbol

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
horseshoe because I guess it's a symbol

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.510 
horseshoe because I guess it's a symbol
of<00:01:32.810> good<00:01:32.990> luck<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:33.770> that's<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:33.979> outside<00:01:34.400> of

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
of good luck so that's the outside of
