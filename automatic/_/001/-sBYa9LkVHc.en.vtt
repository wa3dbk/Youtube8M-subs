00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.950
 Oh 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.950
 good sound 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.190
 Yes 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.030
 Yes 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.400
 Yes 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.149
 these are 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.230
 questions for which look 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.270
 Oh 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.570
 No 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.840
 to go 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.189
 Peter B satisfied with the practice match 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.099
 this is according to a whole a whole 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.379
 usable pot in which we put it 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.780
 pretty awkward but we did 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.950
 physically full to the box against a 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.299
 plow what we do not often in the Netherlands 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.709
 will come across I think from the 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.409
 First we don't play one on one so we 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.049
 don't get seconds to finish 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.130
 to take a banana they were on top 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.989
 physically strong team 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.370
 so they had to be full and that 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.019
 are the educational competitions 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.490
 yes was a good match against a public transport 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.979
 team of dick 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.750
 chance that lead only between small 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.120
 bit and she is going a very good team 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.889
 was much would a lot of chances and I'm 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.599
 glad I should be happy right 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.250
 There is team that played on the edge 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.360
 yes but i don't mind 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.280
 You have to wonder if that is in one 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.630
 preparation is good but good we 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.949
 will do this in two weeks in europe 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.970
 may also come across so 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.139
 that's why i can say very educational 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.729
 competition fund 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.699
 then about the red cross that happens 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.080
 there yes vibrations are his nose against me 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.509
 you may also give a tap 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.370
 not then did I give a little after and 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.509
 then my belly hit me and then you 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.650
 my notebook regretted some strength and pry 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.320
 wonder how i would like a little bit 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.710
 puzzling in the back in the center 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.889
 yes we have arnold 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.050
 unfortunately in cancellations 2 days ago 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.490
 which will take a little longer and with the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.530
 Michael will receive a final training 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.320
 knee in his thigh with a 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.669
 action and that is that is just as stiff and the 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.020
 buttocks take no risk so the 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.729
 It is expected that he will be back on Friday 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.330
 can play but not this match and 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.330
 then you have to move something
