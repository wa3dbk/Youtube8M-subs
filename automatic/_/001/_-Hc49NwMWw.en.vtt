to<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:26.310> messy<00:01:26.670> some<00:01:27.659> pipe<00:01:28.259> cleaners

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
to be a little messy some pipe cleaners

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.249 
to be a little messy some pipe cleaners
are<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.210> slightly<00:01:30.540> straighter<00:01:31.020> than

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
are going to be slightly straighter than

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.570 
are going to be slightly straighter than
others<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> some<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.040> them

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
others and some of them

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.970 
others and some of them
curlier<00:01:33.180> than<00:01:33.240> others<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.770> adds

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
curlier than others but I think it adds

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.050 
curlier than others but I think it adds
to<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.340> beautiful<00:01:35.850> wild<00:01:36.780> style<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.250> that's

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
to the beautiful wild style and that's

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.350 
to the beautiful wild style and that's
it<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.290> number<00:01:40.650> two<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.760> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:42.120> do<00:01:42.240> is

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it now for number two what you can do is

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.570 
it now for number two what you can do is
actually<00:01:42.870> separate<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> pipe<00:01:43.830> cleaner<00:01:44.160> curls

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
actually separate the pipe cleaner curls

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.560 
actually separate the pipe cleaner curls
to<00:01:45.150> give<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.720> more<00:01:46.290> fuller<00:01:46.710> look<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.120> it<00:01:48.330> really

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
to give a more fuller look and it really

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.870 
to give a more fuller look and it really
has<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.320> nice<00:01:50.090> nice<00:01:51.320> look<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.620> kind<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.610> looks

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
has a nice nice look to it kind of looks

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.580 
has a nice nice look to it kind of looks
like<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.890> wavy<00:01:55.890> sort<00:01:56.220> of<00:01:56.310> texture<00:01:56.940> so<00:01:57.440> what<00:01:58.440> I'm

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
like a wavy sort of texture so what I'm

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.220 
like a wavy sort of texture so what I'm
doing<00:01:58.620> now<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.160> just<00:01:59.370> basically<00:02:00.230> separating

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
doing now is just basically separating

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:11.000 
doing now is just basically separating
each<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.980> the<00:02:02.640> pipe<00:02:03.570> cleaner<00:02:03.600> girls<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:10.010> I'm

each of the pipe cleaner girls and I'm

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.190 
each of the pipe cleaner girls and I'm
just<00:02:11.250> using<00:02:11.430> my<00:02:11.700> fingers<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:12.510> comb<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.870> all<00:02:12.930> out

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
just using my fingers to comb it all out

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.580 
just using my fingers to comb it all out
as<00:02:13.440> well<00:02:14.070> as<00:02:14.280> separating<00:02:15.180> each<00:02:15.390> one<00:02:15.780> whichever

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
as well as separating each one whichever

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.010 
as well as separating each one whichever
one<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.890> find<00:02:17.310> problems<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.360> separating<00:02:18.900> with

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
one I find problems and separating with
