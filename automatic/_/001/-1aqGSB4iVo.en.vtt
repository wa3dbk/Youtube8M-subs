00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello every account black ops 2 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.809
 the game is not black ops 1 and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.750
 not modern warfare 3 the game is 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.070
 completely different from what I have at first 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.720
 trouble 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.010
 I am a bit better than black ops 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.019
 1 at warfare 3 in the early days 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.480
 but it probably will 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.179
 take some time to be satisfied 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.930
 with my game I multiplayer 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:40.649
 can now recharge at black ops 2 there 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.890
 there are incredibly strong players 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:49.020
 much better than modern warfare 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:55.410
 3 and black ops 1 why it league 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:58.879
 I think this game and the game 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.800
 players who play a lot of competitions 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.070
 Of course they are going public here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.170
 play and we will go and that is 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.189
 clearly 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:15.390
 but what I want to show here is if 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.170
 one thinks one had caught the opponent 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 and still cold his I have 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.390
 also every now and then the feeling in it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.790
 the games I have two days left 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.729
 yelling and over time I have 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.939
 you notice that in better games one man 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.560
 must take as it is 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.780
 but I found something here anyway 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.720
 perhaps it may help to 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.380
 it helps me too i still have to look 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.619
 Enter search here you have the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.100
 Listen but you are on the bottom right 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.700
 you see search settings that's something 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.259
 very interesting I do not know if that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.369
 the game experience will change 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:05.880
 Everyone can try it for themselves here 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.280
 connection steve normal for me that 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.319
 the fastest internet connection 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.050
 Balance between addiction 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.730
 recommended connection quality 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.900
 is ok for me too i have 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.900
 the fastest internet connection 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.260
 So I can not expose anything here but 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.540
 if you go with the left mouse button 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:35.090
 expresses the fact I have arbitrarily here and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:40.950
 Here's the best I ask myself already 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:44.910
 can i achieve something by best if 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.030
 here is the best you are looking to play 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.800
 with the best connection you need 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.150
 to a fast internet connection 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.040
 the addiction can extend 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.489
 So then I think that has too 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.010
 to do with it if I somebody would do that 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.459
 I do not go and do not become so much 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.260
 as if I would adjust because normal 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:13.680
 for my internet connection 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:19.680
 so that was wrong as I had said 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:23.600
 when I played we too four at 67 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:29.750
 and five in these last two days 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:35.459
 and there it was such a group of people 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.890
 group leader and of course not like that 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.320
 a fast internet connection and me 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.310
 came and said and that was perfect 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.670
 wrong to me because I'm the fast one 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.350
 internet connection half i thought so 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.079
 that is similar in structure as in how 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.200
 at modern warfare 3 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:04.010
 because there is the group leader then 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.180
 the internet connection more balanced 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.019
 and I have that too with modern warfare 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.420
 3 noted here, however, it is 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.209
 completely different there I am 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.650
 convinced because we were, I believe 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.489
 fifth to himself and we went to new 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.539
 town 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.440
 okay for me all but me under com 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.710
 thought there 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.180
 it does not work and we became that 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.730
 we will be free for all and 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.720
 effectively we come purely free for everyone 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:44.010
 that means for me that everyone is his 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.560
 own internet connection has it here 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.430
 Everybody should know how to connect 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.740
 Try out what's best for you 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.610
 my board is always very late 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.540
 purely 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:03.630
 it could be that he has advantages 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:07.980
 not only when he comes in, but also 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:13.290
 for his game that works better with him 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.820
 because I suppose if he is against someone 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.300
 he plays a fast 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.660
 has internet connection and he has one 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.160
 slow then it will be more worth it 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.160
 he is popular 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.330
 He is still a great player 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:35.070
 he still has shootouts and stuff like that 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:37.490
 further but it could be that if one 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.490
 here 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.720
 this type 1 connection does that too 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.669
 into the game what comes out I know it 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.850
 not I take it only at 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:56.310
 otherwise would not stay here something standing 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.620
 I will definitely go this 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.530
 Maybe I will always try 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.020
 still the same and I just have to 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.150
 it will only get better with practice 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.230
 exercise exercise again and to it 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:15.960
 get used to the game and of course take it 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:18.020
 I also get certain at three places 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.280
 bring in patches 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.730
 maybe it will be better or worse 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.800
 right and it gets better 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.550
 we will see the game is very much 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.360
 young 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.240
 So I like it because I had to 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.150
 I find it simple to play 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.420
 because I enjoy it when I go and 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.240
 I'm sure it'll upset me 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:45.980
 but now that's it 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.050
 I'll try it too 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.230
 you can try in the notes 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.740
 and with me at pn so private 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:58.100
 Restoring news youtube 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:00.560
 if you notice any changes 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:06.040
 provides in the game experience 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.040
 I wish you a nice and it
