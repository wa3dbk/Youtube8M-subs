00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 someone is putting sandwiches on them 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.640
 someone makes smaller copies of them 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.400
 famous buildings and bridges 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.490
 and some even use them by 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.969
 Destination to remove stuck between 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:22.650
 with food teeth welcome to the factory 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:25.920
 where do modest toothpicks make raw materials for 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.740
 toothpicks the easiest logs much 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.740
 many logs rather birch logs 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.760
 The transformation of the log begins with 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.010
 bark compartments 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.590
 hara is not suitable for making 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.480
 toothpicks but it is not going to waste it 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.710
 sell to the next factory where she 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.710
 used as fuel 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.850
 but 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.910
 polina is machined twice in 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.340
 resulting in a form 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.300
 correct cylinder convenient for 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 further processing 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.120
 special machine unwraps log 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.260
 like a paper scroll at the same time cut 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.050
 and thin layers 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.850
 twelve sharp blades to 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.040
 cut wood with ease blade 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.810
 should be razor sharp in 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.220
 further the same blade will 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.540
 used for cutting 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.540
 of these tapes on a toothpick 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.430
 then the next stage begins 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.430
 processing 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.259
 but 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.920
 ribbons rolled into rolls 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.920
 blanks 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.320
 blanks rolled into strips and rolls 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.150
 manually and charge the machine 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.130
 automatically unwinds rolls 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.570
 cuts stripes on small sticks 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.570
 same size 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.840
 the sticks pour in a continuous stream 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.530
 knives work at tremendous speed for 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:00.610
 minute they descend 2,000 times producing 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:03.640
 8 thousand future toothpicks chopsticks 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.680
 gutters fall into the container at this stage 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.390
 soft wood to harden 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.350
 and and need to dry for 4 hours at a temperature 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.350
 121 degrees Celsius 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.940
 then the toothpicks can be polished 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.040
 rabanne where four hours under the action 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.100
 friction only their surface becomes 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.230
 perfectly smooth from the drum they 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.870
 arrive at a sorting screen which 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.310
 Separates Thomas night about cleaning the rest 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.090
 served in a blower which too 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.090
 separates the enemy 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.590
 blower feeds toothpicks to 2 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.480
 conveyor belt 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.610
 drums to the end of the conveyors 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.390
 distributed by troc on automatic 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.390
 packer 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.730
 machine folds stack 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.489
 then she folds the boxes machine 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.160
 the packer is set up to stack 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.830
 in one short 650 toothpicks and 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.580
 often fills out a thousand one hundred and fifty 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.580
 boxes 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:19.680
 in just an hour the machine packs 747 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.680
 thousand five hundred toothpicks 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.190
 separate operation some toothpicks 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.950
 wraps paper for delivery in 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.440
 restaurants and airline this car 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.720
 wrap 1200 toothpicks a minute 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.140
 cutting and folding paper 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.420
 the performance of this little 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.950
 the factory is just astronomical 20 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.290
 million two hundred seventeen thousand 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.290
 six hundred toothpicks a day
