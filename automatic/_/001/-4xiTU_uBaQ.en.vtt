00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.670
 that's why I have to do something on this myself 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.259

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.269

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.800
 is that berlin that 's giga android me 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.250
 I'm army and that's the android daily 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.050
 what have 23 seventh bit today 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.689
 wall news day today I admit to me 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.070
 but still have four small ones 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.660
 news picked out the hopefully 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.730
 are reasonably interesting for you 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.779
 whatsapp is always interesting use yes 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.840
 we are all terribly agitated 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.920
 to annoy about it is also social 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.300
 culturally meanwhile hard in the criticism 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.430
 Nevertheless, we use it all the whole 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 time continues and whatsapp now has one 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.700
 new update will not get the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.870
 beta but actually the final 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.980
 version if that has not been resolved 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.539
 you can with us the apk 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 Download to manual installation 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.840
 otherwise, just wait a few 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.640
 hour or maximum days then 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.960
 get her also new in this 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.910
 Above all, that version is her individual 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.719
 assign certain ringtones to contacts 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.859
 could or even that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.649
 This can do everything now 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.690
 to be redefined you can also completely 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.220
 mute user for and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.420
 different periods so always for it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.860
 eight hours I think was in it 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.450
 14 days or for a full year 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.799
 if you are just the next year 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.220
 I do not want anything from this person anymore 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.090
 hear 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.590
 I'll be back in a year 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.450
 forget what the bad thing did 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.890
 that can be adjusted 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.570
 something was still so you can 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.740
 complete conversation as unread 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.390
 mark that is we assume 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.860
 Someone writes you crazy 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.330
 many can not respond to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.619
 get anyway much news the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.750
 The bread is meant to sink everything 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.369
 marks the complete conversation as 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.570
 unread the will you then with so 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.770
 a green dot indicates that he 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.780
 Do not forget yourself there again 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 enter and if necessary 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.640
 reply or the user hours 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.700
 So yesterday I put it that way 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.740
 works for sony made because all 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.079
 your devices with android 5.1 as real 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.369
 update all your devices with android 5.1 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.780
 just want to and will be 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.220
 Actually, I could do a second one now 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.020
 hole but who cares a bit 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.210
 redundant that's why I bow to me 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.409
 this time in front of sony who have me 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.969
 already reported a few days ago 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.210
 the match in sweden the next 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.979
 beta test where you somehow 500 or 303 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.509
 Users have the opportunity to enter the new one 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.240
 to try out july want a new one 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.150
 bring new user interface to the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.790
 devices 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.800
 now are first screenshots 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.480
 been officially released by the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.830
 where you now see where that goes and 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.120
 We like the direction in 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.490
 that's the whole thing is very much 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.990
 vanilla finally so oriented 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.250
 The style with Google has before summit 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.500
 android we usually go to the nexus 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.230
 Devices actually find a lot of flat 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.360
 design very tidy looks the same way 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.890
 good as no sony applications are supposed to 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.900
 to be in there on the screens 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.190
 we still have his own music and 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.920
 album and what's new experience 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.380
 application but basically that looks 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.570
 very minimized very easy too 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.340
 material design i like that from us 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.870
 very good and we would be happy if 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.250
 it from them even after this beta test 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.840
 with the feedback of the users that they yes 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.700
 there still want to catch up and eventual 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.260
 Changes then still elegant anyway 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.420
 such a direction goes and we the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.560
 next xperia devices then the us 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.060
 maybe the end of this year or 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.130
 this year or next year then 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.990
 achieve with this chic surface 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.090
 see you and now we have two more 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.100
 devices that are placed on photos are the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.990
 both yes in the next few weeks then 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.640
 to become official one is that 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.640
 Motor 2015 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.180
 This has now been on a photo 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.000
 take pictures 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.400
 and there we see quite a lot 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.840
 details in an ugly room 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.580
 Above all, we see photos taken 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.140
 also a white golden version 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.450
 and it looks really delicious 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.190
 my colleague touran said that 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.420
 If you want he has to bling bling 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.800
 then a bit stop you have to 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.000
 Have a little heart for bling bling 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.860
 but if you have that, then pull that 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.810
 pretty cool and the other one 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.900
 the device is set that is the samsung 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.330
 galaxy s 6 plus where it is this time 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.530
 Well, that looks like expected 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.540
 It looks like a big samsung 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.580
 galaxy s 60 plus this samsung took 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.050
 now we actually see 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.940
 not much new on what we do 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.260
 have presented and also hoped that 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.290
 note 5 by the way, also with the same 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.940
 also put everything as far as expected 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.280
 and we expect these two devices 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.850
 then with a performance in mid-August 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.709
 yes that was this 23 said no now 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.790
 earth-shattering stuff, but just as well 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.610
 There must be days where it is 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.410
 just a little bit shit 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.610
 I almost said small things exist 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.019
 has signs behind me sometime 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.760
 No upheld as we do now 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.380

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.459
