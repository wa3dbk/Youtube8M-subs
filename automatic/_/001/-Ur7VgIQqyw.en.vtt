about a half inch platform still it's a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.969 
about a half inch platform still it's a
nut<00:01:33.689> pitch<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.079> not<00:01:34.229> every<00:01:34.470> lady<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.860> wear

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
nut pitch so not every lady can wear

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.920 
nut pitch so not every lady can wear
these<00:01:35.130> are<00:01:35.250> about<00:01:35.460> three<00:01:35.729> inches<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.509> the
