00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.900
 blog administrator my place games e 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.990
 I'm making this comment for 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.449
 I teach you because I see a lot of 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.119
 People are looking for what they do to get 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.949
 the car of the bosses 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.489
 only remembering that the one that serves only 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.519
 for the computer platform can even 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.010
 It is giving to make the playstation 2 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.809
 but playstation 2 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.809
 always my life was over on the computer 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.930
 or if the platform and if that but 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.660
 this is only for the computer and it is 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:57.010
 exalted as an example here in the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:01:00.879
 sony on the second lap already and his prize 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.149
 It's who you play who played you know that 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:11.170
 The prize for each race is the 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:14.130
 reward then well let's go there he 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 this victory 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.939
 defeated 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.190
 you can choose two sony markers 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.310
 two reward cards which is 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.370
 simply that they are among those three 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.230
 here one of them is the boss's car I know 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.510
 everybody knows 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.460
 It's a lot of people wonder what it's like 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.360
 to get everyone and the like I do the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.230
 next I chose here for example goes 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.740
 choose the first and third in 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.740
 money 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.060
 Beauty, I took the car from her boss. 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.470
 in having here he goes the game goes while saving 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.340
 automatically I'm already correct 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.229
 right 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.940
 It's but if I do not go out with the car that 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.909
 I do I choose that the two is 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.310
 any of them or if they do not leave the 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.670
 car you wanted to do before you hit 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.450
 I go and alt f4 that will close the game 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.550
 and it will not save you give a little 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.160
 work because because you will have 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.590
 who re -enter the game again and 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.450
 to win his race again and thus 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.840
 successively until you exit with the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.940
 car for example if on another time or c 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.160
 for example, I have now chosen the first and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.739
 last time next time you choose the 1st 2nd 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.830
 2nd 3rd and so on 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.100
 the important thing is that you did not leave 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.330
 The car does not work and does not go on. 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.130
 because otherwise you will lose the car 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.200
 so that's the way I always do 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.299
 with all the bosses it 's very hard work 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.700
 but always worth it in the end you 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:01.040
 get there with all the cars to whom 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.299
 I can incidentally is very accessible in the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.430
 laziness right off the bossy cars 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.430
 so everyone who has there I made one 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.109
 printscreen went that way 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.450
 so the tip is a no-brainer 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.200
 doubt who you want you can comment there in the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.079
 post or in the sport that I'm going to create 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.780
 related to this video or post 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.060
 side of the big boss cars 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.859
 so the tip is there for everyone and even the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.070
 next and thanks to whoever visits 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.070
