00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
real long from here to here like a whole

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.929 
real long from here to here like a whole
bunch<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.689> inches<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.160> were<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> grab<00:00:29.550> say<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
bunch of inches if I were to grab say a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.269 
bunch of inches if I were to grab say a
GI<00:00:30.390> Joe<00:00:30.480> figure<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> might<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:31.800> standing

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
GI Joe figure that I might have standing

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.420 
GI Joe figure that I might have standing
nearby<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.880> some<00:00:33.059> reason<00:00:33.420> he's<00:00:34.380> uh<00:00:34.430> he's

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
nearby for some reason he's uh he's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.130 
nearby for some reason he's uh he's
slightly<00:00:35.910> taller<00:00:36.149> than<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.510> GI<00:00:36.719> Joe<00:00:37.110> figure

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
slightly taller than a GI Joe figure

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
slightly taller than a GI Joe figure
that<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.710> standing<00:00:38.280> by<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.760> no

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that I have standing by for no

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.150 
that I have standing by for no
particular<00:00:39.809> reason<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.770> guess<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
particular reason so and I guess that

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.430 
particular reason so and I guess that
makes<00:00:41.370> his<00:00:41.579> what<00:00:42.180> over<00:00:42.540> four<00:00:42.780> inches<00:00:43.020> long<00:00:43.260> is

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
makes his what over four inches long is

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650 
makes his what over four inches long is
that<00:00:43.559> how<00:00:43.680> math<00:00:43.920> works<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.910> looks

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that how math works I think so looks

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
that how math works I think so looks
pretty<00:00:45.870> good<00:00:46.079> from<00:00:46.440> from<00:00:46.890> most<00:00:47.070> angles<00:00:47.280> even

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
pretty good from from most angles even

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.639 
pretty good from from most angles even
from<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> underside<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.840> looks<00:00:48.960> okay<00:00:49.260> because

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
from the underside it looks okay because

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.830 
from the underside it looks okay because
I<00:00:49.950> mean<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.180> his<00:00:51.300> face<00:00:51.539> right<00:00:51.809> there

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I mean you can see his face right there

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470 
I mean you can see his face right there
but<00:00:52.739> his<00:00:52.860> face<00:00:53.070> looks<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.489> odd<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.940> blends<00:00:54.210> in

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
but his face looks so odd it blends in

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.880 
but his face looks so odd it blends in
pretty<00:00:54.629> well<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:55.079> everything<00:00:55.289> else<00:00:55.500> going

like Soundwave this was a robot mode
that<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.890> like<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> deluxe<00:01:59.280> toy<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.240> does<00:02:00.299> a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that I like the deluxe toy that does a

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.810 
that I like the deluxe toy that does a
lot<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.780> work<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.979> thing<00:02:02.040> across<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
lot of work to get this thing across and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.980 
lot of work to get this thing across and
then<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.030> little<00:02:03.210> cyberverse<00:02:03.630> toy<00:02:03.840> just

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
then this little cyberverse toy just

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.780 
then this little cyberverse toy just
shows<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.560> goes<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.770> blah<00:02:05.159> oh<00:02:05.369> look<00:02:05.670> what

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
shows up and goes like blah oh look what

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.510 
shows up and goes like blah oh look what
I<00:02:05.820> did<00:02:06.020> it's<00:02:07.020> pretty<00:02:07.320> good<00:02:07.530> he<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.979> he<00:02:08.399> can

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
I did it's pretty good he can he can

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.309 
I did it's pretty good he can he can
hold<00:02:08.700> his<00:02:08.879> weapon<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.330> his<00:02:09.450> little<00:02:09.660> hands<00:02:10.050> here

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
hold his weapon in his little hands here

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.870 
hold his weapon in his little hands here
I<00:02:10.979> guess<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> little<00:02:11.940> off<00:02:12.239> model<00:02:12.660> that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
I guess that is a little off model that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.480 
I guess that is a little off model that
just<00:02:13.210> fists<00:02:13.720> in<00:02:13.900> Salman<00:02:14.380> fists<00:02:14.740> but<00:02:14.920> little

toy<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.140> pretty<00:02:29.650> good<00:02:29.920> he's<00:02:30.460> got<00:02:30.640> ball

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
toy it's pretty good he's got ball

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.250 
toy it's pretty good he's got ball
jointed<00:02:31.210> shoulders<00:02:31.600> which<00:02:31.810> allow<00:02:32.080> his

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
jointed shoulders which allow his

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.420 
jointed shoulders which allow his
shoulders<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.770> actually<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.130> move<00:02:33.250> forward

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
shoulders to actually just move forward

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.580 
shoulders to actually just move forward
and<00:02:33.640> backwards<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.180> then<00:02:34.300> like<00:02:35.020> this<00:02:35.350> they

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
and backwards and then like this they

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.590 
and backwards and then like this they
don't<00:02:35.770> go<00:02:35.950> well<00:02:36.400> okay<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.150> know<00:02:37.240> what<00:02:37.360> they<00:02:37.480> go

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
don't go well okay you know what they go

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.550 
don't go well okay you know what they go
a<00:02:37.630> little<00:02:37.780> bit<00:02:37.960> outwards

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
a little bit outwards

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.680 
a little bit outwards
that's<00:02:39.220> not<00:02:39.370> bad<00:02:39.580> he's<00:02:39.760> got<00:02:39.910> elbow<00:02:40.240> joints

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
that's not bad he's got elbow joints

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.570 
that's not bad he's got elbow joints
these<00:02:40.840> are<00:02:40.990> kind<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.320> semi<00:02:41.590> D<00:02:41.650> tented<00:02:42.160> hinges

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
these are kind of semi D tented hinges

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.560 
these are kind of semi D tented hinges
with<00:02:43.240> three<00:02:44.020> major<00:02:44.920> points<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.640> detent<00:02:46.420> and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
with three major points of detent and

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.680 
with three major points of detent and
you<00:02:46.810> can<00:02:47.050> kind<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.470> futz<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.460> between<00:02:48.820> the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
you can kind of futz it between the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.880 
you can kind of futz it between the
detents<00:02:50.230> which<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.530> something<00:02:50.740> I<00:02:50.860> really

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
detents which is something I really

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.640 
detents which is something I really
appreciate<00:02:51.600> ball<00:02:52.600> jointed<00:02:52.930> hips<00:02:53.170> would<00:02:53.500> you

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
appreciate ball jointed hips would you

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.830 
appreciate ball jointed hips would you
do<00:02:53.800> all<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.280> hip<00:02:54.460> motions<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.300> then<00:02:55.540> if<00:02:55.750> you

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
do all the hip motions and then if you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.510 
do all the hip motions and then if you
really<00:02:56.110> want<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.530> guess<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:56.920> can<00:02:57.100> say<00:02:57.280> he<00:02:57.310> has

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
really want I guess you can say he has

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.980 
really want I guess you can say he has
ankle<00:02:57.970> joints<00:02:58.300> even<00:02:58.570> though<00:02:58.660> they<00:02:58.840> only

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
ankle joints even though they only

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.290 
ankle joints even though they only
really<00:02:59.320> go<00:02:59.980> primarily<00:03:00.430> in<00:03:00.580> one<00:03:00.790> direction

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
really go primarily in one direction

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.790 
really go primarily in one direction
it's<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:01.900> because<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.380> transformation

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
it's it's because of the transformation

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.820 
it's it's because of the transformation
so<00:03:03.310> if<00:03:04.270> we're<00:03:04.570> gonna<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:05.080> guess<00:03:05.350> lie<00:03:05.770> to

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
so if we're gonna I guess lie to

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.190 
so if we're gonna I guess lie to
ourselves<00:03:06.070> then<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:07.480> know<00:03:07.600> what<00:03:07.810> he's<00:03:07.990> got<00:03:08.170> a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
ourselves then you know what he's got a

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.740 
ourselves then you know what he's got a
poseable<00:03:08.800> spine<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.700> can<00:03:09.910> fold<00:03:10.420> up<00:03:10.570> and

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
poseable spine that can fold up and

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.560 
poseable spine that can fold up and
shoot<00:03:10.990> cannons<00:03:11.380> over<00:03:11.860> his<00:03:12.010> head<00:03:12.190> -<00:03:12.510> how<00:03:13.510> does

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
shoot cannons over his head - how does

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.300 
shoot cannons over his head - how does
it<00:03:13.810> feel<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.290> be<00:03:14.380> on<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.530> receiving<00:03:14.920> end<00:03:15.100> if<00:03:15.280> I

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
it feel to be on the receiving end if I

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.580 
it feel to be on the receiving end if I
had<00:03:15.430> any<00:03:15.550> problems<00:03:15.880> with<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.090> guy<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:17.470> would

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
had any problems with this guy it would

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.040 
had any problems with this guy it would
be<00:03:17.710> that<00:03:17.920> these<00:03:18.100> two<00:03:18.400> blocks<00:03:18.940> here<00:03:19.210> which<00:03:19.390> plug

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
be that these two blocks here which plug

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.110 
be that these two blocks here which plug
up<00:03:20.200> into<00:03:20.440> his<00:03:20.560> shoulders<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.760> complete<00:03:22.030> the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
up into his shoulders to complete the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.690 
up into his shoulders to complete the
transformation<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.870> could<00:03:23.770> have<00:03:23.890> used<00:03:24.220> a

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
transformation I could have used a

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.600 
transformation I could have used a
little<00:03:25.360> bit<00:03:25.450> more<00:03:25.570> click<00:03:26.140> cuz<00:03:26.680> this<00:03:27.160> one<00:03:27.370> as

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
little bit more click cuz this one as

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.130 
little bit more click cuz this one as
you<00:03:27.730> saw<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.060> couple<00:03:28.240> times<00:03:28.540> really<00:03:28.750> likes<00:03:28.990> to

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
you saw a couple times really likes to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.110 
you saw a couple times really likes to
come<00:03:29.320> loose<00:03:29.560> when<00:03:29.740> I'm<00:03:29.860> moving<00:03:30.100> his<00:03:30.250> shoulders

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
come loose when I'm moving his shoulders

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.280 
come loose when I'm moving his shoulders
around<00:03:31.300> there<00:03:31.480> there<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> bit<00:03:31.990> of<00:03:32.080> friction

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
around there there is a bit of friction

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.690 
around there there is a bit of friction
that<00:03:32.470> holds<00:03:32.770> them<00:03:32.890> together<00:03:33.010> but<00:03:33.370> it's<00:03:33.520> not

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
that holds them together but it's not

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.660 
that holds them together but it's not
quite<00:03:33.970> enough<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:35.380> course<00:03:35.920> more<00:03:36.250> pose<00:03:36.400> ability

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
quite enough of course more pose ability
