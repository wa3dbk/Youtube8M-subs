00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
her mind because I think it's a really

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.219 
her mind because I think it's a really
really<00:01:41.520> neat<00:01:41.729> tool<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.299> kids<00:01:42.540> love<00:01:42.810> it

I<00:01:43.259> think<00:01:43.950> remind<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.759> really<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.509> good<00:01:46.049> way<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I think remind is really a good way to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.069 
I think remind is really a good way to
help<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.640> relationship<00:01:48.270> when<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
help with that relationship when you

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319 
help with that relationship when you
think<00:01:49.320> about<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.890> student<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.640> teacher<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
think about the student the teacher and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.880 
think about the student the teacher and
the<00:01:51.420> parent<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.140> could<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.380> viewed<00:01:52.560> more<00:01:52.829> as

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the parent if it could be viewed more as

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.910 
the parent if it could be viewed more as
a<00:01:53.009> team<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.759> think<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> does<00:01:55.110> make<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> huge

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
a team I think it does make a huge

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.760 
a team I think it does make a huge
difference<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.939> every<00:01:57.630> student<00:01:58.170> had<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
difference if every student had that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.109 
difference if every student had that
kind<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.369> situation<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.540> sky's<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.869> limit

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.649 

yeah<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.150> do<00:02:07.299> actually<00:02:07.600> sounds<00:02:08.020> like<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.140> comment
