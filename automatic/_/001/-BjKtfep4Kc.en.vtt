 I have a famous manufacturer for equipment , but the low vibration from Ms. Mizusaku

 There is such a sound and it gets stuck 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.430
 I tried to open Nagao 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.530
 I was able to do something like this because the magnet and the part of the voice collided 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.450
 If you add a little hey 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.450
 I 'll be quiet 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.950
 I will buy it already and it will be fine. 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:36.060
 I tried to buy it by saying I could change it to something else. 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:38.310
 It's originally a small version of people called sstp 7 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.390
 Yes 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.930
 Yes the content is a simple body and instructions 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.180
 It will be more than Anou 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.220
 Please note I did not write the tube 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.340
 Yes Well it is in this way 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.140
 Yes line up 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:01.120
 sspp 2 s to reflect 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.720
 There are 3 types of 3s and long s. It is this ace you are using now, but feather 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.399
 There is no big type 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.740
 Yes to a different say using it is here now, it is here a 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.570
 Jar that 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.160
 But in a quantity adjustment can you I'm a little It is turning the dial hard but the form of air 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.600
 I will not stay 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:25.330
 Yes this mixes 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.500
 The fit size of the water tank is 60 s and it is suitable for 45 or 60 yen cistern 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.810
 Because it is written 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:37.000
 What I'm using now is such a person, but I use 60 cm with this 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.590
 Tamer There is no problem in particular. This is because I use another pump. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.750
 If it's just your heart , it's just that rice 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.720
 It is said that it is this 3 s that I think 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.920
 Yes Well it is in this way 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.989
 Power consumption has risen a little and the maximum number 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.239
 The amount of air coming out is also up with 2000 c to 2500 c. 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.380
 It's worth it 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:05.490
 Electricity fee is also about 10 yen a month 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:10.600
 If it is 60 yen with use pa for one month long 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.440
 I think that whether it is fluffy Tara garbled in the morning or 60 yen 10 yen 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.590
 Yes 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:20.150

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.720
 Power consumption 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.440
 It is supposed to be referred to as par of course 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.310
 I would like to change 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.310

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.010
 It now runs for more than Yes 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:29.560

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.669
 It is today that it is yes 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:38.810
