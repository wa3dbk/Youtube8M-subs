hi<00:00:00.989> Sandra<00:00:01.469> here's<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.370> video<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:02.939> what<00:00:03.090> I

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hi Sandra here's a video of what I

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.150 
hi Sandra here's a video of what I
figured<00:00:03.240> out<00:00:03.659> with<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.200> mystery<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.710> the

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
figured out with the mystery of the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.020 
figured out with the mystery of the
letter<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.870> number<00:00:07.290> nine<00:00:07.820> carrying<00:00:08.820> on

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
letter I and the number nine carrying on

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.480 
letter I and the number nine carrying on
looking<00:00:09.510> at<00:00:09.630> these<00:00:09.809> two<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.410> seen<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> few<00:00:11.280> more

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
looking at these two I seen a few more

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.799 
looking at these two I seen a few more
things<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.059> wanted<00:00:12.420> me<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.570> make<00:00:12.750> a

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
things that you wanted me to make a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.259 
things that you wanted me to make a
video<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.469> could<00:00:13.590> show<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.670> here<00:00:14.700> we<00:00:15.089> go

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
video so I could show you so here we go

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.540 
video so I could show you so here we go
but<00:00:15.929> I'm<00:00:16.049> gonna<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> little<00:00:16.740> recap<00:00:17.250> about

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
but I'm gonna do a little recap about

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.370 
but I'm gonna do a little recap about
what<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.210> figured<00:00:18.420> out<00:00:18.690> about<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.140> letter<00:00:19.230> I

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
what we figured out about the letter I

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.130 
what we figured out about the letter I
and<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.949> number<00:00:20.220> nine<00:00:20.400> first<00:00:20.789> first<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.990> all

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and the number nine first first of all

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.820 
and the number nine first first of all
the<00:00:22.560> letter<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.039> equals<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.600> ninth<00:00:24.960> letter<00:00:25.500> in

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the letter I equals the ninth letter in

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.220 
the letter I equals the ninth letter in
our<00:00:26.130> alphabet<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.660> knew<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:27.960> was

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
our alphabet and we knew that was

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.950 
our alphabet and we knew that was
significant<00:00:29.010> because<00:00:29.730> 9<00:00:30.210> always<00:00:30.660> wants<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
significant because 9 always wants to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.260 
significant because 9 always wants to
mirror<00:00:31.380> itself<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.460> when<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.730> looked<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
mirror itself so when we looked at the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.900 
mirror itself so when we looked at the
letter<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:34.110> realized<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.010> letter<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.370> could

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
letter I we realized the letter I could

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.590 
letter I we realized the letter I could
be<00:00:36.030> represented<00:00:36.780> as<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> word<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:38.030> then<00:00:39.030> we

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
be represented as the word I then we

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.270 
be represented as the word I then we
realized<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.500> could<00:00:40.710> mirror<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.219> Eve<00:00:41.879> y<00:00:42.719> e

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
realized we could mirror it Eve y e

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.600 
realized we could mirror it Eve y e
there's<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.370> perfect<00:00:44.969> mirror<00:00:45.590> now<00:00:46.590> 9<00:00:46.860> was

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
there's a perfect mirror now 9 was

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
there's a perfect mirror now 9 was
involved<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.390> because<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.870> letter<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.170> is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
involved in this because the letter I is

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.130 
involved in this because the letter I is
a<00:00:49.469> ninth<00:00:49.770> letter<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.789> kept<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> we

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
a ninth letter so we kept going and we

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.610 
a ninth letter so we kept going and we
looked<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> word<00:00:52.920> 9<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:54.719> realized<00:00:55.230> if

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
looked at the word 9 and we realized if

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.819 
looked at the word 9 and we realized if
we<00:00:56.190> took<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.670> e<00:00:56.699> off<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> end<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.199> would<00:00:58.500> spell

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
we took the e off the end it would spell

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.920 
we took the e off the end it would spell
nin<00:00:59.190> which<00:00:59.760> didn't<00:01:00.059> make<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> lot<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.449> sense<00:01:00.690> at

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
nin which didn't make a lot of sense at

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.640 
nin which didn't make a lot of sense at
first<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.980> then<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.550> realized<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.750> could<00:01:03.989> put

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
first but then we realized we could put

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.539 
first but then we realized we could put
in<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.220> word<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.619> it<00:01:07.619> would<00:01:07.830> spell<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
in the word I and it would spell and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
in the word I and it would spell and
sound<00:01:09.150> out<00:01:09.510> 9<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.369> found<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.240> mirror<00:01:12.630> n<00:01:12.780> e

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
sound out 9 then we found the mirror n e

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.840 
sound out 9 then we found the mirror n e
y<00:01:14.520> e<00:01:15.110> n<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> again<00:01:17.630> there's<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.990> number<00:01:19.380> 9

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
y e n so again there's the number 9

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.030 
y e n so again there's the number 9
always<00:01:20.850> mirroring<00:01:21.330> itself<00:01:21.780> even<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.770> our

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
always mirroring itself even in our

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.300 
always mirroring itself even in our
alphabet<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:24.000> found<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.450> mirror<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.680> after

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
alphabet we found a mirror then after

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
alphabet we found a mirror then after
that<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.729> went<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.259> found

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
that I went on and this is what I found

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.960 
that I went on and this is what I found
next<00:01:30.049> we<00:01:31.049> decided<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.860> ahead<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.460> decode

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
next we decided to go ahead and decode

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.660 
next we decided to go ahead and decode
our<00:01:33.270> alphabet<00:01:33.869> A<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:35.070> Z<00:01:35.100> which<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:35.970> 1<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:37.200> 26<00:01:37.799> we

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
our alphabet A to Z which is 1 to 26 we

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
our alphabet A to Z which is 1 to 26 we
casted<00:01:39.180> out<00:01:39.270> nines<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.170> left<00:01:40.380> this

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
casted out nines and it left this

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.999 
casted out nines and it left this
pattern<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.280> numbers<00:01:41.720> then<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.990> realized<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
pattern of numbers then I realized it

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.950 
pattern of numbers then I realized it
had<00:01:44.280> something<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.390> word<00:01:45.600> 9

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
had something to do with the word 9

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.440 
had something to do with the word 9
again<00:01:46.740> always<00:01:47.040> wanting<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.729> mirror<00:01:48.119> itself

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
again always wanting to mirror itself

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.480 
again always wanting to mirror itself
and<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.409> did<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.890> using<00:01:50.490> our<00:01:50.700> alphabet<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.509> well

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
and it did so using our alphabet as well

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.760 
and it did so using our alphabet as well
after<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.610> decoded<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.329> cast<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.350> out<00:01:55.439> nines

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
after we decoded and cast it out nines

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.039 
after we decoded and cast it out nines
in<00:01:55.979> our<00:01:56.159> alphabet<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:57.000> looked<00:01:57.750> at<00:01:57.899> these

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
in our alphabet I looked at these

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.429 
in our alphabet I looked at these
letters<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.799> realized<00:01:59.340> that<00:02:00.119> n<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:01.380> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
letters and I realized that n was a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.179 
letters and I realized that n was a
fight

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
fight

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:10.639 
fight
e<00:02:02.780> was<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> 5<00:02:04.820> y<00:02:05.820> was<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> 7<00:02:07.170> e<00:02:07.580> was<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> 5<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.360> n<00:02:10.050> was

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
e was a 5 y was a 7 e was a 5 and n was

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.040 
e was a 5 y was a 7 e was a 5 and n was
applied<00:02:11.009> now<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.209> see<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.569> mirror<00:02:12.810> on

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
applied now we can see the mirror on

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.770 
applied now we can see the mirror on
either<00:02:13.200> side

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
either side

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.680 
either side
but<00:02:14.319> where's<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.770> nine<00:02:14.980> well<00:02:15.910> here<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.420> comes

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
but where's the nine well here it comes

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.920 
but where's the nine well here it comes
five<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.890> five<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.459> 10<00:02:19.060> which<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.720> 1<00:02:20.130> plus<00:02:21.130> 7<00:02:22.030> 5

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
five and five is 10 which is 1 plus 7 5

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.430 
five and five is 10 which is 1 plus 7 5
5<00:02:23.350> is<00:02:23.590> 10<00:02:23.860> plus<00:02:24.240> 1<00:02:25.410> equal<00:02:26.410> 9<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:28.270> 9<00:02:28.300> not<00:02:29.080> only

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
5 is 10 plus 1 equal 9 so 9 not only

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.880 
5 is 10 plus 1 equal 9 so 9 not only
mirrored<00:02:29.890> itself<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.520> our<00:02:30.670> alphabet<00:02:30.880> numbers

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
mirrored itself in our alphabet numbers

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.940 
mirrored itself in our alphabet numbers
it<00:02:32.890> also<00:02:33.569> mirrored<00:02:34.569> itself<00:02:34.959> with<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.620> number

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
it also mirrored itself with the number

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.699 
it also mirrored itself with the number
9<00:02:36.160> because<00:02:37.000> we<00:02:37.330> decoded<00:02:37.750> our<00:02:37.989> alphabet

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
9 because we decoded our alphabet

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.640 
9 because we decoded our alphabet
we<00:02:39.190> come<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.550> with<00:02:39.790> these<00:02:40.000> letters<00:02:40.650> equaling

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
we come up with these letters equaling

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.370 
we come up with these letters equaling
these<00:02:41.890> numbers<00:02:42.400> adding<00:02:43.270> them<00:02:43.420> up<00:02:43.569> equal<00:02:44.230> the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
these numbers adding them up equal the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.160 
these numbers adding them up equal the
number<00:02:44.560> 9<00:02:44.920> again<00:02:45.910> she'll<00:02:46.420> never<00:02:46.570> be<00:02:46.840> undone

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
number 9 again she'll never be undone

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.860 
number 9 again she'll never be undone
she's<00:02:47.590> always<00:02:47.860> gonna<00:02:48.190> mirror<00:02:48.550> herself<00:02:49.060> even

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
she's always gonna mirror herself even

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.350 
she's always gonna mirror herself even
in<00:02:50.050> our<00:02:50.260> alphabet<00:02:50.560> she'll<00:02:51.130> do<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.489> but<00:02:52.180> after

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
in our alphabet she'll do it but after

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.390 
in our alphabet she'll do it but after
looking<00:02:52.690> at<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.410> went<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.860> little<00:02:53.890> farther

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
looking at this I went a little farther

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.810 
looking at this I went a little farther
Sandra<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.480> what<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.690> see<00:02:56.019> next

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
Sandra and this is what I see next

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.430 
Sandra and this is what I see next
this<00:02:57.820> is<00:02:57.970> Marcos<00:02:58.390> pattern<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.110> it's<00:02:59.230> very

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
this is Marcos pattern and it's very

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.440 
this is Marcos pattern and it's very
significant<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.550> way<00:03:00.670> he<00:03:00.850> numbered<00:03:01.300> it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
significant in the way he numbered it

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.040 
significant in the way he numbered it
because<00:03:02.380> 9<00:03:02.940> sitting<00:03:03.940> at<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.180> top<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.720> always

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
because 9 sitting at the top is always

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.040 
because 9 sitting at the top is always
doubling<00:03:05.739> on<00:03:05.920> each<00:03:06.670> side<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.360> doubling

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
doubling on each side of it doubling

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.800 
doubling on each side of it doubling
negative<00:03:08.500> positive<00:03:08.709> positive<00:03:09.069> negative<00:03:09.810> so

negative positive positive negative so

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.699

he<00:03:11.530> numbered<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.040> one<00:03:12.510> doubled<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.660> 2<00:03:13.959> 2

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
he numbered it one doubled is 2 2

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.750 
he numbered it one doubled is 2 2
doubled<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.370> 4<00:03:15.790> or<00:03:16.330> doubled<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:17.140> 8<00:03:17.440> 8<00:03:18.100> double<00:03:18.640> to

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
doubled is 4 or doubled is 8 8 double to

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
7 7 doubled is 5 now let's break that

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.020 
7 7 doubled is 5 now let's break that
down<00:03:22.630> for<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.200> little<00:03:23.440> bit<00:03:23.620> here<00:03:23.860> Sandra<00:03:24.250> 1

down for you a little bit here Sandra 1
doubled<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.720> 2<00:03:25.989> 2<00:03:26.410> doubled<00:03:26.829> is<00:03:26.950> 4<00:03:27.220> or<00:03:27.519> doubled

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
doubled is 2 2 doubled is 4 or doubled

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.890 
doubled is 2 2 doubled is 4 or doubled
is<00:03:28.239> 8<00:03:28.420> but<00:03:29.260> why<00:03:29.470> is<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.680> 1/7<00:03:30.340> well<00:03:30.970> 8<00:03:31.269> doubled

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
is 8 but why is that 1/7 well 8 doubled

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
is 8 but why is that 1/7 well 8 doubled
is<00:03:32.079> 16<00:03:32.769> 6<00:03:33.549> &amp;<00:03:33.790> 1<00:03:33.820> equals<00:03:34.720> 7<00:03:35.140> so<00:03:35.350> 7<00:03:36.190> double<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.360> 14<00:03:38.170> 1

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
is 16 6 &amp; 1 equals 7 so 7 double is 14 1

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.490 
is 16 6 &amp; 1 equals 7 so 7 double is 14 1
in<00:03:39.280> 4<00:03:39.640> equals<00:03:40.360> 5<00:03:40.630> now<00:03:41.500> 5<00:03:41.530> double<00:03:42.340> 5<00:03:42.910> &amp;<00:03:43.090> 5<00:03:43.299> is<00:03:43.630> 10

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
in 4 equals 5 now 5 double 5 &amp; 5 is 10

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.390 
in 4 equals 5 now 5 double 5 &amp; 5 is 10
which<00:03:45.310> casting<00:03:45.880> out<00:03:46.000> nines<00:03:46.079> equals<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.470> 1<00:03:47.680> so

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
which casting out nines equals the 1 so

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.490 
which casting out nines equals the 1 so
there<00:03:48.670> those<00:03:49.060> numbers<00:03:49.359> are<00:03:49.690> casting<00:03:50.350> out

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
there those numbers are casting out

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.410 
there those numbers are casting out
nines<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:51.100> that's<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.430> very<00:03:51.640> specific<00:03:51.880> pattern

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
nines and that's a very specific pattern

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.690 
nines and that's a very specific pattern
that<00:03:52.780> Marco<00:03:53.109> came<00:03:53.320> up<00:03:53.500> with<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:54.340> if<00:03:54.609> you

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
that Marco came up with that if you

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.370 
that Marco came up with that if you
follow<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.450> just<00:03:55.660> keeps<00:03:55.810> going<00:03:56.049> on<00:03:56.320> and

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
follow it it just keeps going on and

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.130 
follow it it just keeps going on and
getting<00:03:56.769> deeper<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.160> deeper<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.850> deeper<00:03:58.140> but

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
getting deeper and deeper and deeper but

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.860 
getting deeper and deeper and deeper but
I<00:03:59.440> took<00:03:59.709> it<00:04:00.040> back<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.370> our<00:04:00.670> word<00:04:00.970> number<00:04:01.390> 9<00:04:01.600> and

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
I took it back to our word number 9 and

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.190 
I took it back to our word number 9 and
this<00:04:02.079> is<00:04:02.230> what<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.440> found<00:04:02.769> I<00:04:03.930> looked<00:04:04.930> at<00:04:05.079> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
this is what I found I looked at the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.979 
this is what I found I looked at the
word<00:04:05.440> 9<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:06.700> was<00:04:06.850> mirroring<00:04:07.299> itself<00:04:07.720> and

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
word 9 that was mirroring itself and

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.099 
word 9 that was mirroring itself and
also<00:04:08.620> equal<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.400> number<00:04:09.730> 9<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.359> then<00:04:10.989> I

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
also equal to number 9 and then I

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.680 
also equal to number 9 and then I
realized<00:04:11.680> there<00:04:12.430> was<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.670> certain<00:04:13.090> amount<00:04:13.570> of

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
realized there was a certain amount of

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.560 
realized there was a certain amount of
intersects<00:04:14.410> in<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:15.130> word<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.700> when<00:04:16.539> I

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
intersects in the word and when I

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.250 
intersects in the word and when I
numbered<00:04:17.140> them<00:04:17.320> well<00:04:17.890> not<00:04:18.880> surprising<00:04:19.720> they

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
numbered them well not surprising they

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.029 
numbered them well not surprising they
numbered<00:04:20.769> out<00:04:20.979> what<00:04:21.909> Roman<00:04:22.570> put<00:04:23.140> down<00:04:23.380> for<00:04:23.860> his

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
numbered out what Roman put down for his

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.580 
numbered out what Roman put down for his
numbers<00:04:24.490> on<00:04:24.729> his<00:04:24.970> symbol<00:04:25.479> I<00:04:25.860> started<00:04:26.860> here<00:04:27.220> and

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
numbers on his symbol I started here and

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.400 
numbers on his symbol I started here and
I<00:04:27.620> went<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.340> first<00:04:28.370> number<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.180> one<00:04:29.900> doubled

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
I went the first number is one doubled

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.689 
I went the first number is one doubled
is<00:04:30.560> two<00:04:31.120> two<00:04:32.120> doubles<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.750> four<00:04:33.320> four<00:04:34.250> doubled

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
is two two doubles is four four doubled

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.469 
is two two doubles is four four doubled
is<00:04:34.910> eight<00:04:35.210> eight<00:04:36.080> doubled<00:04:36.680> is<00:04:36.860> seven<00:04:37.520> seven

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
is eight eight doubled is seven seven

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.469 
is eight eight doubled is seven seven
doubled<00:04:38.840> is<00:04:39.080> five<00:04:39.500> then<00:04:40.460> we<00:04:40.669> had<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.060> three

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
doubled is five then we had the three

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.629 
doubled is five then we had the three
and<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:42.440> six<00:04:42.740> in<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.639> middle<00:04:44.410> now<00:04:45.410> here's<00:04:46.370> the

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
and a six in the middle now here's the

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.140 
and a six in the middle now here's the
mirror

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
mirror

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:58.110 
mirror
we<00:04:47.930> have<00:04:48.139> eight<00:04:51.130> seven<00:04:53.110> five<00:04:54.850> one<00:04:56.470> two<00:04:57.470> and

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
we have eight seven five one two and

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.409 
we have eight seven five one two and
four<00:04:59.120> so<00:04:59.710> there<00:05:00.710> is<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:01.100> same<00:05:01.460> numbers<00:05:01.940> that

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
four so there is the same numbers that

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.379 
four so there is the same numbers that
Marco<00:05:02.840> uses<00:05:03.320> in<00:05:03.530> his<00:05:03.740> pattern<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.400> when<00:05:05.180> we

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
Marco uses in his pattern and when we

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.600 
Marco uses in his pattern and when we
look<00:05:05.630> if<00:05:05.900> we<00:05:05.960> overlap<00:05:06.590> they're<00:05:07.070> all<00:05:07.280> going<00:05:07.520> to

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
look if we overlap they're all going to

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.379 
look if we overlap they're all going to
equal<00:05:07.970> nine<00:05:08.180> a<00:05:08.419> perfect<00:05:08.900> mirror<00:05:09.139> 8<00:05:09.440> +<00:05:09.800> 1<00:05:09.950> is<00:05:10.100> 9<00:05:10.389> 1

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
equal nine a perfect mirror 8 + 1 is 9 1

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.480 
equal nine a perfect mirror 8 + 1 is 9 1
+<00:05:11.570> 8<00:05:11.690> is<00:05:11.720> 9<00:05:12.130> 7<00:05:13.130> +<00:05:13.280> 2<00:05:13.340> is<00:05:13.700> 9<00:05:13.970> 7<00:05:14.690> +<00:05:14.870> 2<00:05:14.900> is<00:05:15.169> 9<00:05:15.380> or<00:05:15.710> in<00:05:16.220> 5

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
+ 8 is 9 7 + 2 is 9 7 + 2 is 9 or in 5

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.290 
+ 8 is 9 7 + 2 is 9 7 + 2 is 9 or in 5
is<00:05:16.669> 9<00:05:16.910> 5<00:05:17.750> +<00:05:18.020> 4<00:05:18.229> is<00:05:18.350> 9<00:05:18.560> so<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:19.430> found<00:05:19.789> that<00:05:19.940> really

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
is 9 5 + 4 is 9 so I found that really

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.540 
is 9 5 + 4 is 9 so I found that really
remarkable<00:05:21.110> that<00:05:21.680> this<00:05:21.979> word<00:05:22.280> would

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
remarkable that this word would

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.480 
remarkable that this word would
intersect<00:05:23.240> in<00:05:23.539> just<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.500> right<00:05:24.740> amount<00:05:25.310> of

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
intersect in just the right amount of

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.300 
intersect in just the right amount of
numbers<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.600> would<00:05:26.870> come<00:05:27.050> out<00:05:27.229> and<00:05:27.470> equal

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
numbers that would come out and equal

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.879 
numbers that would come out and equal
Marko's<00:05:28.910> numbers<00:05:29.330> in<00:05:29.539> his<00:05:29.750> pattern<00:05:30.229> there's

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
Marko's numbers in his pattern there's

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.159 
Marko's numbers in his pattern there's
the<00:05:31.160> 3<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:31.729> there<00:05:31.910> is<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.180> sex<00:05:32.479> and<00:05:32.780> of<00:05:32.870> course

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
the 3 and there is the sex and of course

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.890 
the 3 and there is the sex and of course
there<00:05:33.830> is<00:05:33.860> a<00:05:34.190> 9<00:05:34.430> /<00:05:34.970> seeing<00:05:35.300> at<00:05:35.479> all

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
there is a 9 / seeing at all

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.020 
there is a 9 / seeing at all
so<00:05:36.500> there<00:05:36.800> you<00:05:36.830> go<00:05:36.979> Sandra<00:05:37.580> that<00:05:37.729> was<00:05:37.850> pretty
