00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.790 
that
the<00:02:09.130> next<00:02:09.399> season<00:02:09.759> they<00:02:10.420> had<00:02:10.569> sort<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.929> won

their<00:02:12.040> test<00:02:12.310> case<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.730> guess<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.480> next

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
their test case I guess so the next

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.020 
their test case I guess so the next
season<00:02:14.080> was<00:02:14.739> sort<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.099> a<00:02:15.220> strange<00:02:17.280> hybrid<00:02:18.280> that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
season was sort of a strange hybrid that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.650 
season was sort of a strange hybrid that
they<00:02:19.209> weren't<00:02:19.420> all<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.940> know<00:02:22.030> satirical

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
they weren't all you know satirical

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.480 
they weren't all you know satirical
shows<00:02:22.870> they<00:02:23.050> weren't<00:02:23.290> all<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:24.040> know<00:02:24.100> making

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
shows they weren't all you know making

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.280 
shows they weren't all you know making
fun<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.700> something<00:02:25.030> or<00:02:25.300> or<00:02:25.450> making<00:02:25.840> comedy

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
fun of something or or making comedy

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.780 
fun of something or or making comedy
sorts<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.040> shows

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
sorts of shows

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.490 
sorts of shows
but<00:02:27.969> all<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.269> transitions<00:02:28.840> were<00:02:28.959> scatters

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
but all the transitions were scatters

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.929 
but all the transitions were scatters
and<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:31.590> then<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.709> just<00:02:32.739> evolved<00:02:33.549> from<00:02:33.700> there

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
and so then it just evolved from there
