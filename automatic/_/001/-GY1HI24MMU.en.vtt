installment<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.590> will<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.950> comparing<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
installment I will be comparing the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.850 
installment I will be comparing the
multirotors<00:00:12.210> boot<00:00:12.420> up<00:00:12.540> times<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.200> acquired

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
multirotors boot up times and acquired

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.460 
multirotors boot up times and acquired
satellites<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.759> time<00:00:14.969> frame<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.599> motor

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
satellites in that time frame the motor

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.570 
satellites in that time frame the motor
startup<00:00:17.070> times

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
startup times

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.880 
startup times
flight<00:00:18.180> times<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.810> flight<00:00:19.470> characteristics

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
flight times and flight characteristics

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.300 
flight times and flight characteristics
and<00:00:20.550> also<00:00:21.180> both<00:00:21.720> multirotors<00:00:22.619> manual

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and also both multirotors manual

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.099 
and also both multirotors manual
landings<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.330> let's<00:00:24.510> jump<00:00:24.720> right<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
landings so let's jump right in and

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.429 
landings so let's jump right in and
start<00:00:25.320> by<00:00:25.590> powering<00:00:25.980> up<00:00:26.220> both<00:00:26.490> quads<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.439> as

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
start by powering up both quads and as

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.130 
start by powering up both quads and as
we<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.769> see<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.460> Q<00:00:29.699> 500<00:00:30.269> plus<00:00:30.480> gained<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.990> lot

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
we can see the Q 500 plus gained a lot

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.350 
we can see the Q 500 plus gained a lot
more<00:00:31.170> satellites<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.309> solo<00:00:32.730> by<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> time

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
more satellites in a solo by the time

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.900 
more satellites in a solo by the time
the<00:00:33.540> quads<00:00:33.780> were<00:00:34.079> ready<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.500> lift<00:00:34.680> off<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.700> Q

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the quads were ready to lift off the Q

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.479 
the quads were ready to lift off the Q
500<00:00:36.540> had<00:00:36.690> 19<00:00:37.140> satellites<00:00:37.739> locked<00:00:38.040> in

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
500 had 19 satellites locked in

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.670 
500 had 19 satellites locked in
while<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> solo<00:00:39.210> had<00:00:39.390> 13<00:00:39.870> satellites<00:00:40.410> locked

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
while the solo had 13 satellites locked

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.280 
while the solo had 13 satellites locked
in<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> Q<00:00:41.879> 500<00:00:42.450> definitely<00:00:42.930> won<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
in so the Q 500 definitely won the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.010 
in so the Q 500 definitely won the
satellite<00:00:43.770> lock<00:00:44.010> contest<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.600> proceed<00:00:45.989> on

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
satellite lock contest so we proceed on

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.959 
satellite lock contest so we proceed on
to<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> next<00:00:46.680> comparison<00:00:47.309> which<00:00:47.789> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
to the next comparison which is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.819 
to the next comparison which is
initializing<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> motors<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.530> did<00:00:49.710> this

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
initializing the motors and we did this

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.100 
initializing the motors and we did this
test<00:00:50.129> twice<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:50.969> positive<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
test twice just to be positive on the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.990 
test twice just to be positive on the
first<00:00:52.350> attempt<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.920> pushed<00:00:53.280> both<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> start

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
first attempt I pushed both the start

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.810 
first attempt I pushed both the start
button<00:00:54.289> simultaneously<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.829> Q<00:00:56.039> 500<00:00:56.610> plus

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
button simultaneously and the Q 500 plus

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.360 
button simultaneously and the Q 500 plus
motors<00:00:57.210> kicked<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.660> first<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> second

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
motors kicked on first so on the second

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.310 
motors kicked on first so on the second
attempt<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.940> pushed<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> start<00:01:00.629> motors<00:01:00.989> button

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
attempt I pushed the start motors button

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.470 
attempt I pushed the start motors button
first<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> solo<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.879> second<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
first on the solo about a second and a

started<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> motors<00:01:09.330> first<00:01:09.600> oh<00:01:11.930> you<00:01:12.930> started

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
started the motors first oh you started

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.530 
started the motors first oh you started
before<00:01:13.350> me<00:01:13.560> hey<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.790> still<00:01:15.119> started

cute 500-plus and the solos response
times<00:01:29.590> on<00:01:29.860> full<00:01:30.070> throttle<00:01:30.100> takeoff<00:01:30.820> are

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
times on full throttle takeoff are

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.120 
times on full throttle takeoff are
pretty<00:01:31.270> much<00:01:31.420> identical<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:32.230> as<00:01:32.680> far<00:01:32.890> as<00:01:32.950> the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
pretty much identical and as far as the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.010 
pretty much identical and as far as the
flight<00:01:33.370> characteristics<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:34.450> solo<00:01:34.810> is<00:01:34.990> a

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
flight characteristics the solo is a

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.650 
flight characteristics the solo is a
much<00:01:35.410> better<00:01:35.680> aircraft<00:01:36.370> in<00:01:36.550> my<00:01:36.790> opinion<00:01:37.330> not

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
much better aircraft in my opinion not

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.840 
much better aircraft in my opinion not
to<00:01:37.720> say<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.140> Q<00:01:38.320> 500<00:01:38.890> plus<00:01:39.070> isn't<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.640> good

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
to say the Q 500 plus isn't a good

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.390 
to say the Q 500 plus isn't a good
stable<00:01:40.180> platform<00:01:40.540> for<00:01:40.930> film<00:01:41.380> but<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.980> solos

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
stable platform for film but the solos

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.940 
stable platform for film but the solos
tight<00:01:42.820> sharp<00:01:43.480> maneuverability<00:01:44.440> right<00:01:44.770> out<00:01:44.920> of

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
tight sharp maneuverability right out of

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.160 
tight sharp maneuverability right out of
the<00:01:45.220> box<00:01:45.430> makes<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.120> uniques<00:01:46.510> rabid<00:01:46.990> mole

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
the box makes the uniques rabid mole

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.900 
the box makes the uniques rabid mole
take<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.500> backseat<00:01:48.040> to<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.370> smart<00:01:48.670> drone

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
take a backseat to the smart drone

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.719 
take a backseat to the smart drone
standards<00:01:49.540> so<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.500> solo<00:01:50.740> is<00:01:51.040> definitely<00:01:51.580> the

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
standards so the solo is definitely the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.060 
standards so the solo is definitely the
better<00:01:51.880> flyer<00:01:52.300> hands<00:01:52.720> down<00:01:53.020> in<00:01:53.290> my<00:01:53.590> opinion

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
better flyer hands down in my opinion

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.969 
better flyer hands down in my opinion
now<00:01:54.790> with<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.119> flight<00:01:55.360> time<00:01:55.630> comparison<00:01:56.350> let

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
now with the flight time comparison let

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.920 
now with the flight time comparison let
me<00:01:57.070> just<00:01:57.310> note<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:58.030> batteries<00:01:58.450> on<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.690> solo

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
me just note the batteries on the solo

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.590 
me just note the batteries on the solo
are<00:01:59.170> brand-new<00:01:59.740> while<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.460> Q<00:02:00.670> 500<00:02:01.210> plus<00:02:01.390> has

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
are brand-new while the Q 500 plus has

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.900 
are brand-new while the Q 500 plus has
at<00:02:01.780> least<00:02:01.930> 60<00:02:02.470> plus<00:02:02.710> flights<00:02:03.040> on<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:03.880> I

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
at least 60 plus flights on it so I

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.940 
at least 60 plus flights on it so I
believe<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.630> solo<00:02:04.869> should<00:02:05.259> provide<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.650> little

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
believe the solo should provide a little

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.699 
believe the solo should provide a little
more<00:02:06.250> punch<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.790> discharge<00:02:07.750> just<00:02:08.320> a<00:02:08.440> tad<00:02:08.679> bit

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
more punch and discharge just a tad bit

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.380 
more punch and discharge just a tad bit
slower<00:02:09.280> than<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.610> used<00:02:09.880> battery

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
slower than a used battery

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.690 
slower than a used battery
well<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.350> solo<00:02:11.590> had<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.980> land<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.459> have<00:02:12.580> his

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
well the solo had to land and have his

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.820 
well the solo had to land and have his
battery<00:02:13.030> changed<00:02:13.540> while<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.780> Q<00:02:14.050> 500<00:02:14.620> plus

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
battery changed while the Q 500 plus

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.460 
battery changed while the Q 500 plus
landed<00:02:15.400> remain<00:02:15.970> done<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.600> took<00:02:16.930> back<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.320> the

skies while still on the first battery

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.080 
skies while still on the first battery
pack<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.440> Q<00:02:20.650> 500<00:02:21.250> plus<00:02:21.430> was<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> winner<00:02:21.970> of

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
pack so the Q 500 plus was the winner of

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.540

left to spare so the Q 500 plus really

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.040 
left to spare so the Q 500 plus really
really<00:02:39.519> won<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.880> flight<00:02:40.120> time<00:02:40.360> challenge<00:02:40.840> I

really won the flight time challenge I

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.540 
really won the flight time challenge I

both the Q 500 plus and the solo descend

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.430 
both the Q 500 plus and the solo descend
at<00:02:51.160> about<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.549> same<00:02:51.760> rate<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.570> solos<00:02:52.959> descent

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
at about the same rate the solos descent

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.770 
at about the same rate the solos descent
is<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.799> a<00:02:53.830> bit<00:02:54.310> more<00:02:54.610> stable<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.299> efficient

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
is it a bit more stable and efficient

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.039 
is it a bit more stable and efficient
and<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.739> landing<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.340> solo<00:02:57.670> is

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
and the landing of the solo is

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.210 
and the landing of the solo is
reminiscent<00:02:59.049> of<00:02:59.140> watching<00:02:59.530> an<00:02:59.650> Olympian

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
reminiscent of watching an Olympian

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.110 
reminiscent of watching an Olympian
stick<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.700> perfect<00:03:01.090> landing<00:03:01.540> every<00:03:02.440> time

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
stick the perfect landing every time

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.420 
stick the perfect landing every time
while<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.299> Q<00:03:04.510> 500<00:03:05.170> plus<00:03:05.440> tends<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:06.010> jump<00:03:06.250> and

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
while the Q 500 plus tends to jump and

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.039 
while the Q 500 plus tends to jump and
bounce<00:03:06.549> up<00:03:06.820> and<00:03:06.940> down<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.209> good<00:03:07.510> three<00:03:07.810> times

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
bounce up and down a good three times

before<00:03:08.620> finally<00:03:08.890> settling<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.090> believe

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
before finally settling in I believe

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.270 
before finally settling in I believe
this<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.840> due<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.440> landing<00:03:11.830> gear<00:03:12.010> which

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
this is due to the landing gear which

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.030 
this is due to the landing gear which
has<00:03:12.489> four<00:03:12.880> points<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:13.840> really<00:03:14.200> only<00:03:14.410> two<00:03:14.739> legs

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
has four points but really only two legs

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.300 
has four points but really only two legs
while<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.880> solo<00:03:16.299> has<00:03:16.540> four<00:03:16.900> true<00:03:17.350> legs<00:03:17.650> which

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
while the solo has four true legs which

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.100 
while the solo has four true legs which
means<00:03:18.580> four<00:03:18.880> separate<00:03:19.360> landing<00:03:19.750> points

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
means four separate landing points

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.840 
means four separate landing points
making<00:03:20.470> contact<00:03:20.980> with<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.190> surface

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
making contact with the surface

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.270 
making contact with the surface
absorbing<00:03:22.660> more<00:03:22.900> shock<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.500> truly<00:03:23.830> planting

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
absorbing more shock and truly planting

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.490 
absorbing more shock and truly planting
its<00:03:24.430> feet<00:03:24.700> as<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.269> solo<00:03:25.510> meets<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.080> ground

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
its feet as the solo meets the ground

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.699 
its feet as the solo meets the ground
so<00:03:26.920> overall<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.730> Q<00:03:27.910> 500<00:03:28.480> plus<00:03:28.720> wins<00:03:29.470> on
