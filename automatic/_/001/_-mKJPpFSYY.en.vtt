00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:09.990
 today we are here in kitchen what is in 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.240
 the case today because I have prepared a 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.370
 personal invention, specifically a rice 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.470
 sweet protein calling it a recipe 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.990
 ready to drink well chilled by 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.640
 a little routine routine high and for 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.410
 course the indispensable amount of 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.869
 carbohydrates that we provide with rice 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.670
 that is to say that I lived rather what is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.380
 what you face all those who 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.939
 we train or also that we want 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.949
 take care or already the thing that there are others that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.140
 you usually eat the typical rice menu and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.750
 chicken to be able to change and eat rice 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.270
 in a different appetizing fresh way 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.129
 and he was holding his protest so the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.520
 truth is that you have no excuse for not 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.520
 prepare it in fact is otherwise 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.520
 we started 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.110
 the ingredients to prepare this 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.940
 recipe are clear egg rice in this 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.820
 case is long rice although personally 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.700
 I really like the rozas madrid 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.310
 cinnamon sweetener so come on we have 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.750
 these prepared ingredients we are going to 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.940
 This first of all have to do anything 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.710
 more than preparing boiled rice and for 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.540
 it simply with the bid and 100 grams 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.470
 It will even be more than enough to 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.470
 do the contractions 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.390
 well now that we have the rice 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.550
 individual we simply have to catch 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.830
 a vessel which is the same blend 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.720
 and from which we will eat this grace 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.909
 protein and how we have served 100 grams 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.860
 in crude here we have 300 grams 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.320
 in the team video demonstrating the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.320
 triple and we will put 100 grams 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.520
 and then remove 100 milliliters 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.520
 of egg white inside the glass 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.750
 and finally we will find it 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.290
 approximately 5 milliliters of 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.290
 agreement 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.450
 and now that we have the mixture made 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.830
 you simply will take the cup 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.140
 we will introduce inside microwaves 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.869
 for about 22 minutes and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.700
 medium to a power of 500 watts and 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.009
 when we start to see that the glass 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.510
 begins to be white and that the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.239
 part of top starts to be a little 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.459
 durita simply with a spoon what 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.959
 we will remove it we will mix it and we will put it 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.090
 to the fridge but to make it more 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.739
 of course we are going to it and so you can see how 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.330
 is done and we will introduce it 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.100
 microwave for two minutes 30 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.010
 minutes to a power as has been said 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.540
 of 500 radios it is important to check 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.130
 that when you're doing it is not 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.660
 late more to right as it will be clear 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.130
 that also in the compact what 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.260
 we will get the texture that I am 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.239
 looking and with which I want you to 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.720
 come out the concentration is so over 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.720
 the minute and a half 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.659
 and if we see that it is still too 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.659
 liquid relax a little more 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.420
 same now that it has already sounded 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.800
 we will remove with care because the glass 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.800
 It is burning because it is crystal 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.780
 and we will have to check very seriously 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.460
 well that the superior state what is 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.040
 can see in the egg white is from 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.340
 this way that is compact because with 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.480
 ease the spoon can sink well 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.240
 that now that we have managed to have 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.080
 In this way we will simply do as 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.080
 if the owner 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.360
 and good once they are well mixed 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 comes the hardest part for the and 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.440
 It's quite like when he plays with him and 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.540
 is to leave it in the fridge approximately 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.090
 between an hour or two hours until 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.170
 is really cold and then it will be 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.620
 the time to eat it 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.420
 but until then there waiting 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.420
 and well it's been two hours 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.040
 As you can see here I have three 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.660
 rations and one of them I've put in 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.660
 this bowl so you can see 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.370
 how is the visual effect once 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.989
 prepared now simply the truth is 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.150
 to tell you that simply in writing 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.209
 that will be asked once he picked up the glass 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.000
 since the desire to eat it but for 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.040
 a touch at the end of the cinnamon 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.400
 lead a simply a little bit by 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.400
 over 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.930
 and bring the pots 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.490
 and a family here you have a recipe 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.259
 innovative fresh and which I hope that 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.449
 try and dislike me in the end below 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.189
