00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.320
 warning the following video can 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:07.630
 contain too many spoilers if not 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.309
 you follow the series at the bottom of the letter 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.320
 that I recommend you at least have 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.800
 seen the fifth season and what's going on 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.800
 the sixth 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.410
 for those who have not had the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.390
 opportunity to see the two chapters with 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.539
 that starts the sixth season that is to say 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.250
 wake up and escape the citadel I leave you 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.860
 a link to facebook here below in the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.140
 description of the video all the credits 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.330
 and thanks goes to picayo as well 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.150
 for giving us the opportunity to see these 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.500
 two chapters subtitled and the best of 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.500
 all in hd 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.140
 we want the one who recovers the arm 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.140
 we want the end to recover arms 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.530
 good good good good good let me 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.610
 tell them that their wish came true 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.860
 because if I recover so his arm 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.690
 schümann keys mo severe hard nothing more and 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.720
 nothing less than three and a half episodes 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.720
 something that I personally did not like 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.030
 since almost the beginning of the series 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.950
 pendleton guard and adam moto gave us 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.500
 many signals on the arm define 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.420
 too many episodes such as end the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.490
 human in which final terno has its 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.020
 metallic arm and it actually 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.899
 He knows why he lost his arm 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.390
 original also as shown in the 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.670
 trunk in which I who refer to the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.560
 first predecessor of end does not have its 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.049
 arm because his parents did 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.159
 the abominable exchange of the arm of his 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.840
 daughter for a crazy computer not and then 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.330
 we found out he was in the plans 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.429
 it depends electro the guard take away his arm 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.649
 so as happens in the second 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.790
 episode of the sixth season escape from 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.740
 the Citadel 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.140
 what I want to achieve with this 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.680
 I just explained is here I was in the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.940
 destiny that I lost my arm 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.800
 let's leave out the script 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.320
 let's leave the directors let's leave 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.290
 outside, everyone was in the destination 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.090
 of the plot of the story of what purpose 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.770
 lost was his arm 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.810
 curiously choco and alternate end lack 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.000
 of his right arm and I that's why I 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.180
 I was waiting for him to lose his arm 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.180
 straight 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.340
 on the net and most of all on youtube 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.230
 round a theory that talks about the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.350
 destiny of each one of the inhabitants 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.570
 of the kingdom of the USA since it does not matter that 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.240
 happen or what event the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.160
 timeline will always happen what 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.810
 it has to happen 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.330
 it may sound stupid and at the same time 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.150
 weird something like that it did not matter the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.060
 desire to end the list always existed in 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.870
 another way but it did exist and the big bomb 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.210
 despite the sacrifice of simón petric or 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.090
 burst 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.610
 what it gives us to understand that 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.640
 it does not matter if it happens or that it changes 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.620
 there are simply things that will happen as 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.350
 we can see it now with the end arm 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.960
 that I had to lose it and how can we 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.220
 to see with choco that he lost it but that 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.220
 final he recovered 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.340
 talking about arms and end there are 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.739
 some curiosities about the line of 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.739
 end time end fin and chocked 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.010
 in the same place where I as r is the 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.870
 same place where end and jake lives 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.120
 confirmed in the trunk episode about 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.799
 it also said that right there is the 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.810
 house where you live alternate end with your 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.329
 family and that the people and 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.569
 villagers there and the market and all 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:46.850
 that civilization is actually the kingdom 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.010
 from the USA only that alternate 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.920
 and all the villagers I'm really 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.110
 the sweet people without mutating because we can 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.960
 appreciate reached March in alternate the 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.560
 March Chango 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.470
 something very interesting that happens here is 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.780
 that according to the future of each end the arm 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.120
 changes many people say that the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.860
 same arm that has yoko who gave it 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.440
 in the sweet princess before she 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.870
 skip the fallout is the same 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.790
 of alternate end but they are wrong 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.550
 or who knows 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.620
 we must also discuss a topic that 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:26.980
 has ultimately generated much controversy 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.980
 and it's about the father of late martini 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.179
 it is affirmed by prism that in peace rest 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.550
 that to be imprisoned in the 

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:42.099
 Citadel glass should commit 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.220
 a cosmic crime something that leaves us 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.110
 very large doubt 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.080
 apparently we have to wait for a good 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.150
 while to realize this more 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.860
 or less a few episodes or else 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.860
 a whole season 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.960
 the whereabouts of the 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.419
 mother destiny my little theory is that 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.430
 the current end mother if she resided in the 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.280
 castle where they go in the episode of 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.770
 chills why the choco ghost 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.139
 I was looking for an end there since I felt a 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.629
 small connection mother and son already what 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.759
 better the end mother was someone of vital 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.819
 importance in the cosmos as well as 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:23.370
 priism was a master of the wishes what 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:26.009
 what I want to say with all this is that what 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.259
 better the father of end martín murdered to 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.180
 his wife becoming this in a 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.529
 cosmic crime and when I was about 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.210
 to capture it 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.430
 martín left abandoned so that 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.139
 later it was found by the 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.259
 Jake's parents 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:42.740
 with this this is just a theory I do not know 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:45.139
 take it so thoroughly 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.150
 it is a possibility since until the 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:51.169
 moment nothing is known about the mother of 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.270
 finn and this makes the series more intriguing 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.550
 apparently now of adventure has been 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.650
 become a series exclusively 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:02.409
 for the faithful followers of it and 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.409
 therefore it is much better and more complex 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.880
 and dan and jacques already have their page in 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.220
 facebook you have an obligation 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.699
 moral to give him I like it if every day 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.300
 I grow more and more and if the video was of his 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.639
 liking 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.500
 if they learned something if they spurred something 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.870
 I do not hesitate to like the video 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.460
 do not hesitate to subscribe to my channel 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.139
 If you want to follow my videos and contributions 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.240
 you have to wait until the new ones 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.160
 episodes to get more theories 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.430
 meanwhile enjoy those that have 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.430
 see you until next time and goodbye
