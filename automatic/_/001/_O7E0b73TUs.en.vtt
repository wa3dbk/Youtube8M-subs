00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.869 
potatoes that seems kind of superfluous
to<00:02:40.239> me<00:02:40.480> in<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:41.349> recipe<00:02:41.769> that's<00:02:41.799> full<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.280> sour

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
to me in a recipe that's full of sour

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.410 
to me in a recipe that's full of sour
cream<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:44.489> cream<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.640> chicken<00:02:45.670> soup<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.299> I'm

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
cream and cream of chicken soup so I'm

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.520 
cream and cream of chicken soup so I'm
just<00:02:46.569> going<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.750> put<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:46.989> half<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.500> amount

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
just going to put in half that amount

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.630 
just going to put in half that amount
reduces<00:02:48.629> guess<00:02:49.629> it<00:02:49.750> actually<00:02:50.170> acts<00:02:50.379> as<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.739> and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
reduces guess it actually acts as a and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.110 
reduces guess it actually acts as a and
lube<00:02:51.910> or<00:02:52.450> emulsifier<00:02:53.440> or<00:02:53.739> something<00:02:54.099> it's<00:02:54.940> not

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
lube or emulsifier or something it's not

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.660 
lube or emulsifier or something it's not
so<00:02:55.329> heavy<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.930> sticky<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.950> butter<00:02:57.160> thins<00:02:57.519> it

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
so heavy and sticky the butter thins it

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.690 
so heavy and sticky the butter thins it
out<00:02:57.790> makes<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.180> lighter<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:59.530> mix<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.400> up<00:03:00.459> and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
out makes it lighter so mix that up and

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.920 
out makes it lighter so mix that up and
then<00:03:00.790> I'm<00:03:00.910> going<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.060> fold<00:03:01.239> in<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.739> potatoes

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
then I'm going to fold in the potatoes

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.259 
then I'm going to fold in the potatoes
alright<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.140> we<00:03:05.290> got<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:06.000> casserole<00:03:07.000> dish

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
alright so we got it in a casserole dish

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.670 
alright so we got it in a casserole dish
in<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.510> case<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.720> roasting<00:03:08.140> pan<00:03:08.170> since<00:03:08.590> a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
in this case a roasting pan since a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.460 
in this case a roasting pan since a
triple<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.099> recipe<00:03:09.599> 9<00:03:10.599> by<00:03:10.720> 13<00:03:11.079> would<00:03:11.260> be<00:03:11.349> good

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
triple the recipe 9 by 13 would be good

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.440 
triple the recipe 9 by 13 would be good
for<00:03:11.620> their<00:03:11.739> original<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.209> can<00:03:13.329> either

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
for their original and you can either

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.690 
for their original and you can either
use<00:03:14.069> cheese<00:03:15.069> on<00:03:15.250> top<00:03:15.459> or<00:03:15.930> some<00:03:16.930> people<00:03:17.019> do

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.440 

crushed<00:03:21.700> up<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.970> thao<00:03:22.150> chip<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.790> I'm<00:03:25.239> going

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
crushed up the thao chip but I'm going

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.390 
crushed up the thao chip but I'm going
to<00:03:25.510> do<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.690> little<00:03:25.900> bit<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.230> cheese<00:03:28.889> and<00:03:29.889> by<00:03:30.370> a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
to do a little bit of cheese and by a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.690 
to do a little bit of cheese and by a
little<00:03:30.579> i<00:03:30.790> mean<00:03:30.940> substantial<00:03:31.209> amount<00:03:32.700> and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
little i mean substantial amount and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.970 
little i mean substantial amount and
some<00:03:34.480> cornflakes<00:03:35.169> with<00:03:37.500> some<00:03:38.500> butter<00:03:38.680> mixed

some cornflakes with some butter mixed

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.240 
some cornflakes with some butter mixed
in<00:03:39.810> that's<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.049> way<00:03:41.139> my<00:03:41.349> mom<00:03:41.590> did<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:41.919> and<00:03:42.099> is

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
in that's the way my mom did it and is

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.720 
in that's the way my mom did it and is
therefore<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.819> only<00:03:43.090> correct<00:03:43.359> method<00:03:44.730> and

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
therefore the only correct method and

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.339 
therefore the only correct method and
then<00:03:45.819> this<00:03:45.940> goes<00:03:46.150> in<00:03:46.329> a<00:03:46.450> 350<00:03:47.200> oven<00:03:47.970> for<00:03:48.970> about

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
then this goes in a 350 oven for about

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.809 
then this goes in a 350 oven for about
45<00:03:50.349> minutes<00:03:50.530> or<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:50.859> or<00:03:51.040> half<00:03:51.340> an<00:03:51.430> hour<00:03:51.549> watch

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
45 minutes or so or half an hour watch

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.270 
45 minutes or so or half an hour watch
the<00:03:52.060> top<00:03:52.209> make<00:03:52.389> sure<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.630> get<00:03:52.870> burned<00:03:53.790> but
