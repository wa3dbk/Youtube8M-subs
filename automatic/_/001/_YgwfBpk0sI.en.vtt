00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
is this install button now when you you

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.160 
is this install button now when you you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
want to just click on it and it will say

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.359 
want to just click on it and it will say
it's<00:00:22.710> quite<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> lot<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> megabytes<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:25.369> it

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
it's quite a lot of megabytes so it

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.700 
it's quite a lot of megabytes so it
doesn't<00:00:26.699> really<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.029> much<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.900> if

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
doesn't really do that much but if

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.170 
doesn't really do that much but if
you're<00:00:29.029> um<00:00:30.230> it<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:32.009> does<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> tiny<00:00:32.489> bit<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.030> it

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
you're um it just does a tiny bit so it

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.330 
you're um it just does a tiny bit so it
might<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.440> all<00:00:34.530> about<00:00:34.559> feelings

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
