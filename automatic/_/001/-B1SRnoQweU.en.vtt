00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 ajax last week you were furious for the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.340
 camera to the failure for you if 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.670
 player is today yes you can only 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.580
 keeps laying more but I think it was 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.320
 we rightly got one last week 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.930
 very poor performance 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
 and I think you can do a bad thing 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.289
 I want to play football, but that's one 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.369
 team cooperating well i thought we were there 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.769
 the start of the competition is not that whole 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.800
 a lot of improvement in showing something 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.940
 not enough for my taste 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.690
 he is in the course of the first half 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 that succeeded and and the second half 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 started to look better what that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.090
 regards yes of course there was today 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.329
 but such a difficult match 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.910
 nec yes did not seem to dare especially 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.960
 in an offensive sense that he well in that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.969
 At the beginning I thought that was a bit too 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.510
 hear it 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.340
 played little forward and it looked 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.690
 what long-winded out 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.820
 He must also remember that it 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.750
 pretty good so it stood out 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.309
 agreed 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.739
 PSV is very difficult to be patient with 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.690
 get busy and if you get nothing 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.710
 away but the king had just 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.570
 briefly in 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.130
 then it is difficult for a team to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.590
 to get out of debt and in particular 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.840
 the position play of the van psv was whole 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.310
 lots of writing in the back and at the moment you 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.110
 then try to give it a try 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.190
 a game the they may 30 30 meters back 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.990
 on the keeper 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.869
 this keeper who gets confused by it 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.179
 Playback ball that is two legged and then 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.560
 then you can get very bad pressure on it 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.119
 an opponent 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.319
 so you have to be patient and the right one 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.590
 wait a moment 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:41.429
 well i thought it was going better pico 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.840
 from yes except of course their picture 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.610
 yes here natural first exchanged 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.200
 for still and for leroy joyce for girls 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.369
 that coach of that so 11 grams 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.049
 because, for example, no series can 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.319
 it well i liked that share 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.239
 Leroy became smaller and smaller 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.190
 had been crazy just before he went off 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:00.869
 he a great action where the you the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.290
 ball just beside the lap 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.060
 those are things 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.450
 that belong to his functioning 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.280
 making offensive runs and thereof 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.060
 that we just a little too little 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.400
 all in all saw a level capable 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.100
 at a trailer today psv alex either 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.780
 a bit about the 70% yes mentality 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.850
 it will be fine here and he brought it 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.520
 frame that they add a little to it 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.580
 that golden graspable yes no I didn't say anything 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.190
 say about pc how are this law they 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.950
 have politely entered and played 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.510
 I have nothing to do with that 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.970
 I'm dealing with an essay 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.240
 we are happy with the point and yes that is 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.770
 something we like 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.770
 very satisfied as a club in the middle bracket 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.600
 Have to be with us for a week 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.430
 yes there the last match of the 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.790
 competition when we watch 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:57.310
 yes then you are going to wait it from there in the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.260
 guess what i always say i expect 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.600
 from one of my own boys that she 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.780
 optimally prepared that they know 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.550
 what she what is expected of them and 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.790
 and we will travel again to win 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.790
 and 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.380
 watch as we do that then call it 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.820
 ourselves a big pleasure from that 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.240
 with a very good feeling he winter 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.980
 in 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.340
 as even apart from the points you 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.500
 and that you see with this law 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.570
 is also 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.070
 for selden we had 0 points 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.330
 understand what the also just with three 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.710
 can stand 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.900
 and now we stand with one and then we have to 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.760
 just to keep on feeling good 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.500
 the things that went well 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.900
 names things that were less that 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.430
 have been appointed and that is where the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.990
 Football is all about 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.030
 a bit of a crazy story so something 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.370
 against these types of teams that of course 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.870
 on paper or strong are also nec he can 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.880
 enjoy playing soccer but both you and you 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.530
 also looks at the hedge there is and roda 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.940
 homeworkers they witnessed 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.830
 WC gets difficult because top women 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.630
 make the car 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.670
 oh fuck i guess too because that kind of 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.930
 business how to do some 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.459
 improve, for example, around the hague 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.060
 next week another one 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.820
 teams that 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.850
 with will there is a often it helps if 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.250
 you make a goal in a certain phase 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.630
 all the matches you mention then come 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.959
 you very difficult and defensive 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.480
 set opponent and the best 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.590
 Remedy is to have the few opportunities you have 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.030
 get because they do have 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.489
 had in those contests for those whatsoever 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.750
 to make and 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.340
 and then you can go further yourself 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.290
 go back because then they will have to 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.540
 come here will not come here for the one 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.320
 defending the backlog with so 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.520
 really that score that they knew remedy 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.620
 so move rav4 from you to the 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.919
 Christmas tree and then the car would go 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.160
 wright yeah so we're going to do it because of it 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.590
 trees already home to set up is wrong 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.760
 with my wife we ​​check because 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.760
 it's about the Christmas tree
