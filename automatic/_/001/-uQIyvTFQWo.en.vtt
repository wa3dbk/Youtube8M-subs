00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 very good kids that are made and 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.580
 I hope I'm great perfectly 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.710
 welcome not yet living in my channel 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.080
 I am synapse and today we can finally 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.759
 talk about the call of advanced advanced 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.820
 work faria you know that yesterday was the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.680
 presentation of the game multiplayer 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.320
 and there are a lot of gameplay out there 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.660
 rulando and analysis of images and amy and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.880
 cocks not the things that I'm not going to 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 do so down in the description os 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 I'm going to leave the channel of that which is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.449
 doing analysis of the frames that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.250
 now I have been seeing such and such 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.600
 greve analysis that is also 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.750
 doing the same and I'll leave you 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.589
 a sniper sniper gameplay 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.850
 and a sniper montage that have already come out 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.230
 sniper mounts yes because people 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.030
 he has already been playing the game for a 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.000
 couple of weeks and they have given him a chance 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.760
 so to get out then ride on what 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.179
 is what has 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.530
 in my opinion that the jump is a 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.839
 people seem very good to you 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.579
 innovative to me I think that I from the 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.579
 scope in which I play with the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.369
 sniper because I think that's what 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.920
 charge completely because you get things out 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.360
 with the sniper when usually 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.340
 we are going to take out the clips with 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.409
 notes on the piano spawn and then if you're 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.600
 in spam and stick a 5 meter pot 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.430
 Will you tell me if you have one below another 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.549
 half height and another one at the top like 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.689
 pussy is going to try to get you something with that 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.550
 so I think that on the subject of that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.800
 baza level pretty fucked i do not know if 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.539
 the game I'm going to buy it or I do not 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.789
 I'm going to buy that, I have to tell him 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.679
 already at the beginning along with the first 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.810
 image is that I have been told 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.720
 go great fucking bitch but then when 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.740
 I was seeing camps law of 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.909
 sniper is very cool because no 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.619
 carries neither charger or is it a 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.789
 sniper carrying only one bullet in 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.830
 the bedroom 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.050
 every shot that hits you have to go back 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.350
 to put in 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.880
 the bullet in the chamber for 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.439
 perform the following the following and 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.909
 for that I like that sniper 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.670
 I like it then there is a gun that 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.490
 he also carries only one bullet inside 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.640
 practically like the sniper 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.189
 also that it hits a lot but I think 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.259
 that saying the same thing before that to 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.670
 play with the sniper that's going to 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.319
 be pretty fucked I know he will be able to 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.630
 play then the typical hitting 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.000
 mountebank and those things but it will be 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.600
 fucked up playing like those of the ethical scouts 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.360
 of the sniper here comes the point 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.890
 what will you do with your channel synapse 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.810
 basically I have the channel based on 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.750
 call of duty since I went up the first 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.220
 video to the channel since I've been following 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.050
 and from the channel I 've always uploaded call of 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.019
 duty or my channel has always been based 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.489
 faced your aunt even though then 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.170
 I have been uploading other things or any 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.660
 blog or any video that I wanted 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.670
 edit or anything I've always 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.260
 had free choice but always in the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.549
 central pillar of the canal and 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.459
 channel growth has been call of 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.810
 duty not then, let's say that the 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.970
 dynamic that I was carrying is 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.430
 always playing with him with the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.370
 sniper and I think in this new 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.129
 ductile case is not going to be able 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.930
 do that too much then by the way 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.690
 we are when he linked to everything frank then 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.420
 I peel me because the power is frank 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.190
 what I'm going to do is going to be from 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.530
 now so I 'm going to start climbing 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.769
 other games that is not just what I do 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.470
 because I do not know if I'm going to buy this 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.480
 game or I 'm not going to buy it then 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.310
 I the white 2 for example of a game 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.799
 I already have it that maddie ximo or 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.140
 I have is the game of the most videos 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.730
 I have in the channel and I saw that there are charges 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.859
 two types of white with the one of the most 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.739
 videos I have in the channel let's not no what 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.910
 I have counted but surely then yes 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.940
 I'm going to start from now I'm going to 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.680
 start to upload another type of game and 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.220
 try to upload a video every Monday 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.470
 of lol try to climb garries mod and this 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.709
 I still have not quite decided 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.109
 because I do not know yet I have to speak it 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.500
 touch look at it but it is true that 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:52.140
 I want to start climbing or at least not to 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.780
 go up but learn to play minecraft 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.430
 that I follow if the first one that has 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.480
 complained about minecraft the first one that has 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.019
 said that fucking shit 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.150
 by changing air a bit and in the case 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.150
 that does not rule out that stop uploading 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.670
 here they have it in the future and in a 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.920
 present what I can say is 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.530
 that in the case of what 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.769
 I bought the new call of duty I'm not going to 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.600
 upload things only sniper 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.519
 yes I will say what we would say 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.740
 sniper what it is to be a try heart play 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.840
 with submachine gun and doing those things that 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.250
 to be a transsexual, let's say that 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.080
 would also dedicate to upload that in play 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.940
 playing with different weapons not 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.490
 only with snipers and not 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.860
 I know if I should say this still because 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:44.470
 It's still early I do not know when it will come out 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.210
 but when I take days here you know that 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.970
 I said I was going to get the second part of 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.970
 neural pool was going to call neural press 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.320
 2 well I do not think I do too spoiler 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.560
 but in the end it will not be number 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.880
 pulse 2 is going to be another montage but in 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.729
 how much its disassembly that will be around 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.139
 October to mid -October because I 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.500
 I calculate that it will be a month and a half 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.500
 edition 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.920
 in October and I'll upload the montage already 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:18.000
 from there you can stop uploading 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.960
 things just from sniper I do not know if 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.370
 completely or if some time in 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.169
 when a practice match whatever but 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.319
 I will not base so much the channel are on the 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.629
 streaming apart from because good I think 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:31.719
 that it's too long that I have to 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.340
 throw trying to get me clips and everything 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:35.469
 the roll and then also the standard ones 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.539
 are going through the roof and I know that 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.979
 I lost community sniper hates me 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.360
 simply because of having more 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.099
 subscribers with them then yes it is 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.780
 truth that they are really putting me is 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.120
 lose what they are asking for like in their 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.099
