about eight o'clock and temperatures are
still<00:00:13.740> high<00:00:14.240> you<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.570> see<00:00:15.719> from<00:00:15.750> here

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
still high you can just see from here

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.859 
still high you can just see from here
look<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> thermometer<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.310> um<00:00:17.869> it's

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
look the thermometer it's um it's

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.960 
look the thermometer it's um it's
actually<00:00:19.140> over<00:00:19.500> 80<00:00:19.740> Fahrenheit<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:22.939> like<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
actually over 80 Fahrenheit and like I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.769 
actually over 80 Fahrenheit and like I
say<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.390> about<00:00:24.539> eight<00:00:24.689> o'clock<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:29.779> not

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
say it's about eight o'clock so it's not

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.720 
say it's about eight o'clock so it's not
too<00:00:31.080> hot<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.560> indoors<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.369> I've<00:00:32.460> got<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
too hot to be indoors so I've got the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.510 
too hot to be indoors so I've got the
rocket<00:00:33.120> stove<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.809> out<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.520> just

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
rocket stove going out here I just

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.740 
rocket stove going out here I just
reassemble<00:00:36.030> it

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
reassemble it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
reassemble it
just<00:00:37.620> thought<00:00:37.739> I'd<00:00:37.890> show<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.550> new

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
just thought I'd show you this new

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.930 
just thought I'd show you this new
standby<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.469> very<00:00:40.739> simple

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
again you have the one concrete block on

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.690 
again you have the one concrete block on
the<00:00:46.649> bottom<00:00:47.010> okay

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the bottom okay

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
the bottom okay
and<00:00:47.940> that's<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.719> sitting<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> wooden

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and that's just sitting on a wooden

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.490 
and that's just sitting on a wooden
table<00:00:49.920> right<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> middle<00:00:54.379> where<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
table right so in the middle where the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.040 
table right so in the middle where the
cattle<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.949> sitting<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.270> hollow<00:00:57.539> concrete

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
cattle is sitting is the hollow concrete

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.000 
cattle is sitting is the hollow concrete
block<00:00:59.270> say<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.690> those<00:01:00.840> long<00:01:01.140> ones<00:01:01.410> when

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
block say one of those long ones when

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.070 
block say one of those long ones when
you<00:01:02.160> stand<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.850> quite<00:01:03.090> tall<00:01:06.080> there's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
you stand it up it's quite tall there's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.649 
you stand it up it's quite tall there's
a<00:01:07.170> small<00:01:07.470> hole<00:01:07.770> made<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> front<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
a small hole made in the front of the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.710 
a small hole made in the front of the
concrete<00:01:10.049> block<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.790> either<00:01:12.000> side

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
concrete block and then on either side

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.060 
concrete block and then on either side
I've<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:14.040> some<00:01:14.549> split<00:01:14.970> concrete<00:01:15.810> blocks<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
I've put some split concrete blocks to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.330 
I've put some split concrete blocks to
form<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.509> tunnel<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:19.979> air<00:01:20.310> is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
form like a little tunnel so the air is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.590 
form like a little tunnel so the air is
sucked<00:01:20.970> in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
sucked in

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.620 
sucked in
through<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.530> tunnel<00:01:23.159> okay<00:01:23.790> well<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
through that little tunnel okay well the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.539 
through that little tunnel okay well the
fire<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> middle<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> cup<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
fire is in the middle of the cup of the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.950 
fire is in the middle of the cup of the
hollow<00:01:26.820> concrete<00:01:27.119> block<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:29.960> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
hollow concrete block and you see and it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.130 
hollow concrete block and you see and it
goes<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:33.590> I'll<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.650> move<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
goes up and I'll just move this and you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.859 
goes up and I'll just move this and you
can<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.740> oh<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:39.720> can't<00:01:39.990> really<00:01:40.170> see<00:01:40.640> okay<00:01:41.640> but

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
can see oh you can't really see okay but

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.210 
can see oh you can't really see okay but
there's<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> good<00:01:43.110> heat<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.560> there<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.009> can

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
there's a good heat going there you can

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
there's a good heat going there you can
see<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.579> young<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:46.020> kettle's<00:01:46.409> boiling<00:01:48.110> it's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
see the young the kettle's boiling it's

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.090 
see the young the kettle's boiling it's
about<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.250> very<00:01:50.579> simple<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:52.100> easy

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
about this it's a very simple and easy

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.130 
about this it's a very simple and easy
to<00:01:53.369> make<00:01:55.100> interpretation<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.219> suppose<00:01:56.549> off<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
to make interpretation I suppose off the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.300 
to make interpretation I suppose off the
rocket<00:01:58.530> stove<00:01:58.850> and<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:01.829> nice<00:02:02.009> thing<00:02:02.280> about

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
rocket stove and the nice thing about

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.480 
rocket stove and the nice thing about
this<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.570> transport<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:05.369> if

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
this is that you can transport it so if

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.130 
this is that you can transport it so if
I<00:02:05.610> wanted<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> head<00:02:06.240> off<00:02:06.420> down<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.930> beach

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
I wanted to head off down to the beach

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.190 
I wanted to head off down to the beach
or<00:02:08.300> somewhere<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.690> day<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.899> could

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
or somewhere for the day I could

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.540 
or somewhere for the day I could
actually<00:02:10.349> bring<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.800> with<00:02:11.039> me<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> back

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
actually bring this with me in the back

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.230 
actually bring this with me in the back
of<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.790> car

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
of the car

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.790 
of the car
because<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:12.990> literally<00:02:15.020> two<00:02:16.020> solid

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
because it's literally two solid

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160 
because it's literally two solid
concrete<00:02:17.040> blocks<00:02:17.580> sorry<00:02:18.210> one<00:02:18.510> solid<00:02:18.930> concrete

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
concrete blocks sorry one solid concrete

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.070 
concrete blocks sorry one solid concrete
block<00:02:19.650> one<00:02:20.190> hollow<00:02:20.490> concrete<00:02:20.850> block<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.600> a

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
block one hollow concrete block and a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.900 
block one hollow concrete block and a
couple<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.440> broken<00:02:22.560> bits<00:02:25.490> I'll<00:02:26.490> show<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.760> what

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
couple of broken bits I'll show you what

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.680 
couple of broken bits I'll show you what
I<00:02:26.940> burn<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.620> best<00:02:28.830> change<00:02:29.220> I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
I burn in this for the best change I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.990 
I burn in this for the best change I
burn<00:02:30.690> sticks<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.350> willow

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
burn sticks of willow

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.920 
burn sticks of willow
now<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.060> willow<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:35.120> quite<00:02:36.120> dry<00:02:36.450> obviously

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
now the willow is quite dry obviously
