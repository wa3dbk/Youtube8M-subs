00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello people is loud and cheeky again 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.750
 This time the ranger aquino I will 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.740
 none yes I will immediately added a 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:18.710
 Announcement to do so to the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:20.880
 all in again so in German 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.250
 of course I find it very cool 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 After the colleague mona completely forgotten 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:34.190
 no matter where on the map somehow the thing 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.300
 is just to hey it's very nice very 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.760
 Great to do something because the map 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.850
 I'm pretty far away 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.140
 god right thank God 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.989
 The lobby here is still pretty 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.370
 happy and shitty 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.500
 when I made something big changed 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.180
 youtuber in here because of these bands 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:04.409
 its good but I have to live with well 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.619
 here then with the score bit of luck 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.619
 from 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:20.950
 ok behind me but one or 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.620
 in front and behind me 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.170
 I regard this as an emergency situation 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.979
 spectator 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.979
 Spoonbill would not be wrong here 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:08.460
 so gifted front left, I believe one 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.890
 so yes what I wanted to announce 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.890
 is that the throwers 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.160
 most likely just try 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.130
 So I will go for a free for all 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.160
 or maybe two and then yes 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.180
 So much trouble, so to speak 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.020
 try as much as possible 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.880
 to wreak 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.680
 I will do that with the throwers 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.480
 So samba possibly rpg at4 what to do 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.160
 Of course I have to say that with it 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.870
 have no conditions available 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.140
 therefore the victory with it excluded 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.130
 is or is as good as excluded 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.620
 I hope that is not the case now 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.730
 so important as I said as much as 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.709
 possible try to do it as 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.690
 I had posted last on facebook 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.150
 is it is it the use sign 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.100
 still give 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.250
 this is going to be very tough on something 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.180
 hinzubekommen 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.450
 but of course I will 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.450
 to attempt 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.450
 what a shame 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.879
 yes and I do not know what to use sign 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.049
 I'll probably rpg or as I said 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.989
 I do not really know if I play like that 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.250
 I'll make that javelin, of course 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.250
 in no case try 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.670
 because that just does not make sense to me 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.780
 have a shot with it every time I have to 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.310
 in my opinion after wanting it 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.700
 impossible to win a game with 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.659
 I'll just sit down now 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.040
 Do not know maybe thing really has 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.819
 really made it to the army but that 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.290
 I can not imagine 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.129
 It just will not not be that way 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.209
 without help 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.209
 I'll tell you another one 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.270
 water which he set went well 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.950
 not counting where I am 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.950
 honestly say right here in the exit 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.740
 ok from the left 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.909
 red 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:26.400
 if you're okay 30.4 rainbow is ok 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.190
 well, clearly, I think next will 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.270
 then come the m4 and then the model 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.280
 that we are very interesting again 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.480
 I hope you like the gamepad and 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.970
 I hope for like that 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.210
 I planned the throwers the author 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.210
 a show
