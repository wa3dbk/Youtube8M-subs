00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.650
 How about friends, I'm Ricardo Dominguez and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.389
 we are in grace style in this 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.900
 program you will not learn that the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.480
 style is not something that is born is 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.020
 something that is learned over time and in 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.020
 the way 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.980
 this time we are going to talk about how 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.380
 a formal scene takes place but 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.000
 with friends with lifelong friends 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.550
 with friends from children or with friends 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.680
 recent but close friends the week 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.970
 formal with friends does not require 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.860
 presentations to each other because 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.960
 We are obviously talking about 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.780
 everyone knows each other maybe there's 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.730
 Some friend or some friendly partner that 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.140
 be new to the group and these will be 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.379
 seaweed in a presentation of them 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.470
 saying that such caleyes are engaged in 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.930
 this is in our group for that reason 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.690
 in the series between friends he copied previous 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.600
 in the snacks are usually important 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.820
 but they must not go beyond the point where 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.950
 go without hunger remember how you 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.500
 I have said other times that the snack is 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.990
 to whet the appetite not to satisfy 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.420
 the diner always accommodates man 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.970
 woman man woman separating the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.330
 couples so that the conversation can 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.280
 flow without being interrupted or without 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.380
 have to do with points of view 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.390
 of each couple the type of 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.700
 Table mount is normal assembly 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.040
 in any case can be omitted tablecloth 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.100
 but it is not convenient given that it is 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.230
 of a formal dinner now well if the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.470
 shaped scene 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.260
 for some specific reason for example 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.150
 of visiting the couple friend for their 10 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.060
 years of marriage or because some of 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.700
 the members of this group had a success 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.250
 particular in some activity this must 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.700
 be done from the beginning do it 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.010
 know so that at the end of the dinner it 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.770
 Serve the champagne and drink for the 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.320
 success or for the matter in question that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.480
 was the reason for this dinner this 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.240
 way I think you can do a 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.710
 dinner among friends with a lot of style and with 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.680
 a lot of formality 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.990
 friends that's all for today I remind you 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.190
 that they like my program that is 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.610
 subscribe the crash style on youtube and 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.610
