forehand this is my grip I would try and
do<00:02:00.159> it<00:02:00.280> like<00:02:00.369> this<00:02:00.520> but<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.420> guys<00:02:01.569> do<00:02:01.810> it

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
do it like this but you guys do it

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.600

my generation as well but we weren't as

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.600 
my generation as well but we weren't as
good<00:02:30.680> at<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:30.920> because<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.280> weren't<00:02:31.430> that

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610

one why huh poor that I mean that's
obviously<00:02:45.140> something<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.340> can

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
obviously something that you can

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.390 
obviously something that you can
practice<00:02:46.820> but<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.720> don't<00:02:47.870> really<00:02:48.020> practice

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
practice but you don't really practice

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.220
