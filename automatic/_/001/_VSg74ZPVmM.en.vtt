00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.430
 What's going on turned around by welcoming 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.250
 another issue of smart update 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.110
 magazine news smartphones tablets and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.179
 the chancellor fucking dirt the case is 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.890
 Let's just go with one 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.520
 competitors to paypal a bit says hurts 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.480
 paper commented on the nfc format 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.970
 what you fci zack that is how should 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.859
 i say has near field communication with 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.109
 the time is possible as similar 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.700
 bluetooth that you can on short distance 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.230
 several different devices with each other 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.960
 can act quite similarly with 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.610
 bluetooth with what to compare 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.170
 to be used entirely but for 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.079
 cash payments or for check in at 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 airport et cetera but paypal live 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.800
 do not believe that this is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.200
 format clock is set and also the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 boss of paypass a few nice details 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.910
 out can eg the kind in monetary value 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.770
 implemented yet paypal is in 2012 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.170
 from 3 9 to 14 billion dollars 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 increased and twelve million users 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.780
 Sorry for the phone, I am vibrating 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.390
 I'm twelve million users in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.460
 germany use paper of it 20 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 percent use this service in 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.729
 the nice possibilities also on the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.670
 smartphone or your tablet currently 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.439
 working paypal to participate in a system 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.509
 Waiting times to shorten eg in 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.650
 restaurant should be possible then with 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.939
 the smartphone to the bill 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.880
 Do not settle for that 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.960
 For example, work must be expected 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.619
 what has the problem with many of them 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.540
 manufacturers 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.650
 they have no confidence in the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.820
 nfc system that is still relatively new and yes 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.130
 but not so good 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.479
 sophisticated and that works 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.970
 i need my device to be smartphone 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.700
 Hold tablet against the sensor and that 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.560
 are just for the problem with 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.360
 privacy I everything is as I said 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.490
 is still relatively fresh and that's why 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.470
 think paper so long that there in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.670
 children's shoes are quasi why should 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.960
 we show each other what thoughts are 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.660
 if we increase our sales 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.490
 then we do not really care 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.460
 Well then we come to the next topic 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 to the surface pro the nice tablet of 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.950
 microsoft which is pretty surprising 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.590
 to put it this way 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.820
 the good news after a few days 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.470
 It was already sold out, you think 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.900
 haye did a great job selling it 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.610
 because the problem is just a lot of 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.920
 Pre-orderers do not even get more 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.720
 model of the 128 gb model for example 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.830
 was already after seven hours 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.600
 sold out 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.800
 and there are some as an example 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.160
 branches 13 canada eg staples and best 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.290
 buy 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.360
 they only delivered three devices 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.740
 get there rather data preordered 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.780
 but they got three devices 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.330
 online, for example, there are only the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.700
 64 gb variant the 128 is already 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.380
 not anymore and there is no official one 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.270
 reasoning of microsoft why so 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.580
 the tablet was bad before that 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.890
 sold and they said with the 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.170
 surface pro we expect a big one 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.640
 purchase rush and why is it then 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.250
 bottlenecks and why have so due 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.840
 model is delivered the question the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.790
 it turns out there is no official 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.840
 Opinion on this 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.030
 and when the whole thing is in 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.560
 Germany were sold this as is 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.860
 there is still no termination because there is 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.989
 room 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.100
 There is no official statement 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.019
 All of us have to wait for that 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.300
 We also want to have fun with us 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.080
 one expects further with his 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.360
 smartphone with the samsung galaxy s 4g 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.250
 second rumors about it and that the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.950
 Headliner on the recognition of gestures 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.530
 it will be possible or not 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.780
 We will contact you at the latest on 15 march if 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.870
 the whole thing in Moscow presented 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.380
 is or at the latest at the release in 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.180
 April 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.489
 and there is such a way 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.530
 gesture recognition system from sony 's 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.660
 floating dutchman and that were just 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.730
 movements are detected without physical 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.489
 So activity as you almost as 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.019
 knows all this time fiction filming 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.239
 So his wall has it so so 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.580
 with the finger so very cool thing in the 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.920
 cut should be possible is relative 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.459
 difficult to implement if it works 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.730
 Of course it would be a big one 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.900
 relief for many and it is 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.850
 probably or 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.260
 You can assume that it never will 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.410
 pay at the song galaxy used 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.410
 can 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.630
 samsung at galaxy s 41 without this 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.790
 system has already developed and used 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.140
 does one assume that samsung on 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.579
 of course trying to implement the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.570
 think competitively and we want it too 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.260
 and is such a unique feature 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.940
 to have 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.290
 therefore one can assume that 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.050
 but also something in the field 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.150
 probably did and then come 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.850
 yes the last news we come to the apple 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.560
 Although there was something gigantic in the field 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.300
 many rumors that three iphones in 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.850
 will this year appear once the 5 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.220
 it is such an iphone mini and just one 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.990
 iphone market I believe it should be called 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.070
 have not got that now 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.320
 to go out but it should 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.990
 probably only the iphone has 5 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.550
 and the iPhone 6 on the market is the 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.840
 iPhone 6 has as a special feature that have 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.980
 I said yes last time 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.750
 the pretty big display 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.320
 there is currently a 5 inch 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.540
 display off because it already has to 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.250
 Face was at suppliers because svs 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.860
 and the six as already mentioned at 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.500
 suppliers were spotted and therefore 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.010
 someone so the expert further delivered 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.980
 has been 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.210
 news.at level raushauen the 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.890
 Release is just of both 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.630
 probably in 2013 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.700
 probably only models at 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.970
 suppliers already gone for the third time 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.700
 were spotted that one already exists 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.520
 a few details though the iphone 5 it 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.610
 should be similar to the 5 Series and only 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.930
 very minimal extensions have so 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.270
 let's just say a new version 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.990
 bring out people to buy 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.880
 claiming now just so there 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.440
 not something I really no 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.880
 reasons why one should be happy there 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.520
 there are no real reasons 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.470
 for that the iphone 6 has of course then 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.840
 more renovation just something bigger 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.820
 is etc and should compete with 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.320
 galaxy note are because of the larger ones 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.850
 display course , but must be careful 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.130
 its what apple is pretty well known 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.180
 for many prototypes then not at all 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.530
 be published there are always 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.850
 again that any prototypes in 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.740
 which measure can be found because they 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.240
 left employee but has left 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.280
 you can see that from the outside on one 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.290
 safe source is and the devices too 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.910
 so let us get to the market 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.290
 what all that apple apple surprise us 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.580
 I will present for the time being 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.590
 satisfied then for the time being no 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.020
 get new except it is indeed as 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.310
 Breakthrough blatant new there 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.770
 introduced where they really worth it 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.330
 but I would go away right now 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.220
 not out yet but lets and easy 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.960
 What is the value of the surprise 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.580
 tim cook 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.590
 there presented there we would be already 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.020
 through with the smart update now but 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.340
 this much shit or via update is 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.410
 just thanks for watching 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.880
 I hope see you next time 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.830
 issue again from the smart or the 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.610
 other format I'm so far out 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.210
 Have a good time 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.210
 40
