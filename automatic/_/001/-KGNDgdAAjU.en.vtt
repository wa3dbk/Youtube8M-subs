00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.520
 I was 16 years old I had to be trying 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.230
 to mask November 17, 1992 and the 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.220
 official date given by dc comics 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.040
 for the death of superman 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.970
 this death was widely publicized but 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.440
 do you really know in what 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.480

 twelve of them he broke his prison 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.309
 dig the soil and finally get to the air

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.000
 stay safe in your ikea kitchens 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.470
 instead of hanging out in our paws this 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.960
 shabby scenario spring and 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.119
 macho written by a woman louise 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.500
 simonson is a pretext for us 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.300
 present the underground monsters that 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.890
 want to invade metropolis upon arriving 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.070
 in town from below thanks to a machine 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.070
 giantess 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.610
 I am not expert in Machiavellian plan 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.630
 but there was no simpler 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.830
 superman stop these horns enough 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.119
 easily because as he says in 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.039
 this box with a close-up on his 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.470
 butt I'm not the kind of man 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.729
 do not understand it easily ah yes I 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.950
 full of homophobic jokes if you 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.360
 want on his side continuous 12d 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.110
 to move straight ahead by tearing the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.399
 trees on its way and destroying 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.399
 bridges on its way 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.720
 I have to stop the carambars but 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.899
 who is 12d where does he come from 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.220
 or is he going to eat when he goes 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.640
 at mcdo 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.020
 a doom mc we will not have the answer 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.910
 right now because here comes into play 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.769
 justice league of america wonder 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.209
 woman green I wait a minute 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.760
 what is it that these branquignols 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.110
 and yes a little like the avengers sometimes 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.850
 justice league is composed of the most 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.440
 great heroes of the planet and sometimes 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.700
 for an editorial reason that escapes me 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.030
 we have the right to a second team 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.799
 knife 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.360
 I do not think it has anything to do with 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.130
 the pot of the artist since the cdm 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.450
 jergens who takes care of the scenario and 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.549
 drawings I mean it's not irrelevant 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:36.870
 who and so at the time we have the right to 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:39.799
 maxima hate nothing to fart goodwin the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.420
 big blue dominate pretty empty abortion 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.620
 and there are others but we have nothing 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.019
 to do since anyway they will 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.040
 to take a beating scared the opposite 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.049
 would have been amazing 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.680
 but superman arrives and here we go 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:56.280
 superman 74 adventures of superman 497 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.560

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.220
 it's disgusting 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.120
 and finally we come to superman 75 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.000
 another episode of fighting the 5th and the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.760

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.920

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.740
 stashed at the end of the street or what band 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.390
 on the other hand, there is not one who 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.320
 will see the case of the jl and blue beetle 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.770

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.150
 vertebral but I am very optimistic 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.190
 even though I planned on a dead autopsy 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.500
 relatives on the other hand superman him he 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.670

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.790
 revive him with everything they 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.280
 could a defibrillator a species 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.390
 of machine that collects energies and 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.380
 its limits if I did not put the 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.920
 sticks in the eye to see if he 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.560
 did not pretend 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:51.440

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.360
 a superman episode funeral very 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.800
 touching partly thanks to martin and 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.120

 logo who would have liked to kill good superman 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.350
 superman is dead so it's over 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.880
 and no, because if his soul has 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.880

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.269
 pau actually the project cadmus it's not 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.689
 students who change country 

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:21.119
 it's a special federal unit which 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:24.089
 does not mean anything so cadmus theft 

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:25.849
 superman body loïs by the recover 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:28.319
 in a story absolutely 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.089
 improbable with badass bikers 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.419
 found completely by chance on the 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:32.699
 road 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.289
 supergirl a heroine who at 1 5 or 6 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.759
 episode especially just for her 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.249
 in this saga but that do not serve 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:40.499
 strictly nothing and we also find 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.389
 the monsters under ground there we saw 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:53.059
 at the beginning of the video that proposes to 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:56.069
 to travel in frog this frog 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:58.769
 every time she appears she has 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:01.800
 seem to have nothing to do with it but 

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:04.919
 really look at this head and that's it 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.059
 every box where it is 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.899
 I am in one of the biggest 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:11.129
 sales or super mom twin bonus pack 

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:12.539
 my god how can you say that you 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.389
 love death more than marvel with a 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.279
 character like that short the water they get 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.969

 on the other hand brings out the youngest 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:24.869
 no really it's absolutely bad 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.889
 seriously it looks like a sado-maso comic 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:29.279
 necrophile to pedophiles 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:31.949
 nice tanoh all leather lying on the 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.539
 dead superman body with children 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.129
 who look no problem and a 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.259
 giant booger ask me by on 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:38.249
 do not care how awful it is 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.509
 more than an animal and we have 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:42.209
 zoophilia 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:44.159
 oh my god they screwed a seal so 

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:46.619
 the heroes find the body of superman 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.699
 all is well that ends well finally these 

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:50.369
 ways of saying because he's dead 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.059
 it's sad when you think 

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:53.639
 of this saga 

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:55.169
 the first part is excellent even 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.419
 if I criticized with a huge but 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:58.860
 bad faith it's part of the game 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.959
 second part a little bit more 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.489
 nawak there is anecdotal but not 

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:04.349
 we do not care anyway it's a 

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:06.809
 classic you are forced to read a 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:08.419
 day or other because it's very good 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:10.349
 writing is a very beautiful story 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.300
 easily understandable even if one 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:13.739
 do not know the universe dc and I you 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.529

 that I think the guy is doing too much 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.190
