00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
action of ionic void you can see how the

action of ionic void you can see how the
whitening<00:03:09.810> agent<00:03:10.140> actually<00:03:10.650> gets<00:03:10.830> into<00:03:11.040> the

smallest surfaces of your teeth where

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.020 
smallest surfaces of your teeth where
the<00:03:13.230> stains<00:03:13.500> hide<00:03:13.800> making<00:03:14.430> them<00:03:14.550> whiter<00:03:14.820> and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
the stains hide making them whiter and

the stains hide making them whiter and
brighter<00:03:15.120> than<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.600> ever<00:03:15.870> imagined<00:03:16.440> possible

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
brighter than you ever imagined possible

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.580 
brighter than you ever imagined possible
and<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.910> doesn't<00:03:18.390> take<00:03:18.570> two<00:03:18.810> hours<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.440> it

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and this doesn't take two hours and it

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.170 
and this doesn't take two hours and it
sure<00:03:19.800> doesn't<00:03:19.980> cost<00:03:20.370> hundreds<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:20.940> hundreds

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
sure doesn't cost hundreds and hundreds

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.449 
sure doesn't cost hundreds and hundreds
of<00:03:21.239> dollars<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.840> for<00:03:22.380> me<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.830> best<00:03:23.040> part<00:03:23.310> is

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
of dollars and for me the best part is

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.220 
of dollars and for me the best part is
it<00:03:23.880> doesn't<00:03:24.209> hurt<00:03:24.360> my<00:03:24.540> sensitive<00:03:24.959> teeth

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
it doesn't hurt my sensitive teeth

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.940 
it doesn't hurt my sensitive teeth
Debbie<00:03:25.709> those<00:03:26.160> days<00:03:26.430> are<00:03:26.700> over<00:03:30.950> that's

Debbie those days are over that's

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.699 
Debbie those days are over that's
incredible

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
incredible

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.130 
incredible
I<00:03:33.739> had<00:03:34.129> no<00:03:34.430> idea<00:03:34.819> that<00:03:35.269> they<00:03:35.420> were<00:03:35.450> really<00:03:35.900> that

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
I had no idea that they were really that

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.309 
I had no idea that they were really that
that<00:03:36.379> is<00:03:36.590> HUGE<00:03:36.980> oh<00:03:37.519> wow<00:03:38.209> yeah<00:03:38.780> they<00:03:39.019> look<00:03:39.170> so

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
that is HUGE oh wow yeah they look so

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.089 
that is HUGE oh wow yeah they look so
much<00:03:39.349> brighter

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
much brighter

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.429 
much brighter
and<00:03:40.189> it<00:03:40.459> changes<00:03:40.909> the<00:03:41.180> whole<00:03:41.209> chemistry<00:03:42.140> of

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
and it changes the whole chemistry of

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.619 
and it changes the whole chemistry of
your<00:03:42.620> smile<00:03:42.920> that's<00:03:43.459> pretty<00:03:43.879> impressive<00:03:44.239> I

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
your smile that's pretty impressive I

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.170 
your smile that's pretty impressive I
like<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.650> before<00:03:45.799> they're<00:03:46.700> just<00:03:46.939> dull

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
like that the before they're just dull

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.270 
like that the before they're just dull
