00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
what happened if there were no free

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.170 
what happened if there were no free
slots<00:00:58.019> and<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:59.159> somehow<00:00:59.400> got<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> merchant<00:01:00.089> in

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
slots and we somehow got a merchant in

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.189 
slots and we somehow got a merchant in
well<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.110> happened<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.559> each<00:01:02.510> merchant<00:01:03.510> has

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
well what happened was each merchant has

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.240 
well what happened was each merchant has
a<00:01:04.229> chance<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.619> either<00:01:04.739> competing<00:01:05.369> or<00:01:07.250> gaining

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
a chance of either competing or gaining

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.340 
a chance of either competing or gaining
a<00:01:08.310> new<00:01:08.430> slot<00:01:08.759> and<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.360> depends<00:01:09.899> on<00:01:10.050> what's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
a new slot and it just depends on what's

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.109 
a new slot and it just depends on what's
going<00:01:10.649> on<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> don't<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.550> a<00:01:11.580> merchant<00:01:12.000> I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
going on if you don't have a merchant I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.670 
going on if you don't have a merchant I
believe<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> new<00:01:12.600> feature<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.440> can

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
believe a new feature is that you can

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.370 
believe a new feature is that you can
actually<00:01:13.860> automatically<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.289> merchant<00:01:16.289> in

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
actually automatically get a merchant in

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.950 
actually automatically get a merchant in
there<00:01:16.590> at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> same<00:01:16.860> time<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:18.390> used<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.840> be

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
there at the same time it used to be

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.570 
there at the same time it used to be
that<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.320> happened<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:19.770> some<00:01:20.130> merchants

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that what happened was some merchants

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.910 
that what happened was some merchants
would<00:01:20.700> compete<00:01:21.030> away<00:01:21.330> people<00:01:22.140> some<00:01:22.500> merchants

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
would compete away people some merchants

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
would compete away people some merchants
would<00:01:23.039> fill<00:01:23.250> empty<00:01:23.460> slots<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.119> think<00:01:24.300> that's

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
would fill empty slots I think that's

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910 
would fill empty slots I think that's
been<00:01:24.660> changed<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> little<00:01:25.320> bit<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.649> a<00:01:25.679> little

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
been changed a little bit to be a little

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
been changed a little bit to be a little
bit<00:01:26.009> more<00:01:26.190> friendly<00:01:26.660> but<00:01:27.660> that<00:01:27.780> does<00:01:27.990> make<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
bit more friendly but that does make it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.810 
bit more friendly but that does make it
more<00:01:28.320> competitive<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:29.160> that<00:01:29.310> means<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
more competitive as that means that the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.160 
more competitive as that means that the
more<00:01:29.970> merchants<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.600> getting<00:01:30.810> sent<00:01:31.050> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
more merchants that are getting sent the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260 
more merchants that are getting sent the
more<00:01:31.320> competition<00:01:31.770> there<00:01:32.039> is<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.940> this<00:01:33.090> time

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
more competition there is so this time

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.380 
more competition there is so this time
we're<00:01:33.420> gonna<00:01:33.539> turn<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:35.360> priority<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
we're gonna turn up the priority to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.080 
we're gonna turn up the priority to
green<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.320> turning<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.280> anything<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.909> all

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
green now turning it to anything at all

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.850 
green now turning it to anything at all
will<00:01:39.450> automatically<00:01:40.049> send<00:01:40.290> merchants<00:01:40.650> when

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
will automatically send merchants when

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.469 
will automatically send merchants when
you<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> merchant<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> money<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.299> do

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you have a merchant and the money to do

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.359 
you have a merchant and the money to do
it<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.869> you're<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.170> already<00:01:43.650> full<00:01:44.040> up<00:01:44.220> on

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it and you're not already full up on

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.609 
it and you're not already full up on
merchants<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> center<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.360> trade<00:01:45.619> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
merchants at the center of trade the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.170 
merchants at the center of trade the
difference<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.509> that<00:01:48.530> which<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.180> you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
difference is that which one is you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.399 
difference is that which one is you
which<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.540> select<00:01:51.659> depends<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.350> your

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
which one you select depends on your

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.130 
which one you select depends on your
priority<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.040> if<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.220> had<00:01:53.540> Lubeck<00:01:54.540> here<00:01:54.780> at<00:01:54.899> red

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
priority so if I had Lubeck here at red

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.780 
priority so if I had Lubeck here at red
and<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.799> had<00:01:56.070> Antwerp<00:01:57.140> at<00:01:58.140> yellow<00:01:58.670> what<00:01:59.670> would

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and I had Antwerp at yellow what would

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.999 
and I had Antwerp at yellow what would
happen<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.420> would<00:02:00.479> prioritize

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
happen is I would prioritize

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.959 
happen is I would prioritize
automatically<00:02:02.009> sending<00:02:02.310> my<00:02:02.399> merchants<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
automatically sending my merchants to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.910 
automatically sending my merchants to
Antwerp<00:02:03.329> instead<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.020> blue<00:02:04.259> back<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:04.860> I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
Antwerp instead of blue back but if I

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.380 
Antwerp instead of blue back but if I
couldn't<00:02:05.219> send<00:02:05.430> them<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> Antwerp<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.240> some

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
couldn't send them the Antwerp for some

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.819 
couldn't send them the Antwerp for some
reason<00:02:06.750> then<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> would<00:02:07.170> send<00:02:07.320> them<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.530> Lu<00:02:07.649> back

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
reason then I would send them to Lu back

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.069 
reason then I would send them to Lu back
instead<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.360> want<00:02:09.540> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:09.869> set

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
instead and if you want you can just set

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.810 
instead and if you want you can just set
them<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.530> same<00:02:10.709> value<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
them all the same value and then the

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.340 
them all the same value and then the
computer<00:02:12.060> will<00:02:12.269> decide<00:02:12.630> for<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.079> what<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
computer will decide for you what it

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.670 
computer will decide for you what it
wants<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.739> do

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.410 

so<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.430> now<00:02:17.519> we're<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:17.849> going<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.090> set<00:02:18.269> Liu

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
so for now we're just going to set Liu

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.110 
so for now we're just going to set Liu
back<00:02:18.629> up<00:02:18.780> really<00:02:19.110> high<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.650> see<00:02:20.189> what<00:02:20.489> happens

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
back up really high and see what happens

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.100 
back up really high and see what happens
as<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:22.709> can<00:02:22.829> see<00:02:23.299> we've<00:02:24.299> automatically<00:02:24.840> had

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
as you can see we've automatically had

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.970 
as you can see we've automatically had
four<00:02:25.409> merchant<00:02:25.769> sent<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.189> us<00:02:27.439> so<00:02:28.439> what<00:02:28.860> will

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
four merchant sent to us so what will

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.770 
four merchant sent to us so what will
happen<00:02:29.010> when<00:02:29.250> all<00:02:29.579> four<00:02:29.970> Merchants<00:02:30.360> get<00:02:30.569> there

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
happen when all four Merchants get there

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:47.180 
happen when all four Merchants get there
on<00:02:31.230> about<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:33.030> 8th<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.450> March

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.810 

okay<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.860> 10th<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.220> March<00:02:50.370> we're

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
okay it's now the 10th of March we're

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.910 
okay it's now the 10th of March we're
out<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.060> merchants<00:02:51.390> but<00:02:51.600> that's<00:02:51.780> okay<00:02:52.170> now<00:02:52.860> you

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
out of merchants but that's okay now you

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.280 
out of merchants but that's okay now you
can<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.450> share<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.900> pie<00:02:55.080> has

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
can see that the share of the pie has

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.690 
can see that the share of the pie has
gotten<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> little<00:02:55.800> smaller<00:02:56.100> there<00:02:56.400> are<00:02:56.490> fewer

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
gotten a little smaller there are fewer

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.070 
gotten a little smaller there are fewer
countries<00:02:56.940> trading<00:02:57.510> than<00:02:57.660> there<00:02:57.780> were<00:02:57.900> before

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
countries trading than there were before

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.900 
countries trading than there were before
and<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> reason<00:02:58.860> for<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.310> we<00:02:59.670> are

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
and the reason for that is that we are

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.640 
and the reason for that is that we are
eight<00:03:00.060> are<00:03:00.300> now<00:03:00.450> filling<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:01.020> three<00:03:01.320> slots

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
eight are now filling up three slots

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.110 
eight are now filling up three slots
with<00:03:01.860> England<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.310> means<00:03:02.550> we<00:03:02.670> have<00:03:02.820> three

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
with England that means we have three

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.870 
with England that means we have three
merchants<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:03.660> place<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.800> we<00:03:05.190> set<00:03:05.520> five

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
merchants in place so we set five

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.000 
merchants in place so we set five
merchants<00:03:06.570> over<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.020> course<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.710> run

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
merchants over the course of this run

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.650 
merchants over the course of this run
but<00:03:08.340> we've<00:03:08.460> only<00:03:08.580> gotten<00:03:08.910> actually<00:03:09.150> three

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
but we've only gotten actually three

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.720 
but we've only gotten actually three
that<00:03:09.810> were<00:03:09.900> successful<00:03:10.620> some<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.250> them<00:03:11.430> failed

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
that were successful some of them failed

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.540 
that were successful some of them failed
some<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.210> them<00:03:12.420> probably<00:03:12.570> were<00:03:12.810> competed<00:03:13.260> away

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
some of them probably were competed away

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.800 
some of them probably were competed away
just<00:03:14.550> depends<00:03:14.850> on<00:03:14.970> what's<00:03:15.150> going<00:03:15.420> on<00:03:15.510> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
just depends on what's going on the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.750 
just depends on what's going on the
higher<00:03:16.020> up<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.290> are<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.950> trade<00:03:17.190> structure

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
higher up you are in the trade structure

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.400 
higher up you are in the trade structure
the<00:03:18.060> more<00:03:18.270> likely<00:03:18.600> your<00:03:18.840> merchants<00:03:19.290> are<00:03:19.380> going

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
the more likely your merchants are going

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.400 
the more likely your merchants are going
to<00:03:19.590> be<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:19.830> ones<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.190> get<00:03:20.280> targeted<00:03:20.790> by<00:03:21.410> new

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
to be the ones that get targeted by new

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.080 
to be the ones that get targeted by new
merchants<00:03:22.980> because<00:03:23.220> they<00:03:23.580> want<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.820> compete

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
merchants because they want to compete

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.700 
merchants because they want to compete
with<00:03:24.150> basically<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.870> most<00:03:25.200> aggressive

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
with basically the most aggressive

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.150 
with basically the most aggressive
person

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
person

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.430 
person
however<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.210> may<00:03:27.390> change<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.840> bit<00:03:28.020> if

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
however the that may change a bit if

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.990 
however the that may change a bit if
you're<00:03:28.710> one<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.070> harder<00:03:29.400> targets<00:03:29.790> to

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
you're one of the harder targets to

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.560 
you're one of the harder targets to
dislodge<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:32.490> way<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.700> works<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.150> your<00:03:33.330> trade

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
determine what chance there is to

determine what chance there is to
compete<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.300> merchants<00:03:39.660> away<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.620> as<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:40.980> can

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
compete the merchants away so as you can

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.920 
compete the merchants away so as you can
see<00:03:41.280> if<00:03:41.490> you<00:03:41.580> have<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.700> good<00:03:41.910> ruler<00:03:42.330> if<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.780> have

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
see if you have a good ruler if you have

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.020 
see if you have a good ruler if you have
certain<00:03:43.290> national<00:03:43.800> ideas<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.580> commerce

certain national ideas like commerce

trade<00:03:47.760> efficient<00:03:48.150> if<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.540> have<00:03:48.720> mercantilism

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
trade efficient if you have mercantilism

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.920 
trade efficient if you have mercantilism
versus<00:03:49.950> free<00:03:50.190> trade<00:03:50.460> and<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:51.390> course<00:03:51.600> if<00:03:51.780> the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
versus free trade and of course if the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.690 
versus free trade and of course if the
nation<00:03:52.230> themselves<00:03:52.800> have<00:03:52.950> certain<00:03:53.280> penalties

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
nation themselves have certain penalties

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.820 
nation themselves have certain penalties
then<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.660> easier<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.080> trade<00:03:55.260> them<00:03:55.410> away<00:03:55.470> and

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
then it's easier to trade them away and

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.470 
then it's easier to trade them away and
the<00:03:55.950> merchants<00:03:56.310> are<00:03:56.400> somewhat<00:03:56.820> smart<00:03:57.180> they'll

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
the merchants are somewhat smart they'll

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.990 
the merchants are somewhat smart they'll
usually<00:03:57.930> try<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.200> compete<00:03:58.530> with<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:59.340> easiest

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
usually try to compete with the easiest

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.640 
usually try to compete with the easiest
target<00:04:00.330> but<00:04:00.720> sometimes<00:04:01.140> they'll<00:04:01.350> decide

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
target but sometimes they'll decide

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.640 
target but sometimes they'll decide
instead<00:04:02.240> to<00:04:03.240> compete<00:04:03.510> with<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.930> toughest

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
instead to compete with the toughest

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.370 
instead to compete with the toughest
target<00:04:05.040> because<00:04:05.310> they<00:04:05.430> want<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.700> dislodge<00:04:06.030> it

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
target because they want to dislodge it

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.960 
target because they want to dislodge it
now<00:04:07.380> if<00:04:07.530> we<00:04:07.650> can<00:04:07.800> get<00:04:07.920> up<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.070> five<00:04:08.400> merchants

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
now if we can get up to five merchants

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.280 
now if we can get up to five merchants
in<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.240> center<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.570> trade<00:04:09.720> that's<00:04:10.050> pretty

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
in the center of trade that's pretty

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.710 
in the center of trade that's pretty
much<00:04:10.410> as<00:04:10.590> good<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:10.860> we<00:04:10.980> can<00:04:11.130> get<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.360> part

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
much as good as we can get and this part

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.360 
much as good as we can get and this part
over<00:04:12.810> here<00:04:13.110> will<00:04:13.260> tell<00:04:13.410> us<00:04:13.590> when<00:04:13.890> we<00:04:14.010> have<00:04:14.190> up

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
over here will tell us when we have up

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.449 
over here will tell us when we have up
to<00:04:14.400> five<00:04:15.290> now<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.380> issue<00:04:16.590> with<00:04:16.950> getting<00:04:17.280> to

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
to five now the issue with getting to

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.360 
to five now the issue with getting to
five<00:04:17.700> is<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.239> can't<00:04:18.450> send<00:04:18.750> any<00:04:18.930> more<00:04:19.169> until<00:04:20.040> a

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
five is you can't send any more until a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.620 
five is you can't send any more until a
certain<00:04:20.700> point<00:04:20.910> in<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.120> game<00:04:21.180> when<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.600> have

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
certain point in the game when you have

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.300 
certain point in the game when you have
enough<00:04:21.900> trade<00:04:22.140> technology<00:04:22.500> research<00:04:23.040> to

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
enough trade technology research to

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.000 
enough trade technology research to
allow<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.700> form<00:04:23.970> monopolies<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:25.010> monopoly

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
allow you to form monopolies a monopoly

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.320 
allow you to form monopolies a monopoly
is<00:04:26.160> pretty<00:04:26.430> much<00:04:26.550> what<00:04:26.760> it<00:04:26.790> sounds<00:04:27.210> you're

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
is pretty much what it sounds you're

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.060 
is pretty much what it sounds you're
trying<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.690> control<00:04:28.050> all<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.350> trade<00:04:28.800> in<00:04:28.980> the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
trying to control all the trade in the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.470 
trying to control all the trade in the
center<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.400> trade<00:04:29.550> what<00:04:29.940> happens<00:04:30.240> when<00:04:30.390> you

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
center of trade what happens when you

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.970 
center of trade what happens when you
get<00:04:30.600> to<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.750> monopoly<00:04:31.260> is<00:04:31.380> you<00:04:31.560> have<00:04:31.680> six

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
get to a monopoly is you have six

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.950 
get to a monopoly is you have six
merchants<00:04:32.400> in<00:04:32.520> place<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:33.000> every<00:04:33.780> merchant

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
merchants in place and every merchant

merchants in place and every merchant
you<00:04:34.230> send<00:04:34.500> after<00:04:34.919> that<00:04:35.070> starts<00:04:35.700> competing

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
you send after that starts competing

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.050 
you send after that starts competing
guys<00:04:36.330> away<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.990> instead<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.620> just<00:04:38.060> filling

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
guys away and instead of just filling

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.550 
guys away and instead of just filling
their<00:04:39.270> spot<00:04:39.540> since<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:39.990> have<00:04:40.080> no<00:04:40.169> more<00:04:40.320> spots

their spot since you have no more spots

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.409 
their spot since you have no more spots
to<00:04:40.740> fill<00:04:40.919> it<00:04:41.100> just<00:04:41.280> gets<00:04:41.430> rid<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.700> them<00:04:41.850> now

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
to fill it just gets rid of them now

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.210 
to fill it just gets rid of them now
what<00:04:42.570> happens<00:04:42.870> is<00:04:43.050> for<00:04:43.620> every<00:04:43.860> one<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.160> you

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
what happens is for every one that you

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.700 
what happens is for every one that you
get<00:04:44.430> rid<00:04:44.669> of<00:04:44.700> you<00:04:45.330> get<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.510> larger<00:04:45.990> slice<00:04:46.260> of<00:04:46.470> pie

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
get rid of you get a larger slice of pie

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.710 
get rid of you get a larger slice of pie
if<00:04:47.340> you<00:04:47.520> can<00:04:47.640> somehow<00:04:47.880> control<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.570> with<00:04:48.690> a

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
if you can somehow control it with a

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.470 
if you can somehow control it with a
monopoly<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.470> get<00:04:49.770> everybody<00:04:50.280> else<00:04:50.460> out<00:04:50.730> then

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
monopoly and get everybody else out then

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.760 
monopoly and get everybody else out then
you'll<00:04:51.600> actually<00:04:51.720> have<00:04:52.080> an<00:04:52.169> enormous<00:04:52.410> amount

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
you'll actually have an enormous amount

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.490 
you'll actually have an enormous amount
of<00:04:52.950> money<00:04:53.570> now<00:04:54.570> as<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:54.810> can<00:04:54.960> see<00:04:55.140> we've<00:04:55.350> got

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
of money now as you can see we've got

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.840 
of money now as you can see we've got
three<00:04:55.680> merchants<00:04:56.160> which<00:04:56.280> is<00:04:56.430> a<00:04:56.460> pretty<00:04:56.640> big

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
three merchants which is a pretty big

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.450 
three merchants which is a pretty big
share<00:04:57.090> yet<00:04:57.570> we<00:04:57.660> don't<00:04:57.780> even<00:04:57.990> make<00:04:58.169> merely<00:04:58.620> the

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
share yet we don't even make merely the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.219 
share yet we don't even make merely the
value<00:04:59.819> of<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.970> center<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.330> trade<00:05:00.569> that's

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
value of the center of trade that's

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.070 
value of the center of trade that's
because<00:05:01.530> of<00:05:01.650> our<00:05:01.770> trade<00:05:02.069> efficiency<00:05:02.810> which<00:05:03.810> is

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
because of our trade efficiency which is

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.279 
because of our trade efficiency which is
located<00:05:04.500> here<00:05:04.650> we<00:05:05.639> have<00:05:06.050> 56%<00:05:07.050> trade

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
located here we have 56% trade

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.860 
located here we have 56% trade
efficiency<00:05:07.889> here<00:05:08.250> in<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.520> income<00:05:08.970> marker

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
efficiency here in the income marker

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.350 
efficiency here in the income marker
what<00:05:10.470> that<00:05:10.620> means<00:05:10.800> is<00:05:10.949> we<00:05:11.069> get<00:05:11.220> 56<00:05:11.819> percent<00:05:12.270> of

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
what that means is we get 56 percent of

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.700 
what that means is we get 56 percent of
the<00:05:12.449> money<00:05:12.630> that<00:05:12.840> we<00:05:12.960> would<00:05:13.169> normally<00:05:13.319> be

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
the money that we would normally be

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.189 
the money that we would normally be
getting<00:05:13.979> from<00:05:14.160> this<00:05:14.310> center<00:05:14.610> of<00:05:14.729> trade<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.840> our

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
getting from this center of trade so our

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.779 
getting from this center of trade so our
actual<00:05:16.650> value<00:05:16.740> is<00:05:17.009> a<00:05:17.130> little<00:05:17.370> higher<00:05:17.580> than

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
actual value is a little higher than

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.490 
actual value is a little higher than
this<00:05:17.910> it's<00:05:18.180> probably<00:05:18.449> about<00:05:18.569> twice<00:05:18.900> this<00:05:19.199> so

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
this it's probably about twice this so

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.719 
this it's probably about twice this so
we're<00:05:19.620> actually<00:05:19.740> getting<00:05:20.009> somewhere<00:05:20.160> close

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
we're actually getting somewhere close

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.290 
we're actually getting somewhere close
to<00:05:20.759> 40<00:05:21.300> or<00:05:21.419> 50<00:05:21.810> out<00:05:21.960> of<00:05:22.130> 886<00:05:23.130> that's<00:05:23.910> a<00:05:24.030> large

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
to 40 or 50 out of 886 that's a large

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.659 
to 40 or 50 out of 886 that's a large
number<00:05:24.569> of<00:05:24.960> course<00:05:25.199> it's<00:05:25.319> not<00:05:25.440> all<00:05:25.650> of<00:05:25.800> it

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
number of course it's not all of it

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.760 
number of course it's not all of it
but<00:05:27.060> you<00:05:27.449> know<00:05:27.539> that's<00:05:28.139> as<00:05:28.349> good<00:05:28.470> as<00:05:28.590> we<00:05:28.680> can

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
but you know that's as good as we can

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.100 
but you know that's as good as we can
get<00:05:28.979> right<00:05:29.160> now<00:05:29.300> now<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.449> should<00:05:30.630> be<00:05:30.750> noted

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
get right now now it should be noted

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.170 
get right now now it should be noted
that<00:05:31.710> you<00:05:31.889> can<00:05:32.039> actually<00:05:32.190> get<00:05:32.490> over<00:05:32.849> a<00:05:32.880> hundred

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
that you can actually get over a hundred

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.460 
that you can actually get over a hundred
percent<00:05:33.539> you<00:05:33.840> know<00:05:33.960> your<00:05:34.169> trade<00:05:34.440> or

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
percent you know your trade or

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.930 
percent you know your trade or
production<00:05:34.979> efficiency<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.639> that<00:05:35.789> will

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
production efficiency and that will

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.460 
production efficiency and that will
allow<00:05:36.150> you<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.360> get<00:05:36.509> more<00:05:36.570> money<00:05:36.990> than<00:05:37.349> you're

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
allow you to get more money than you're

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.409 
allow you to get more money than you're
actually<00:05:37.919> theoretically<00:05:38.849> supposed<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.330> be

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
actually theoretically supposed to be

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.659 
actually theoretically supposed to be
able<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.750> get<00:05:39.949> that's<00:05:40.949> just<00:05:41.070> kinda<00:05:41.490> how<00:05:41.580> it

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
able to get that's just kinda how it

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.219 
able to get that's just kinda how it
works<00:05:41.940> but<00:05:42.210> you're<00:05:42.360> normally<00:05:42.690> not<00:05:42.840> gonna<00:05:42.960> see

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
works but you're normally not gonna see

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.240 
works but you're normally not gonna see
that<00:05:43.259> unless<00:05:43.560> you're<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.889> only<00:05:44.099> person

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
that unless you're the only person

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.790 
that unless you're the only person
trading<00:05:44.910> that's<00:05:45.750> extremely<00:05:46.229> unlikely<00:05:46.349> to

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
trading that's extremely unlikely to

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.710 
trading that's extremely unlikely to
happen<00:05:46.979> in<00:05:47.220> Europe<00:05:47.400> but<00:05:47.970> it<00:05:48.120> may<00:05:48.270> happen<00:05:48.630> in

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
happen in Europe but it may happen in

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.360 
happen in Europe but it may happen in
the<00:05:48.750> new<00:05:48.990> world<00:05:49.229> because<00:05:49.650> you<00:05:49.770> can<00:05:49.889> only<00:05:49.979> trade

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
the new world because you can only trade

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.649 
the new world because you can only trade
in<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.639> center<00:05:50.880> a<00:05:50.940> trade<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:51.240> you<00:05:51.479> actually

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
in the center a trade that you actually

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.589 
in the center a trade that you actually
know<00:05:52.020> about<00:05:52.349> so<00:05:53.190> if<00:05:53.460> somebody<00:05:54.120> creates<00:05:54.449> the

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
know about so if somebody creates the

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.779 
know about so if somebody creates the
center<00:05:54.840> of<00:05:54.930> trade<00:05:55.050> Mexico<00:05:55.830> then<00:05:56.520> they<00:05:56.639> can

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
center of trade Mexico then they can

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.219 
center of trade Mexico then they can
have<00:05:56.970> a<00:05:57.000> whole<00:05:57.240> lot<00:05:57.419> of<00:05:57.449> money<00:05:57.659> for<00:05:57.960> a<00:05:58.020> whole

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
have a whole lot of money for a whole

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:59.809 
have a whole lot of money for a whole
long<00:05:58.470> time<00:05:58.500> because<00:05:59.159> all<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.460> Mexican

00:05:59.809 --> 00:05:59.819 
long time because all the Mexican

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.610 
long time because all the Mexican
provinces<00:06:00.330> will<00:06:00.449> be<00:06:00.539> trading<00:06:00.930> there<00:06:01.110> but<00:06:01.409> only

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
provinces will be trading there but only

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.920 
provinces will be trading there but only
the<00:06:02.009> country<00:06:02.340> who<00:06:02.639> actually<00:06:03.030> established<00:06:03.870> the

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
the country who actually established the

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.510 
the country who actually established the
colonies<00:06:04.349> there<00:06:04.530> and<00:06:04.710> maybe<00:06:04.889> some<00:06:05.159> native

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
colonies there and maybe some native

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.820 
colonies there and maybe some native
neighbors<00:06:05.970> actually<00:06:06.900> know<00:06:07.289> that<00:06:07.500> the<00:06:07.590> center

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
neighbors actually know that the center

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.560 
neighbors actually know that the center
of<00:06:07.919> trade<00:06:08.039> exists<00:06:08.669> of<00:06:09.120> course<00:06:09.180> eventually

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
of trade exists of course eventually

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.390 
of trade exists of course eventually
people<00:06:09.930> will<00:06:10.169> find<00:06:10.470> it<00:06:10.590> out<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:10.949> since<00:06:11.250> it's

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
people will find it out and since it's

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.950 
people will find it out and since it's
so<00:06:11.580> valuable<00:06:11.759> they'll<00:06:12.150> send<00:06:12.449> their<00:06:12.570> merchants

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
so valuable they'll send their merchants

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.260 
so valuable they'll send their merchants
there<00:06:13.080> to<00:06:13.199> compete<00:06:13.500> so<00:06:14.280> it<00:06:14.460> leads<00:06:14.699> you<00:06:14.820> to<00:06:14.940> ask

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
there to compete so it leads you to ask

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.600 
there to compete so it leads you to ask
whether<00:06:15.599> you<00:06:15.750> should<00:06:15.810> spread<00:06:16.229> them<00:06:16.320> out<00:06:16.610> or

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
whether you should spread them out or

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.510 
whether you should spread them out or
whether<00:06:18.180> you<00:06:18.360> should<00:06:18.630> concentrate<00:06:19.280> my<00:06:20.280> advice

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
whether you should concentrate my advice

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.370 
whether you should concentrate my advice
to<00:06:20.729> be<00:06:20.820> there<00:06:20.969> generally<00:06:21.419> to<00:06:21.539> concentrate<00:06:22.199> on

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
to be there generally to concentrate on

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.439 
to be there generally to concentrate on
a<00:06:22.409> one<00:06:22.740> or<00:06:22.860> two<00:06:23.039> valuable<00:06:23.639> centers<00:06:24.060> to<00:06:24.180> trade

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
a one or two valuable centers to trade

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.390 
a one or two valuable centers to trade
with<00:06:24.990> people<00:06:25.289> who<00:06:25.380> aren't<00:06:25.560> very<00:06:25.680> mad<00:06:26.009> at<00:06:26.190> you

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
with people who aren't very mad at you

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.909 
with people who aren't very mad at you
for<00:06:26.820> instance<00:06:27.120> Spain<00:06:27.780> is<00:06:27.930> just<00:06:28.139> served<00:06:28.349> France

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
for instance Spain is just served France

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.189 
for instance Spain is just served France
has<00:06:29.039> just<00:06:29.219> declared<00:06:29.340> war<00:06:29.610> on<00:06:29.789> me<00:06:29.909> so<00:06:30.780> there<00:06:30.930> if

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
has just declared war on me so there if

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:33.260 
has just declared war on me so there if
I<00:06:31.380> put<00:06:31.620> too<00:06:31.860> many<00:06:31.979> merchants<00:06:32.460> here<00:06:32.669> they're

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
I put too many merchants here they're

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.020 
I put too many merchants here they're
going<00:06:33.449> to<00:06:33.539> embargo<00:06:34.320> me<00:06:34.500> and<00:06:35.190> what<00:06:35.550> an<00:06:35.639> embargo

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
going to embargo me and what an embargo

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.219 
going to embargo me and what an embargo
means<00:06:36.210> is<00:06:36.330> my<00:06:36.449> merchants<00:06:36.810> can't<00:06:37.020> trade

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
means is my merchants can't trade

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:38.659 
means is my merchants can't trade
anymore<00:06:37.440> so<00:06:37.830> they're<00:06:37.979> not<00:06:38.070> making<00:06:38.250> much<00:06:38.520> money

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
anymore so they're not making much money

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.010 
anymore so they're not making much money
and<00:06:38.940> they're<00:06:39.030> gonna<00:06:39.120> be<00:06:39.300> easy<00:06:39.509> to<00:06:39.690> compete

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
and they're gonna be easy to compete

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.110 
and they're gonna be easy to compete
away<00:06:40.229> I<00:06:40.469> don't<00:06:40.949> want<00:06:41.099> that<00:06:41.310> so<00:06:41.639> I'd<00:06:41.759> rather<00:06:41.909> go

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
away I don't want that so I'd rather go

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.999 
away I don't want that so I'd rather go
with<00:06:42.270> people<00:06:42.570> like<00:06:42.690> Levesque<00:06:43.199> or<00:06:43.440> maybe<00:06:43.590> Spain

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
with people like Levesque or maybe Spain

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.310 
with people like Levesque or maybe Spain
or<00:06:44.370> Russia<00:06:44.610> people<00:06:45.000> who<00:06:45.210> don't<00:06:45.389> hate<00:06:46.020> me<00:06:46.169> too

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
or Russia people who don't hate me too

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.920 
or Russia people who don't hate me too
much<00:06:46.500> so<00:06:46.770> they'll<00:06:47.520> let<00:06:47.699> me<00:06:47.820> keep<00:06:47.969> trading<00:06:48.270> of

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
much so they'll let me keep trading of

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.510 
much so they'll let me keep trading of
course<00:06:49.169> if<00:06:49.259> you<00:06:49.349> get<00:06:49.469> too<00:06:49.680> successful<00:06:49.919> or<00:06:50.490> you

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
course if you get too successful or you

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.300 
course if you get too successful or you
become<00:06:50.729> too<00:06:51.090> infamous<00:06:51.930> then<00:06:52.289> even<00:06:52.949> your<00:06:53.070> trade

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
become too infamous then even your trade

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.620 
become too infamous then even your trade
partners<00:06:53.729> may<00:06:53.909> decide<00:06:54.150> they<00:06:54.270> don't<00:06:54.360> want<00:06:54.479> to

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
partners may decide they don't want to

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.209 
partners may decide they don't want to
trade<00:06:54.810> with<00:06:54.990> you<00:06:55.110> anymore<00:06:55.349> and<00:06:55.740> that's<00:06:55.889> just<00:06:56.130> a

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:56.219 
trade with you anymore and that's just a

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:59.599 
trade with you anymore and that's just a
risk<00:06:56.430> that<00:06:56.550> they<00:06:56.789> take<00:06:56.969> diplomatically
