00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:04.980 

let's<00:00:03.999> look<00:00:04.120> at<00:00:04.270> a<00:00:04.299> couple<00:00:04.359> things<00:00:04.750> real<00:00:04.839> quick

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:04.990 
let's look at a couple things real quick

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.410 
let's look at a couple things real quick
here<00:00:05.799> about<00:00:06.839> how<00:00:07.839> it<00:00:07.990> sets<00:00:08.200> up<00:00:08.700> as<00:00:09.700> I<00:00:10.210> said

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
here about how it sets up as I said

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.330 
here about how it sets up as I said
before<00:00:10.450> I<00:00:10.719> don't<00:00:11.080> have<00:00:11.290> anything<00:00:11.559> in<00:00:11.980> this

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
before I don't have anything in this

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.999 
before I don't have anything in this
particular<00:00:12.880> Bank<00:00:13.570> it's<00:00:14.049> set<00:00:14.320> for<00:00:14.349> delay<00:00:14.799> but

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
particular Bank it's set for delay but

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.390 
particular Bank it's set for delay but
that's<00:00:15.160> just<00:00:15.339> what<00:00:15.519> was<00:00:15.639> there<00:00:15.969> in<00:00:16.960> this<00:00:17.770> in

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
that's just what was there in this in

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.220 
that's just what was there in this in
this<00:00:18.610> scene<00:00:18.910> when<00:00:19.120> I<00:00:19.150> when<00:00:19.660> I<00:00:19.690> have<00:00:19.930> modified

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
this scene when I when I have modified

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.670 
this scene when I when I have modified
it<00:00:20.410> so<00:00:21.190> let's<00:00:21.610> say<00:00:21.790> I<00:00:21.820> want<00:00:22.210> it<00:00:22.300> as<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:23.170> special

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
it so let's say I want it as a special

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.610 
it so let's say I want it as a special
distortion<00:00:24.280> if<00:00:24.790> you<00:00:24.910> press<00:00:25.390> here<00:00:25.900> and<00:00:26.440> says

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.620 
distortion if you press here and says

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.100 
distortion if you press here and says
model<00:00:26.980> select<00:00:27.220> press<00:00:27.460> /<00:00:27.640> type<00:00:27.850> you<00:00:28.810> press<00:00:29.080> down

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
model select press / type you press down

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.650 
model select press / type you press down
and<00:00:29.680> now<00:00:30.310> it's<00:00:30.520> a<00:00:30.640> modulation<00:00:31.150> blue<00:00:31.540> is

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
and now it's a modulation blue is

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.240 
and now it's a modulation blue is
modulation<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:34.000> it's<00:00:34.240> a<00:00:35.160> distortion<00:00:36.160> the

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
modulation now it's a distortion the

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.340 
modulation now it's a distortion the
gold<00:00:36.490> kind<00:00:37.060> of<00:00:37.150> yellow<00:00:37.360> sound<00:00:37.690> ones<00:00:38.200> are

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
gold kind of yellow sound ones are

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.510 
gold kind of yellow sound ones are
distortion<00:00:38.860> so<00:00:39.370> let's<00:00:39.580> say<00:00:39.670> I<00:00:39.760> want<00:00:40.000> to<00:00:40.090> go<00:00:40.240> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
distortion so let's say I want to go to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.069 
distortion so let's say I want to go to
something<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.760> little<00:00:42.940> heavier<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:48.960> there's<00:00:49.960> a

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
something a little heavier and there's a

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.250 
something a little heavier and there's a
buzz<00:00:50.500> space<00:00:54.030> buzz<00:00:55.030> pie<00:00:55.360> that's<00:00:55.690> modeled<00:00:56.140> after

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
buzz space buzz pie that's modeled after

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.670 
buzz space buzz pie that's modeled after
a<00:00:56.440> big<00:00:56.920> muff<00:00:57.270> pie<00:00:58.270> in<00:00:58.570> which<00:00:58.690> harmonics<00:00:59.170> unit<00:00:59.500> I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
a big muff pie in which harmonics unit I

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.100 
a big muff pie in which harmonics unit I
asked<00:00:59.860> me<00:01:00.040> to<00:01:00.160> have<00:01:00.340> one<00:01:00.550> of<00:01:00.579> those<00:01:00.760> when<00:01:01.000> I<00:01:01.060> was

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
asked me to have one of those when I was

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.660 
asked me to have one of those when I was
in<00:01:02.110> my<00:01:02.380> teens<00:01:02.440> I<00:01:02.950> got<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.130> pretty<00:01:03.280> good<00:01:03.399> idea<00:01:03.489> of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
in my teens I got a pretty good idea of

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.510 
in my teens I got a pretty good idea of
what<00:01:03.820> they<00:01:03.910> sound<00:01:04.150> like

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.330 

okay<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.800> important<00:01:14.310> for

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
okay and now it's really important for

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.870 
okay and now it's really important for
me<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.730> all<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.120> my<00:01:16.130> sounds<00:01:17.130> are<00:01:17.310> pretty

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
me that all of my sounds are pretty

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.719 
me that all of my sounds are pretty
close<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.450> same<00:01:18.540> volume<00:01:19.640> because<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
close to the same volume because the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.340 
close to the same volume because the
kind<00:01:20.940> of<00:01:21.000> gigs<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.810> generally<00:01:22.200> had<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
kind of gigs I do we generally had a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
kind of gigs I do we generally had a
sound<00:01:22.650> man<00:01:22.890> who's<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> want<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.210> boost

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
sound man who's going to want to boost

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.280 
sound man who's going to want to boost
and<00:01:25.229> lower<00:01:25.410> by<00:01:25.710> my<00:01:26.270> volumes<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.450> solos<00:01:27.869> I

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and lower by my volumes for solos I

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.570 
and lower by my volumes for solos I
don't<00:01:28.500> necessarily<00:01:28.860> take<00:01:29.220> care<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
don't necessarily take care of that

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.870 
don't necessarily take care of that
myself<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.830> what<00:01:31.830> I'm<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.220> now<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
myself so what I'm going to do now is is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.060 
myself so what I'm going to do now is is
match<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.390> output<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.440> close<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.830> can<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
match the output as close as I can to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.359 
match the output as close as I can to
the<00:01:35.729> unit<00:01:36.330> by<00:01:36.479> pass<00:01:36.720> completion<00:01:37.260> so

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.290 

it's<00:01:41.369> quite<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> bit<00:01:41.820> louder

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.930 

no<00:01:44.510> here

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
no here

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.810 
no here
and<00:01:46.180> we<00:01:46.450> see<00:01:46.630> this<00:01:46.720> bottom<00:01:47.050> one<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.170> output<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
and we see this bottom one is output and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.899 
and we see this bottom one is output and
we<00:01:48.910> dial<00:01:49.120> it<00:01:49.270> back

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.540 

you

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.490 

then

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.570 

getting<00:02:02.710> pretty<00:02:02.860> close

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
getting pretty close

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.700 
getting pretty close
bring<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.300> down<00:02:05.330> just<00:02:05.480> a<00:02:05.690> little<00:02:05.780> bit<00:02:05.900> more

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.200 

and<00:02:08.830> just<00:02:09.370> because<00:02:09.460> I<00:02:09.610> feel<00:02:09.640> like<00:02:09.820> I'm<00:02:10.120> gonna

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
and just because I feel like I'm gonna

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.760 
and just because I feel like I'm gonna
bring<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> drive<00:02:10.660> up<00:02:10.930> a<00:02:11.020> little<00:02:11.230> bit

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.410 

you'll<00:02:15.280> notice<00:02:15.490> as<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.700> bring<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.090> output

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
you'll notice as you bring the output

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.180 
you'll notice as you bring the output
down<00:02:16.600> just<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:17.020> real<00:02:17.320> stompbox<00:02:17.950> it's

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
down just like a real stompbox it's

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.950 
down just like a real stompbox it's
hitting<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.640> front<00:02:18.820> of<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.030> amp<00:02:19.240> differently

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
hitting the front of the amp differently

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.340 
hitting the front of the amp differently
so<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:21.520> tone<00:02:22.210> changes

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.210 

pretty<00:02:28.980> close<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:30.020> think<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:33.650> mean<00:02:34.650> that's<00:02:34.740> cloud

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
pretty close I think I mean that's cloud

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.370 
pretty close I think I mean that's cloud
as<00:02:35.340> close<00:02:35.490> as<00:02:35.610> we're<00:02:35.730> going<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.940> get<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.170> I'm

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
as close as we're going to get it so I'm

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.650 
as close as we're going to get it so I'm
setting<00:02:40.770> up<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.980> scene<00:02:41.220> super<00:02:42.030> super<00:02:42.210> simple

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
setting up a scene super super simple

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.720 
setting up a scene super super simple
all<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.840> did<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.290> took<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.500> scene<00:02:43.830> called<00:02:44.100> my

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
all I did is I took the scene called my

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.840 
all I did is I took the scene called my
scratch<00:02:45.150> pad<00:02:45.540> scene<00:02:46.200> because<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.700> was<00:02:47.820> a

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
scratch pad scene because it was a

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.510 
scratch pad scene because it was a
scratch<00:02:48.120> pad<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:49.110> set<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.650> took<00:02:50.430> me

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
scratch pad and I set it up took me

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.970 
scratch pad and I set it up took me
about<00:02:50.580> five<00:02:50.940> minutes<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.450> put<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:51.990> tube

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
about five minutes to put a tube

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.400 
about five minutes to put a tube
compressor<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.810> came<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.080> that

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
compressor in the and it came on that

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.170 
compressor in the and it came on that
state<00:02:58.980> because<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.400> state<00:02:59.640> we<00:02:59.730> left<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.060> in

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
state because that state we left it in

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.750 
state because that state we left it in

compressor<00:03:04.490> just<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.640> little<00:03:05.790> bit<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.060> little

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
compressor just a little bit a little

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.850 
compressor just a little bit a little
bit<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.830> extra<00:03:07.920> when<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.430> need<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.030> then

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.630 

screamer

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.460

a channel to drive when I want to go a
little<00:03:19.590> harder<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.580> think<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.030> showed

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
little harder and I think we just showed

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.210 
little harder and I think we just showed
you<00:03:21.480> set<00:03:21.780> up<00:03:21.960> I<00:03:22.200> want<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.560> go<00:03:22.620> even<00:03:22.860> harder<00:03:22.950> than

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
you set up I want to go even harder than

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.350 
you set up I want to go even harder than
that<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:24.870> do<00:03:25.020> a<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:28.040> big<00:03:29.040> muff<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.490> fact<00:03:29.760> being

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
that I can do a a big muff in fact being

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.280 
that I can do a a big muff in fact being
it's<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> different<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:32.430> different<00:03:33.290> bank

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
it's in a different in a different bank

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:50.490 
it's in a different in a different bank
I<00:03:34.530> can<00:03:34.770> actually<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:37.459> combinations<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.610> them

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.200 

me

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
me

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.210 
me
Oh

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.380 

not<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> big<00:03:57.459> fan<00:03:57.610> of<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:57.940> but<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.120> can<00:03:58.270> do<00:03:58.360> it

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
not a big fan of that but you can do it

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.050 
not a big fan of that but you can do it
okay<00:03:58.930> I'm<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:02.470> we've<00:04:02.709> got<00:04:02.920> great<00:04:03.310> distortions

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
okay I'm so we've got great distortions

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.089 
okay I'm so we've got great distortions
I<00:04:04.239> again<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:04.989> disagree<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.709> guy<00:04:05.800> said<00:04:06.010> the

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
I again I disagree the guy said the

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.790 
I again I disagree the guy said the
distortion<00:04:06.520> suck<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:06.880> think<00:04:07.060> they<00:04:07.180> sound

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
distortion suck I think they sound

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.540 
distortion suck I think they sound
pretty<00:04:08.800> close<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.310> real<00:04:09.520> deal<00:04:09.760> the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
pretty close to the real deal the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.190 
pretty close to the real deal the
modulations<00:04:12.550> are<00:04:12.730> gorgeous<00:04:13.269> besides<00:04:14.019> the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
modulations are gorgeous besides the

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.270 
modulations are gorgeous besides the
phase<00:04:14.410> shifter<00:04:15.600> chorus<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:16.919> opto<00:04:17.919> tremolo

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
phase shifter chorus and opto tremolo

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.409 
phase shifter chorus and opto tremolo
that<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.459> have<00:04:18.730> you've<00:04:18.880> got<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:19.030> choice<00:04:19.239> of

that I have you've got a choice of
several<00:04:19.660> different<00:04:20.019> kinds<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.260> planter's

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
several different kinds of planter's

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.500 
several different kinds of planter's
fact<00:04:21.280> let's<00:04:21.489> uh<00:04:21.639> let's<00:04:21.790> see<00:04:22.030> if<00:04:22.090> we<00:04:22.150> can<00:04:22.300> find

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
fact let's uh let's see if we can find

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.050 
fact let's uh let's see if we can find
one<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.810> those<00:04:23.190> real<00:04:24.190> quick<00:04:24.490> in<00:04:24.700> one<00:04:24.880> of<00:04:24.910> the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
one of those real quick in one of the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.800 
one of those real quick in one of the
other<00:04:25.270> scenes<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:26.700> believe<00:04:28.169> that<00:04:29.169> if<00:04:29.620> we<00:04:29.950> go

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
other scenes I believe that if we go

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.629 
other scenes I believe that if we go
here<00:04:31.810> we<00:04:31.990> will<00:04:32.919> find<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.610> plan<00:04:33.910> under<00:04:34.180> there

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
here we will find a plan under there

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.300 
here we will find a plan under there
somewhere<00:04:36.639> now<00:04:37.600> oh<00:04:37.930> but<00:04:38.830> it<00:04:38.950> does<00:04:38.979> have<00:04:39.280> a

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
somewhere now oh but it does have a

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.930 
somewhere now oh but it does have a
really<00:04:39.639> nice<00:04:40.620> Leslie<00:04:41.620> emulation<00:04:42.100> which<00:04:42.820> is

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
really nice Leslie emulation which is

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.190 
really nice Leslie emulation which is
really<00:04:43.150> cool<00:04:43.419> let's<00:04:43.630> turn<00:04:43.810> everything<00:04:43.990> off

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
really cool let's turn everything off

medico idea hook of an expression pedal
to<00:05:10.820> it<00:05:10.970> you<00:05:11.090> can<00:05:11.240> speed<00:05:11.570> up<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:11.950> slow<00:05:12.950> down

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
to it you can speed up and slow down
