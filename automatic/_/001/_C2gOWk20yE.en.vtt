guess<00:00:30.269> we'll<00:00:30.449> start<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:32.070> if

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
guess we'll start with this and see if

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.819 
guess we'll start with this and see if
it's<00:00:33.059> any<00:00:33.239> different<00:00:33.540> than<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> seasons<00:00:34.530> one

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it's any different than the seasons one

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.860 
it's any different than the seasons one
I<00:00:35.130> know<00:00:35.190> these<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.149> three<00:00:36.540> food

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870

I know these just have three food
collectibles<00:00:38.090> get<00:00:39.090> bronzes<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.660> Silver's<00:00:40.200> I

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
collectibles get bronzes and Silver's I

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.709 
collectibles get bronzes and Silver's I
assume<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> seasons<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.000> too<00:00:42.059> if

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
assume the seasons are like that too if

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.990 
assume the seasons are like that too if
we<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.440> an<00:00:43.559> elite<00:00:43.950> it'd<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.460> nice<00:00:44.670> but

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
we get an elite it'd be nice but

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.959 
we get an elite it'd be nice but
otherwise<00:00:45.390> these<00:00:45.989> aren't<00:00:46.559> too<00:00:46.739> valuable<00:00:47.100> get

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
otherwise these aren't too valuable get

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.709 
otherwise these aren't too valuable get
green<00:00:48.570> beans<00:00:49.610> okay<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.030> seasons<00:00:51.239> ones

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719

on the Jets now but we'll go back to the

on the Jets now but we'll go back to the
thanksgiving<00:01:24.720> classic<00:01:25.259> seasons<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.759> got

thanksgiving classic seasons we got

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.690 
thanksgiving classic seasons we got
chicken<00:01:27.600> I'll<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.650> power<00:01:28.920> through<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.490> rest

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
chicken I'll just power through the rest

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.870 
chicken I'll just power through the rest
of<00:01:29.880> these<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.030> don't<00:01:30.390> think<00:01:30.630> I'll<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.990> much<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
of these I don't think I'll get much and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
of these I don't think I'll get much and
here<00:01:32.880> i<00:01:32.909> mean<00:01:33.119> there's<00:01:33.299> always<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.869> chance

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
here i mean there's always the chance

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.350 
here i mean there's always the chance
but<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.710> guess<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.979> i<00:01:35.340> won't<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.759> an<00:01:35.909> elite

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
but my guess is i won't get an elite

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.490 
but my guess is i won't get an elite
based<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.140> my<00:01:37.320> look<00:01:37.560> glazed<00:01:38.420> carrots<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.780> i

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
based on my look glazed carrots and i

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.020 
based on my look glazed carrots and i
don't<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:40.950> i'm<00:01:41.100> gonna<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.369> doing<00:01:41.400> any<00:01:41.880> of

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
don't think i'm gonna be doing any of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.319 
don't think i'm gonna be doing any of
those<00:01:42.979> collections<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> cornucopia
