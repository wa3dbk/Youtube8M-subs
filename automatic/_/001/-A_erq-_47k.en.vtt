out there to practice catching the board

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.760 
out there to practice catching the board
is<00:02:17.450> what's<00:02:18.450> going<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.690> handle<00:02:19.050> basically<00:02:19.560> all

how far my toes are off the side of the
board<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.710> gives<00:02:31.950> me<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> super<00:02:33.120> ability<00:02:34.050> to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
board that gives me a super ability to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.350 
board that gives me a super ability to
scoop<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.740> board<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.430> gives<00:02:35.760> me<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.970> ton

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
scoop the board and just gives me a ton

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.780 
scoop the board and just gives me a ton
of<00:02:36.390> leverage<00:02:37.080> over<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.590> side<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.220> actually

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
of leverage over the side I actually

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.900 
of leverage over the side I actually
like<00:02:39.180> curve<00:02:39.780> my<00:02:40.080> toes<00:02:40.410> down<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.430> over<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
side and then just shoot it straight

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.880 
side and then just shoot it straight
back<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.970> that's<00:02:45.150> what<00:02:45.330> gives<00:02:45.510> me<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.900> super

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
back and that's what gives me that super

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.430 
back and that's what gives me that super
scooped<00:02:47.640> tre<00:02:48.120> flip<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.720> then<00:02:48.870> my<00:02:49.050> front<00:02:49.350> foot

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
scooped tre flip and then my front foot

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.620 
scooped tre flip and then my front foot
you'll<00:02:49.770> notice<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.550> kind<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.910> let<00:02:51.600> it
