00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.679 

so<00:00:26.339> today<00:00:26.609> we're<00:00:26.789> working<00:00:26.909> on<00:00:27.089> grip<00:00:27.329> strength

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
so today we're working on grip strength

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.409 
so today we're working on grip strength
and<00:00:27.989> a<00:00:28.439> lot<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.099> workouts<00:00:29.819> is<00:00:29.970> also<00:00:30.210> tiny

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
and a lot of the workouts is also tiny

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.919 
and a lot of the workouts is also tiny
core<00:00:31.850> this<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.910> kind<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.359> a<00:00:33.449> modified

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:33.929 
core this is kind of a modified

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.650 
core this is kind of a modified
kettlebell<00:00:34.739> row<00:00:35.039> that<00:00:35.250> we're<00:00:35.399> doing<00:00:35.660> here

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
kettlebell row that we're doing here

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.630 
kettlebell row that we're doing here
where<00:00:36.960> we're<00:00:37.530> really<00:00:37.710> using<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.129> lot<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.429> core

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
where we're really using a lot of core

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.520 
where we're really using a lot of core
to<00:00:38.699> help<00:00:38.820> stabilize<00:00:39.179> your<00:00:39.570> body<00:00:42.019> 8<00:00:43.019> to<00:00:43.260> 12

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
to help stabilize your body 8 to 12

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.140 
to help stabilize your body 8 to 12
right<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.980> there<00:00:44.190> nice<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.179> smooth

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.660 

core<00:00:51.990> on<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.230> block<00:00:52.470> is<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.950> main<00:00:53.130> stabilizer

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
core on the block is you main stabilizer

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.790 
core on the block is you main stabilizer
and<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.510> grip<00:00:54.720> strength<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.260> me<00:00:55.380> is<00:00:55.560> really

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and the grip strength for me is really

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
and the grip strength for me is really
important<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.370> coming<00:00:57.090> back<00:00:57.240> from<00:00:57.540> having

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
important just coming back from having

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.960 
important just coming back from having
such<00:00:58.110> a<00:00:58.140> big<00:00:58.380> break<00:00:58.650> I<00:00:58.920> really<00:00:59.610> realize

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
such a big break I really realize

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.430 
such a big break I really realize
especially<00:01:00.210> riding<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.780> 450<00:01:01.110> on<00:01:01.380> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
especially riding the 450 on the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
especially riding the 450 on the
motocross<00:01:01.710> track<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.280> arms<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.120> pumping<00:01:03.420> up

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
motocross track just arms are pumping up

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.900 
motocross track just arms are pumping up
I'm<00:01:03.870> weak<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.740> because<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.580> weak<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
I'm weak so that because I'm weak and

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.000 
I'm weak so that because I'm weak and
holding<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> lot<00:01:06.570> tighter<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.140> holding<00:01:07.920> on

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
holding on a lot tighter and holding on

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.740 
holding on a lot tighter and holding on
a<00:01:08.070> lot<00:01:08.190> tighter<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.700> what's<00:01:08.970> blowing<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.480> arms

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
a lot tighter is what's blowing my arms

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.050 
a lot tighter is what's blowing my arms
up<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.830> be<00:01:10.950> strong<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.700> more

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
up so if I can be strong and more

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.090 
up so if I can be strong and more
confident<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:13.230> have<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> hold<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.890> tight

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
confident and not have to hold so tight

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
confident and not have to hold so tight
well<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:14.940> not<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.360> using<00:01:16.050> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
well then I'm not you know using that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
well then I'm not you know using that
muscle<00:01:16.320> group<00:01:16.620> so<00:01:16.800> much<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.610> should<00:01:17.790> be

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
muscle group so much and I should be

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.880 
muscle group so much and I should be
able<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> sustain<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.720> workout<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.710> block

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
able to sustain a workout on the block

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.670 
able to sustain a workout on the block
for<00:01:20.160> a<00:01:20.190> lot<00:01:20.550> longer<00:01:20.700> we're<00:01:21.090> using<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.680> rope

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
for a lot longer we're using the rope

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.609 
for a lot longer we're using the rope
for<00:01:23.670> grip<00:01:24.510> strength<00:01:24.840> instead<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.470> just

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
for grip strength instead of just

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.960 
for grip strength instead of just
holding<00:01:25.860> onto<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.190> bar<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> be

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
holding onto the bar this is going to be

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.370 
holding onto the bar this is going to be
a<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.270> more<00:01:27.450> difficult<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.930> Livan<00:01:28.200> do

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
a bit more difficult to Livan do

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
a bit more difficult to Livan do
especially<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.280> our<00:01:29.460> slow<00:01:29.700> movements<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
especially with our slow movements and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.550 
especially with our slow movements and
the<00:01:30.420> time<00:01:30.660> on<00:01:30.840> your<00:01:30.960> finishing<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.410> we're

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the time on your finishing that we're

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560 
the time on your finishing that we're
going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:33.030> we're<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.510> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
going to be on and then we're going to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.750 
going to be on and then we're going to
be<00:01:33.830> throwing<00:01:34.830> our<00:01:35.070> feet<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.340> we're<00:01:35.580> going<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
be throwing our feet up we're going to

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.670 
be throwing our feet up we're going to
just<00:01:35.910> use<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.180> tire<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:36.869> pull<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
just use the tire it's here pull that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.260 
just use the tire it's here pull that
thing<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.430> we're<00:01:38.580> basically<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
thing up and then we're basically in a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.790 
thing up and then we're basically in a
sense<00:01:39.540> we're<00:01:39.750> doing<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.080> pull<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
sense we're doing a pull up like you

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.070 
sense we're doing a pull up like you
would<00:01:41.040> using<00:01:41.729> before<00:01:42.330> on<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> wall<00:01:42.780> but

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
would using before on the wall but

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.740 
would using before on the wall but
because<00:01:43.440> there<00:01:43.560> peter<00:01:43.800> up<00:01:44.450> it's<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.690> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
because there peter up it's going to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.330 
because there peter up it's going to
just<00:01:45.930> lighten<00:01:46.380> some<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.710> body<00:01:46.920> weight

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.640 

nice<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.670> smooth

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.340 

today<00:01:55.650> we're<00:01:56.490> doing<00:01:56.700> grip<00:01:57.540> strength<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.050> key

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
today we're doing grip strength is a key

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.930 
today we're doing grip strength is a key
thing

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
thing

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.360 
thing
core<00:01:59.940> stability<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> bigger<00:02:01.740> jump<00:02:02.130> city

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
core stability for the bigger jump city

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.700 
core stability for the bigger jump city
jumps<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.180> then<00:02:03.360> also<00:02:03.630> what<00:02:04.290> we're<00:02:04.440> doing<00:02:04.620> is

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
jumps and then also what we're doing is

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.920 
jumps and then also what we're doing is
obviously<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.340> size<00:02:05.520> building<00:02:06.120> and<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.720> we're

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
obviously the size building and if we're

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.290 
obviously the size building and if we're
going<00:02:07.140> much<00:02:07.710> more<00:02:07.980> than<00:02:08.130> about<00:02:08.310> 45<00:02:08.760> minutes<00:02:09.240> of

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
going much more than about 45 minutes of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.070 
going much more than about 45 minutes of
actual<00:02:09.980> strength<00:02:10.980> like<00:02:11.580> weight<00:02:12.060> lifting<00:02:12.300> we

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
actual strength like weight lifting we

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.800 
actual strength like weight lifting we
start<00:02:13.380> going<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.680> bit<00:02:13.830> catabolic<00:02:14.370> meaning<00:02:14.880> your

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
start going a bit catabolic meaning your

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.840 
start going a bit catabolic meaning your
body's<00:02:16.170> got<00:02:16.350> no<00:02:16.530> more<00:02:16.740> fuel<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.790> really<00:02:18.150> run<00:02:18.330> on
