00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
the based on solar and they have

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.680 
the based on solar and they have
different<00:02:36.250> qualities<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.000> different

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
different qualities of different

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.259 
different qualities of different
frequencies<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:38.590> it's<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.730> really<00:02:39.940> one

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269
