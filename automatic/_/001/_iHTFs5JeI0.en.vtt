and it's fun to share my life story I

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
know that it was yeah of course it and I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.169 
know that it was yeah of course it and I
think<00:01:36.110> that<00:01:36.380> was<00:01:36.560> also<00:01:36.740> kind<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.399> turning

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
think that was also kind of a turning

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.910 
think that was also kind of a turning
point<00:01:38.390> for<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.960> mean<00:01:39.140> you<00:01:39.289> started

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
point for you I mean you started

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.529 
point for you I mean you started
encouraging<00:01:40.340> people<00:01:40.789> and<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.240> think<00:01:41.300> that's

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
encouraging people and I think that's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.840 
encouraging people and I think that's
something<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.530> well<00:01:42.830> not<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.190> lot<00:01:43.369> of<00:01:43.429> us<00:01:43.640> get

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
something that well not a lot of us get

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.660 
something that well not a lot of us get
to<00:01:44.000> do<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:44.539> is<00:01:45.050> that<00:01:45.259> kind<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:45.619> what<00:01:46.100> also<00:01:46.280> keeps

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
to do so is that kind of what also keeps

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.380 
to do so is that kind of what also keeps
you<00:01:46.789> down<00:01:47.050> well<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.200> mean<00:01:49.119> from<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.300> beginning

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
like my reason to continue serving was

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.520 
like my reason to continue serving was
just<00:01:53.390> because<00:01:53.720> I<00:01:53.869> love<00:01:54.050> it<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.259> it's

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
just because I love it and it's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.370 
just because I love it and it's
something<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:55.009> wanted<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.340> try<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.700> do<00:01:56.380> so

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
something I wanted to try to do so

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.560 
something I wanted to try to do so
that's<00:01:57.560> kind<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:57.920> how<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.190> started

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
that's kind of how it started

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.919 
that's kind of how it started
I'm<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.590> professional<00:02:01.159> super<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:02.000> this<00:02:02.330> day<00:02:02.570> and

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
I'm a professional super to this day and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.880 
I'm a professional super to this day and
so<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:03.920> guess<00:02:04.159> along<00:02:04.670> with<00:02:04.909> surfing<00:02:05.390> comes<00:02:05.890> just

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
so I guess along with surfing comes just

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.539 
so I guess along with surfing comes just
