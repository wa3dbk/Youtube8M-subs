00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.210
 hello in this video I show you how 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.010
 elaborate these three cards 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.510
 congratulations are very easy to do and 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.400
 sure you have at home all 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.400
 materials needed to make them 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.800
 you will need a newspaper 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.990
 old watercolors paints in brush a 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.779
 black marker scissors a sheet that 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.550
 serve as the basis for the card you 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.110
 I recommend it to be a kind of paper something 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.330
 thick so that it supports the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.040
 watercolors tempera 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.290
 I have used for the three roles of 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.390
 a block of drawing to make them 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.000
 cut out three rectangles and then the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.920
 I've doubled it in half last 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.650
 rounded its corners with the help of 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.390
 a pair of scissors now that you know how it is 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.190
 the basis on which I will perform the three 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.800
 cards we will begin to decorate the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.630
 first for it you have to cut out a 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.149
 piece of newspaper from a 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.340
 approximate size of the card in the 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.280
 newspaper paper center draws a 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.780
 circle or figure you prefer 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.150
 cut out the figure 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.290
 now place the sheet on the card and 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.290
 fix one with duct tape 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.320
 once you've done this cut out 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.330
 tape strips of size 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.520
 prefer and stick it on the surface 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.700
 from tunisia you can leave the whole strip 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.410
 divide it into two or more parties seeks 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.530
 that all of them have a length 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.300
 approximate then pasted on the card and 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.590
 deforming the letters of the word or 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.590
 phrase you want to stamp 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.430
 once you've pasted the last 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.790
 piece of tape and have your 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.440
 Ready message mix tempura with water 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.390
 the mixture has to be pretty 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.160
 liquid so that when you run your finger over 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.050
 the bristles drop droplets of 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.820
 painting on paper before 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.530
 was completely dry gave way 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.270
 a cloth through the center of the circle to 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.970
 blur and extend the painting but 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.679
 this step is optional now yes when 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.090
 be dry remove the adhesive tape with 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.310
 which forms of your word or phrase 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.129
 then do the same with the paper of 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.870
 newspaper you will get one more circle or 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.700
 less perfect depending on the liquid 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.980
 that you have left latent and if any 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.629
 drop has been drained under the period 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.250
 mine as you see has the edges something 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.569
 irregular in any way I think that 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.780
 the effect it brings is not entirely 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.780
 wrong 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.860
 let's do the second of the cards 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.930
 for that, take a sheet of your newspaper 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.930
 and adhesive tape stickers on it 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.970
 after waiting with caution a 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.970
 adhesive tape 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.670
 You will see that part of the letters are 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.670
 stuck on its surface 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.379
 and now just cut with your 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.629
 scissors strips of masking tape and 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.260
 deforming the figure you want, I'm going to 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.260
 make two hearts 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.580
 If the adhesive tape does not stick well 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.240
 on the card you can use 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.240
 glue in bar 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.220
 I have also decided to write a message 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.990
 with black felt-tip pen after pasting and 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.400
 adhesive tape marking the cover of 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.400
 the card on the edges 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.790
 to make the third of the postcards 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.100
 paints a sheet of newspaper 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.980
 contemplas uses different colors and 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.660
 mix them with more you like wait 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.150
 dry the ego sticks on the sheet tape 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.980
 adhesive as we did previously 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.319
 taking off carefully 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.870
 this time I have decided to form a 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.670
 letter with the adhesive tape remember that 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.099
 you can use glue on bars if 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.930
 does not look good about anything if finally 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.890
 It is sprinkled with droplets of tempera 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.240
 the surface of the paper 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.310
 here you have the three cards 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.620
 finished as you see is really easy 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.740
 and you can make different designs in the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.060
 comments can you tell me what would you do 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.650
 I think it would be great that you will cheer up 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.660
 and will record a video showing our 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.250
 designs and if you do leave a comment 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.989
 in this with a link so we can 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.640
 see it or if you prefer you can also 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.930
 send a photo through any of 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.180
 the contact sections that 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.770
 you will find under the video here I leave you 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.200
 several links to other tutorials 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.669
 that could interest you and that's all 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.850
 dismissal until the next video up 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.850
 then
