00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.290
 today between a question of one 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.789
 answered a question from Marc Antoine 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.340
 nadeau of the plateau mont royal 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.349
 he asks me is it okay 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.360
 to add water to the paint 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.880
 we understand our paintings the water base 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.649
 for painting the view of everything but he 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.059
 ya for is it with age 

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:30.369
 paint water in paint 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:33.260
 to the water where he has answer is yes 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.940
 to some extent in fact 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.800
 manufacturers say up to 10% 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.870
 so can be added in the painting 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.730
 if we need it it's for 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.890
 even recommend I would say about 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.440
 outer surfaces to the extent 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.810
 possible not to alter the paint 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.760
 because we are still against the 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.480
 elements of the end the sun the rain 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.890
 moisture and that was so 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.480
 outside it really really 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.670
 limit as much as possible in 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.050
 interior paints 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.040
 it's a bit more tolerable then 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.820
 always in this by limiting itself to 10% 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.140
 in what sense in what 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.689
 circumstances are we going to buy from 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.180
 water to paint it can then 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.159
 maybe too much his main consciousness 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.990
 still something cutting 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.149
 cladding in convoy of which 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.399
 I use it as well as to the experts 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.109
 I have yet to master this is it 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.499
 that the miss is already causing very good 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:28.219
 but in here we used the suspicious 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:30.979
 of a dead baby I stay a little in my 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.329
 cutting to help the blur because 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.100
 black beige paint with the trend is 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.670
 thick enough thrown from the paint is 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.079
 too thick 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.229
 and when we put it on the surfaces 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.630
 it is actually syria can opinion 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.219
 it can him to the right s of the line 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.819
 especially that in the dark colors and 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.709
 contrasting so that about the reasons for the 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.029
 barbaud jean withdrawal at the cutout at 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.420
 someone to make a cut 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:56.119
 if we increase a little bit the content of 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.689
 water have reduced the proportion of content 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.299
 in solid which helps what helped to 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.520
 hide pizzo line not they have 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.079
 really drunk from medieval to 83 and 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.590
 and especially on the can is open 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.780
 for a long time 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.660
 that's how the day is at 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.590
 it 's not going too much for 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.030
 it's not just like a boiler 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.170
 of water that evaporates there are products 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.670
 in the paint that make sure 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.519
 that it evaporates faster than 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.980
 water evaporates by itself in a 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.420
 hut focusing a 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.819
 painting behavior is when 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.319
 we do rifle painting for the 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.120
 spray painting to roll by the 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.370
 French all call the gun 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.790
 up to 10% maximum if it is 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.709
 necessary 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.409
 so whoever the hand of the creator of the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.730
 rifle and pistol volume a day where I 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.640
 here painting and towers and paris nantes 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.780
 two techniques 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.910
 for that I did not go into the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.130
 detail but never times it can 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.170
 to be necessary 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.590
 another example it can study these 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.209
 if we still drive respecting the 10% 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.440
 until Thursday at most 10% is 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.330
 practice we have to put 10% 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.420
 just before 2% just to say 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.430
 sometimes but increasing by adding 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.450
 a little water in the paint 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.459
 what we do is change the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.410
 viscosity paul man but the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.430
 viscosity which makes sure that a 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.680
 day their walls that will allow me to 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.650
 slide on a wall for example if I 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.900
 painting on a surface of gyproc that have 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.910
 nothing but a layer of primer jeet 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.739
 either continue to drink my second course 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.580
 of paint through the layer that 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.150
 dry then when I leave you to your 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.950
 games still have the impression 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.110
 to be idle while if I add 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.060
 a little bit of water sometimes it can 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.140
 help me really go to church and 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.450
 he was looking for viscosity but that 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.450
 also improves the result that's it
