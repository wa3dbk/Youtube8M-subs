and round around until there's enough

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:05.949 
and round around until there's enough
chips<00:02:05.090> on<00:02:05.239> there<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.479> somebody<00:02:05.629> wants<00:02:05.899> to

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
chips on there that somebody wants to

chips on there that somebody wants to
take<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:06.500> what<00:02:06.619> are<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.770> chips<00:02:06.950> do<00:02:07.099> well

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
take it but what are the chips do well

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.430 
take it but what are the chips do well
if<00:02:07.849> you<00:02:07.970> took<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:08.300> with<00:02:08.420> no<00:02:08.629> chips<00:02:08.869> on<00:02:08.989> its<00:02:09.140> 12

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
if you took this with no chips on its 12

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.650 
if you took this with no chips on its 12
points<00:02:09.800> if<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.550> take<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.879> with<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.120> each<00:02:11.390> one

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
points if you take it with this each one

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
points if you take it with this each one
of<00:02:11.750> these<00:02:11.810> chips<00:02:12.110> at<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.319> end<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.530> game

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
of these chips at the end of the game

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.020 
of these chips at the end of the game
that<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.830> have<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:13.160> your<00:02:13.250> hand<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.790> going<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
that you have in your hand is going to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.630 
that you have in your hand is going to
be<00:02:14.180> minus<00:02:14.720> points<00:02:15.080> for<00:02:15.500> each<00:02:15.620> one<00:02:15.650> chip<00:02:16.160> so

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
be minus points for each one chip so

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.140 
be minus points for each one chip so
it's<00:02:16.790> 12<00:02:17.120> 11<00:02:17.840> 10<00:02:18.110> 9<00:02:18.290> 8<00:02:18.470> 7<00:02:18.680> 6<00:02:18.800> once<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.730> take<00:02:19.970> this

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
it's 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 once you take this

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.240 
it's 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 once you take this
it's<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.660> 12<00:02:21.080> but<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.379> have<00:02:21.500> six<00:02:21.769> chip<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.190> you

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
it's a 12 but you have six chip that you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.979 
it's a 12 but you have six chip that you
have<00:02:22.400> these<00:02:22.790> chips<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.090> take<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.720> it's<00:02:23.810> really

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
have these chips to take so it's really

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.170 
have these chips to take so it's really
only<00:02:24.080> worth<00:02:24.319> six<00:02:24.830> if<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:25.250> think<00:02:25.430> about<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:25.730> so

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
only worth six if you think about it so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.250 
only worth six if you think about it so
you<00:02:26.239> would<00:02:26.390> take<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.959> take<00:02:27.080> these

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
you would take this and you take these

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.690 
you would take this and you take these
chips<00:02:27.470> in<00:02:27.560> your<00:02:27.620> hand<00:02:27.830> because<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.400> start

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
chips in your hand because you start

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.000 
chips in your hand because you start
with<00:02:28.730> 11<00:02:29.090> chips<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.690> if<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.290> come<00:02:30.530> around<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
with 11 chips and if you come around and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.290 
with 11 chips and if you come around and
one<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.280> these<00:02:31.400> cards<00:02:31.730> comes<00:02:31.940> up<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.180> you

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
one of these cards comes up and you

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.210 
one of these cards comes up and you
don't<00:02:32.450> have<00:02:32.510> any<00:02:32.690> chips<00:02:32.959> in<00:02:33.200> your<00:02:33.410> hand<00:02:33.650> well

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
don't have any chips in your hand well

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.500 
don't have any chips in your hand well
you<00:02:34.340> have<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.730> take<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.239> might<00:02:35.360> be<00:02:35.480> a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
you have to take it and it might be a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.449 
you have to take it and it might be a
high<00:02:35.690> card<00:02:35.989> so<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.950> balance<00:02:37.340> between

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
high card so it's a balance between

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.530 
high card so it's a balance between
trying<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.269> play<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.989> chips<00:02:39.230> or<00:02:39.440> not<00:02:40.060> now<00:02:41.060> so

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
trying to play the chips or not now so

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.360 
trying to play the chips or not now so
then<00:02:41.989> it's<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.650> person<00:02:42.950> who<00:02:43.099> took<00:02:43.310> the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
then it's the the person who took the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.040 
then it's the the person who took the
card<00:02:43.730> would<00:02:43.940> flip<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.450> over<00:02:44.659> and<00:02:44.750> then<00:02:44.930> they

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
card would flip this over and then they

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.449 
card would flip this over and then they
would<00:02:45.170> decide<00:02:45.470> again<00:02:45.769> whether<00:02:45.980> they<00:02:46.129> want<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
would decide again whether they want the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.149 
would decide again whether they want the
card<00:02:46.670> or<00:02:46.790> not<00:02:47.590> let's<00:02:48.590> say<00:02:48.709> this<00:02:48.830> was<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> end

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
card or not let's say this was the end

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.550 
card or not let's say this was the end
of<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.310> game<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.360> had<00:02:50.599> these<00:02:50.900> three<00:02:51.200> cards

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
of the game and I had these three cards

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.350 
of the game and I had these three cards
in<00:02:51.650> front<00:02:51.769> of<00:02:51.920> me<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.519> typically<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.150> would<00:02:53.209> be

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
in front of me so typically it would be

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.710 
in front of me so typically it would be
12<00:02:53.780> plus<00:02:54.170> 22<00:02:54.560> plus<00:02:54.590> 24<00:02:55.400> minus<00:02:55.610> however<00:02:56.569> many

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
12 plus 22 plus 24 minus however many

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.030 
12 plus 22 plus 24 minus however many
chips<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.050> have<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.319> that<00:02:57.409> would<00:02:57.530> be<00:02:57.590> my<00:02:57.709> points

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
chips I have and that would be my points

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.880 
chips I have and that would be my points
lowest<00:02:58.430> points<00:02:58.700> wins<00:02:59.110> but<00:03:00.110> let's<00:03:00.260> say<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.470> card

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
lowest points wins but let's say a card

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.160 
lowest points wins but let's say a card
had<00:03:01.099> come<00:03:01.340> up<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.970> was<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> 23<00:03:02.720> in<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.989> deck

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
had come up and it was a 23 in the deck

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.809 
had come up and it was a 23 in the deck
and<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.530> went<00:03:03.680> around<00:03:03.830> around<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.550> people<00:03:04.730> are

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
and I went around around and people are

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.720 
and I went around around and people are
putting<00:03:04.970> chips<00:03:05.239> on<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.719> I<00:03:06.139> take<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.700> I

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
putting chips on it and I take it so I

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.839 
putting chips on it and I take it so I
take<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.299> because<00:03:08.620> 22<00:03:09.620> 23<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.159> 24<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:10.579> now

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
take this because 22 23 and 24 and now

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:11.170 
take this because 22 23 and 24 and now
could

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
could

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.630 
could
values<00:03:11.840> we<00:03:12.379> we<00:03:12.799> align<00:03:13.069> them<00:03:13.189> on<00:03:13.280> top<00:03:13.430> of<00:03:13.489> each

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
values we we align them on top of each

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.830 
values we we align them on top of each
other<00:03:13.849> like<00:03:13.879> this<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.150> what<00:03:14.359> this<00:03:14.480> means<00:03:14.659> is

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
other like this and what this means is

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.059 
other like this and what this means is
even<00:03:15.049> though<00:03:15.200> there's<00:03:15.379> three<00:03:15.590> cards<00:03:15.890> here

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
even though there's three cards here

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.490 
even though there's three cards here
because<00:03:16.670> they're<00:03:16.849> consecutive<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.689> only<00:03:18.079> take

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
because they're consecutive I only take

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.740 
because they're consecutive I only take
the<00:03:18.650> 22<00:03:19.069> these<00:03:19.340> cards<00:03:19.640> are<00:03:19.730> worth<00:03:19.819> zero<00:03:19.849> so

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
the 22 these cards are worth zero so

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.030 
the 22 these cards are worth zero so
it's<00:03:20.900> really<00:03:21.170> big<00:03:21.349> debt<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.739> that's<00:03:21.859> another

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
it's really big debt and that's another

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.140 
it's really big debt and that's another
thing<00:03:22.129> that's<00:03:22.430> big<00:03:22.640> in<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.790> game<00:03:22.969> is<00:03:23.030> you're

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
thing that's big in this game is you're

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.970 
thing that's big in this game is you're
trying<00:03:23.359> to<00:03:23.450> fill<00:03:23.629> in<00:03:23.750> gaps<00:03:23.780> maybe<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.739> some<00:03:24.890> of

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
trying to fill in gaps maybe of some of

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.280 
trying to fill in gaps maybe of some of
your<00:03:25.069> cards<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:25.519> at<00:03:25.849> this<00:03:26.000> point<00:03:26.329> my<00:03:26.840> points

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
your cards so at this point my points

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.319 
your cards so at this point my points
would<00:03:27.620> basically<00:03:27.799> be<00:03:28.099> 22<00:03:28.609> plus<00:03:28.790> 12<00:03:29.060> minus

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
would basically be 22 plus 12 minus

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.000 
would basically be 22 plus 12 minus
however<00:03:29.629> many<00:03:29.810> chips<00:03:30.049> I<00:03:30.170> have<00:03:30.319> and<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.889> would

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
however many chips I have and that would

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.309 
however many chips I have and that would
be<00:03:31.069> my<00:03:31.189> points<00:03:31.579> and<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.569> continues<00:03:33.109> until

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
be my points and so this continues until

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.990 
be my points and so this continues until
all<00:03:33.829> this<00:03:34.370> would<00:03:34.519> be<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:34.639> end<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.849> game

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
all this would be the end of the game

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.459 
all this would be the end of the game
but<00:03:35.180> as<00:03:35.359> we<00:03:35.480> were<00:03:35.569> saying<00:03:35.810> how<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:36.139> works<00:03:36.319> with

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:36.469 
but as we were saying how it works with

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.440 
but as we were saying how it works with
the<00:03:36.560> chips<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:36.950> stuff<00:03:37.129> this<00:03:37.730> just<00:03:38.060> goes<00:03:38.239> all

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
the chips and stuff this just goes all

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.270 
the chips and stuff this just goes all
the<00:03:38.480> way<00:03:38.629> until<00:03:38.840> all<00:03:39.109> 24<00:03:39.560> cards<00:03:39.769> are<00:03:39.920> gone<00:03:40.040> and

the way until all 24 cards are gone and

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.830 
the way until all 24 cards are gone and
at<00:03:40.639> the<00:03:40.760> end<00:03:40.909> you<00:03:41.000> caught<00:03:41.209> up<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.420> points<00:03:41.659> as<00:03:41.750> I

chips they have but one of us the lowest

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.890 
chips they have but one of us the lowest
