00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.990
 of skins that we have this built-in 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.000
 within the beta does not mean that 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.380
 are those that are cut because they do not 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.139
 they can obviously have several at the same 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.590
 time except they are who is it for 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.850
 you 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.850
 for example you can put here 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.240
 two 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.370
 so let's find them tonic because 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.370
 I have the dh remember then right now 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:15.050
 let's find the ribbon and click here 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:17.840
 and we already overcome what you say kim accept and 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.600
 well this takes from 10 to 15 give certain 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.600
 from 5 to 10 minutes so in this 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.130
 my assistant is going to continue 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.290
 I believe that with breast 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.990
 and well here we see that we have the young 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.660
 sonic width and going is not only question 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.590
 of changing statistics here 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.900
 where says face and where it says gender does not 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.350
 the race tells me the size of your hand or 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.000
 the one from sant to the dragon and I'll go 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.660
 playing with those of those so up 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.560
 that we find the character's 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.910
 example are and that human is road phase 2 and 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.910
 garbutt is one but obviously varies 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.740
 depending on the character and whoever 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.650
 created on a motorcycle so I hope that you 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.900
