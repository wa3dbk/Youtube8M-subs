00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
you switch to exactly to your bow and

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.110 
you switch to exactly to your bow and
then<00:01:56.990> use<00:01:57.200> T<00:01:57.590> which<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.520> right<00:01:58.820> here<00:01:58.850> that

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
then use T which is right here that

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.570 
then use T which is right here that
trigger<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.990> draw<00:02:00.260> back<00:02:00.530> your<00:02:00.560> bow<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.220> then

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
trigger to draw back your bow and then

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.040 
trigger to draw back your bow and then
you<00:02:01.700> can<00:02:01.850> switch<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.090> flaming<00:02:02.510> arrows<00:02:02.900> which

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
you can switch to flaming arrows which

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.390 
you can switch to flaming arrows which
you've<00:02:03.200> already<00:02:03.440> done<00:02:03.590> using<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.160> move

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
you've already done using the move

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.730 
you've already done using the move
button<00:02:04.730> exactly<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.260> just<00:02:06.440> turned<00:02:06.650> off

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
button exactly so you just turned off

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.260 
button exactly so you just turned off
the<00:02:06.920> flaming<00:02:07.220> arrows<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.760> then<00:02:07.970> there's<00:02:08.210> a

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
the flaming arrows and then there's a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.030 
the flaming arrows and then there's a
targeting<00:02:08.810> reticule<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.619> use<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:09.950> can

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
targeting reticule that you use you can

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.890 
targeting reticule that you use you can
see<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.340> exactly<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.240> it's<00:02:11.390> controlled<00:02:11.810> by

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
see it exactly and it's controlled by

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.950 
see it exactly and it's controlled by
the<00:02:12.050> wand<00:02:12.320> so<00:02:13.210> you<00:02:14.210> can<00:02:14.390> align<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.930> with

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
the wand so you can align it with

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.180 
the wand so you can align it with
whatever<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.740> you're<00:02:15.830> trying<00:02:15.890> to

whatever it is that you're trying to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.800 
whatever it is that you're trying to
target<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.760> then<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:17.000> let<00:02:17.210> go<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.480> T<00:02:17.660> to

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
target and then you let go of T to

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:28.600 
target and then you let go of T to
release<00:02:18.110> an<00:02:18.320> arrow<00:02:18.760> exactly

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.640
