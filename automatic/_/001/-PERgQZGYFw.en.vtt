some of these structures filled with the
housing<00:03:57.960> downturn<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.460> think<00:03:59.850> it<00:03:59.970> has<00:04:00.120> put<00:04:00.300> a

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
housing downturn I think it has put a

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.360 
housing downturn I think it has put a
little<00:04:00.510> bit<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.720> crunching<00:04:01.050> growth<00:04:01.320> but<00:04:02.250> we're

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
little bit of crunching growth but we're

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.130 
little bit of crunching growth but we're
primed<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:02.850> ready<00:04:02.910> for<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.360> there<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:03.900> more

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
primed and ready for it there is more

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.460 
primed and ready for it there is more

County than any other area so when

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.670 
County than any other area so when
growth<00:04:09.180> comes<00:04:09.480> we're<00:04:10.110> really<00:04:10.260> primed<00:04:10.530> for

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680

or industrial but I think the important
part<00:04:14.250> here<00:04:14.520> is<00:04:14.670> there<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.060> growth<00:04:15.450> but<00:04:15.780> the

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
part here is there is growth but the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.030 
part here is there is growth but the
