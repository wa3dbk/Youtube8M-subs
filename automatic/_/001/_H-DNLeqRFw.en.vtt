relic racer a little bit of an unusual
game<00:00:07.950> it's<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.730> racing<00:00:09.150> game<00:00:09.179> obviously<00:00:09.840> you

game it's a racing game obviously you

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.080 
game it's a racing game obviously you
need<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.710> get<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.219> finish<00:00:11.429> line<00:00:11.460> as

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
need to get to the finish line as

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.140 
need to get to the finish line as
quickly<00:00:12.599> as<00:00:12.900> possible<00:00:13.400> which<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.429> not<00:00:14.790> unlike

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
quickly as possible which is not unlike

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.880 
quickly as possible which is not unlike
any<00:00:15.420> other<00:00:15.630> racing<00:00:15.929> game<00:00:16.049> however<00:00:16.529> you're

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
any other racing game however you're

driving<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.460> little<00:00:17.640> square<00:00:18.060> car<00:00:18.680> now<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
driving a little square car now the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.820 
driving a little square car now the
subtleties<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.689> game<00:00:21.930> actually<00:00:22.380> come<00:00:22.619> in

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
subtleties of this game actually come in

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.480 
subtleties of this game actually come in
the<00:00:22.920> form<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.310> its<00:00:23.519> control<00:00:24.000> mechanism<00:00:28.340> as<00:00:29.340> you

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the form of its control mechanism as you

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.150 
the form of its control mechanism as you
can<00:00:29.609> see<00:00:29.820> they<00:00:30.150> drive<00:00:30.359> along<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.949> get<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
can see they drive along I get to the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.799 
can see they drive along I get to the
finish<00:00:32.430> line<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.570> essentially<00:00:34.200> it

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
finish line and that's essentially it

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.630 
finish line and that's essentially it
not<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.989> simple<00:00:37.230> though<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.280> when<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
not that simple though so when we get a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.990 
not that simple though so when we get a
new<00:00:38.670> track<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.379> usually<00:00:40.710> takes<00:00:41.070> us<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
new track it it usually takes us to a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.209 
new track it it usually takes us to a
different<00:00:42.780> style<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.350> game<00:00:43.680> every<00:00:44.040> single

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
different style of game every single

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.850 
different style of game every single
time<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> play<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.289> gravity<00:00:46.289> affects<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.680> so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
time you play it gravity affects you so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.229 
time you play it gravity affects you so
much<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.579> fall<00:00:47.940> off<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
much you can see it you can fall off the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.420 
much you can see it you can fall off the
end<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.719> these<00:00:49.649> are<00:00:49.770> all<00:00:49.890> tracks<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.309> I've

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
end so these are all tracks that I've

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.660 
end so these are all tracks that I've
previously<00:00:50.879> played<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.190> they<00:00:53.190> get<00:00:53.370> more<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
previously played and they get more and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.979 
previously played and they get more and
more<00:00:53.730> difficult<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> more<00:00:54.690> time<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
more difficult and the more time you

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:07.540 
more difficult and the more time you
play<00:00:55.199> them

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.500 

so<00:01:08.550> you<00:01:08.640> notice<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.030> top<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.300> screen

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
so you notice that the top of the screen

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.210 
so you notice that the top of the screen
there's<00:01:09.750> two<00:01:09.960> bars<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.650> them<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> white

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
there's two bars one of them is white

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.900 
there's two bars one of them is white
one<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.180> those<00:01:12.330> red<00:01:12.660> now<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.860> white<00:01:14.340> bar<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
one of those red now the white bar is

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.180 
one of those red now the white bar is
sort<00:01:15.510> of<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.990> timekeeper<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> need<00:01:17.100> to

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
sort of like the timekeeper you need to

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.610 
sort of like the timekeeper you need to
finish<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.580> course<00:01:17.840> by<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.900> time<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
finish the course by the time that

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.280 
finish the course by the time that
reaches<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.280> end<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.600> there's<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.020> red

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
reaches the end and then there's the red

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350 
reaches the end and then there's the red
bar<00:01:22.470> which<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.040> Guinness<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.240> know

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
bar which is your Guinness you know

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.900 
bar which is your Guinness you know
there's<00:01:24.540> two<00:01:24.720> types<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.080> gas<00:01:25.380> canisters<00:01:25.980> along

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
there's two types of gas canisters along

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.730 
there's two types of gas canisters along
the<00:01:27.030> way<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.480> of<00:01:27.510> them<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.320> red<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.650> as

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the way one of them is the red one as

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.450 
the way one of them is the red one as
you<00:01:28.830> can<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:28.980> you<00:01:29.250> grab<00:01:29.490> those<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:31.860> top

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you can see you grab those and you top

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.920 
you can see you grab those and you top
up<00:01:32.580> your<00:01:32.670> gas<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.570> other<00:01:33.690> one<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.870> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
up your gas and the other one is a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.000 
up your gas and the other one is a
yellow<00:01:34.080> one<00:01:34.260> it<00:01:34.410> gives<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.620> a<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.770> bit<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
yellow one it gives you a little bit of

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.570 
yellow one it gives you a little bit of
a<00:01:35.040> nitrous<00:01:35.430> first<00:01:36.979> let<00:01:37.979> me<00:01:38.010> see<00:01:38.190> if<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.430> show

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
a nitrous first let me see if I can show

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.620 
a nitrous first let me see if I can show
you<00:01:38.640> what<00:01:38.760> happens<00:01:38.970> when<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.150> drive<00:01:39.360> into<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you what happens when you drive into a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.740 
you what happens when you drive into a
tree<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.620> go<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.160> explode<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.030> you've

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
tree there you go you explode so you've

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.510 
tree there you go you explode so you've
also<00:01:42.900> got<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> avoid<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.650> lot<00:01:44.010> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.160> obstacles

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
also got to avoid a lot of the obstacles

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:54.650 
also got to avoid a lot of the obstacles
along<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> way<00:01:53.000> now<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.300> saying<00:01:54.510> the

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
along the way now as I was saying the

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.030 
along the way now as I was saying the
subtleties<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.050> this<00:01:55.260> game<00:01:55.470> come<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.860> form

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
subtleties of this game come in the form

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.340 
subtleties of this game come in the form
of<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.280> control<00:01:56.610> mechanism<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.660> move<00:01:58.229> your

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
of it's control mechanism you move your

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080 
of it's control mechanism you move your
car<00:01:58.560> left<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.040> right<00:01:59.190> obviously<00:01:59.610> but<00:01:59.850> it's

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
car left and right obviously but it's

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090 
car left and right obviously but it's
locked<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.290> degree<00:02:01.500> angles<00:02:01.770> so

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
locked in it what if I degree angles so

of<00:02:39.200> thing<00:02:39.409> different<00:02:39.739> layouts<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.730> can<00:02:40.909> do

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
of thing different layouts you can do

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
versus challenges you've got the redline

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.490 
versus challenges you've got the redline
mode<00:02:44.299> which<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.659> essentially<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.260> same<00:02:45.349> as

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
mode which is essentially the same as

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.960 
mode which is essentially the same as
the<00:02:45.620> first<00:02:45.829> one<00:02:45.920> except<00:02:46.280> now<00:02:46.579> you<00:02:46.640> have<00:02:46.849> this

red bar chasing your own way which just

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.860 
red bar chasing your own way which just
makes<00:02:49.819> things<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.239> little<00:02:50.359> bit<00:02:50.510> more

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
makes things a little bit more

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.550 
makes things a little bit more
interesting<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:53.299> goal<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.690> simply<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.260> get<00:02:54.409> to

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
interesting the goal is simply to get to

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.800 
interesting the goal is simply to get to
the<00:02:54.650> end<00:02:54.799> but<00:02:55.700> now<00:02:55.879> there<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.090> this<00:02:56.359> giant<00:02:56.720> red
