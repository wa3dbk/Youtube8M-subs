00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.970 
on his funeral I met maybe two three
hundred<00:02:32.010> people<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.880> loved<00:02:33.810> him<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.350> much<00:02:34.380> as

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
hundred people that loved him so much as

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.790 
hundred people that loved him so much as
if<00:02:35.130> he<00:02:35.280> was<00:02:35.430> their<00:02:35.760> own<00:02:35.910> father<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:38.280> think

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
if he was their own father and I think

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.140 
if he was their own father and I think
that<00:02:40.800> he<00:02:40.920> loved<00:02:41.100> them<00:02:41.250> back<00:02:41.490> he<00:02:41.940> had<00:02:42.030> this

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
that he loved them back he had this

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.570 
that he loved them back he had this
ability<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.930> love<00:02:43.080> people<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:44.190> get<00:02:44.340> love

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
ability to love people and to get love

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.060 
ability to love people and to get love
back<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.900> same<00:02:46.170> with<00:02:46.380> his<00:02:46.500> heart

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
back and the same with his heart

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.530 
back and the same with his heart
