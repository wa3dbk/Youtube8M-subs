and the next pitch the guy hits a home
run<00:00:38.690> well<00:00:39.690> part<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> reason<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.280> those

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
run well part of the reason for those

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
run well part of the reason for those
errors<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.329> don't<00:00:42.450> spend<00:00:42.840> time<00:00:43.110> working<00:00:43.500> on

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
errors is we don't spend time working on

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.209 
errors is we don't spend time working on
so<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> fly<00:00:44.910> ball<00:00:45.149> drill<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:46.500> very<00:00:46.770> easy<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
so the fly ball drill it's very easy to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.810 
so the fly ball drill it's very easy to
execute<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.719> feeder<00:00:49.110> stands<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> infield

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820

feeding when the feeder rotates his

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.150 
feeding when the feeder rotates his
shoulders<00:01:00.469> that's<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> player

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160

now once we execute some to the glove

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.149 
now once we execute some to the glove
side<00:02:23.620> we<00:02:24.620> got<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.950> go<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.340> throwing<00:02:25.700> side

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.220 

and<00:02:32.370> then<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:33.209> want<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.510> work<00:02:33.659> on<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.049> all

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
and then we want to work on the all

straight back over our head we always

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.190 
straight back over our head we always
open<00:02:40.620> glove<00:02:41.249> side<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:42.120> key<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.540> making<00:02:42.569> sure

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
open glove side the key is making sure

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.649 
open glove side the key is making sure
that<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.530> open<00:02:43.709> up<00:02:43.980> at<00:02:44.189> a<00:02:44.219> steeper<00:02:44.909> or<00:02:45.150> deeper

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
back over my head if I don't open up

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.420 
back over my head if I don't open up
with<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.599> deep<00:02:54.900> enough<00:02:55.200> angle<00:02:55.680> now<00:02:56.159> I've

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
with a deep enough angle now I've

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.550 
with a deep enough angle now I've
created<00:02:56.700> an<00:02:57.450> extremely<00:02:58.230> tough<00:02:58.889> catch<00:03:00.469> but<00:03:01.469> if

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
created an extremely tough catch but if

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.069 
created an extremely tough catch but if
I<00:03:01.680> get<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.950> good<00:03:02.249> open<00:03:02.700> step<00:03:02.999> at<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.269> deeper<00:03:03.719> angle

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
I get a good open step at a deeper angle

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.050 
I get a good open step at a deeper angle
on<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> ball<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.799> can<00:03:05.250> keep<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.609> ball<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.819> little

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
on the ball I can keep the ball a little

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.839 
on the ball I can keep the ball a little
bit<00:03:06.269> off<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.689> my<00:03:06.840> side<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.620> if<00:03:08.219> I<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.819> I

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
bit off to my side and if I have to I

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.789 
bit off to my side and if I have to I
can<00:03:09.030> catch<00:03:09.419> over<00:03:09.810> my<00:03:09.959> shoulder<00:03:10.379> but

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
can catch over my shoulder but

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.770 
can catch over my shoulder but
oftentimes<00:03:11.310> I'll<00:03:11.849> be<00:03:12.000> able<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.269> circle<00:03:12.689> around

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
oftentimes I'll be able to circle around

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
oftentimes I'll be able to circle around
and<00:03:13.349> make<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.310> much<00:03:14.760> easier<00:03:14.790> catch

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.370 

after<00:03:22.800> we<00:03:22.920> do<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.070> couple<00:03:23.550> reps<00:03:23.760> each<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
after we do a couple reps each to the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.550 
after we do a couple reps each to the
