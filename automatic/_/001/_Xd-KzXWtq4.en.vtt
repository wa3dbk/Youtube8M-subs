00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.129
 Example 2 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:12.769
 Today's special relieve you have to wonder what attracted together 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.640
 I have a little time to offer. 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:21.650
 I prepared the base makeup once for the first time . 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.409
 There are three kinds of make-up that can make use of the popular and real life mind. 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.819
 I've chosen base makeup. 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:33.170
 Lastly, I would like to offer a flush cover base that can give a boost to makeup. 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:38.420
 Gonna try once there is a little height to give an understanding of the world of Red Light 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:43.010
 On the contrary, the color is green, and the mecca face is very green. 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.899
 If your face is partially used by Buddhist people, it will be more effective. 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.750
 You can direct 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:55.579
 When the whole is right, the fire and the usual intern are equally green. 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.309
 You can apply it partially and you can finish the foundation with this feeling of heterogeneity on this turn. 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.629
 I 'll set the tone first and let's get started. 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.199
 Air puffs are the most appropriate tools to increase adhesion multiple times 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.670
 same 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:13.400
 Please apply thinly to the part with red flush with the line. 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 Then, using an air puff gently pat As the toktoktok a close one 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:21.570
 I'll make it. 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.800
 It will lead a thin little exaggeration we just several times faster as layering 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.510
 I'll try it. 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:32.400
 The important point here is that very small quantities are important to many times 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:37.080
 When you distribute your finger like this, please be careful to come in the thinnest way. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:42.690
 Joe is now around the border with the base makeup to finish this 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:47.729
 I 'll purge the border naturally to the surroundings with just the purple. 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:52.350
 Now the base step as part of an appeal based neundeyo over the pre-colored cover 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.970
 There is a difference. It is the foundation stage that teaches neatly . 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.860
 It's very important. 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.789
 Just look around when cbc turns very cool 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:08.519
 I choose a foundation that teaches yellow to make me look healthy . 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:13.709
 It is important that I now use the horse spoke a little tinge of color little toad 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:18.930
 The color you should be careful of is the color with the pink color. 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:23.910
 I'll try to get rid of the feeling of heterogeneity by using a product with a lot of yellow light. 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:29.519
 I'll take away about 1 cm in diameter and use it . 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:33.750
 Incorrect drinking lightly, please buy the dip As the dot once so small 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.230
 If you type a single foundation in both a lighter could be a make-up 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.930
 Will 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:45.410
 Get rid of the border share back gently, like Ghana earlier while I connect to the Touch 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.410
 It's important that you touch it like you press it lightly. 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.420
 woo ah 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.129
 Now you can pack kisses to finish and even catch the oil 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.959
 I'm going to step on the steps. 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:04.560
 I think it 's better to use the facts of the foundation type in the sow and powder. 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.560
 It is important to lightly glue thinly around the ball 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.250
 Horn turned bwatneundeyo end to the base 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:26.500
 Do you see a lot of red flesh disappearing? 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:32.019
 This came face scratched up wonak many 2Q12 still cry niggas who also 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:36.040
 If you use a layering technique, as I've adhesion while more thin 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:40.780
 I think you can get a good base cover . 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.930
 So far, I made a make-up, a make-up, and now I am doing 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.849
 I adjusted the blush cover base to makeup. 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:53.319
 I have dreamed of making the base makeup once. 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:58.299
 I think I can make the feature interesting by looking forward to the comments. 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.540
 I hope to see you next time. 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.540
 I will. 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.830
 For example, red light is red. 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:15.950
 Then you can think of the complementary color of the red light 3 and then the partial light 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.860
 As opposed to the red color Dad gekkeum now better 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.300
 Oh , please do not write this. 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.300
