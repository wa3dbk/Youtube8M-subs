00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.449
 all right 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.640
 hello welcome again i am cs and today 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.980
 I bring you a trick here on the map 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.280
 buried and well this trick would be for 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.480
 have infinite ammo from the m-14 and 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.440
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.239
 is to open this source is to break it for 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.030
 to be able to open the portal there 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.500
 right in the labyrinth and good a 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.090
 Once we have broken it, we will have to 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.949
 open the way for the mansion 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.949
 also to go there of course 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.570
 and well then once this breaks us already 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.940
 we open the access to the mansion and before 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.100
 to leave we have to take the build 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.800
 the jumper the sweeping steam as 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.330
 you want to call is quite important and 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.280
 well now what you have to do will be 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.960
 break the source you can break it with 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.190
 grenades or with the weapon that I have now 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.290
 same because the hands 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.880
 It does not matter but it's good for you to see 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.470
 that can also be broken with grenades 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.080
 and good what we do would be 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.630
 transport us to this area quite 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.740
 important to have all the pal jumper and 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.570
 good what we have to do would be 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.190
 place where you are seeing the for 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.260
 jumper but as follows 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.750
 how are you going to do it because you have to 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.670
 jump or just place and jump 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.190
 at the same time so that we stay floating 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.750
 in the air this is quite important and 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.480
 it is quite difficult the truth as 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.280
 you can see so this is going to leave us 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.400
 the first you have to just when 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.380
 go to place jump and good once 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.180
 done that so that you stay like that 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.610
 you will have to do is that when 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.800
 just go jump the jumper what 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.470
 place in agreement 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.420
 and well it will stay like this now for 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.390
 climb up to do the trick what 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.280
 you have to do is stay here quiet 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.810
 well and as you can see it will not rise here if 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.970
 it has gone well and we have placed well 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.160
 the pieces will remain the character 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.410
 here 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.680
 and here if we can right behind 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.860
 of the weapon here we can buy the weapon 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.570
 and we will even be immortal that is of 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.390
 what is the trick of being immortal and 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.090
 have infinite ammo of the m-14 like 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.550
 you are watching there, I buy it and 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.470
 there you have the infinite ammunition 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.630
 or can you teach me right now how do I 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.060
 I can buy the weapon for you to see 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.090
 here in the next video you are watching 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.280
 that I slipped and the serious ones directly in 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.550
 the game as you see there puts hold 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.960
 subtract m14 and good did not have money 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.870
 to buy it because I had it 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.100
 removed the ghosts and good for 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.570
 make immortal what you have to do is 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.250
 stay there just behind the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.260
 poster and crouch 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.900
 and well, nothing else here we have the 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.330
 trick I hope you have been useful 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.160
 you like it if you liked it and nothing else 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.160
 subscribe frank unofficially until soon 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.790
