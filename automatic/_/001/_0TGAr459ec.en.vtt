00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 very good to all people welcome to 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.810
 his new microbiology channel where 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.800
 we will discuss issues related to 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.110
 bacteria parasites virus and fungi both 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.389
 beneficial as pathogens for being 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.850
 human, let's start with the steps to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.250
 perform the attention of big step number 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.350
 1 with a sterile calibrated handle we place 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.859
 a drop of convex saline 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.869
 physiological on a clean slide in 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.810
 which we will make the own of the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.489
 biomass to dye after we fix it with 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.320
 lime achieved by the part of for example 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.010
 of the objects on the flame of the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.050
 lighter to about 5 to 10 centimeters of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.940
 preference step number 2 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.090
 and we add crystal violet to the sample 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.510
 and we wait for a minute after a 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.300
 minute 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.160
 rinse with distilled water step 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.350
 number 3 we will add place today hologram 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.949
 and we wait a minute after the minute 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.510
 we get angry with distilled water for 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.570
 step number 4 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.130
 We can rinse with ketone alcohol 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.620
 until you see that you stop running the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.510
 ink 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.970
 or we can leave the one to which it becomes 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.240
 over the sample of 10 to 20 seconds and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.450
 then rinse with distilled water 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.230
 finally we add the mica to our 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.290
 sample for 30 seconds or less and 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.300
 rinse with distilled water I say less 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.880
 because in some cases if you register 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.430
 30 seconds or more can give false great 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.560
 negative very well now that we know 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.900
 how the technique is done let's move on to its 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.580
 foundation the basics of the technique 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.410
 is based on the differences between 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.420
 cell walls of the pleasures were 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.190
 positive and great negatives the wall 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.690
 Cellular gram positive bacteria 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.240
 It has a thick layer of peptide 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.970
 Mexican in addition to two kinds of acids 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.040
 t iconic anchored on the inner side of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.040
 the cell wall and attached to the membrane 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.320
 plasma is the acid 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 hypothetical and ccoo and more on the surface 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.970
 the acid is iconic that is anchored 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.700
 only in the Mexican peptide also 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.530
 known as brunette on the contrary the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.390
 Vulcan peptide coat of the large 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.950
 gatti bass is thin and lies 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.650
 linked to a second plasma membrane 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.020
 outside of composition other than 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.270
 internal by means of lipoprotein 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.640
 therefore both types of bacteria are 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.300
 they stain differentially because of these 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.240
 consecutive differences in your wall 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.250
 the key is peptidoglycan since it is 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.440
 the material that confers its rigidity to the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.990
 bacterial cell wall and the large 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.230
 positive people have it in much greater 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.670
 proportion that were negative the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.680
 difference that is observed in the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.510
 Resistance to discoloration is due to 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.550
 that the outer membrane of the large 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.920
 gatti bass is just a different dense 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.720
 organic, such as the mixture of 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.970
 alcohol becomes the peptide layer 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.160
 vulcano that he owns is too thin 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.560
 as to be able to retain the complex of 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.690
 Iodine violet crystal that was formed 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.640
 previously and therefore this complex 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.830
 it escapes losing its coloration 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.540
 violet but on the contrary the great 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.630
 positive when owning a cell wall 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.120
 more resistant and with a higher proportion of 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.040
 Mexican discharges are not susceptible to 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.960
 the action of the organic solvent but that 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.540
 this one is hydrating the pores 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.130
 closing what prevents you from 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.730
 resort to escape autism 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.740
 violet iodine and maintaining coloration 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.680
 violet if the video 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.240
 Like it and if you do not like it in the box 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.820
 comments you can do 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.040
 constructive to help this channel to 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.040
 Grow and improve your work quality
