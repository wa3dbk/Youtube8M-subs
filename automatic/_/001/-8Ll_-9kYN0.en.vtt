00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Greetings to those who see this video I am 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.779
 night dragon and after not uploading a 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 reflective video today I bring you a theme 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.650
 which I wanted to say that it is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.660
 about wars of animes against 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.790
 cartoons but first I want them 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.890
 clarify that this video is for the purpose of 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.380
 express myself and not to create controversy or 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.869
 nothing of that shit but good I will begin 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.029
 with this thing in these wars 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.529
 they simply devote that the fanboys of 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.840
 anime shoot shit to those of the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.090
 cartoons or vice versa from my point 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.430
 of view considered that the fanboys more 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.960
 those of the anime but that's not 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.120
 it means that it is for or in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.590
 against the anime since I like it 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.840
 also like the cartoons 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.329
 because I just like it equally 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.940
 although in the anime I have the fanboys more 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.070
 bothersome or obsessive that does not take away the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.989
 fact that the anime is mainly 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.239
 the most attacked by the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.219
 religious or by people who hate 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.199
 otakus and that's why they throw shit at 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.660
 anime but talking about another point 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.940
 some often complain about some things 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.730
 of the anime than what some cartoons 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.339
 they have or even worse than the anime or 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.120
 the homosexual scenes of now I will give 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.880
 Some 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.990
 so they can understand 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.850
 they mainly attack the anime that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.460
 they make many sadists are created 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.010
 that there is a lot of blood is satanic there 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.080
 much sexual content and so on I neither 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.940
 I'm going to contradict those things since it's 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.130
 the truth but something that is strange 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.950
 because only the anime attack for those 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.620
 reasons since there are animated series like 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.900
 father of the family the simpsons the house of 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.820
 the drawings and so on those series that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.770
 I mentioned earlier I do not think there's 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.900
 some anime that is worse than these 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.820
 they may be at their same level either 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.830
 so morbid of its content or what 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.690
 shocking that you can get to do to 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.970
 the children's audience or even those who 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.710
 they are older but other examples of 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.050
 that I should mention would be from the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.970
 simpsons since this series has humor 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.100
 black about what can become 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.920
 offensive to certain groups of people 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.370
 since it is Catholic homosexuals and between 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.500
 others 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.930
 eye that the simpsons is one of my 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.090
 favorite series in my case I have not seen 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.220
 no anime that has jokes like that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.110
 racist or something like that or so 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.300
 least focus on a black humor that 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.340
 is offensive to certain people 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.020
 which many complain about the anime 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.910
 when they almost do not listen 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.770
 about which hannah series like 'the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.380
 simpsons' for the jokes that usually 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.600
 doing that does not mean that I complain 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.730
 nor do I defend the anime that has 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.890
 The most obsessive fanboys does not come back bad 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.750
 to the anime I bet that the main reason 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.000
 that one hates the anime is for the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.100
 followers at least I do something that 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.930
 if it's justifiable but already consider the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.700
 encourage as a garbage only for the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.950
 fanboys and I do a pendejada 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.870
 they also complain that the anime is very 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.210
 monotonous and very trite but in the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.100
 cartoons there's a lot of cliche also for 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.050
 example is the typical clumsy daddy of 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.120
 protagonist must always have 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.070
 some chapter that they play soccer or 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.200
 baseball or you always have to travel 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.180
 in time or that the prota has a 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.640
 bad relationship with his sister and between 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.740
 other things more up to anime of our 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.480
 childhood like the cow and the chick was 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.730
 of those grotesque humor cartoons 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.040
 that can be disgusting but to the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.870
 funny time for some people and I 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.820
 I include it but you can still get to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.470
 do entertaining both anime and 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.540
 cartoons about happen from the grotesque 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.640
 of the expressions of the faces that 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.620
 can cause a child to be traumatized 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.630
 so horrible it was but I do not say that 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.920
 all are as there are children that neither 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.959
 they feel nothing about 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.060
 to this so I do not see the joke of 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.310
 say that the anime is disturbing and blah 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.290
 blah blah it is true that there are animes with that 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.480
 but neither is it to say that all the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.340
 anime in general is like this because by following 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.560
 that logical happiness then the 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.780
 cartoons are like that shit because the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.970
 examples like rim and stimpy father of 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.550
 family and other series that I mentioned makes 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.319
 I'm not saying I hate that series alone 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.810
 I say those things so that certain people 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.730
 to see how things are that both 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.620
 for the reasons that criticize the anime 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.800
 a lot amount of 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.810
 cartoons have another point to discuss 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.790
 it would be that I think that the anime and 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.620
 cartoons are equal in a sense 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.930
 but different in another and I 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.850
 I will explain what I mean by this are 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.440
 normally different from the 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.450
 most of your animation or by 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.400
 expressions or for having more variety of 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.110
 genre like the one that has the anime that 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.880
 I have more variety of genres 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.280
 justifies that it be better than 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.530
 cartoons and in the sense that they are 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.989
 same be that they are animated series the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.570
 anime is still a caricature some 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.520
 they've thought about it before, well, it's like that 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.320
 simple the anime is caricature like 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.730
 that we always see by cartoon 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.380
 network the only 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.230
 difference is to be made by the 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.030
 Japanese but still it's still 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.250
 cartoons both anime and cartoons 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.950
 has its content varies as an action 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.020
 childish comedy and so on there I get to 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.540
 the conclusion of all this that they are 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.580
 the same in that sense if I said that the 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.620
 anime has more variety of content 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.780
 but what happens is that in such anime 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.460
 like the wick is like an anime action 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.680
 since that possesses although it is not 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.510
 considered are in the same thing there is 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.490
 animes of different genre but that 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.250
 has in common dow is to have action now 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.960
 they understand me although another thing that yes 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.480
 difference anime with cartoons 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.120
 it's how long some animes are 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.430
 that mainly the majority are are in 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.680
 and yes it is a difference although I think that 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.780
 does not affect in the least but good at 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.460
 less in my case but that leads to 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.710
 that are against the anime 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.930
 generalize that all series of the 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.030
 anime always wins the good but that's not 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.460
 it's true since you anime like dead note 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.930
 the prota ends dying that shows 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.210
 that there are animes that can have 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.160
 typical clichés so repetitive but that 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.020
 does not mean that in general the series 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.720
 be bad since there are things that can 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.270
 reward and you end up liking several 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.190
 aspects of that series I know I 've talked 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.050
 most of my video of those that 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.970
 they are against the anime but what 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.580
 happens is that it had a lot to 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.590
 deepen but well I will not talk so much 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.900
 of those who criticize the cartoons and 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.850
 that we all know how most are 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.950
 the otakus that is not Japanese 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.320
 shit and other things already very 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.330
 talked so I'll cut here now I'll give 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.760
 my opinion to this quotes between wars 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.800
 in the particular I think that none of 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.110
 the two animations is better or worse than 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.210
 the other since for me they are almost identical 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.550
 but as I said before there is something that 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.710
 difference a little but they are identical to 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.200
 that you both have shit and things 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.230
 good or good and bad cartoons 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.270
 and animes bad and good that simple 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.100
 but it's not strange, since all 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.620
 the internet wars are all 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.810
 stupid and none is the smart 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.540
 everything that takes it as a war is a 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.490
 immature more this is internet and not a 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.560
 war to despair for whoever 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.020
 the winner or to give it to mature 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.820
 when even that show but good not 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.120
 I'm looking to change anyone with this video 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.800
 but just express myself and in the end it 's all 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.900
 what I had to say this 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.030
 just an opinion and my way of seeing the 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.460
 things on this topic and I do not expose my 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.389
 point of view to anyone give your opinion in 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.129
 the comments 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:52.129
 goodbye and until another
