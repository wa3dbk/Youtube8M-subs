00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
put it in one of these two side ones

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.070 
put it in one of these two side ones
either<00:01:04.890> side<00:01:05.309> don't<00:01:06.180> try<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.450> pop<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
either side don't try and pop it in the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
either side don't try and pop it in the
top<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> hole<00:01:08.159> there<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
top one because the hole there is is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.210 
top one because the hole there is is
just<00:01:09.450> too<00:01:10.049> narrow<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.799> then<00:01:10.979> you're<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
just too narrow and then you're just

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.990 
just too narrow and then you're just
going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.760> gently<00:01:12.619> squeeze<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:14.100> ink<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.790> then

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
going to gently squeeze in ink and then

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.850 
going to gently squeeze in ink and then
keep<00:01:15.299> an<00:01:15.479> eye<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.020> levels<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
keep an eye on the levels in the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.730 
keep an eye on the levels in the
cartridges<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:20.990> as<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.110> said<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.439> should<00:01:22.619> be

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
cartridges and as I said it should be

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
cartridges and as I said it should be
looking<00:01:23.070> at<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> point<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.640> around<00:01:23.939> 15<00:01:24.509> ml<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
looking at a point in around 15 ml of

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.649 
looking at a point in around 15 ml of
ink<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> cartridge<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:27.270> then<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> will

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
ink in the cartridge and then it will

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:38.590 
ink in the cartridge and then it will
just<00:01:27.750> pop<00:01:28.080> straight<00:01:28.409> back<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.829> your<00:01:29.009> printer

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.780 

so<00:01:39.590> anywhere<00:01:39.950> up<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.130> their<00:01:40.750> 75%<00:01:41.750> mark<00:01:42.790> there

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
so anywhere up to their 75% mark there

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.910 
so anywhere up to their 75% mark there
were<00:01:43.880> also<00:01:44.240> I've<00:01:44.450> put<00:01:44.479> 15<00:01:45.170> ml<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.470> ink<00:01:45.650> into
