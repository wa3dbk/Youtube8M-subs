we'll<00:00:11.010> be<00:00:11.040> doing<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.760> bit<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.120> theory<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.780> music

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
we'll be doing a bit of theory of music

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.189 
we'll be doing a bit of theory of music
relating<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.400> get<00:00:14.519> out<00:00:14.690> since<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.840> time<00:00:16.019> I've

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
relating to get out since the time I've

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.310 
relating to get out since the time I've
started<00:00:16.500> doing<00:00:16.680> all<00:00:17.099> the<00:00:17.220> video<00:00:17.490> lessons

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
started doing all the video lessons

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.499 
started doing all the video lessons
there<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:19.470> been<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.710> lot<00:00:20.159> of<00:00:20.339> requests<00:00:20.730> from

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
there have been a lot of requests from

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.380 
there have been a lot of requests from
students<00:00:21.989> and<00:00:22.259> from<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.679> people<00:00:22.800> they<00:00:23.730> wanted

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
students and from the people they wanted

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.849 
students and from the people they wanted
to<00:00:24.509> know<00:00:24.630> more<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.989> the<00:00:25.109> theory<00:00:25.499> you<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.710> how

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
to know more of the theory you know how

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.899 
to know more of the theory you know how
the<00:00:25.919> notes<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.339> structured<00:00:26.759> on<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:26.909 
the notes are structured on the

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.269 
the notes are structured on the
fingerboard<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.659> how<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.529> come<00:00:28.829> across<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
fingerboard and how do I come across the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.309 
fingerboard and how do I come across the
chords<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.939> bar<00:00:30.179> chord<00:00:30.419> positions<00:00:30.899> open

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:31.319 
chords and the bar chord positions open

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.319 
chords and the bar chord positions open
chord<00:00:31.499> positions<00:00:31.979> and<00:00:32.369> what<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.180> mean

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
chord positions and what do you mean

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.880 
chord positions and what do you mean
with<00:00:33.449> at<00:00:33.570> home<00:00:33.660> scales<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.500> how<00:00:34.530> do<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.739> play

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
with at home scales and how do you play

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040 
with at home scales and how do you play
the<00:00:34.949> scales<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.699> fingerboard<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.690> on

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the scales on the fingerboard and on

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.160 
the scales on the fingerboard and on
different<00:00:37.859> positions<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.519> fingerboard

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
different positions on the fingerboard

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.139 
different positions on the fingerboard
so<00:00:40.170> what<00:00:40.410> I'll<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.859> I'll<00:00:41.160> take<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.090> through

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
so what I'll do is I'll take you through

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.029 
so what I'll do is I'll take you through
a<00:00:42.359> bit<00:00:42.539> of<00:00:42.570> theory<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.109> this<00:00:43.320> episode<00:00:43.769> and

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
a bit of theory in this episode and

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.950 
a bit of theory in this episode and
going<00:00:44.309> further<00:00:44.519> we'll<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.210> having<00:00:45.449> some<00:00:45.719> video

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
going further we'll be having some video

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.229 
going further we'll be having some video
lessons<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.789> understanding<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> different

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
lessons on understanding the different

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
lessons on understanding the different
notations<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.809> music<00:00:49.230> how<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.890> apply<00:00:50.039> them

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
notations in music how do we apply them

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.239 
notations in music how do we apply them
to<00:00:50.309> guitar<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:51.230> all<00:00:52.230> these<00:00:52.440> things<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.160> in

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:53.249 
to guitar and all these things so in

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:55.400 
to guitar and all these things so in
this<00:00:53.339> first<00:00:53.550> episode<00:00:53.989> will<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.109> doing<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this first episode will be doing the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.979 
this first episode will be doing the
theory<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.890> understanding<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.579> names<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.839> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
theory on understanding the names of the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.959 
theory on understanding the names of the
open<00:00:58.230> strings<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.309> we'll<00:00:59.460> start<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
open strings so we'll start with the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.389 
open strings so we'll start with the
names<00:01:00.179> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.929> open<00:01:01.109> strings<00:01:01.289> starting<00:01:02.039> from

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
names of the open strings starting from

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.479 
names of the open strings starting from
string<00:01:02.640> number<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:03.390> now<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.920> first<00:01:05.190> string

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
each individual string first let's look

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.940 
each individual string first let's look
at<00:01:58.590> how<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> strings<00:01:59.490> are<00:01:59.700> numbered<00:02:00.330> now<00:02:01.050> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
at how the strings are numbered now the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.300 
at how the strings are numbered now the
