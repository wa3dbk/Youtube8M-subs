00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.760
 in battlefield 4 tank is death on 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.369
 caterpillars and at the same time is 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.920
 armored fortress which is just 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.869
 impossible to beat one engineer sr g 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.790
 pub it to overcome you need at least 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.730
 two engineers lpg 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.369
 either a bomber who goes to his rear 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.980
 and if the tank turned out to be a camper, then you need it 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.590
 do not get it and how to be in such 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.140
 situations if you are alone 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.629
 with a tank and you know what shot at 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.989
 him the first time he will find you and kill 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.360
 and you already think that you are left completely 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:51.190
 hopeless situation but it is not so 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.190
 can be done like this 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.120
 not bad really so how do you get rid of 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.150
 tank if you slipped him into the rear of the 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.260
 one shot srav before uncover 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.810
 you this secret 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.180
 I'll tell you about the basic principles 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.580
 fogeym srav the fact is that more or less 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.070
 experienced players know about this word chips 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.740
 as re-aim after exit 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.050
 the game was available such a bug release from 2 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.270
 simultaneously missiles and respectively 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.280
 could kill any other tank 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.290
 technique for a two-shot Cf. 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.450
 after that this bug was fixed but 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.580
 for some reason, many thought that they fixed 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.140
 re-aiming function but to 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.350
 common joy reuse function 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.880
 aiming left in gm 172 com for 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.520
 those who do not know do not know what it is 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.229
 I will try to explain this briefly in 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.600
 that the cpa rocket always flies into 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.820
 the place where the last time was sent 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.280
 sight that is flying to the point of the latter 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.780
 aiming and experienced players know what 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.820
 firing on the far technology not 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.070
 always keep it in sight 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.970
 just aim at her sight 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.430
 and all 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.899
 the rocket itself will do its thing but also 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.660
 there is a famous way for carving 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.610
 caravans from cover it lies in 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.979
 that in the sighting it is in the sighting 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.500
 rocket mode is released up after 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.480
 word recharge occurs if not 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.610
 shoot after reloading and just 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.770
 aim at the camper who sits behind 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.170
 shelter then the rocket will fall him right on 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.959
 the head is called a function 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.030
 re-aiming also experienced 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.310
 players know that if you release a shell 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.650
 grass tank back then he will 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.800
 immediately disabled and will be inflicted 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.170
 50 percent damage if you release two 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.030
 projectile that tank will be destroyed but the matter 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.620
 in that right after the first projectile 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.810
 the tank is likely to turn on brilliant green 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.940
 will deploy the towers and kill you to hell 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.099
 mother and you were still tailors players 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.530
 they know that the tank is besides the back 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.660
 there is a weak spot in the tower in this 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.050
 location shoot at us on a tip Wilen 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.239
 also cause damage of 50 units 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.180
 destroy the tank combine these two 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.980
 ways if you crept behind him 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.260
 yes everything is actually very simple 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.540
 rocket is released into the sky strictly under 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.920
 90 degrees produced 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.290
 recharge 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.930
 the rocket goes to the tank turret and 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.340
 after the first rocket reaches 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.620
 goals 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.590
 the second rocket is instantly released in 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.450
 the back and the tank destroyed the tank did not 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.489
 have time to react to include Zelenka 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.860
 or else take some action 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.590
 you just destroy him yes actually 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.049
 you shoot two shots but for 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.660
 tanka it feels like one shot and 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.400
 two rockets fly simultaneously here 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.650
 There are several questions like 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.379
 launch a rocket strictly at an angle of 90 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.959
 degrees where to aim and how long to wait 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.420
 to launch a rocket strictly at an angle 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.299
 90 degrees you need to lift up 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.880
 head up to the point where you have 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.730
 already stop moving mouse release 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.340
 rocket and wait a couple of seconds so she 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.380
 gained altitude and if the tank suddenly starts 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.700
 move so she flew at an angle 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.829
 90 degrees 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.870
 can not worry about accuracy and 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.000
 an error of 10 degrees is acceptable and then 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.620
 is there a rocket will fly at an angle of 80 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.810
 degrees critical damage will be all 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.640
 equals received further i will show you the points 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.769
 which you should aim at if you are logged in 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.549
 to the tank on the left side behind either with 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.549
 right side 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.310
 Well, respectively, the second rocket 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.010
 we start after the first arrives 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.800
 rocket immediately to the back of the tank and 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.440
 he will be destroyed even the tank driver 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.840
 will not understand what happened to him after mine 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.480
 research it turned out that the storm of all 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.110
 tanks Russian tank t 90 turned out 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.370
 the most vulnerable to this method 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.140
 the destruction of the matter is that he has 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.060
 open tower and aim at 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.090
 commander's box which is 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.300
 vulnerability easiest on the second 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.030
 place for ease of destruction is abrams 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.490
 but in third place is a Chinese tank 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.420
 which is the most difficult in 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.580
 the destruction 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.800
 the fact is that on the right side it is not 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.930
 almost impossible to destroy data 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.330
 way because the machine gun he has 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.580
 is not centered and accordingly 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.910
 if we put a rocket on a machine gun then she 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.190
 deals 48 damage then it is also 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.110
 no small size tank immediately displayed 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.850
 and after you release the second 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.340
 projectile he will have nine percent 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.740
 it will be brought to the fire you definitely 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.080
 he would have to destroy the engineer either 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.750
 get out in general thread and at the same time destroy 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.460
 you either just tan in the tanks after 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.890
 of how we figured out the technique 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.510
 the destruction of the camper tank I'll tell you 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.490
 about the usefulness of the application of this 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.650
 technology in the game for the rest 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.590
 technique the thing is vertical 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.990
 rocket launch is more successful than 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.730
 horizontal first horizontal 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.840
 the launch of raw rockets may prevent 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.280
 some kind of obstacle knoll mound and 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.890
 other if the tank suddenly hides behind 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.380
 shelter if you launch a rocket 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.810
 vertically the tank will not be able to 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.200
 hide behind cover the rocket will fly him 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.810
 in the tower and if this rocket hits 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.300
 upright tank damage from 30 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.490
 up to 50 units and he immediately 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.980
 immobilizes regardless 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.660
 what damage was done does not help him 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.730
 active armor they will still 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.950
 immobilized and accordingly will be finished off 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.840
 your allies if he is near 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.420
 also vertical missile hit 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.460
 immediately btr leads to its immobilization 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.190
 but it does standard damage 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.450
 uncritical rocket launch 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.760
 also safer 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.289
 if suddenly you come back behind the infantry 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.719
 forever and ever 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.300
 can kill because time is spent 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:41.490
 in targeting you have much less 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.680
 rather than you launch a rocket 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.749
 in a horizontal way you will have 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.669
 time to look around at the time of recharge and 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:50.039
 also you need much less time 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.439
 to aim at the technique because 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:55.439
 rocket going down from the top flying faster 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:57.559
 rather than horizontally well and here with the technician 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:07:00.149
 destruction of tanks, I probably finish 

00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:02.909
 let all tankers hate me now 

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:04.619
 campers but if you think that to the tank 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:06.930
 it's impossible to get close if u have an arrow 

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:07.709
 worth the location scanner then you 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.259
 are mistaken 

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:13.199
 but I'll tell you about it in 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:15.270
 next video subscribe to my 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.849
 channel not to miss the whole thing 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.599
 interesting and you learn how to get 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:20.610
 to tank 

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:22.680
 discreetly even if he uses 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.069
 location scanner see you soon 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.069
 until
