guys a better idea about what can

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.700 
guys a better idea about what can
actually<00:00:05.880> happen<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.630> bathroom<00:00:07.170> ceiling

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
actually happen to a bathroom ceiling

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.970 
actually happen to a bathroom ceiling
when<00:00:08.550> there<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.059> too<00:00:09.300> much<00:00:09.450> moisture<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.320> not

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
when there is too much moisture and not

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.339 
when there is too much moisture and not
enough<00:00:11.340> ventilation<00:00:11.900> what<00:00:12.900> you're<00:00:13.050> looking

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
enough ventilation what you're looking

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.059 
enough ventilation what you're looking
at<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.370> small<00:00:15.120> spot<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.739> the

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:17.069 
at here is a small spot on on the

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:19.759 
at here is a small spot on on the
ceiling<00:00:17.489> of<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.819> bathroom<00:00:18.419> and<00:00:18.839> of<00:00:19.529> course

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:19.769 
ceiling of the bathroom and of course

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.300 
ceiling of the bathroom and of course
it's<00:00:20.039> from<00:00:20.429> an<00:00:20.939> accumulation<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.929> moisture

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
it's from an accumulation of moisture

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.769 
it's from an accumulation of moisture
because<00:00:23.310> there<00:00:23.819> isn't<00:00:24.029> enough<00:00:24.539> ventilation

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
because there isn't enough ventilation

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.460 
because there isn't enough ventilation
now<00:00:25.439> here's<00:00:25.679> the<00:00:25.859> ceiling<00:00:26.720> after<00:00:27.720> about<00:00:28.050> five

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
now here's the ceiling after about five

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.099 
now here's the ceiling after about five
minutes<00:00:28.499> of<00:00:29.039> being<00:00:29.909> in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.300> shower<00:00:30.599> now

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
minutes of being in the shower now

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.590 
minutes of being in the shower now
remember<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.919> door<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.489> closed<00:00:32.850> there<00:00:33.300> are

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
remember the door was closed there are

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.830 
remember the door was closed there are
no<00:00:33.960> windows<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.769> the<00:00:35.429> ventilation<00:00:35.940> fan<00:00:36.510> in

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
no windows and the ventilation fan in

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.950 
no windows and the ventilation fan in
this<00:00:37.559> bathroom<00:00:38.070> wasn't<00:00:39.059> working<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
this bathroom wasn't working and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.979 
this bathroom wasn't working and
realistically<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.949> wasn't<00:00:41.429> working<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.870> know

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
realistically it wasn't working you know

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.680 
realistically it wasn't working you know
on<00:00:43.109> a<00:00:43.140> scale<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.649> 1<00:00:43.859> to<00:00:44.070> 1<00:00:44.429> to<00:00:44.460> 100<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.300> would<00:00:45.359> say

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
on a scale of 1 to 1 to 100 I would say

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.329 
on a scale of 1 to 1 to 100 I would say
this<00:00:45.870> thing<00:00:46.109> was<00:00:46.230> probably<00:00:46.410> working<00:00:46.800> at<00:00:47.070> about

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
this thing was probably working at about

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.319 
this thing was probably working at about
20%<00:00:48.199> capacity<00:00:49.199> it<00:00:49.379> wasn't<00:00:49.649> even<00:00:49.710> close

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
20% capacity it wasn't even close

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.500 
20% capacity it wasn't even close
otherwise<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.570> wouldn't<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.440> problem

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
otherwise we wouldn't have this problem

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.840 
otherwise we wouldn't have this problem
here's<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.690> arrow<00:00:54.899> pointing<00:00:55.499> to<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:56.370> moisture

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
here's an arrow pointing to the moisture

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.049 
here's an arrow pointing to the moisture
in<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.589> ceiling<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.249> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.879> there

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
in on the ceiling and you can see there

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.040 
in on the ceiling and you can see there
are<00:01:00.409> parts<00:01:01.409> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.800> ceiling<00:01:02.069> that<00:01:02.789> aren't<00:01:03.659> wet

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
are parts of the ceiling that aren't wet

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.789 
are parts of the ceiling that aren't wet
now<00:01:04.979> here's<00:01:05.159> another<00:01:05.220> arrow<00:01:05.880> pointing<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
now here's another arrow pointing to the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.010 
now here's another arrow pointing to the
parts<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> ceiling<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.390> still<00:01:09.689> dry

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
parts of the ceiling that are still dry

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810 
parts of the ceiling that are still dry
now<00:01:10.259> another<00:01:10.619> problem<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.369> bathroom

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
now another problem with this bathroom

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.050 
now another problem with this bathroom

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and I don't like to see this is they

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.289 
and I don't like to see this is they
used<00:01:15.299> flat<00:01:15.719> paint<00:01:16.350> or<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> satin<00:01:17.490> based<00:01:17.759> finish

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

in a bathroom and this basically lets

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.310 
in a bathroom and this basically lets
the<00:01:22.590> water<00:01:22.770> absorb<00:01:23.430> into<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.420> drywall<00:01:24.689> a

the water absorb into the drywall a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.010 
the water absorb into the drywall a
little<00:01:26.070> faster<00:01:26.490> than<00:01:26.700> semi-gloss<00:01:27.329> or<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.719> high

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
little faster than semi-gloss or a high

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
about how much moisture actually

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.459 
about how much moisture actually
accumulates<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.799> top<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.469> unventilated

a<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:20.520> bit<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.820> moisture<00:02:20.940> there<00:02:21.360> but<00:02:21.450> I

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
a little bit of moisture there but I

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.900 
a little bit of moisture there but I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
perspective here of how much water is

perspective here of how much water is
actually<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.300> ceiling<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:29.010> let's<00:02:29.220> wrap

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
actually on the ceiling so let's wrap

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.700 
actually on the ceiling so let's wrap
things<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:29.910> here<00:02:29.970> if<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.080> spot<00:02:31.470> like

some fresh air in there it's going to

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.300 
some fresh air in there it's going to
lessen<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.400> amount<00:03:20.520> of<00:03:20.760> moisture<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.180> can

have<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> fan<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.459> you're<00:03:27.030> getting<00:03:27.209> this

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
have a fan and you're getting this

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.870 
have a fan and you're getting this
moisture<00:03:27.990> in<00:03:28.170> there<00:03:28.470> then<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.400> might<00:03:29.610> want<00:03:29.820> to

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
moisture in there then you might want to

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.930 
moisture in there then you might want to
replace<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.510> fan<00:03:31.070> or<00:03:32.070> check<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.730> make<00:03:32.880> sure

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
replace the fan or check to make sure

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.300 
replace the fan or check to make sure
it's<00:03:33.209> actually<00:03:33.390> working<00:03:33.930> properly<00:03:34.560> sometimes

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
it's actually working properly sometimes

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.820 
it's actually working properly sometimes
you're<00:03:35.430> gonna<00:03:35.550> have<00:03:35.610> obstructions<00:03:36.540> this<00:03:37.380> fan

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
you're gonna have obstructions this fan

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.100 
you're gonna have obstructions this fan
here<00:03:38.250> actually<00:03:38.850> needs<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.240> be<00:03:39.360> cleaned<00:03:39.870> that

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
here actually needs to be cleaned that

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.510 
here actually needs to be cleaned that
there's<00:03:40.290> dust<00:03:40.770> all<00:03:41.130> around<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:42.630> perimeter<00:03:43.380> of

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
there's dust all around the perimeter of

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.640 
there's dust all around the perimeter of
the<00:03:44.520> cover<00:03:44.820> there<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.360> mean<00:03:45.630> come<00:03:45.900> on<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.410> this

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
the cover there I mean come on this this

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.060 
the cover there I mean come on this this
is<00:03:46.830> going<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:47.310> obstructing<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:49.230> airflow

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
is going to be obstructing the airflow

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.280 
is going to be obstructing the airflow
so<00:03:50.670> again<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.540> could<00:03:51.690> be<00:03:51.750> just<00:03:52.140> as

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
so again this this could be just as

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.190 
so again this this could be just as
simple<00:03:52.470> as<00:03:52.740> cleaning<00:03:53.100> out<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:54.720> ventilation

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
simple as cleaning out the ventilation

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.130 
simple as cleaning out the ventilation
system<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.250> you're<00:03:56.940> done<00:03:57.240> you've<00:03:57.600> eliminated

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
system and you're done you've eliminated

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.000 
system and you're done you've eliminated
the<00:03:58.590> problem<00:03:59.959> again<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.170> already<00:04:01.410> mentioned

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
the problem again I already mentioned

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.570 
the problem again I already mentioned
this<00:04:02.220> but<00:04:02.670> if<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.540> have<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:04.170> flat<00:04:04.560> or<00:04:04.830> a<00:04:04.860> satin
