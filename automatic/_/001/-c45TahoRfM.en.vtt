at least but that was very very close

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.060 
at least but that was very very close
I'm<00:01:39.869> not<00:01:40.020> sure<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.350> give<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.560> less<00:01:40.770> time

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
I'm not sure if they give you less time

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.590 
I'm not sure if they give you less time
or<00:01:41.220> more<00:01:41.369> time<00:01:41.430> if<00:01:41.909> you're<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.150> co-op<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.479> what

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
or more time if you're in co-op is what

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.139 
or more time if you're in co-op is what
I<00:01:42.659> was<00:01:42.780> trying<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.079> say<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:44.000> anyways<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
I was trying to say there anyways I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.280 
I was trying to say there anyways I
don't<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.450> we've<00:01:45.570> missed<00:01:45.750> anything<00:01:46.110> else

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
don't think we've missed anything else

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.749 
don't think we've missed anything else
that<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.770> everything<00:01:47.430> else<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.670> we

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that I think everything else that we

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.310 
that I think everything else that we
need<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:47.970> after<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.479> checkpoint<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.140> there's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
need is after that checkpoint so there's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.020 
need is after that checkpoint so there's
the<00:01:49.439> L<00:01:49.560> letter<00:01:49.799> right<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:50.280> know<00:01:50.790> what's

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the L letter right there know what's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.730 
the L letter right there know what's
going<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.390> backer<00:01:51.600> holy<00:01:51.930> crap<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.409> squid

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
going on the backer holy crap that squid

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.219 
going on the backer holy crap that squid
is<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.070> destroying<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:54.420> stinking

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
is just destroying that stinking

around the corner here I don't want to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.109 
around the corner here I don't want to
miss<00:02:05.829> still<00:02:06.130> like<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.280> barrel<00:02:06.759> I<00:02:06.820> know<00:02:06.880> that

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
miss still like a barrel I know that

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.490 
miss still like a barrel I know that
much<00:02:07.299> yes<00:02:07.479> it's<00:02:07.689> this<00:02:07.780> barrel<00:02:08.110> right<00:02:08.259> here

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
much yes it's this barrel right here

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.440 
much yes it's this barrel right here
we're<00:02:09.340> trying<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.580> do<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:09.819> wait<00:02:10.030> Joe's<00:02:10.179> playing

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
we're trying to do is wait Joe's playing

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.720 
we're trying to do is wait Joe's playing
directly<00:02:10.869> up<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:12.040> sort<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.340> crest

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
directly up and in that sort of crest

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.040 
directly up and in that sort of crest
and<00:02:12.970> then<00:02:13.150> launch<00:02:13.390> yourself<00:02:13.480> with<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> puzzle

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
and then launch yourself with a puzzle

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.270 
and then launch yourself with a puzzle
piece<00:02:14.140> then<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.770> want<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.950> make<00:02:15.069> sure<00:02:15.190> that

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
piece then you want to make sure that

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.920 
piece then you want to make sure that
you<00:02:15.370> shoot<00:02:15.550> yourself<00:02:15.610> back<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.150> dry<00:02:16.420> land<00:02:16.450> and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
you shoot yourself back on dry land and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.180 
you shoot yourself back on dry land and
not<00:02:17.110> screw<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.770> land<00:02:17.980> into<00:02:18.160> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
not screw that up and land into the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.670 
not screw that up and land into the
ocean<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.730> just<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.959> can<00:02:20.380> be<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.470> tricky

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
ocean that is just it's can be a tricky

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.290 
ocean that is just it's can be a tricky
fail<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.130> can<00:02:21.160> screw<00:02:21.489> that<00:02:21.610> up<00:02:21.670> pretty<00:02:22.090> easily

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
fail you can screw that up pretty easily

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.180 
fail you can screw that up pretty easily
I<00:02:22.540> think<00:02:22.569> I'm<00:02:23.290> not<00:02:23.470> sure<00:02:23.530> it's<00:02:23.800> like<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> auto

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
I think I'm not sure it's like it auto

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.650 
I think I'm not sure it's like it auto
barrel<00:02:24.640> either<00:02:24.849> so<00:02:25.060> there<00:02:25.330> might<00:02:25.510> be<00:02:25.540> some

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
barrel either so there might be some

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.290 
barrel either so there might be some
leniency<00:02:26.260> with<00:02:26.769> it<00:02:26.920> I'm<00:02:27.010> sure<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.030> be

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
leniency with it I'm sure but just be

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.630 
leniency with it I'm sure but just be
careful<00:02:28.530> also<00:02:29.530> over<00:02:29.709> here<00:02:29.739> don't<00:02:30.099> stand<00:02:30.400> still

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
careful also over here don't stand still

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.089 
careful also over here don't stand still
for<00:02:30.970> too<00:02:31.120> long<00:02:31.330> cause<00:02:31.450> I'm<00:02:31.569> pretty<00:02:31.870> sure<00:02:32.099> the

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
for too long cause I'm pretty sure the

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.410 
for too long cause I'm pretty sure the
technicals<00:02:33.580> from<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.760> cracking<00:02:34.180> will

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
technicals from the cracking will

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.840 
technicals from the cracking will
actually<00:02:34.980> hit<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.130> if<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.250> stand<00:02:36.430> still<00:02:36.580> for

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
actually hit you if you stand still for

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.030 
actually hit you if you stand still for
too<00:02:37.000> long<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:37.450> just<00:02:37.600> keep<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:37.930> mind<00:02:38.049> I'm

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
too long so just keep that in mind I'm

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.620 
too long so just keep that in mind I'm
not<00:02:39.100> willing<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.580> test<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:40.030> theory<00:02:40.360> though

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
not willing to test that theory though
