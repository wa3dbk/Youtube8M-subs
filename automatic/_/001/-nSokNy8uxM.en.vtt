while<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:45.899> thing<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.200> definitely

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
while and one thing I'm definitely

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.350 
while and one thing I'm definitely
seeing<00:00:46.770> about<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> show<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.789> there's<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
seeing about this show is there's a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.069 
seeing about this show is there's a
really<00:00:48.660> strong<00:00:49.039> dichotomy<00:00:50.039> between<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.809> sort

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
really strong dichotomy between the sort

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.819 
really strong dichotomy between the sort
of<00:00:52.610> console<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.320> traditional<00:00:55.320> sort<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
of console and traditional sort of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
of console and traditional sort of
traditional<00:00:56.399> gaming<00:00:57.239> community<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:57.809> is

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
traditional gaming community which is

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.049 
traditional gaming community which is
really<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> around<00:00:59.789> us

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
really what we see here and around us

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.540 
really what we see here and around us
and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.199> sort<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.800> notion<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> indie

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and then the sort of notion of the indie

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.980 
and then the sort of notion of the indie
games<00:01:02.789> social<00:01:03.690> media<00:01:04.019> games<00:01:04.260> web<00:01:04.710> based<00:01:04.949> games

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
free-to-play games that really a lot of

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.300 
free-to-play games that really a lot of
the<00:01:10.799> talks<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.189> show<00:01:11.369> her<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.470> I<00:01:13.470> think

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the talks the show her about and I think

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.340 
the talks the show her about and I think
that<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.750> depends<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.229> which

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that it's so then it depends on which

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.660 
that it's so then it depends on which
direction<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.830> coming<00:01:17.130> from<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.490> you're<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
direction are coming from if you're a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.580 
direction are coming from if you're a
flash<00:01:17.970> developer<00:01:18.180> who's<00:01:19.020> been<00:01:19.200> developing

games for phones and you're coming onto

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.929 
games for phones and you're coming onto
the<00:01:22.590> netbook<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.040> were<00:01:23.130> looking<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> vast

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the netbook you were looking at a vast

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.270 
the netbook you were looking at a vast
embarrassment<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.869> riches<00:01:25.040> right<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.159> were

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
embarrassment of riches right you were

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.460 
embarrassment of riches right you were
going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> gazillion<00:01:27.720> more<00:01:28.350> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
going to have like a gazillion more of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.490 
going to have like a gazillion more of
everything<00:01:29.240> if<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.659> are<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.990> bleeding<00:01:31.380> edge

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
everything if you are a bleeding edge

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.740 
everything if you are a bleeding edge
gamer<00:01:31.799> who's<00:01:32.729> been<00:01:32.880> pushing<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.299> limits<00:01:33.600> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
gamer who's been pushing the limits of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.620 
gamer who's been pushing the limits of
the<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> hottest<00:01:34.860> GPUs<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.479> know

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the you know the hottest GPUs you know

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.649 
the you know the hottest GPUs you know
and<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.860> scoff<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.820> know<00:01:38.909> 60<00:01:39.299> frames<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and you scoff at you know 60 frames a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.840 
and you scoff at you know 60 frames a
second<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.500> you're<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
second then you're going to have to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.770 
second then you're going to have to
scale<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.090> back<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.790> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
scale it back right I think that in that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.120 
scale it back right I think that in that
community<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.590> thing<00:01:46.799> we're<00:01:46.950> definitely

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
community one thing we're definitely

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.859 
community one thing we're definitely
seeing<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.090> lot<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> people<00:01:48.479> have

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
seeing is that a lot of people have

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
seeing is that a lot of people have
gotten<00:01:49.140> very<00:01:49.229> smart<00:01:49.710> about<00:01:49.950> writing<00:01:50.250> their

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
gotten very smart about writing their

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.280 
gotten very smart about writing their
games<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.729> C<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.180> writing<00:01:51.930> them<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.200> they

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
games in C and writing them so they

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.560 
games in C and writing them so they
scale<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.189> write<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.610> essentially

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
scale right so they write to essentially

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.050 
scale right so they write to essentially
an<00:01:54.930> infinitely<00:01:55.560> scalar<00:01:55.979> set<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.340> screen

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
an infinitely scalar set of screen

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.539 
an infinitely scalar set of screen

requirements to get your games in we

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.960 
requirements to get your games in we
have<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.610> few<00:02:36.180> sort<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.459> legal<00:02:38.459> requirements

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
have a few sort of legal requirements

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.090 
have a few sort of legal requirements
but<00:02:39.090> generally<00:02:39.660> speaking<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:40.230> know<00:02:40.350> as<00:02:40.890> far

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
but generally speaking you know as far

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.080 
but generally speaking you know as far
as<00:02:41.220> we're<00:02:41.340> concerned<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.790> more<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.000> merrier

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
as we're concerned the more the merrier

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.120 
as we're concerned the more the merrier
and<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:46.440> depends<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:46.800> what<00:02:46.920> direction

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
