misters<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.370> stuff<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.730> keep<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.000> humid<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:39.750> I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
misters and stuff to keep it humid but I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.340 
misters and stuff to keep it humid but I
just<00:02:40.380> sprained<00:02:40.830> my<00:02:41.070> tank<00:02:41.880> down<00:02:42.060> daily<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.870> try

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
just sprained my tank down daily and try

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.810 
just sprained my tank down daily and try
to<00:02:43.410> keep<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.740> somewhat<00:02:43.980> moist<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.580> do<00:02:44.670> not

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
to keep it somewhat moist you do not

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.410 
to keep it somewhat moist you do not
want<00:02:45.060> /<00:02:45.480> moisten<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.960> substrate<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:47.700> because

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
want / moisten the substrate but because

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.170 
want / moisten the substrate but because
I<00:02:48.540> could<00:02:48.750> lead<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.050> mold<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.560> other<00:02:50.490> exactly

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
I could lead to mold and other exactly

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.160 
I could lead to mold and other exactly
stuff<00:02:51.600> like<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> karma<00:02:52.650> throbb<00:02:53.040> for<00:02:54.950> substrate

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
stuff like a karma throbb for substrate

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.160 
stuff like a karma throbb for substrate
this<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> substrate<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.910> substrate<00:03:00.360> at

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
this is the substrate the substrate at

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.080 
this is the substrate the substrate at
the<00:03:01.350> beginning<00:03:01.650> which<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.220> saw<00:03:02.400> awesome<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.000> used

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
the beginning which I saw awesome I used

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.410 
the beginning which I saw awesome I used
4th<00:03:06.090> floor<00:03:06.590> by<00:03:07.590> zoom<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.880> staff<00:03:12.120> works

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
4th floor by zoom it and the staff works

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.880 
4th floor by zoom it and the staff works
pretty<00:03:12.570> well<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.020> can<00:03:13.050> use<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.320> for<00:03:13.590> frogs

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
pretty well and you can use it for frogs

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.750 
pretty well and you can use it for frogs
and<00:03:14.220> snakes<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.110> photo/susan<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.410> sucked<00:03:16.760> but

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
and snakes and photo/susan it sucked but

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.140

something new you laid off Pawn i have
over<00:04:36.210> there<00:04:37.400> right<00:04:38.400> here<00:04:38.699> and<00:04:39.060> then<00:04:39.509> bomb<00:04:39.690> in<00:04:39.840> a

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
over there right here and then bomb in a

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.629 
over there right here and then bomb in a
pond<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.440> do<00:04:40.560> not<00:04:40.680> want<00:04:40.919> to<00:04:40.979> put<00:04:41.069> gravel<00:04:41.310> rocks

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
pond you do not want to put gravel rocks

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.309 
pond you do not want to put gravel rocks
because<00:04:42.060> those<00:04:42.180> can<00:04:42.419> be<00:04:42.449> harmful<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.080> Frog

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
because those can be harmful to the Frog

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.100 
because those can be harmful to the Frog
especially<00:04:43.889> if<00:04:43.979> they<00:04:44.099> swallow<00:04:44.400> them<00:04:44.699> I<00:04:45.110> use

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
especially if they swallow them I use

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.270 
especially if they swallow them I use
like<00:04:46.680> just<00:04:47.280> glass<00:04:47.849> like<00:04:48.210> fairy<00:04:48.539> stone<00:04:48.840> rocks

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
like just glass like fairy stone rocks

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.860 
like just glass like fairy stone rocks
because<00:04:50.280> they're<00:04:50.430> smooth<00:04:50.759> so<00:04:51.360> they<00:04:51.479> won't<00:04:51.599> cut

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
because they're smooth so they won't cut

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.170 
because they're smooth so they won't cut
the<00:04:51.990> belly<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:52.319> the<00:04:52.380> Frog<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:53.009> think<00:04:53.789> that's

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
the belly of the Frog I think that's

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.760 
the belly of the Frog I think that's
what<00:04:54.389> you<00:04:54.419> want<00:04:54.599> to<00:04:54.659> make<00:04:54.750> sure<00:04:54.780> is<00:04:55.080> that<00:04:55.139> you

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.610 
don't have anything sorry that will cut
the<00:04:59.550> belly<00:04:59.729> of<00:04:59.880> the<00:04:59.970> Frog<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:03.810> also<00:05:04.080> make<00:05:04.440> sure
