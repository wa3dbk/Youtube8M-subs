00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.150
 there are readers 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.639
 my name is paulo grande and if it is 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 best buy a weekly space where the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.490
 People clarify doubts of who wants 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.949
 change cars 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.570
 today I will answer two readers 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.789
 once because the two asked the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.640
 same car closed 2008 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.710
 the first question of luiz otÃ¡vio lobo 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.289
 he wants to know about the car exchange 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.550
 with automatic gearbox and I confess to 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.869
 You, too, had curiosity in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.059
 relation to this exchange because it 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.520
 have only four gears is 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.070
 installed in the engine aspirated 1.6 being 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.629
 that pj also has 1.6 turbo which is more 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.030
 powerful that day to day I did not notice anything 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.789
 wrong in this exchange is the engine of the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.629
 worked within the expected 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.449
 in a spin did not know too much between a 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.090
 brand and another or feel holes before 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.670
 of the troops from day to day it goes very well 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.430
 on the test track the performance was 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.159
 median thus within the expected but 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.570
 one should not take responsibility for the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.180
 the performance of the car that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.380
 there is a motor existed there are other 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.580
 factors that teach performance 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.840
 remembering that his consumption was very 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.150
 good 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.570
 another reader daniel sanches he wants 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.880
 to know if it's worth buying a 2008 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.140
 and I respond that depends on the expectation 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.270
 that he has 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.390
 if he wants his own off-road car 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.799
 land is perhaps not worth it because it is a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.509
 urban car by design is now a 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.130
 car to use on a daily basis as the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.920
 most people do like zezinho 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.320
 Sometimes with facts, it 's easy, it 's a car. 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.030
 to direct the position of jean and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.430
 good visibility 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.159
 the small fast steering wheel it is well 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.899
 finished well equipped with the stitch 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.210
 negative, maybe we can quote the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.460
 inner space that is not even tight 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.290
 and that performance is also not 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.320
 sweeping 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.189
 but both pro daniel and paulo luiz 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.590
 Otavio 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.469
 I recommend the test drive as always 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.569
 I make our readers here 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.160
 why the best way to assess 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.690
 Do you like it or not on the boardwalk? 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.330
 to behave 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.610
 if the pregnant woman has the experience you 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.310
 have any further questions any comments 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.310
 please leave our address, thank you
