00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.659
 i 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.280
 I had not prepared it let's show him 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.309
 basically what is part of what 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.180
 have friends in this case this follow 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.390
 use 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.840
 you jotes in this case 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.539
 these are containers that for balls of 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.839
 tennis as I had already explained 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.210
 this container is basically what it has 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.180
 one tin 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.270
 with the candle bonus 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.790
 It has a matchbox has carton 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:44.970
 there is a little ball made of paper 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.360
 has here filter fluff 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.330
 dryer 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.440
 it has some wooden tics as we see 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.440
 here some finite sticks 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:02.579
 additional that has the chemistry that comes 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.229
 basically on the faces three devices 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.409
 so he can be put inside for 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:12.350
 so that it absorbs moisture 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:18.710
 apart from that then I have here 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:22.610
 another base is I have an envelope of soup and 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.240
 three portions of water here I have a 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.970
 knife 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.970
 multi-purpose 16 functions 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.220
 an external I have a magiclick life with 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.770
 Many of you already know him 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.790
 and I have here the stove that 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.520
 used for external 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.040
 to place external 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.990
 and I do not just have a little pot 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.990
 and basically for what we now show 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.390
 what is it called 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.689
 it is very easy and simple 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.000
 for campsites too or to have you 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.000
 at home 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.409
 and it's easy to transport too 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.760
 are a little better from the 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.760
 right 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.500
 so you can see how this works 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.859
 to place the Canary Islands 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.890
 the distance 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.080
 if we want to cook but we are doing well 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.660
 like water 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.250
 or what you 're going to put to heat there and 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.890
 basically, we can make a 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.120
 sopita or heat food 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.569
 if you want to take advantage of the external 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.569
 maximum 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.030
 this idea is that commonly people 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.520
 who work in catering 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.130
 and the restaurant recognizes 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.690
 what you do is if you want to cook 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.930
 In the middle of a fire, put the lid on 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.660
 half 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.890
 she is not going to pay 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.740
 kitchens and when I've finished using 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.350
 the crucitas of kitchens as you can 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.530
 re-cover and so gives you the 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.810
 outermost external without the lid as 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.080
 we say 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.560
 the strong car as we say on the street 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.020
 because natura basically two hours 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.180
 in this case, if we cook half 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.180
 game possibly with a little more 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.640
 it's a little bit more 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.590
 well not to help render any 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.140
 activity that we have is still 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.110
 on you have to be careful because 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.850
 that kind of de geli to pay her a 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.660
 bit difficult already when it is consumed by 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.130
 that pay then basically it's all 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.989
 demonstrating this part forward but 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.750
 Then I went with another video demonstrating 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.760
 by all the cadistas who have in the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.760
 kit to tell them what it is that has 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.500
 my people if they like these videos and they 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.430
 like what we are doing in this 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.900
 page 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.550
 remember to give them in this video 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.310
 subscribe to this YouTube channel
