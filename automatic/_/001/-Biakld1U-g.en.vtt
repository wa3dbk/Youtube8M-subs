because i made it earlier um I put the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.050 
because i made it earlier um I put the
eye<00:02:13.960> pin<00:02:14.290> in<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:15.700> I'll<00:02:16.030> start

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
eye pin in it and then I'll start

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.140 
eye pin in it and then I'll start
putting<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.050> UM<00:02:18.180> whipped<00:02:19.180> cream<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.490> but

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
putting the UM whipped cream on it but

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.540 
putting the UM whipped cream on it but
first<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:23.170> need<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.350> make<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.680> straw<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.490> you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
first you need to make the straw so you

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.870 
first you need to make the straw so you
can<00:02:24.790> bake<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.270> with<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:27.220> starbucks<00:02:27.640> coffee

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
can bake it with the starbucks coffee

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.780 
can bake it with the starbucks coffee
because<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.810> cannot<00:02:29.260> um<00:02:31.320> make<00:02:32.320> or<00:02:32.710> put<00:02:33.580> the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
because you cannot um make or put the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.840 
because you cannot um make or put the
whipped<00:02:33.940> cream<00:02:34.240> on<00:02:34.390> before<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.820> bake<00:02:36.820> it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
whipped cream on before you bake it

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.870 
whipped cream on before you bake it
because<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.870> might<00:02:38.200> be<00:02:38.770> flammable<00:02:39.070> I'm<00:02:39.580> not

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
because it might be flammable I'm not

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.570 
because it might be flammable I'm not
exactly<00:02:40.240> sure<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:41.160> then<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.400> make<00:02:42.550> a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
exactly sure but then you just make a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.630 
exactly sure but then you just make a
little<00:02:42.760> straw<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:45.070> doesn't<00:02:45.370> matter<00:02:45.460> what

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
little straw it doesn't matter what

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
little straw it doesn't matter what
color<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:46.210> used<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.660> like<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:47.020> use<00:02:47.170> green

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
color you used I like to use green

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.700 
color you used I like to use green
because<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:50.170> matches<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.680> starbucks<00:02:51.430> logo

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
because it matches the starbucks logo

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.170 
because it matches the starbucks logo
just<00:02:53.710> like<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.070> now<00:02:54.490> once<00:02:54.730> you're<00:02:54.970> done

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
to be able to see the eye pin which is

right there and if you don't have
silicone<00:03:55.360> or<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.220> can<00:03:57.400> probably<00:03:57.580> fight

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
silicone or like you can probably fight

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.670 
silicone or like you can probably fight
find<00:03:58.330> it<00:03:58.510> at<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.660> Lowe's<00:03:59.620> or<00:03:59.650> Home<00:04:00.070> Depot<00:04:00.640> or

some type of hardware store if you don't
have<00:04:05.740> silicone<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.550> could<00:04:06.820> probably<00:04:07.180> use

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
have silicone you could probably use

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.910 
have silicone you could probably use
like<00:04:09.450> mm<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.690> don't<00:04:11.050> know<00:04:11.260> if<00:04:11.380> polymer<00:04:11.800> clay

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
like mm I don't know if polymer clay

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.010 
like mm I don't know if polymer clay
would<00:04:12.130> work<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.760> could<00:04:12.970> swirl<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.600> polymer

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
would work you could swirl the polymer

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.520 
would work you could swirl the polymer
clay<00:04:14.170> into<00:04:14.560> here<00:04:14.920> but<00:04:15.900> silicon<00:04:16.900> looks<00:04:17.169> mostly

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
clay into here but silicon looks mostly

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.960 
clay into here but silicon looks mostly
like<00:04:17.620> whipped<00:04:17.950> cream<00:04:18.040> so<00:04:18.220> there's<00:04:18.790> whipped
