00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:10.849
 [music] 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.710
 what engine do i have here now 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 kicked 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.359
 burned out electric motor means after 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.880
 how I bought 3 engine and she got me 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.619
 we burned the price of each motor in the area 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.720
 five thousand 600 rubles it costs 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.059
 Ekaterinburg 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.949
 that's how the calculations there do not show 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.920
 that something I do not know the rights that 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.559
 something not so found and from three people 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.909
 which can be wound to the Slav in 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.299
 Russia naturally 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.909
 that is, 1 person is duyunov 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.820
 which is in my Zelenograd 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.949
 or Moscow region somewhere there but it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.320
 the author himself yes it yes it is the author himself 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.449
 Winding Means Well Naturally to Moscow 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.049
 go to rewind the engine 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.820
 it's pretty clave and happy 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.369
 accidents I climbed means to the forum 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.530
 cheaters there i found that works 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.359
 only the Slav woman himself 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.969
 engine which here is the translation it is already on 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.850
 Slavic means he passes his 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:25.289
 torque through reducer tsn 016 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.420
 on the verge of the rotator and here already through 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.579
 This thing through the swivel served 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.130
 air on the contrary knowing that what happened 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.670
 eventually the engine has stopped 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.219
 warm it turns very powerful that is 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.340
 if earlier let's say a projectile bites 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.979
 then he just got up that is a little bit 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.490
 literally rock can't crank it 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.499
 got up 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.170
 now he doesn't get up he starts 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:51.479
 the rods spin with great effort then 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.649
 there is a moment really grew I just not 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.280
 I can not measure it 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.469
 Unfortunately, I'm sorry but I myself 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.569
 the fact that the engine has become more powerful 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.490
 they stopped to burn stopped to burn yes 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.069
 this is the most important because that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.539
 when I drilled the engine 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:11.250
 all pandora weighs about half a ton 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.830
 So it turns out that the whole thing is 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.230
 she tries to rotate under huge 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.760
 weight and when you're still stupid in the depths 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.000
 i.e 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.560
 approximately 30 meters permissible in the rock 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.599
 you go 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.640
 there are completely different loads there already and weight 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.180
 rod is added each bar there 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.569
 a kilo of 50 weighs himself this bur 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.659
 weighs a kilo 50 that is all very 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.810
 serious load here and i am very satisfied 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.360
 I recommend rewinding to Slav 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.920
 coordinates of the person who is peremat 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:52.379
 rewinds you can find right here 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:54.900
 my dear here are the news here 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.720
 in the big bear still want you 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.549
 share with my friend Dmitry 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.220
 decided mean about us so 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.980
 it worked out well with the rig we decided 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.099
 also rewind windmills show where they are 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.549
 there were fingers yes here they were right there 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.459
 stick sticks 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:20.819
 just shelves stick out here let's go 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:23.370
 let's see so here it is a windmill rather 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.840
 his working part means here 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.010
 permanent magnets are present 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.989
 neodymium 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.510
 But on such a rotor, they are executed 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:37.639
 Means and winding respectively means 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:43.410
 the winding here is three phases of 24 volts 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:45.840
 instructions it is written that he is 24 volts 400 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.900
 watt every kind of talk but in fact 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.150
 it turns out that even with such storm 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.000
 winds like we have here that here 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.030
 really takes all the plywood there is not all that 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.379
 not screwed can carry there on his 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.859
 greenhouse yes by the way we had a case 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.930
 more interesting literally in the spring 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.970
 in the greenhouse raised along with the bar 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.519
 that is, here's the usual greenhouse that goes 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.250
 Here is a polycarbonate polycarbonate with 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.250
 Profile scolded yes and it turns out 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.799
 There were also stakes in a bit of earth and timber a hundred 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.109
 a hundred and fifty her just raised so 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.659
 like a feather and threw meters for 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.830
 fifty i mean the wind is very serious 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.320
 but these windmills 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.930
 the american 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.980
 here's the enemies know what you do garbage 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:34.060
 because they don't produce a damn 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.510
 evening do this is not work 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.000
 what we want to do is just like that 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.930
 we have a beauty 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.260
 So we decided to motor Sergei 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.810
 try to rewind here this here Vitry 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.940
 chock that is so that he at least something well 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.040
 gave here let's hope that 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.470
 experiment will look further 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.650
 first from the first conclusion that these are exactly 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.970
 work blue and then 2 does that here 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.370
 try to find a student 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.980
 rewind yet see themselves become all bye 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.950
 show so dear friends summarize 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.720
 means that in fact we have in fact we 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.730
 we have these engines 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.760
 common nickname syndrome 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:21.020
 appointments here we have debility right 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:24.810
 leg is worth 4 kill stock version 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:37.050
 Naturally 1410 births of 4 kilowatts each 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:38.910
 all he began to work grow now year 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.690
 back with and here is this engine i'm taking 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.730
 there is also a plan to rewind 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.700
 rewind casts American wind turbine 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.010
 because it produces virtually Now 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.360
 full crap 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.030
 here maybe we are something Sergey 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.970
 let's try to solve it and if itâ€™s decided 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.590
 it will be great when 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.060
 it will be possible sect windmills rewinds on 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.639
 wonderful winding 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.090
 well stay with us subscribe 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.300
 put likes and everything on our channel 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.300
 kind 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.540
 I have been sitting for about a year
