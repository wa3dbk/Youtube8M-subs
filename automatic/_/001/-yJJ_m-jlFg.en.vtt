could<00:00:18.930> get<00:00:19.020> looks<00:00:19.260> from<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.530> second<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> third

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
could get looks from the second to third

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.170 
could get looks from the second to third
round<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.520> think<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> lot<00:00:20.790> of<00:00:20.910> people<00:00:20.970> were

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
round I think a lot of people were

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.580 
round I think a lot of people were
expecting<00:00:21.540> Ryan<00:00:21.720> Tannehill<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> star

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
expecting Ryan Tannehill to be the star

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.960 
expecting Ryan Tannehill to be the star
quarterback<00:00:22.860> in<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.280> game<00:00:23.430> Weeden<00:00:23.760> really

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
quarterback in that game Weeden really

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.330 
quarterback in that game Weeden really
outshined<00:00:24.450> him<00:00:24.630> Arizona<00:00:25.289> State<00:00:25.500> upset<00:00:25.920> USC

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
outshined him Arizona State upset USC

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.830 
outshined him Arizona State upset USC
last<00:00:26.460> week<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:26.850> one<00:00:26.940> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.119> big<00:00:27.300> factors<00:00:27.510> in

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
last week and one of the big factors in

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.810 
last week and one of the big factors in
that<00:00:27.960> was<00:00:28.110> linebacker<00:00:28.500> vontaze<00:00:28.890> burfict<00:00:28.950> yeah

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
that was linebacker vontaze burfict yeah

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.130 
that was linebacker vontaze burfict yeah
hit<00:00:29.940> a<00:00:29.970> key<00:00:30.210> interception<00:00:30.600> right<00:00:30.869> before

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
hit a key interception right before

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.540 
hit a key interception right before
halftime<00:00:31.380> then<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.770> think<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.129> keep<00:00:32.430> that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
halftime then I think really keep that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.090 
halftime then I think really keep that
victory<00:00:32.940> took<00:00:33.720> it<00:00:33.840> back<00:00:33.989> most<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.950> road

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
victory took it back most of the road

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
victory took it back most of the road
he's<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> guy<00:00:35.670> that's<00:00:35.700> got<00:00:35.940> great<00:00:36.510> take<00:00:36.780> on

pac-10 Trevin Wade the corner back from

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.400 
pac-10 Trevin Wade the corner back from

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
Arizona had gone to get some tough teams

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.770 
Arizona had gone to get some tough teams
early<00:00:46.710> he's<00:00:47.040> been<00:00:47.190> impressive<00:00:47.510> faced<00:00:48.510> three

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
early he's been impressive faced three

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.389

he's a guy that stood out even despite

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.530 
he's a guy that stood out even despite
the<00:00:52.559> losses<00:00:53.130> against<00:00:53.850> Stanford<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.300> thought<00:00:54.480> he

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
the losses against Stanford I thought he

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.959 
the losses against Stanford I thought he
was<00:00:54.630> very<00:00:54.780> good<00:00:55.230> even<00:00:55.770> against<00:00:56.070> Oregon<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
was very good even against Oregon you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.220 
was very good even against Oregon you
know<00:00:57.030> he's<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> guy<00:00:57.329> that's<00:00:57.360> may<00:00:57.870> end<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.079> very

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
know he's a guy that's may end up very

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.780 
know he's a guy that's may end up very
well<00:00:58.380> I<00:00:58.530> think<00:00:58.680> he's<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.100> put<00:00:59.340> himself<00:00:59.430> in

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
well I think he's really put himself in

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.950 
well I think he's really put himself in
in<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> middle<00:01:00.210> rounds<00:01:00.390> third<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> fourth

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
hurt in the past never missed any games

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.129 
hurt in the past never missed any games
it's<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.789> guy<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.179> does<00:01:09.420> he<00:01:09.539> have<00:01:09.630> tendonitis

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:10.139 
it's a guy that does he have tendonitis

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:11.779 
it's a guy that does he have tendonitis
in<00:01:10.229> his<00:01:10.289> knees<00:01:10.560> missed<00:01:11.130> last<00:01:11.310> week's<00:01:11.609> game

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
in his knees missed last week's game

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:13.309 
in his knees missed last week's game
against<00:01:12.090> wyoming<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.719> concussion<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:13.319 
against wyoming with a concussion I

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.649 
against wyoming with a concussion I
think<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> durability<00:01:14.429> factor<00:01:14.789> is<00:01:15.179> an<00:01:15.569> issue

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
think the durability factor is an issue

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.269 
think the durability factor is an issue
that<00:01:15.780> could<00:01:16.079> affect<00:01:16.350> his<00:01:16.409> stack<00:01:16.679> with

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:17.279 
that could affect his stack with

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:18.679 
that could affect his stack with
quarterback<00:01:17.639> from<00:01:17.789> South<00:01:17.969> Carolina<00:01:18.149> Steven

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
in the fourth quarter last week and I

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.539 
in the fourth quarter last week and I
think<00:01:31.319> he's<00:01:31.469> still<00:01:31.649> a<00:01:31.709> salad<00:01:32.130> late<00:01:32.340> round

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
prospect but he after that benching I

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.260 
prospect but he after that benching I
think<00:01:34.889> his<00:01:35.009> stack<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.490> taking<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> hit<00:01:35.909> another
