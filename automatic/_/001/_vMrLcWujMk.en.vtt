honcho bumper hung right about this

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.609 
honcho bumper hung right about this
level<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.840> see<00:00:31.050> why<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.349> would<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
level you can see why that would be a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.900 
level you can see why that would be a
problem<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.130> you're<00:00:32.279> approaching<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.730> rocks

problem as you're approaching the rocks

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.729 
problem as you're approaching the rocks
this<00:00:33.120> would<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.390> prevent<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.200> from<00:00:34.260> going

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
this would just prevent you from going

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.340 
this would just prevent you from going
up<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.070> over<00:00:35.130> anything<00:00:35.630> in<00:00:36.630> addition<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
up and over anything in addition to the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
little bit if I make this a little bit

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.280 
little bit if I make this a little bit
longer<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:23.970> it'll<00:01:24.180> take<00:01:24.840> care<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
longer here it'll take care of that

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
the the rubbing issues I do get a little

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.820 
the the rubbing issues I do get a little
bit<00:06:06.030> of<00:06:06.120> rubbing<00:06:06.390> as<00:06:06.510> I<00:06:06.630> flex<00:06:06.960> here<00:06:07.260> but

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
bit of rubbing as I flex here but

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.340 
bit of rubbing as I flex here but
nothing<00:06:08.310> too<00:06:08.520> bad<00:06:08.730> everyone<00:06:09.660> what<00:06:09.870> everyone

says<00:06:11.790> hey<00:06:11.970> get<00:06:12.180> a<00:06:12.210> lift<00:06:12.420> kit<00:06:12.630> get<00:06:12.900> a<00:06:12.930> lift<00:06:13.140> kit

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
says hey get a lift kit get a lift kit

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.470 
says hey get a lift kit get a lift kit
but<00:06:13.920> I<00:06:13.980> did<00:06:14.280> I<00:06:14.460> didn't<00:06:14.820> want<00:06:14.940> to<00:06:15.030> go<00:06:15.120> that<00:06:15.300> way

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
but I did I didn't want to go that way

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.030 
but I did I didn't want to go that way
because<00:06:16.070> you<00:06:17.070> get<00:06:17.190> a<00:06:17.220> lift<00:06:17.430> kit<00:06:17.640> it<00:06:18.060> ruins<00:06:18.720> your

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
because you get a lift kit it ruins your

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.340 
because you get a lift kit it ruins your
drive<00:06:20.040> line<00:06:20.310> angles<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.810> it<00:06:21.960> raises<00:06:22.320> your

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
drive line angles and it raises your

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.190 
drive line angles and it raises your
center<00:06:22.800> of<00:06:22.830> gravity<00:06:23.280> so<00:06:23.310> if<00:06:24.090> I<00:06:24.330> can<00:06:24.930> get<00:06:25.110> away

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
center of gravity so if I can get away

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.790 
center of gravity so if I can get away
from<00:06:25.350> doing<00:06:25.620> a<00:06:25.970> lift<00:06:26.970> kit<00:06:27.440> you<00:06:28.440> might<00:06:28.650> as<00:06:28.740> well

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
from doing a lift kit you might as well

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.770 
from doing a lift kit you might as well
do<00:06:29.040> it<00:06:29.070> because<00:06:29.550> um<00:06:29.850> it's<00:06:30.300> just<00:06:30.420> gonna<00:06:30.600> make

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
do it because um it's just gonna make

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.930 
do it because um it's just gonna make
your<00:06:30.900> performance<00:06:31.380> worse<00:06:31.620> so<00:06:32.220> here<00:06:32.460> I<00:06:32.490> am<00:06:32.580> I'm

gonna<00:06:33.030> be<00:06:34.130> getting<00:06:35.130> about<00:06:35.280> three<00:06:35.490> quarters<00:06:35.760> of

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
gonna be getting about three quarters of

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.970 
gonna be getting about three quarters of
an<00:06:35.970> inch<00:06:36.060> wider<00:06:36.510> on<00:06:36.750> both<00:06:36.960> sides

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
an inch wider on both sides

an inch wider on both sides
and<00:06:39.410> and<00:06:40.410> I'm<00:06:40.560> probably<00:06:40.980> going<00:06:41.460> to<00:06:41.550> take<00:06:41.790> the

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640 
obviously because this thing is really

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.330 
obviously because this thing is really
beat<00:07:08.970> I<00:07:09.210> really<00:07:09.750> take<00:07:10.590> this<00:07:10.620> thing<00:07:10.800> up<00:07:11.160> some

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
beat I really take this thing up some

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.780 
beat I really take this thing up some
treacherous<00:07:11.970> climbs<00:07:12.710> you<00:07:13.710> can<00:07:13.860> see<00:07:14.070> see<00:07:14.670> if<00:07:14.730> we

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:14.790 
treacherous climbs you can see see if we

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.260 
treacherous climbs you can see see if we

can see some of the yeah yeah and a lot
of<00:07:18.390> times<00:07:18.570> I<00:07:18.870> fail<00:07:19.140> on<00:07:19.380> the<00:07:19.470> climbs<00:07:19.710> and<00:07:19.950> this

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
of times I fail on the climbs and this

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.810 
of times I fail on the climbs and this
thing<00:07:20.400> comes<00:07:20.610> tomahawking<00:07:21.270> down<00:07:21.660> the<00:07:22.530> hills

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:22.820 
thing comes tomahawking down the hills

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.230 
thing comes tomahawking down the hills
and<00:07:23.820> it's<00:07:24.510> quite<00:07:25.050> dramatic<00:07:26.010> and<00:07:26.790> I<00:07:26.910> have<00:07:27.030> yet

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
and it's quite dramatic and I have yet

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.730 
and it's quite dramatic and I have yet
to<00:07:27.270> break<00:07:27.540> one<00:07:27.960> thing<00:07:28.290> yet

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
to break one thing yet

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.740 
to break one thing yet
it's<00:07:28.890> pretty<00:07:29.130> crazy<00:07:29.370> I've<00:07:29.850> I've<00:07:30.240> slipped<00:07:30.570> a

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:30.750 
it's pretty crazy I've I've slipped a

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.660 
it's pretty crazy I've I've slipped a
spur<00:07:31.500> gear<00:07:31.560> but<00:07:31.950> that<00:07:32.070> was<00:07:32.190> just<00:07:32.220> because<00:07:32.520> I

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:32.670 
spur gear but that was just because I

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.400 
spur gear but that was just because I
had<00:07:32.850> the<00:07:32.940> wrong<00:07:33.090> gearing<00:07:33.510> going<00:07:33.720> on<00:07:33.870> that's

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.410 
had the wrong gearing going on that's

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.960 
had the wrong gearing going on that's
the<00:07:34.590> only<00:07:34.950> thing<00:07:35.130> that's<00:07:35.280> broken<00:07:35.490> on<00:07:35.820> this

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:35.970 
the only thing that's broken on this

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.370 
the only thing that's broken on this
truck<00:07:36.210> ever<00:07:36.510> since<00:07:36.720> I<00:07:36.780> bought<00:07:36.900> it<00:07:37.050> I<00:07:37.110> had<00:07:37.230> this

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 
truck ever since I bought it I had this

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.530 
truck ever since I bought it I had this
thing<00:07:37.590> for<00:07:37.620> four<00:07:38.130> months<00:07:38.430> now<00:07:38.610> and<00:07:39.060> it's<00:07:39.420> been
