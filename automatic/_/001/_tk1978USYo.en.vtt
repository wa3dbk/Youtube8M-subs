00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.200
 Welcome to a whole new project 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.509
 and we play an adventure web 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.240
 the relatively new is minecraft 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.639
 found forum and that means 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.500
 The circle is horror and is with the new 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.820
 resorts pack functions and the whole 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.410
 command blog functions in the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.480
 recent scarcely dates have been added 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.699
 have been created and like the name 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.920
 already says what a week will be gone 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.260
 forum is even very good for one 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.730
 minecraft map and i know there is 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.590
 I finally have a few times 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.500
 somewhere like on facebook said 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.500
 anything else that I'm quite anxious 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.730
 I played as well as amnesia 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.290
 but i know more in amnesia 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.670
 less what happens because I already 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.949
 heard more often and there I have 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.230
 not so much anxiety after all 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.160
 But I do not know what we mean 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.600
 unlimited possibilities in themselves the 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.050
 app developer has seattle and especially 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.489
 everything used 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.190
 I have but it was a bit 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.140
 will also afraid of this map and times 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.369
 say dismayed forth in our adventure 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.259
 I could even get away with it myself 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.990
 convince what actually possible me 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.759
 have a 20 second video of it short 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.160
 Highly loaded where you can just one 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.110
 bit of music looks and the first room 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.740
 So now was only seen nothing yet 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.700
 the music belongs and I think myself 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.679
 I was excited and anxious 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.929
 Therefore, I will now I could 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.700
 Also convince what is going on here 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.869
 I do not know it is necessary but me 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.250
 I have the necessary atmosphere 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.369
 I hope you see me well 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.360
 enough 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.099
 In hindsight, I can get a bit lighter 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.060
 but we will see for a long time 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:52.009
 make the screen better for the screen 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.220
 it would say that we are right now 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.300
 still in game mode 2 1 in kiev motors 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.940
 changes immediately and welcome to the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.759
 pacemakers source program installed 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.479
 for the best experience justices settings 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:14.390
 music is of sound 500 where it is already 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:18.260
 50 and particles are minimal for 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.470
 be received yet and wishes good 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.629
 Lucky I will not die first 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.830
 he jumps under a little and stands 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.349
 then the music starts 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.940
 I dont know how he did that in the video 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.599
 end effect and if I'm not after 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.250
 to report 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.360
 and I think that's not 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.260
 as a big difference to make 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.090
 make it very bright 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.209
 But that is better if we do that 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.440
 make and the good technique two audio 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.440
 Traces on that means I can do that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.120
 volume and effect will change 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.500
 but now only times that a little 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.340
 make it quieter because I'm too loud though 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.050
 and let's start 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.660
 I do not know if I'm really starting 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.790
 actually too much afraid of it I have 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.280
 am up to approx 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.230
 gone there resisted you that 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.969
 small 20 and video links below if 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.480
 You also want to find from the facebook 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.469
 page 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.459
 I just find it on mine 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:07.349
 facebook page that the left you guys 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.239
 not all is from the latter to play 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.510
 also inspired staircase horror or 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.510
 like this 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:20.790
 so here's the god i can do that 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.170
 I can not really do that 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.680
 just something in the face or something 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:31.769
 what god i believe i am like that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.919
 anxious if i maybe 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.819
 screaming it is still nothing I know 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:40.560
 not if I'm scared as much as 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.900
 get it full and I can 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:52.109
 not at all 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:54.540
 I do not want to yet yes I do not know 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.379
 only has a blog paul in the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.590
 written comments 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:06.959
 that's probably like sc like 0 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:12.150
 Sometime, god happens, oh god 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.560
 oh god what spent you in 5 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.440
 minutes of space is so now I'm in front 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.239
 terrible died 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.470
 that's so bad i would have let her 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.609
 alone or something because I am me 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.889
 so stupid do and simply fear 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.180
 before that and I believe that people 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.770
 maybe somewhere else again reasonable 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.190
 so do not play that way within 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:34.009
 I'm so scared a lot 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.999
 Excited, what am I doing? 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.650
 I am going to do a very bad thing 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:38.509
 I do not know much about it yet 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.789
 because I give hot jumps kersten 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.279
 as well as the worst is because of it 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:53.319
 actually a new shrek were on 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:53.319
 teleport that's shit 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.930
 all that is now is its been free 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.930
 2 a 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:12.199
 I can not play anymore 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:16.219
 shit music just makes it all 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:18.229
 I do not think so much worse 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.639
 Mr. I can go on 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:24.379
 I 'm fucking shit I know 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.339
 but i will finish every first park 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.169
 on and probably 10 seconds 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:29.930
 or so are roughly said with the 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.759
 explain everything but I can not anymore 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.589
 carry on I am not too iks to 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.909

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.999
 seen that I actually so cheap 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.559
 but that bad 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:42.289

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:49.490
 We're going to be here too now 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:53.769
 and an end put to start doing 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.809
 I 'm doing this now 

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:57.919
 Of course, I will be the one again 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:58.999
 good is very late and 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.259
 probably also scored later 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.219
 upload it too 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.969
 little bit scary if it's right now 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:07.279
 look and I just want to say - 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:09.469

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:11.080

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.840

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.820
