 resumed at age 75 a little duck chained maharashtra appeared 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.270
 for the first time on the screen 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.690
 A star is born 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.159
 just as you became a character 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:40.269
 the most popular of the university 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.310
 we can also offer home 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.020
 m Spanish signed it is rather nice but it still has a tendency 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.310
 to overestimate yourself you've seen my life forever true algeria I'm 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.590
 bigger than I will come we remain discreet that the advertised does not consist 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.970
 that every time he puts himself on the sticks is not it? 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.840
 chuck 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.480
 alleys of dumping 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.740
 he starred in over 130 cartoon 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.740
 But there is more 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.780
 we talked about it at his starting age was a secondary character in 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.720
 outgoing frankly important 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.490
 we do not know that he really created once I did not attack him 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.980
 in this respect the park does not want to work early at disney's in the 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.260
 animation studio then he left disney wonder began to draw 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.080
 as soon as a mix the marrakech stats that's when damas did 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.510
 actually been created the feeling of a second try and with the word 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.670
 cheyrou country on the screen we did not understand with his contacts you 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.670
 are with Carl barks what he's learned to speak so to speak 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.540
 geneva lille and become the universe of donald's and his companions 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.650
 Karl Marx to breathe life into them 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.850
 he also invented new characters 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.340
 like the uncle 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 where the rapetou brothers 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 the theater of a human comedy 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.600
 animals are really dehumanized 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.710
 whether it's like humans season but it's kind of the magic of the first 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.840
 equals microbes space finally is all that we could be recognized 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.170
 of truth we do everyday in the stories of karl marx said left and 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.170
 that's what makes his genius and his great strength pink and purple it's like 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.919
 we do not just have happy people 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:26.519
 the regional offer of tent his luck every time 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.719
 yes but the bad luck continues 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.129
 we 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.069
 cla 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.049
 in 1960 something bad happened when he was angry he came out of his 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.900
 hinges according to the floor they form the personage 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.579
 his return but without distorting paris is probably his love 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.579
 it's also in time and everywhere in France 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.799
 few people know as well give a little singer rich pellet 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.010
 the abbot 20 artists 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.010
 who draws the character of donalda throughout the world 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.309
 vim 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.180
 fabien gilot I read yesterday a completed sentence the best stories 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.409
 come from his illustrious boarders at the age of 14 I had noticed 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.199
 that they were all from the same designer because the barÃ§a I was not 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.479
 Sunday me too I want to deal with the aspects of the genre that's where 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.679
 born my desire to draw maltes and cyprus thomas of his mental age 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.269
 Ulrich Reuters began drawing from childhood 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.889
 he worked for donald's body for chains and then for disney 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:38.829
 in Paris 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:39.809
 to a series of 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.429
 gold which today counts among the designers by then the most 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:43.249
 reputed 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:45.269
 these little bits they became 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.899
 an age that will end up on comic book covers 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:51.650
 the singer has already drawn donald's thousands of times 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.699
 while developing his own style 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.699
 delivering his interpretation of donald 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.419
 sector is going to happen but it's more than that it's not about selling 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:01.880
 the best 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.430
 nyon for example should not smile without stopping as it should and the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.330
 'smartphones' for the draw because it is also about making more adult in 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.100
 drawing the pen or not seeing her husband the elements of the fign way 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.839
 everything is softer but in my opinion it should be avoided 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:18.129
 we do not know what they are not founded alas for me that the 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:21.129
 character should have a very clean line and a strong character 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.680
 because what men think does not dare anything you want 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.470
 to better try to adopt his philosophy of yohann not to let himself 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.999
 knock down by the little setbacks and other catastrophes over or over 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.759
 we must be able to apply them on a daily basis, of course it would be ideal 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.759
 same grain of salt to find is the fiasco according 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.960
 likewise city councilor 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.099
 is that why we love them so much 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.370
 in his innumerable adventures and these roles always new despite his 75 

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:05.889
 years 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.569
 he remains a superstar 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.030
 nothing but finland 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.479
 one in four lives on the sideline 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:12.680
 str 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.509
 the stories are really great that's why I want 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.360
 draw ten weeks i drew donald of sagemcom all these beautiful 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.360
 stories and I confirm transmit them not attacked by the turkey at the stadium 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.839
 likewise to consider the future with a good mood 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.199
 the special editions have just been published 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.099
 we must discover the cartoons in dvd we are waiting impatiently 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.569
 the new adventures of the little duck 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:38.860
