00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.490
 he was all the same so we find ourselves 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.059
 for a short video on how the 10 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.590
 and a knife so me it's an opinion 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.210
 in a simple and effective way with a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.779
 stone sharpened so I will do another 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.810
 tutorial with a rifle to sharpen his 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.789
 so called there with a stone enough 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.019
 fine a grain fine enough to really 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.580
 see a good cutting edge so here at 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.110
 what you can see the blade is a little 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.260
 scrambled here is not too bad weak 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.730
 finally I mean so here I go 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.520
 to show you how we do for 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.379
 hone then already you take your 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.200
 stone or flat craft on the floor 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.789
 finally you on a table you take 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.559
 your blade like there like that and you 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.059
 go tilt it slightly like that and 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:05.250
 you are going to act as if you 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:08.159
 go cut something like this and 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.140
 it's cold by pressing hard enough 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:30.840
 a little bit I mean not too much 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:35.000
 strong but a little bit here I do them ten 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.590
 time on this side after we change sides 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.590
 here we do the same ten times 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.710
 that's ten times 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.759
 so there he begins to have a better 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.440
 cutting edge they really have better is 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.190
 so here we redo ten times each 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.470
 such side you their fill as 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.989
 after that what I want to do what except 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.470
 that is not supported is finally there is this 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.390
 the blade do it alone gently one 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.040
 does not support at all we leave the ideal to 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.040
 him alone while tilting a little 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.940
 you can do it like that too 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:42.940
 the learner authors not do like that 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:55.579
 there we reverse side is the good for 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.660
 the beginning a lot I ordered crazy you 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:12.590
 ask to do like that because 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:15.560
 it's easier we do it again 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:23.900
 you know pretty sharp and for 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:40.519
 to actually finish like that see I'm not 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:42.980
 loud you do not press at all it's for 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.720
 organize the step is there you have a 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.850
 blade with a very very very good 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:58.519
 cutting edge here is it slice 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:04:03.070
 perfectly gerard six how much 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.070
 will it trouble well yes 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:19.269
 see bag or rather well here is there 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.269
 you have a very good edge 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:41.089
 So here is a pack well especially that 

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:43.219
 the more you saw the blade was not 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:45.770
 terrible at first we managed to make a 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:48.139
 very good cutting edge so here is these 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:53.020
 measures and monsters red dead 75 and 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.020
 we see there leave you at the next ag
