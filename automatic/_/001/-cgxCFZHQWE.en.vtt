00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
but figured out and we have to do it as

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.470 
but figured out and we have to do it as
an<00:03:53.950> installation<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:55.390> actually<00:03:56.140> um<00:03:57.180> check<00:03:58.180> all

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
an installation is actually um check all

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.910 
an installation is actually um check all
those<00:03:58.720> direct<00:03:59.140> x<00:04:00.780> one<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:01.870> those<00:04:02.019> other<00:04:02.319> two

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
those direct x one of those other two

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.729 
those direct x one of those other two
are<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.459> have<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.180> norther<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.079> run<00:04:05.230> matchka

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
are you have a norther to run matchka

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.930 
are you have a norther to run matchka
but<00:04:06.220> after<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.120> do<00:04:07.209> that<00:04:07.349> then<00:04:08.640> we're<00:04:09.640> kind<00:04:09.880> of

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
but after you do that then we're kind of

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.930 
but after you do that then we're kind of
a<00:04:10.030> complicated<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.750> complicated<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.940> the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
a complicated the complicated is the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.449 
a complicated the complicated is the
hardest<00:04:13.209> part<00:04:13.360> comes<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.870> so<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:15.220> don't<00:04:15.370> open

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
hardest part comes in so you don't open

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.590 
hardest part comes in so you don't open
your<00:04:15.700> folder<00:04:16.090> were<00:04:16.269> magic<00:04:17.109> aids<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.650> then<00:04:18.639> you

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
your folder were magic aids and then you

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.930
