00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.580
 I'm in one of my last 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.750
 videos all the time took with mature 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.270
 tinkered the connector and there I still 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.890
 which I and I have nothing 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.500
 wants to throw away and because I too 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.570
 quite a lot of possibilities show 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.480
 I want to do what you can with the things 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.720
 you can buy one buys most of the time 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.370
 packages so bundles and then happens 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.550
 part and that should not be so exactly 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.930
 as with the split ring the 10 mm large 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.210
 we have a lot of rain 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.870
 I would like to tinker with these now 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.750
 connect something and now had 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.579
 I get this wonderful book 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 and since I'm the color red at the moment totally 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.000
 Great was nothing closer than a in the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.739
 principle to tinker a few earrings 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.390
 and later in matching jerman 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.770
 always so i have used for my one 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.500
 couple earrings with pin keppel 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.970
 pacifier these two connect hook 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.590
 this crash behavior 2 mm then two 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.659
 larger glass beads and a few smaller ones 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.710
 glass grinding bern and of course the pliers 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.420
 and side cutters and the flat 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 I finished the first one 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.790
 and so he looks from the second man 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.159
 now together with it begins the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.619
 single trailer first finished 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.770
 you can find the bigger one 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.380
 Pearl on the pen and I have 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.380
 about it still a steep given 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:52.250
 now 1 cm after the last pearl 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.270
 Cut off to the side and bend with 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.270
 also and countless b 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.050
 the second trailer is the one with the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.800
 cat pen there I have one 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.980
 squeezed then pulled the smaller one 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.820
 glass grinding falls 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.890
 and another kitsch pearl to it and there 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.320
 let's do the same 1 cm now 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.780
 the pearl cut off to the side 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.110
 bend and provide peter runge analysis 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.160
 Now you can still see if the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.590
 original eyelet of the pen lies parallel 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.030
 to whom you have made this is mine 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.290
 does not hurt that way and that's why 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.120
 I turn it a bit 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.120
 to make it look smoother 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.090
 so now we open the eyelids to the side 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:06.720
 get away and hang the elements 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:15.840
 Here comes the loop 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:19.770
 and to go again and down we hang 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.770
 the great pearl one 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.520
 in addition 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.960
 the whole thing already is missing in the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.330
 principle only the hook and that is 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.290
 also quite simply move to the side 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.440
 Bend away on the right side 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.740
 ahead 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.740
 a slope 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.740
 and give
