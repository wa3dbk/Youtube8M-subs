another sample of what they look like

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.319 
another sample of what they look like
it's<00:00:39.449> on<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> bobby<00:00:39.929> pin<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.789> I'd<00:00:41.789> have<00:00:42.000> one<00:00:42.179> on

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
it's on a bobby pin here I'd have one on

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.000 
it's on a bobby pin here I'd have one on
a<00:00:42.359> ring

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.220 

and<00:00:46.250> how<00:00:46.790> how<00:00:47.270> we're<00:00:47.450> making<00:00:47.570> them<00:00:47.930> is<00:00:48.050> we're

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
and how how we're making them is we're

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.990 
and how how we're making them is we're
just<00:00:48.380> using<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.829> jelly<00:00:49.070> roll<00:00:49.190> of<00:00:49.460> fabric<00:00:49.670> so

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
just using a jelly roll of fabric so

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.310 
just using a jelly roll of fabric so
this<00:00:50.120> has<00:00:50.270> already<00:00:50.570> cut<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.900> two<00:00:51.020> and<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.200> half

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
this has already cut to two and a half

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.410 
this has already cut to two and a half
inches<00:00:51.739> wide<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.430> then<00:00:52.790> we<00:00:52.879> lay<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:53.210> jelly

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
inches wide and then we lay the jelly

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.119 
inches wide and then we lay the jelly
roll<00:00:53.690> out<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:54.170> then<00:00:54.559> cut<00:00:54.800> them<00:00:54.890> with<00:00:54.980> the

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
roll out and then cut them with the

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.619 
roll out and then cut them with the
rotary<00:00:55.370> cutter<00:00:55.640> at<00:00:55.910> two<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.239> half<00:00:56.420> inch

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
rotary cutter at two and a half inch

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.750 
rotary cutter at two and a half inch
intervals<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.590> then<00:00:57.800> we<00:00:57.980> end<00:00:58.160> up<00:00:58.340> with<00:00:58.550> all

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
intervals and then we end up with all

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.910 
intervals and then we end up with all
these<00:00:58.940> coordinating<00:00:59.750> fabrics<00:01:00.440> to<00:01:00.620> make<00:01:00.770> our

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
these coordinating fabrics to make our

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.400 
these coordinating fabrics to make our
flowers<00:01:01.280> from<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.510> making<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.930> flowers<00:01:03.260> is

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
flowers from so making the flowers is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.040 
flowers from so making the flowers is
very<00:01:03.650> simple<00:01:04.129> you<00:01:04.759> take<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:05.210> piece<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.690> the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
very simple you take a piece of the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.980 
very simple you take a piece of the
fabric<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:08.240> goes<00:01:08.390> into<00:01:08.660> this<00:01:08.930> little

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
fabric and it goes into this little

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.530 
fabric and it goes into this little
template<00:01:09.970> so<00:01:10.970> we<00:01:11.090> open<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.450> template<00:01:11.869> up

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
template so we open the template up

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.440 
template so we open the template up
we<00:01:14.050> take<00:01:14.230> a<00:01:14.260> piece<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.560> fabric<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.310> fold<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.330> on

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
we take a piece of fabric and fold it on

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.600 
we take a piece of fabric and fold it on
the<00:01:16.510> diagonal

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
the diagonal

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.090 
the diagonal
so<00:01:19.120> it's<00:01:19.270> on<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.540> bias<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:19.900> helps<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.530> lay

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
so it's on the bias that helps it lay

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.500 
so it's on the bias that helps it lay
nice<00:01:21.840> close<00:01:22.840> it<00:01:23.050> into<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.700> template<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.210> stays

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
nice close it into the template it stays

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.500 
nice close it into the template it stays
nice<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:25.810> secure<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:27.610> we<00:01:27.700> use<00:01:27.880> our<00:01:28.090> nice

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
nice and secure then we use our nice

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.980 
nice and secure then we use our nice
curved<00:01:28.960> scissors<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:30.490> cut<00:01:30.700> around<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
curved scissors to cut around the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.920 
curved scissors to cut around the
outside

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.810 

and<00:01:36.410> then<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:36.890> becomes<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.370> very<00:01:37.550> simple

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
and then it becomes a very simple

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.260 
and then it becomes a very simple
stitching<00:01:38.450> project<00:01:39.370> I'm<00:01:40.370> using<00:01:40.430> this<00:01:40.910> is<00:01:41.090> our

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
stitching project I'm using this is our

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.270 
stitching project I'm using this is our
needle<00:01:41.600> case<00:01:41.840> where<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:42.500> keep<00:01:42.980> all<00:01:43.250> the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
needle case where you can keep all the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.070 
needle case where you can keep all the
threaded<00:01:43.760> needles<00:01:44.090> in<00:01:44.300> together<00:01:44.510> which<00:01:44.930> is

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
threaded needles in together which is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.510 
threaded needles in together which is
wonderful<00:01:45.320> for<00:01:45.800> handwork<00:01:46.310> projects

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.950 

it's<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.670> one<00:01:50.940> sorry<00:01:51.270> forgot<00:01:51.570> which<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:51.840> it

was

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.190 
was
so<00:01:53.619> we<00:01:53.890> start<00:01:54.220> in<00:01:54.490> number<00:01:55.360> one<00:01:55.570> which<00:01:55.869> is<00:01:56.049> right

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
so we start in number one which is right

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.139 
so we start in number one which is right
here<00:01:56.500> they're<00:01:56.770> all<00:01:56.890> numbered<00:01:57.250> one<00:01:57.490> two<00:01:57.790> three

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.150 
next five petals pull them all together
and<00:03:03.860> tie<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.100> off<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.580> we<00:03:04.670> have<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.850> flower
