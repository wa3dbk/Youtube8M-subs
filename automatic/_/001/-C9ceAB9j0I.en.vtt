00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
monthly rate really you know our guys

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.229 
monthly rate really you know our guys
are<00:00:36.320> on<00:00:36.890> anything<00:00:37.280> from<00:00:37.550> sort<00:00:37.879> of<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.000> middle

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
are on anything from sort of the middle

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.709 
are on anything from sort of the middle
teens<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:40.219> thirty<00:00:40.609> forty<00:00:41.149> thousand<00:00:41.539> pounds

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
teens to to thirty forty thousand pounds

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.060 
teens to to thirty forty thousand pounds
I<00:00:42.019> think<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.350> average<00:00:42.590> wage<00:00:42.829> in<00:00:43.010> the

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
I think the average wage in the

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.590 
I think the average wage in the
Premiership<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.609> seventy<00:00:43.940> thousand<00:00:44.300> pounds

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
Premiership is seventy thousand pounds

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.779 
Premiership is seventy thousand pounds
now<00:00:44.750> and<00:00:45.199> I<00:00:45.320> think<00:00:45.500> in<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:45.859> future<00:00:46.219> we're

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
now and I think in the future we're

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.009 
now and I think in the future we're
going<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.000> have<00:00:47.090> to<00:00:47.210> have<00:00:47.300> seven<00:00:47.570> players<00:00:47.809> that

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
going to have to have seven players that

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.319 
going to have to have seven players that
are<00:00:48.309> getting<00:00:49.309> close<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:49.609> that<00:00:49.910> if<00:00:50.120> we're<00:00:50.239> going

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
are getting close to that if we're going

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.470 
are getting close to that if we're going
to<00:00:50.420> compete<00:00:50.690> with<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:51.829> top<00:00:52.219> end<00:00:52.489> nations<00:00:53.300> that

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
to compete with the top end nations that

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.060 
to compete with the top end nations that
are<00:00:53.660> putting<00:00:53.960> more<00:00:54.170> money<00:00:54.199> into<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:54.800> every

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
are putting more money into it every

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.779 
are putting more money into it every
year<00:00:56.260> we've<00:00:57.260> put<00:00:57.559> eight<00:00:57.800> contracted<00:00:58.579> players

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
year we've put eight contracted players

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.310 
year we've put eight contracted players
that<00:00:59.059> will<00:00:59.120> probably<00:00:59.510> increase<00:00:59.749> next<00:01:00.050> year

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
that will probably increase next year

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.930 
that will probably increase next year
it's<00:01:00.679> never<00:01:00.829> going<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.070> be<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.190> huge<00:01:01.460> amount<00:01:01.789> of
