going to show you how to do it first of
all<00:01:27.780> regular<00:01:28.410> deck<00:01:28.620> as<00:01:28.830> always<00:01:30.950> what<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.070> need

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
all regular deck as always what you need

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.730 
all regular deck as always what you need

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.120 
kings doesn't have to be aces or kings
but<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.080> just<00:01:37.230> think<00:01:37.380> these<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
but I just think these are the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.850 
but I just think these are the
impressive<00:01:38.580> cards<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:40.260> setup<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.800> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
impressive cards the setup for this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.950

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
one ace then two Kings here then you'll

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.470
