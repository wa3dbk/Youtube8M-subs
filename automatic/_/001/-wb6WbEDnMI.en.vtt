version of the original car and this is

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.090 
version of the original car and this is
one<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:12.230> would<00:01:12.290> be<00:01:12.350> easier<00:01:12.710> for<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:12.980> to

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
one that would be easier for you to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.550 
one that would be easier for you to
build<00:01:13.360> there's<00:01:14.360> just<00:01:14.540> some<00:01:14.630> basic<00:01:14.960> changes<00:01:15.320> to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
build there's just some basic changes to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.790 
build there's just some basic changes to
the<00:01:15.710> way<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.400> back<00:01:16.670> pieces<00:01:16.940> go<00:01:17.180> together<00:01:17.240> and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
the way the back pieces go together and

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.290 
the way the back pieces go together and
this<00:01:18.800> plate<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.340> little<00:01:19.580> bit<00:01:19.700> more<00:01:19.820> commonly

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
this plate is a little bit more commonly

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.000 
this plate is a little bit more commonly
found<00:01:20.420> than<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.350> old<00:01:21.530> style

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
found than the old style

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.540 
found than the old style
so<00:01:22.550> this<00:01:22.790> is<00:01:22.910> the<00:01:23.000> one<00:01:23.120> we<00:01:23.270> will<00:01:23.420> build<00:01:24.550> before

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
so this is the one we will build before

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.100 
so this is the one we will build before
we<00:01:25.610> do<00:01:25.730> that<00:01:25.760> a<00:01:26.150> little<00:01:26.540> rundown<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:26.900> the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
simply take them off and they go on the

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.930 
simply take them off and they go on the
door<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.959> parking<00:02:09.349> tickets<00:02:09.649> come<00:02:10.459> back<00:02:10.700> at

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
door so a parking tickets come back at

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.100 
door so a parking tickets come back at
your<00:02:11.120> parking<00:02:11.420> ticket<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:14.690> extras<00:02:14.990> are

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
your parking ticket and the extras are

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.230 
your parking ticket and the extras are
just<00:02:15.260> kept<00:02:15.800> inside<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.220> cruisers

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
just kept inside the cruisers

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.110 
just kept inside the cruisers
okay<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.360> car<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.600> very<00:02:18.780> easy<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.260> build<00:02:20.120> so

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
okay this car is very easy to build so

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.160 
okay this car is very easy to build so
I'm<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.330> going<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.540> take<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.720> completely

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
I'm not going to take it completely

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.960 
I'm not going to take it completely
apart<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.860> know<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.400> can<00:02:23.490> get<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.700> idea

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
apart but I know you can get the idea

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.840 
apart but I know you can get the idea
this<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.140> standard<00:02:25.590> base<00:02:26.190> plate<00:02:26.490> that<00:02:26.760> was

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
this is the standard base plate that was

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.060 
this is the standard base plate that was
used<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.380> tell<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.740> difference<00:02:29.010> between

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
used you can tell the difference between

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.710 
used you can tell the difference between
it<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.700> originals<00:02:30.120> because<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.570> original

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
it in the originals because the original

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.590 
it in the originals because the original
ones<00:02:31.020> have<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.500> hole<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.130> it

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
ones have a hole in it

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.200 
ones have a hole in it
the<00:02:33.600> original<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:34.110> as<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.350> result<00:02:35.180> does<00:02:36.180> not

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
the original one as a result does not

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.760 
the original one as a result does not
have<00:02:36.480> room<00:02:36.660> for<00:02:36.690> receipt<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.590> car

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
have room for receipt so this car

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.790 
have room for receipt so this car
actually<00:02:38.040> does<00:02:38.190> not<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> seat

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
actually does not have a seat

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.890 
actually does not have a seat
whereas<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.250> being<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.730> more<00:02:41.940> modern<00:02:42.630> plate

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
whereas this being the more modern plate

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.400 
whereas this being the more modern plate
it<00:02:43.800> does<00:02:44.210> it's<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.270> little<00:02:45.480> nicer<00:02:45.600> for<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.080> cop

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
it does it's a little nicer for the cop

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.950 
it does it's a little nicer for the cop
there<00:02:46.850> you'll<00:02:47.850> see<00:02:48.030> how<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.270> plays<00:02:48.510> out<00:02:48.720> in

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
there you'll see how this plays out in

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.950 
there you'll see how this plays out in
the<00:02:49.620> difference<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.040> construction<00:02:50.720> on<00:02:51.720> this

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
the difference in construction on this

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.500 
the difference in construction on this
portion<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.770> as<00:02:53.580> we<00:02:53.700> go<00:02:53.820> forward<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.150> you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
portion of it as we go forward so you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.740 
portion of it as we go forward so you
get<00:02:54.570> your<00:02:54.750> base<00:02:54.870> plate<00:02:55.460> you<00:02:56.460> add<00:02:56.610> your<00:02:56.850> your

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
get your base plate you add your your

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.800 
get your base plate you add your your
lights<00:02:57.930> underneath<00:02:58.880> steering<00:02:59.880> wheel<00:03:00.000> see<00:03:00.570> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
lights underneath steering wheel see and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.500 
lights underneath steering wheel see and
then<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.920> put<00:03:02.100> some<00:03:02.130> 1<00:03:02.550> by<00:03:02.670> fours<00:03:02.970> thanks

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
then I just put some 1 by fours thanks

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.990 
then I just put some 1 by fours thanks
actually<00:03:03.810> these<00:03:03.930> 1<00:03:04.440> by<00:03:04.590> twos<00:03:04.830> here<00:03:05.280> plates

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
actually these 1 by twos here plates

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.190 
actually these 1 by twos here plates
underneath<00:03:06.330> just<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.660> kind<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.900> give<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.140> a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
underneath just to kind of give it a

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.590 
underneath just to kind of give it a
little<00:03:07.320> bit<00:03:07.470> lower<00:03:07.710> look<00:03:08.360> every<00:03:09.360> police<00:03:09.570> car

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
little bit lower look every police car

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.450 
little bit lower look every police car
needs<00:03:09.990> set<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.530> cool<00:03:10.680> wheels<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.310> we've

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
needs set of cool wheels so we've

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.900 
needs set of cool wheels so we've
swapped<00:03:11.700> out<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.060> red<00:03:12.210> ones<00:03:12.420> for<00:03:12.830> these<00:03:13.910> nice

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
swapped out the red ones for these nice

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.560 
swapped out the red ones for these nice
ones<00:03:15.210> and<00:03:16.130> then<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.460> the<00:03:17.790> push<00:03:18.090> bar<00:03:18.300> piece

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
ones and then this is the push bar piece

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.000 
ones and then this is the push bar piece
I'm<00:03:19.050> not<00:03:19.230> sure<00:03:19.380> what<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:19.620> originally

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
I'm not sure what it's originally

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.410 
I'm not sure what it's originally
intended<00:03:20.220> for<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.910> looks<00:03:21.060> like<00:03:21.120> one<00:03:21.390> of

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
intended for but it looks like one of

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.070 
intended for but it looks like one of
those<00:03:22.100> PIT<00:03:23.100> maneuver<00:03:23.130> bars<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:24.090> put<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.930> on

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
those PIT maneuver bars so put that on

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.330 
those PIT maneuver bars so put that on
there<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.410> that's<00:03:25.560> your<00:03:25.770> basic<00:03:25.860> rolling

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
there and that's your basic rolling

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.770 
there and that's your basic rolling
chassis<00:03:26.520> if<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.850> put<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.120> stick<00:03:27.300> around<00:03:27.390> here

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
chassis if you put the stick around here

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.780 
chassis if you put the stick around here
just<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.950> Pennsylvania<00:03:29.580> State

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
just like the Pennsylvania State

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.160 
just like the Pennsylvania State
Troopers<00:03:30.690> net<00:03:32.000> doors<00:03:33.000> are<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.450> standard<00:03:33.870> Lego

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
Troopers net doors are the standard Lego

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.820 
Troopers net doors are the standard Lego
police<00:03:34.710> doors<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:36.230> still<00:03:37.230> like<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.470> old<00:03:37.500> look

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
police doors I still like the old look

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.960 
police doors I still like the old look
the<00:03:37.980> best<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.860> entire<00:03:41.310> department<00:03:41.490> has

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
the best and the entire department has

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.480 
the best and the entire department has
that<00:03:42.210> and<00:03:42.330> these<00:03:42.390> are<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.750> usual<00:03:43.490> so

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
that and these are just the usual so

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.970 
that and these are just the usual so
this<00:03:44.610> much<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.820> very<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:45.900> far<00:03:46.110> very

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
this much is very this is so far very

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.520 
this much is very this is so far very
much<00:03:47.160> like<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> regular<00:03:47.930> Lego<00:03:48.930> car<00:03:49.140> goes

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
much like a regular Lego car goes

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.280 
much like a regular Lego car goes
together<00:03:49.740> now<00:03:50.720> I'm<00:03:51.720> gonna<00:03:51.870> go<00:03:51.990> ahead<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.140> just

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
together now I'm gonna go ahead and just

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.960 
together now I'm gonna go ahead and just
plunk<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> front<00:03:52.950> on<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.340> then<00:03:53.670> I'll<00:03:53.760> explain

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
plunk the front on and then I'll explain

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.449 
plunk the front on and then I'll explain
how<00:03:54.060> it's<00:03:54.330> built<00:03:54.450> don't<00:03:54.810> even<00:03:54.990> do<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.200> back

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
how it's built don't even do the back

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.100 
how it's built don't even do the back
but<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.550> is<00:03:56.670> basically<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.240> front<00:03:57.480> assembly

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
but this is basically the front assembly

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.670 
but this is basically the front assembly
and<00:03:58.980> kind<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.520> figure<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.790> out<00:04:00.000> from<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:00.780> it

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
and kind of figure it out from that it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.260 
and kind of figure it out from that it
just<00:04:01.890> goes<00:04:02.010> on<00:04:02.190> it's<00:04:02.310> one<00:04:02.430> big<00:04:02.610> piece<00:04:02.820> the

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
just goes on it's one big piece the

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.670 
just goes on it's one big piece the
front<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.660> back<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.840> these<00:04:04.080> cars<00:04:04.140> are

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
front and the back of these cars are

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.350 
front and the back of these cars are
built<00:04:05.100> exactly<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.670> same<00:04:07.430> so<00:04:08.430> we<00:04:08.730> start<00:04:09.270> with

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
built exactly the same so we start with

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.420 
built exactly the same so we start with
the<00:04:09.420> wheel<00:04:09.540> arch<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:11.040> goes<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.459> just<00:04:11.700> like<00:04:12.000> that

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
the wheel arch it goes on just like that

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.160 
the wheel arch it goes on just like that
here's<00:04:14.430> your<00:04:14.760> own<00:04:15.030> by<00:04:15.630> four<00:04:15.840> with<00:04:16.020> some

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.230 
this is a 2 by 3 plate and put a little
please<00:04:26.400> sticker<00:04:26.640> on<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.970> end<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:29.240> there's

please sticker on the end and there's
mine<00:04:30.480> just<00:04:30.900> like<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.260> again<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:31.860> is

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
mine just like that again this is

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.680 
mine just like that again this is
exactly<00:04:32.310> like<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.580> front<00:04:32.850> except<00:04:33.390> it's<00:04:33.600> got

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
exactly like the front except it's got

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.240 
exactly like the front except it's got
red<00:04:33.840> lights<00:04:33.900> instead<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:34.890> know<00:04:34.980> it<00:04:35.070> likes

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
red lights instead of you know it likes

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.240 
red lights instead of you know it likes
to<00:04:36.140> top<00:04:37.140> it<00:04:37.290> off<00:04:38.390> these<00:04:39.390> plates<00:04:40.320> here<00:04:40.650> now<00:04:41.010> on

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
to top it off these plates here now on

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.010 
to top it off these plates here now on
the<00:04:41.400> original<00:04:41.760> car<00:04:41.970> you'll<00:04:42.270> notice<00:04:42.600> that<00:04:42.780> the

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
the original car you'll notice that the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.260 
the original car you'll notice that the
black<00:04:43.950> line<00:04:44.280> extends<00:04:44.760> all<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:44.910> way<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.120> the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
black line extends all the way to the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.450 
black line extends all the way to the
door<00:04:45.480> whereas<00:04:45.990> on<00:04:46.140> this<00:04:46.290> one<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.740> stops<00:04:47.100> there

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
door whereas on this one it stops there

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.220 
door whereas on this one it stops there
that's<00:04:47.820> because<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.360> is<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.600> simplified

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
that's because this is a simplified

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.660 
that's because this is a simplified
construction<00:04:49.860> front<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.310> back<00:04:50.430> being

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
construction front and the back being

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.760 
construction front and the back being
the<00:04:50.790> same<00:04:51.060> on<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.420> original<00:04:51.750> car<00:04:51.930> there's<00:04:52.740> a

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
the same on the original car there's a

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.500 
the same on the original car there's a
little<00:04:52.950> bit<00:04:53.040> more<00:04:53.190> room<00:04:53.520> on<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:53.730> inside<00:04:53.940> but

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
little bit more room on the inside but

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.840 
little bit more room on the inside but
there<00:04:54.630> is<00:04:54.750> no<00:04:54.900> seat<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:56.250> can<00:04:56.280> build<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.700> either

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
there is no seat you can build it either

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.780 
there is no seat you can build it either
way<00:04:57.590> now<00:04:58.590> if<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.830> go<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:59.160> route<00:04:59.370> then<00:04:59.640> this

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
way now if you go that route then this

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.960 
way now if you go that route then this
would<00:04:59.940> be<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.060> 1<00:05:00.330> by<00:05:00.480> 4<00:05:00.510> plate<00:05:01.110> going<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.370> it<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:04.970> 1

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
would be a 1 by 4 plate going to it a 1

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.600 
would be a 1 by 4 plate going to it a 1
by<00:05:06.120> 2<00:05:06.180> plate<00:05:06.300> going<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.050> 1<00:05:07.200> by<00:05:07.320> 4<00:05:07.350> plate<00:05:07.610> with

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
by 2 plate going to a 1 by 4 plate with

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.780 
by 2 plate going to a 1 by 4 plate with
two<00:05:08.640> 1<00:05:09.630> by<00:05:09.840> 1<00:05:10.230> plates<00:05:10.590> stacked<00:05:10.920> here<00:05:11.400> that's

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
two 1 by 1 plates stacked here that's

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.540 
two 1 by 1 plates stacked here that's
really<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.120> only<00:05:12.150> different<00:05:13.400> part<00:05:14.400> in<00:05:14.490> the

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
really the only different part in the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.730 
really the only different part in the
dust<00:05:14.760> so<00:05:15.180> there<00:05:15.330> top<00:05:15.630> off<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:16.050> back<00:05:16.380> fenders

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740

kinds of handheld radios and stuff back

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.320 
kinds of handheld radios and stuff back
in<00:05:33.540> this<00:05:33.660> area<00:05:34.640> and<00:05:35.640> originally<00:05:36.150> these<00:05:36.270> were

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
in this area and originally these were

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.390 
in this area and originally these were
back<00:05:36.600> windows<00:05:36.930> we've<00:05:37.620> now<00:05:37.800> moved<00:05:37.950> them<00:05:38.160> to<00:05:38.190> the

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
back windows we've now moved them to the

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.420 
back windows we've now moved them to the
front<00:05:38.640> so<00:05:38.970> we<00:05:39.000> can<00:05:39.180> put<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.360> square<00:05:39.510> back<00:05:39.720> so

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
front so we can put the square back so

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.350 
front so we can put the square back so
that's<00:05:41.430> why<00:05:41.640> they<00:05:41.760> have<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:41.970> sticker<00:05:42.240> on<00:05:42.300> it

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.080 
that's why they have the sticker on it
we<00:05:42.540> just<00:05:42.630> didn't<00:05:42.870> take<00:05:42.990> them<00:05:43.110> off<00:05:43.970> that's<00:05:44.970> the

we just didn't take them off that's the

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.060 
we just didn't take them off that's the
basic<00:05:45.420> car<00:05:45.570> now<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:45.870> front<00:05:46.140> at<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:46.680> top<00:05:46.800> is

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
basic car now the front at the top is

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.570 
basic car now the front at the top is
very<00:05:47.100> easy<00:05:47.400> it's<00:05:47.850> a<00:05:47.880> standard<00:05:48.240> top<00:05:49.070> it's<00:05:50.070> got<00:05:50.280> a
