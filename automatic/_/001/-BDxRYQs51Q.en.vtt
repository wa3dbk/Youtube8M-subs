you go to the old ruins and this is what
I<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:01.229> exceptionally<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.979> checking<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
I really exceptionally like checking is

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.060 
I really exceptionally like checking is
the<00:02:03.210> weapon<00:02:03.509> rack<00:02:03.689> because<00:02:04.229> weapon<00:02:04.890> racks

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
the weapon rack because weapon racks

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.429 
the weapon rack because weapon racks
have<00:02:05.219> given<00:02:05.460> me<00:02:05.549> legendaries<00:02:06.090> already<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.320> I

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
have given me legendaries already so I

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.949 
have given me legendaries already so I
suggest<00:02:07.979> checking<00:02:08.160> all<00:02:08.459> weapon<00:02:08.759> racks<00:02:08.970> that

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
suggest checking all weapon racks that

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.760 
suggest checking all weapon racks that
to<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> left<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.310> me<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.670> tunnel<00:02:12.660> can<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.930> there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
to the left of me a tunnel can be there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.520 
to the left of me a tunnel can be there
so<00:02:14.240> this<00:02:15.240> right<00:02:15.450> here<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> twitch

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
so this right here with a twitch

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.150 
so this right here with a twitch
caved-in<00:02:16.890> tunnel<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:18.180> be<00:02:18.300> right<00:02:18.480> there<00:02:19.160> so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
caved-in tunnel can be right there so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.120 
caved-in tunnel can be right there so
check<00:02:20.460> that<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.720> then<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.770> really

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
check that and then this is the really

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.670 
check that and then this is the really
popular<00:02:23.310> tunnel<00:02:23.970> over<00:02:24.150> here<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:25.470> doesn't

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
popular tunnel over here it doesn't

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.430 
popular tunnel over here it doesn't
always<00:02:25.920> spawn<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:27.480> open<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:27.960> time<00:02:28.230> though

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
always spawn it is open this time though

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.510 
always spawn it is open this time though
so<00:02:28.830> what<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.340> do<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.520> if<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.880> get<00:02:30.030> here<00:02:30.240> first

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
check that you'll check that you check

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.010 
check that you'll check that you check
that<00:03:34.800> weapon<00:03:35.220> rack<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.670> then<00:03:36.480> you'll<00:03:36.750> go<00:03:36.959> to

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
chance of spawning of all the cellars

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.420 
chance of spawning of all the cellars
and<00:03:41.010> then<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.150> come<00:03:42.360> around<00:03:42.480> here<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:44.040> like

speed<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.720> wish<00:03:49.350> more<00:03:49.560> people<00:03:49.860> realize<00:03:50.250> that

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
speed I wish more people realize that

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.850 
speed I wish more people realize that
this<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:50.880> all<00:03:51.090> about<00:03:51.330> speed<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.930> that's<00:03:52.770> the

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
this is all about speed and that's the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.660 
this is all about speed and that's the
whole<00:03:53.010> point<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.310> doing<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:54.500> but

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
whole point of doing it but

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.460 
whole point of doing it but
well<00:03:57.670> what<00:03:58.360> if<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.600> get<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.840> moving<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.350> will

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
well what if you get it moving you will

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.770 
well what if you get it moving you will
make<00:03:59.650> all<00:03:59.860> the<00:03:59.890> runs<00:04:00.130> faster<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:00.820> that's<00:04:01.600> why

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
make all the runs faster so that's why

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.670 
make all the runs faster so that's why
i'm<00:04:02.470> saying<00:04:02.710> you<00:04:02.890> know<00:04:03.010> get<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:03.940> going<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:05.530> get

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
i'm saying you know get it going we get

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.990 
i'm saying you know get it going we get
you<00:04:05.890> might<00:04:06.070> give<00:04:06.220> pretty<00:04:06.400> good<00:04:06.490> period<00:04:06.880> for

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
you might give pretty good period for

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.820 
you might give pretty good period for
people<00:04:07.360> there's<00:04:07.900> also<00:04:08.050> chance<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.530> those<00:04:08.680> good
