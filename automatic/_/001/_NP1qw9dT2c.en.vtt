 we will have a hand strap 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.200
 pretty practice 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.590
 here we have what it is 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.590

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.840
 a usb data cable usb port 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.840
 standard and micro usb 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:26.960
 in a bag what we have that is and 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:31.000
 the camera itself what is the area of ​​the 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.000
 optics attracts a lot of attention 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:54.050
 a fairly large screen with some 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.050
 controls on the right side 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.250
 among which is the wheel of 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.580
 select the radio button 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.680
 to see the pictures to enter 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.680
 the menu to erase the images 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.610
 in what is the basis of the product 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.610
 we have a micro hdmi connection 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.329
 Y 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.520
 where to insert the battery and 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.520
 as not the memory card 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.020
 on the left side we have what it is 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.010
 the holes to anchor the strap the 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.270
 hand strap and after this small tape 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.600
 there is the microusb port 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.330
 to be able to pass content from that of the 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.560
 memory card inserts the camera to 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.560
 a computer if we want it 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.530
 and on the upper side we have what they are 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.640
 well 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.620
 and controls 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.620
 so the camera 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.840
 scene modes 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:20.100
 an automatic mode and manual mode 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.320
 several typical camera controls 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.650
 we have the on / off button 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.910
 of the unit what is the mechanism for 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.430
 practice zooming a button for what it is 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.520
 the capture of the images that is 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.030
 quite large and very comfortable so 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.030
 I can see 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.220
 and here we would have what is the flash that 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.220
 will then be activated in automatic mode 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.030
 or we will activate it manually with the 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.030
 dedicated flash button 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.819
 we can also not anchor a flash 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.819
 external 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:21.330
 what I can see in finishes because what 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:24.569
 which is the area of optics is metallic 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.250
 this side area is rubber which 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.120
 allows a good grip of the 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:33.090
 device 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.090
 this area here is also metallic 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.340
 the base is plastic all this area of 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.860
 here this side area would be plastic 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.069
 It is also made of plastic 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.729
 including what is the botonería of the 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.729
 back area 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.160
 the glass screen 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.310
 and now we will insert what is the 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.310
 battery for 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.240
 to see how the camera responds 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.779
 and turn on the camera with the button 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.779
 dedicated 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.340
 this would be what is the interface of the 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.340
 camera 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.390
 with its less 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.190
 what is the lens 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.940
 this would be the response of the lens to 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.940
 practice zoom 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.970
 this would be the speed at which 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.300
 would respond the lens and we would pay the 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.300
 camera 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.620
 so that it would stay this way 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.650
 a camera that a priori seems very 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.319
 interesting with some finishes also 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.419
 really interesting in what in what 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:07.389
 what is the combination between finishes 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:10.750
 metallic an important area of rubber 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:15.159
 for a good grip and a zone 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:18.009
 back and pass more in completion of 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:19.960
 plastic in the next video what 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:22.120
 will have to get a little bit about me 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.770
 experience with this with this camera 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.590
 photographic that has appeared to me in 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.289
 photography and in video recording and 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.120
 talk a little bit of good 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:32.710
 what has been the case? 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.220
 connectivity through networks 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:39.599
 wireless and the response in general 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.599
 also of autonomy
