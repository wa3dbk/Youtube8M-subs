00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.120
 and we are going to give in depositing 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.770
 for this not to appear 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.130
 a screen like the following 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.630
 where he asks for our card number 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.920

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.680
 we have deposited 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.920
 but for this we have to create an account 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.190
 and that account is on the page of temple rr punto torito cásseres 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.669

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.300
 out there entering the page does not appear

 in which they ask us for an inite card 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.969
 in this case if we do not have it 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.959
 we can get it in the green button 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.149
 giving a click 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:28.639
 inova redirect to a page 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.849
 where is the creation of the account 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.269
 for that we have to type 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.889
 our names 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.849
 this must be with true information 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.559
 around here there is no insecurity 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.789
 so let's put 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.799

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.019
 to choose a 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.849
 sorry we have to choose a local 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.269

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.269
 email 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.769

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:45.179
 what I give you x 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.309
 and of course our medium or password that we have chosen 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:50.939
 and we will access 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.249
 clicking on accept 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.429
 alderete born in accept 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:58.689
 it will not present a range 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.539
 of multiple options 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:04.779
 to buy add balance transfer 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.839
 and everything else as a judge 2 i 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.549
 purchases 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.429
 well let's go acquire recharge 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:15.439
 once your account has been entered 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.220
 we're just going to go to recharge types to bring them 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.359
 where is it that you can 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.969
 request a recharge 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.609
 for this we are going to go see how it works and give us the options 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.580
 p that we can go to a telecom was a cyclone electra 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.550
 or even superboletos by ethan is in 7 of the event 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.479
 it will be an event 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.910
 and of course two banks that are nationally one handled it by stec 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.219
 active another here that and I know it's very profitable this option is what I 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.930
 I consider better 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.990
 for that we are going to have to go 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.990
 carry us 14th 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.400
 in this case we are going to 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.090
 accra a card we can customize it 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.789
 to show account numbers here 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.580
 or to be also there our name 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.340
 and a bar code this is for some federative entities of the 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.449
 republic 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.710
 where can we go some others because he does not mention it 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.150
 fox 11 7 and you see the event 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.930
 where season and ones 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.740
 bar coders 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.669
 he will come across 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.589
 to make it faster 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.669
 but as I told you I recommend hsbc 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.150
 so that we have our card 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.370
 they have already generated in pdf 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.189
 villages and print it 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:32.969
 preferably laser 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.589
 there we also go to my carla and we can go to Aztec bank or that sbs 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:40.999
 hsbc of the nation that I recommend 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:43.159
 once all this is 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.609
 we already have a card we went to the loan bank 500 pesos 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.410
 then we will go to deposit 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.039
 to the cashier 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.360
 how to put our account number 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.300
 in this case 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.860
 then we type the pir 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.789
 for saying let's choose four zeros 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.589
 and the proposed amount 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:06.889
 I remember that the commission detailed touching is depending on the amount 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.219
 If you deposit more than one point less commission 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:14.340
 in the forum 500 pesos must charge between 5 and 10 pesos 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.490
 He already said the other thing is it's up to us 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.770
 this case that I love you out there that before lending 500 pesos 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.979
 and I ethically do goals 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.740
 and we will send 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.419
 when sending this information 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.539
 pokerstars is going 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.139
 go to a message where they are releasing conference 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:39.049
 and automatically with us the dollars to be able to start 

00:06:39.049 --> 00:06:39.879
 to play 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.529
 either in cash tables 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:44.509
 they use tournaments 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:45.539
 or in 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.430
 just out there there are multiple room 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.479
 hand to hand 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.490
 the question of deposit 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.029
 and a recommendation would be to play 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:57.619
 the finals 

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:58.520
 poker the time 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.349
 champions the first tournament in mexico 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:05.069
 and that's how easy it is how we can bet on pokerstars 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:09.579
 I hope this serves you anything here we are 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:15.149
 I met and name hominick in pokerstars vetoes 23 any help 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:20.270

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:21.219
