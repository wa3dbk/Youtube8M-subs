00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.470
 good man is in the insurance I am 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.260
 artist in the brand of batteries my text 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.710
 the brand of cymbals uses well and in this 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.250
 day 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.360
 I'm in the middle of a tour and so 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.940
 what better time than this for 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.380
 tell them about a drummer that I'm 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.870
 using precisely in this tour 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.660
 This re speaker is the black panther 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.820
 fastback well I'm re forward have 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.870
 very particular measures very 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.080
 blackwater may text specials are 12 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.210
 for 7 of the milestones very portable yo 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.060
 I can take it out in my suitcase with mickeal 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.460
 and down without any problems this 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:03.500
 It really is made with six layers of 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.909
 5.1 millimeter maple each has 8 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.399
 blogs 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.439
 of tension for a tuning then 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.600
 much more accurate good what more 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.509
 I like this role before really is the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.420
 sound considering measures 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.110
 who manages 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.259
 we have a pretty high type is a tone 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.850
 quite high but not for this reason 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.310
 loses the body but so 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.310
 otherwise it has enough body is a 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.030
 dry sound with quite a projection and 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.130
 spectacular for any 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.869
 a medium in which you need 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.390
 unwrap in today we are going 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.220
 to listen without amplification and more 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.950
 ahead in the show we will live 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.619
 amplified visit www doubts in the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.920
 sure point net and there we are 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.920
 talking 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.870
 i 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.720
 good during this video they could see 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.310
 that there was another jewel next to me because 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.890
 It looked like a jewel 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.650
 is the stinger is a re-steering also 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.840
 quite the gauge if special in its 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.050
 measures is a 10-inch flywheel 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.709
 made entirely in metal and in this 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.370
 case then our mouth as indeed 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.370
 like a kettledrum and pto
