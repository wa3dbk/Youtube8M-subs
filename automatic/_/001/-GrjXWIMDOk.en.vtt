 about that down in the description 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.590
 I'll leave ursine by making repeat 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.320
 interface configuration options help

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.260
 classic and once you have creation 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.109
 classic because you can do what I 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.600
 I'm going to do no and you'll wonder what I do 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.670
 to repair them basically to me to 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.230
 it has happened to me I do not know if you and I am 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.960
 we are going to finish mining and I made some 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.089
 tools and lower your chest and say oh 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.680
 I did not have tools that were 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.840
 means use because there finished bullets 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.000
 use and you do not want to use them anymore 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.860
 wants to know nothing about them and just 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.570
 you leave them lying there or even in your 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.740
 friend can be good no longer I'm not going to 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.360
 way it was a bed and my 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.650
 tools are used 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.050
 a way that these tools 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.060
 are still saved or which of this 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.530
 way for example good first that 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.590
 all you have to know is that 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.860
 you need two objects of the same material 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.600
 it can not be a stone peak and a peak 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.570
 of iron can not be a peak of 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.120
 diamond and a golden sword does not have 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.700
 to be two iron picks two bullets 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.860
 iron or two iron armors not 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.660
 what rocks do this single mine do not 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.660
 you need table of character in fact it's 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.700
 the only thing that is not is to press x and 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.410
 what to do is you grab the bad peak or 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.300
 the two bad peaks we 're going to put 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.490
 together and you will get a peak 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.560
 totally new this can also be 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.470
 do but only with the anvil and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.080
 made you experience experience then 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.640
 well it's better totally free without the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.810
 need for experience you can not 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.630
 character it until it is totally 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.979
 new or you can crafter not for example if 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.140
 you have one that is really no longer 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.150
 Hold not a block more then you're going to 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.250
 leave at least for these to come together 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.560
 two true as I said or can even 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.580
 just if you do not want this ax 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.350
 because the list was unintentionally 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.820
 you can simply do it again 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.720
 also works with the armor as it 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.030
 I was saying a while ago 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.500
 effort all your armor was you can 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.050
 put or can you put the face on 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.210
 helmet and helmet lead to the iron helmet 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.190
 and so it can not be with whatever you want 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.630
 tell that it's the same material and 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.670
 so can a kraft table 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.460
 eo in case you doubt you can put the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.130
 the booties although they are slang and you are 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.740
 I'm going to have some droplets and better than 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.770
 before I can have a shirt or look 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.750
 even totally no longer avoids 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.370
 pants that are almost new 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.440
 what to put back and then of that 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.300
 way arrange my tools so that 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.950
 can be reused or simply 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.750
 so that they have a little more diver 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.450
 not so with the gentlemen this serves 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.040
 recycling enough of it to 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.600
 tools that you must give michael 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.459
 videos you liked I know it's a small 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.380
 kind already as good as serving us a 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.330
 tip for trick you have some 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.790
 doubt subscribe to for more videos like 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.080
