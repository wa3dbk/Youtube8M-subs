00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
just snaps the cutter to 45 degree

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.670 
just snaps the cutter to 45 degree
increments<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.750> much<00:01:57.930> easier<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> keep<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
increments it's much easier to keep the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.010 
increments it's much easier to keep the
ruler<00:01:58.950> straight<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> see<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.899> can

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
ruler straight like you can see you can

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.450 
ruler straight like you can see you can
also<00:02:01.140> use<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> shift<00:02:01.740> key<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.009> your<00:02:02.219> keyboard

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
also use the shift key on your keyboard

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.609 
also use the shift key on your keyboard
to<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> same<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.509> anyway<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.259> go

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to do the same thing anyway I just go

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.959 
to do the same thing anyway I just go
and<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.890> cut<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> panel<00:02:05.520> ruler<00:02:05.820> layer

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
and I cut the panel ruler layer

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.429 
and I cut the panel ruler layer
approximately<00:02:06.659> where<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.869> laid<00:02:07.170> down<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
approximately where I laid down the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:17.440 
approximately where I laid down the
borders<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> ruffs<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:10.069> repeat

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.809 

so<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.349> can<00:02:18.680> see<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.099> panel<00:02:19.280> rulers<00:02:19.700> are

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
so you can see that the panel rulers are

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.309 
so you can see that the panel rulers are
about<00:02:20.090> where<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.330> want<00:02:20.690> them<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.170> they're<00:02:21.290> not

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
about where I want them but they're not

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.040 
about where I want them but they're not
quite<00:02:21.709> lined<00:02:21.980> up<00:02:22.250> yet<00:02:22.519> so<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.660> tools

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
quite lined up yet so on the tools

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.809 
quite lined up yet so on the tools
palette<00:02:24.440> I'm<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.950> choose<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.400> object

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
palette I'm going to choose the object

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.900 
palette I'm going to choose the object
selector<00:02:26.209> tool<00:02:26.420> here<00:02:26.980> then<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.250> click<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.849> drag

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
selector tool here then I click and drag

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.170 
selector tool here then I click and drag
the<00:02:29.239> border<00:02:29.739> where<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:30.769> want<00:02:31.099> them<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:32.090> I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
the border where I want them and I

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.030 
the border where I want them and I
repeat<00:02:32.480> for<00:02:32.720> all<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.110> borders<00:02:33.440> like<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:33.860> see

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
repeat for all the borders like you see

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.009 
repeat for all the borders like you see
here<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:34.580> first<00:02:34.819> example<00:02:35.390> there<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.840> only

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
here on this first example there is only

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.960 
here on this first example there is only
the<00:02:36.200> bottom<00:02:36.530> border<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.099> everything<00:02:37.700> else<00:02:37.790> is

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
the bottom border and everything else is

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.089 
the bottom border and everything else is
beyond<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.599> the<00:02:38.959> canvass<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:39.560> all<00:02:39.739> I<00:02:39.769> would<00:02:39.920> do

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
beyond the the canvass so all I would do

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.210

is<00:02:40.250> click<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.640> drag<00:02:40.730> off<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:42.019> canvas<00:02:42.440> and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
is click and drag off the canvas and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.110
