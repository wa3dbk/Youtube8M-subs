heaviness 64 pretty sure at about 80% or
so<00:02:10.820> balls<00:02:11.030> can't<00:02:11.269> close<00:02:11.450> out<00:02:11.600> of<00:02:11.630> stock<00:02:11.870> with<00:02:11.900> a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
so balls can't close out of stock with a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.229 
so balls can't close out of stock with a
down<00:02:12.230> go<00:02:12.440> down<00:02:12.470> being<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.610> he<00:02:13.760> hasn't<00:02:14.150> met

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
down go down being and he hasn't met

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.030 
down go down being and he hasn't met
that<00:02:14.390> lethal<00:02:14.810> percent<00:02:15.170> right<00:02:15.350> now<00:02:15.380> definitely
