was this is Steinhardt ocean one and I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.090 
was this is Steinhardt ocean one and I
believe<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.380> second<00:01:07.770> generation

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
believe this the the second generation

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.770 
believe this the the second generation
I've<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.670> got<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.260> in<00:01:10.260> July<00:01:10.619> 2014<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
I've just got it on in July 2014 and the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
I've just got it on in July 2014 and the
first<00:01:12.990> question<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.409> had<00:01:13.680> was<00:01:13.979> when<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.000> went<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
first question I had was when I went to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.960 
first question I had was when I went to
the<00:01:15.689> website<00:01:15.950> where<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.009> purchased<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.850> I'm

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the website where I purchased it and I'm

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.870 
the website where I purchased it and I'm
gonna<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.240> over<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.720> bit<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
gonna go over that a little bit but the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.940 
gonna go over that a little bit but the
first<00:01:21.180> question<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.570> has<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.830> know

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
first question that has was you know

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.190 
first question that has was you know
gave<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> option<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.049> was<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
gave you the option I think it was a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.789 
gave you the option I think it was a
luminol<00:01:26.189> metal<00:01:26.580> bezel<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.509> believe<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.229> ceramic

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
luminol metal bezel I believe or ceramic

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.450 
luminol metal bezel I believe or ceramic
this<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.710> belief<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.100> metal<00:01:32.400> is

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
this one is the belief that the metal is

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.810 
this one is the belief that the metal is
aluminum<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:34.229> not<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> ceramic<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
aluminum it's not the ceramic so you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.100 
aluminum it's not the ceramic so you
know<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> first<00:01:36.630> question<00:01:36.810> because

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
know that was the first question because

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.140 
know that was the first question because
it<00:01:37.290> didn't<00:01:37.530> give<00:01:37.650> me<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> picture<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.670> want<00:01:39.090> to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
it didn't give me a picture so I want to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.490 
it didn't give me a picture so I want to
give<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.420> guys<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.630> view<00:01:40.490> with<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.700> one<00:01:42.500> with

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
give you guys a view with that one with

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
give you guys a view with that one with
the<00:01:43.619> aluminum<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:44.159> looks<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:44.939> case

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the aluminum one looks like just in case

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.890 
the aluminum one looks like just in case
you<00:01:45.210> were<00:01:45.329> wondering

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
you were wondering

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.060 
you were wondering
most<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:48.020> my<00:01:48.050> watches<00:01:48.320> I<00:01:48.560> believe<00:01:48.860> are<00:01:49.040> the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
most of my watches I believe are the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.940 
most of my watches I believe are the
aluminum<00:01:50.000> bezel<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.810> think<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.500> ceramic

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
aluminum bezel and I think the ceramic

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.110 
aluminum bezel and I think the ceramic
supposed<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.250> be<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.340> little<00:01:52.550> bit<00:01:52.640> more<00:01:52.820> durable

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
supposed to be a little bit more durable

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.390 
supposed to be a little bit more durable
maybe<00:01:53.479> scratch<00:01:53.810> resistant<00:01:54.409> for<00:01:55.010> what<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.190> could

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
maybe scratch resistant for what I could

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.930 
maybe scratch resistant for what I could
gather<00:01:55.900> but<00:01:56.900> like<00:01:57.260> I<00:01:57.380> said<00:01:57.440> I<00:01:57.650> have<00:01:58.550> had<00:01:58.820> any

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
gather but like I said I have had any

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.030 
gather but like I said I have had any
problems<00:01:59.330> with<00:01:59.420> my<00:01:59.510> bills<00:01:59.750> and<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.350> went
