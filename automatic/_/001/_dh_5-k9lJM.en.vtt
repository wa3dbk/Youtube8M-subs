the next track is basically just driving
along<00:04:56.340> some<00:04:56.669> rooftops<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.389> jump<00:04:57.840> through

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
along some rooftops you jump through

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.439 
along some rooftops you jump through
some<00:04:58.710> glass<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:59.400> do<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.550> little<00:04:59.789> tumble<00:05:00.180> and

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
then it comes back and then the whole

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.529 
then it comes back and then the whole
building<00:05:02.250> collapses<00:05:02.759> okay<00:05:03.180> that's<00:05:03.360> an<00:05:03.509> e

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
building collapses okay that's an e

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.240 
building collapses okay that's an e
number<00:05:03.780> two<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.319> in<00:05:04.409> the<00:05:04.470> third<00:05:04.530> track<00:05:05.039> you're

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
just driving across this this elevated

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.320 
just driving across this this elevated
highway<00:05:07.530> system<00:05:07.949> making<00:05:08.370> these<00:05:08.490> jumps<00:05:09.000> not

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
highway system making these jumps not

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.240 
highway system making these jumps not
making<00:05:09.750> these<00:05:09.900> jumps<00:05:10.289> and<00:05:10.889> then<00:05:11.009> all<00:05:11.099> of<00:05:11.130> a

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
making these jumps and then all of a

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.589 
making these jumps and then all of a
sudden<00:05:11.280> it<00:05:11.550> starts<00:05:11.729> to<00:05:11.789> collapse<00:05:11.909> on<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.509> you

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
sudden it starts to collapse on you you

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:13.640 
sudden it starts to collapse on you you
have<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.780> kind<00:05:12.960> of<00:05:13.020> make<00:05:13.139> it<00:05:13.289> to<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:13.440> end<00:05:13.560> as

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
have to kind of make it to the end as

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.570 
have to kind of make it to the end as
quickly<00:05:13.680> as<00:05:13.979> you<00:05:14.009> can

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
quickly as you can

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.399 
quickly as you can
you<00:05:14.819> think<00:05:15.120> you<00:05:15.240> could<00:05:15.360> probably<00:05:15.479> land<00:05:15.900> right

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
you think you could probably land right

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:17.809 
you think you could probably land right
into<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.740> finish<00:05:16.979> line<00:05:17.190> that<00:05:17.220> you<00:05:17.400> fuck<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.699> up

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
into the finish line that you fuck it up

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.640 
into the finish line that you fuck it up
somehow<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.569> then<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.080> just<00:05:19.229> kind<00:05:19.409> of<00:05:19.440> back

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
somehow and then you just kind of back

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.680 
somehow and then you just kind of back
in<00:05:19.860> slowly<00:05:20.159> and<00:05:20.610> then<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.449> whole<00:05:21.539> thing

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
in slowly and then the whole thing

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.600 
in slowly and then the whole thing
collapses<00:05:21.780> on<00:05:22.169> you<00:05:22.259> right<00:05:22.440> so<00:05:22.830> there's<00:05:23.370> a<00:05:23.430> lot

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
collapses on you right so there's a lot

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.980 
collapses on you right so there's a lot
of<00:05:23.639> work<00:05:23.819> that<00:05:23.970> went<00:05:24.090> into<00:05:24.240> this<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:24.690> it's

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990
