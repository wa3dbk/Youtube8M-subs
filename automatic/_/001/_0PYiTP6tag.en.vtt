00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
this is my Honda Accord I replaced the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.310 
this is my Honda Accord I replaced the
idle<00:00:11.550> control<00:00:11.700> valve<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.660> electronic

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
idle control valve and the electronic

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.130 
idle control valve and the electronic
control<00:00:13.650> valve

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.100 

so<00:00:18.950> getting<00:00:19.220> this<00:00:19.310> weird<00:00:19.640> surge<00:00:20.510> problem

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
so getting this weird surge problem

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.880 
so getting this weird surge problem
they're<00:00:21.650> like<00:00:21.860> rough<00:00:22.760> idle<00:00:23.590> only<00:00:24.590> one<00:00:24.740> of<00:00:24.800> my

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
they're like rough idle only one of my

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.319 
they're like rough idle only one of my
stoplights<00:00:25.430> it's<00:00:26.240> like<00:00:26.509> this<00:00:26.750> just<00:00:27.619> hear<00:00:28.460> it

everything made sure the alternator

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.220 
everything made sure the alternator
diode<00:00:49.130> was<00:00:49.310> correct<00:00:49.670> clean<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.720> free<00:00:51.050> of<00:00:51.080> any

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
diode was correct clean and free of any

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
little valve behind throttle body that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.410 
little valve behind throttle body that
big<00:01:19.759> silver<00:01:20.090> unit<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.790> just<00:01:23.000> still<00:01:23.390> can't

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
big silver unit and I just still can't

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.940 
big silver unit and I just still can't
figure<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:23.990> out<00:01:24.080> I've<00:01:24.259> placed<00:01:24.590> those<00:01:24.740> two

that

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.340 
that
clucks<00:01:41.939> right<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.330> between<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.499 

here's<00:01:47.860> my<00:01:47.980> voltage

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.710 

you<00:01:50.990> can<00:01:51.140> get<00:01:51.289> a<00:01:51.320> better<00:01:51.530> shot

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.480 

you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.320> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.830 

anyway<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.330> 14<00:02:04.100> yeah<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.430> kind<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.750> see<00:02:06.750> how

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
anyway it's 14 yeah just kind of see how

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.440 
anyway it's 14 yeah just kind of see how
it's<00:02:06.960> popping<00:02:07.290> up<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.500> down<00:02:07.650> like<00:02:07.799> that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.619 

this<00:02:10.929> is<00:02:11.080> kind<00:02:11.349> of<00:02:12.060> tiny<00:02:13.060> bit<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.480> was<00:02:13.540> like

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
this is kind of tiny bit and I was like

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.089 
this is kind of tiny bit and I was like
checking<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:14.140> my<00:02:14.230> grounds<00:02:14.680> make<00:02:14.830> sure<00:02:14.950> they're

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
checking on my grounds make sure they're

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.890 
checking on my grounds make sure they're
clean<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:16.180> know<00:02:16.269> maybe<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.629> was<00:02:16.720> just

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
clean you know maybe it was just

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.150 
clean you know maybe it was just
something<00:02:17.110> between<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.800> battery<00:02:18.099> and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
something between the battery and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.180 
something between the battery and
alternator<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:19.090> mean<00:02:19.959> both<00:02:20.140> pretty<00:02:20.830> new<00:02:21.010> Hubble

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
alternator I mean both pretty new Hubble

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.059 
alternator I mean both pretty new Hubble
yellow<00:02:21.400> top<00:02:21.640> deep-cycle<00:02:22.650> my<00:02:23.650> grounds<00:02:23.980> are

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
yellow top deep-cycle my grounds are

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.740 
yellow top deep-cycle my grounds are
really<00:02:24.340> clean<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.670> good

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
really clean and good

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.050 
really clean and good
upgraded<00:02:27.650> wiring<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.430> mean<00:02:28.670> everything's

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
upgraded wiring I mean everything's

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.690 
upgraded wiring I mean everything's
really<00:02:29.480> secure<00:02:29.900> triple<00:02:30.410> check<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.860> we<00:02:31.460> did

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
really secure triple check that we did

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.839 
really secure triple check that we did
the<00:02:31.790> other<00:02:31.820> day<00:02:32.090> actually

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.849 

and<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.329> just<00:02:35.540> doesn't<00:02:35.810> make<00:02:36.109> any<00:02:36.379> sense<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:36.829> to

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
and it just doesn't make any sense as to

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.089 
and it just doesn't make any sense as to
why<00:02:37.099> should<00:02:37.340> adjust<00:02:37.609> next<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:39.560> really<00:02:39.950> not

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
why should adjust next it's really not

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.970 
why should adjust next it's really not
sure<00:02:40.370> what's<00:02:40.609> what<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.329> tiny<00:02:41.709> annoyance<00:02:42.709> is

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
sure what's what that tiny annoyance is

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.680 
sure what's what that tiny annoyance is
truly

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
truly

I've<00:02:53.159> been<00:02:53.370> seeing<00:02:53.489> this<00:02:53.640> problem<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:54.090> lot<00:02:54.239> with

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
I've been seeing this problem a lot with

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.780 
I've been seeing this problem a lot with
other<00:02:55.319> Honda's<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:55.980> there's<00:02:56.159> been<00:02:56.280> solutions

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
other Honda's and there's been solutions
