00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 what 's up with friends stefan here from fifa 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.460
 and welcome to the second swap 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.210
 pictures we had a long time ago 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.890
 ever 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.750
 he was not that special because of us 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.830
 because it did not come on the 99er chemistry 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.230
 I just do not have it like this 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.730
 thought with the new target system now 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.199
 But I'm fully in it is natural 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.820
 also not so great must be honest so 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.350
 much harder to build hybrids 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.000
 what do you say so I really think 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.289
 really difficult and also very long 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.810
 used for this team here 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.340
 See you now a 4-2-3-1 team 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.560
 in the second variation 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.640
 you decided on facebook resp 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.830
 many of you have chosen 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.630
 decided that we have 1 212 team for 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.130
 30,000 coins will be available soon 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.870
 still there is a very strong team 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.020
 is we catch right now but also directly 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.460
 time with the 4 2 3 1 team yes and we 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.680
 are now here in food I have 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 unfortunately still have no fifa 14 can 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.100
 that to be true no or since several times it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.719
 are there since Tuesday or 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.120
 Wednesday and I still have nothing 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.980
 I have a lot most of the early access as 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.020
 gambled that was nice but up 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.390
 thursday it was only and now sitting 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.940
 I unfortunately without and here it is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.309
 honestly pretty shitty well 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.260
 we start now with the 4 2 3 1 team 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.540
 in the second variant that 's for 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.939
 Let me guess, let me guess 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.770
 on the superior, of course, 50,000 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.170
 Coins on both consoles is natural 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.119
 a little weird 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.659
 we are now asked color scheme in 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.950
 Windows 7 base change because one and 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.470
 do not show these messages anymore 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.720
 thanks so as we said we catch 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.030
 Now with the 4 2 3 1 that costs up 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 both consoles 50,000 coins is one 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.799
 weird but what the hell are we 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.619
 catch the goalkeeper here we have 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:38.369
 atlético madrid had to be right 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.979
 good man 86 reflexive 82 driving 88 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.509
 handling and 84 position play what 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.220
 me also a very crucial 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.119
 role plays so there I have one 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.350
 good backing 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.479
 Now we go to the left-back 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.159
 Here are the one man from the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.440
 Spanish League It is Eliseo of Malaga 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.789
 The tempo has the workplace home medium 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.100
 I do not think so bad or 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.289
 medium medium is synonymous but only 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.580
 that fits in a defense otherwise in 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.330
 pretty much all areas as well 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.679
 good values and that's why we go 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.410
 also directly to the defender 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.989
 here we have a Brazilian 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.940
 Wellington may be seeing it now 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.920
 at first glance quite as strong from 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.720
 he had a pretty good time 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.019
 strength what then makes up for it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.150
 Of course, the 81st fans and 76 head 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.200
 So, for example, that's all right 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.880
 I'm honestly speaking for chemistry 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.160
 used because I would rather have 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.720
 taken another but with the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.609
 chemistry is all that stuff in 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.680
 fifa 14 now we come to one 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:38.190
 have really strong defenders here 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.359
 we distribute from tottenham hotspurs 72 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.239
 Fighter so really good again 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:45.060
 I think he has 81 with him 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.620
 defense and 82 header and looks 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.570
 you get this shot dribbling and 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.040
 Passwords as a place of honest could 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.109
 also a central one for me 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.660
 Be defensive midfielder so 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.100
 a really good strong man up there 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.840
 the second defender position 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.380
 continue to the right defender 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.360
 So here we have a right pace 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.540
 let's take a look at 92 tempo 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.920
 walker ss from rodney as well 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.600
 trust so that must now because of the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.770
 so pure chemistry so I'm there too 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.060
 not so happy with me there too 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.160
 but the other two took what 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.520
 let's walker a really good one here 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.430
 also 78 defense 78 header 70 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.020
 76 dribbling really fits 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.000
 good man for the right 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.040
 linebacker position 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.870
 we come to the right central 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.880
 defensive midfield here have me there 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.500
 did I say something wrong lucas 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.420
 leiva of 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.890
 liverpool has also been pretty good 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.070
 made a new one last year 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.900
 player this year a silver in silver 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.970
 of course, a player with good works 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.910
 in the defense tempo to 70 everything 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.400
 very good 78 matchplay has workplace from 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.890
 loher so there is really nice behind 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.660
 in defense so in there 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.490
 cares less about it 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.959
 Attack but look that behind 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.560
 do not burn anything but then go on 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.850
 the next one because we have a bin 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.590
 maybe not so many like it 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.780
 maybe like a few and me too 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.350
 I think he just has a felipe 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.959
 melo 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.280
 who really has values ​​everywhere you can 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.110
 you just have to pull the hat 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.480
 honestly say 80 defense 80 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.790
 everything else around the 75 rum the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.140
 dear melo has the workplace hey so 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.600
 then he is at least in front 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.790
 a bit steamy and therefore for me 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.620
 really good man at galatasaray 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.660
 Now we come to the left midfield 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.430
 Here we have a very interesting one 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.340
 man a very young man i believe is 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.780
 It also is great at playing 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.190
 galatasaray also has 91 tempo 81 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.840
 dribbling of course the four stars 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.970
 skills available shot and adapt 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.560
 the 65 euro measures itself so the true 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.750
 but let's face it otherwise 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.250
 Values ​​simply look outstanding 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.840
 definitely plays really strong 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.760
 then we go to the right 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.100
 Mittelfeld and here we have a man 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.210
 that's brazilian means another one 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.060
 from thun to half men 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.280
 Of course, that's not so stupid again 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.810
 here it is all the game at braga 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.640
 I think so, but I am now 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.229
 not so so leave 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.780
 not so much forcing you on it and 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.479
 770 he tempo but I think so important 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.490
 fifa 14 tempo it is not anymore and 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.410
 who had a dribbling of 81 believes one 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.000
 stronger around the 70 80 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.470
 so that's what's going on there 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.190
 noticeable that he really is a right one 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.110
 good man is 70 shot 79 passing game 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.520
 So it will definitely be 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.169
 Of course, having a really good time in 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.660
 Rickling four star skills like that 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.310
 So a good at what its all 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.930
 Man on the right side exit now 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.850
 we come to the central offensive 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.650
 midfield and wailing small lightning one 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.150
 coutinho of liverpool 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.729
 Of course, that also applies to the new ones 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.080
 chemistry 83 pace I believe the 90s 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.230
 entrance and entrance is natural 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.640
 very important 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.350
 So that's right there too 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.870
 whirl and make steam 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.430
 Of course, his dribbling of 880 will tell 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.440
 have a 78 game 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.520
 he has so much better last season 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.010
 exit for me that would actually have 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.380
 but over the 80s area are for it 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.240
 the shot with 69 also not so bad 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.290
 but could be better now 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.460
 Let's come for the last time 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.750
 Of course, good four-star year 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.440
 skills I have, of course, still 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.270
 lead 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.180
 But now we come to the last man 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.450
 and that is a portuguese it is 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.120
 Of course each of prague accumulates 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.620
 so exactly in any case plays in 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.190
 the portuguese league itself unite 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.600
 like all 84 ps , 80 dribbling has four 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.580
 Of course it's four stars 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.890
 weak foot , I think one too 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.530
 really good strength of over 80 shot 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.110
 So, from 72, head of 79 so 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.970
 outstanding man in this team and yes 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.340
 and there are not so much anymore 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.160
 to say you can see we have two 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.780
 position changes so from the west ring on 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.460
 left midfield and the same on the 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.450
 other side but I think that costs 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.400
 not so much now, maybe 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.270
 times 5000 editions maybe one 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.310
 be a little less 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.770
 We now see the team here costs 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.300
 even only 40,000 I 'm not 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.700
 certainly 50,000 somehow so around the turn 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.070
 50,000 so everything should be in there for 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.620
 50,000 coins and that actually looks 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.270
 really good and I hope you 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.680
 like that bands would like it 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.000
 I'm very, very, very, very happy about that 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.660
 I am glad that has a lot of time 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.060
 tasted 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.950
 to create this hybrid animal that was 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.900
 as far as I am doing well until 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.900
