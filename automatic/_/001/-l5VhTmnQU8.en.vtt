 Of temperature 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.250
 programs under the self-construction system only deliver 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.190
 materials so they face some obstacles like the following 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.940
 the young indeterminate construction 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.970

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.230
 the success of 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.220
 not less than 11% 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.220
 high freight cost 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.860
 offered the economic housing haiti 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.860
 helps to reduce some problems in areas 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.630
 and in remote rural areas 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.720
 we took on the task of developing a new constructive system 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.600
 using materials developed by Mexicans 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.110
 with excellent characteristics that do not count ideal for the construction of the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 train a house to series developments 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 arises thanks to the development of the protexa group 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.420
 nineteen ninety five 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.800
 said Daniel DÃ¡vila initiated an investigation to develop a 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.549
 lightweight resistant mortar 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.439
 conversion bought Texas is working on its manufacture and distribution 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.859
 commercial 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:22.019
 the traditional construction of a rural house depending on the area 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.440
 branch of eight to ten weeks 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.540
 with our system supported by numerous patents only from 6 to 10 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.189
 days 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.579
 next we will see the new system of action 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.589
 the first day your level before compaq of the area 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:44.409
 concluding with the placement of borders for the transfer of concrete 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.909
 the second day proceeds to the brother-in-law of the concrete according to the 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.909
 specifications of each region 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.809
 the third day the pieces of a prefabricated fiberglass mold are placed 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.389
 joining them with screws 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.819
 subsequently a reinforcement setter is not placed the cuts are made 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.829
 necessary to place them sea 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.819

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.349

 cesar stickers ingrate 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:23.929
 but light protexa 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:29.540
 from 48 to 72 hours later a blow of fiberglass is removed that end 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.620
 the university students 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.539
 all 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:33.939
 the March 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.579
 let's play with wolf 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.159
 in self-construction the fun begins when the community participates 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.779
 in the task of throwing us 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:47.199
 0 on the fiberglass mold on the last day the sealing of the 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.479
 exterior surface and proceeds to waterproof the roof and paint the 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:56.769
 interior and exterior walls activate this system is successful for its low 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.659
 cost and simple structure 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.999
 satisfies the urgency of the inhabitants of the different remote regions as 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:08.879
 marginalized from enjoying decent housing rural schools libraries spaces 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.879
 health center and community service 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.789
 the housing thanks to its popularity is easily feasible to cover the 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.220
 growth needs 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.059
 what about the families the communities 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:23.169
 southern project 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.449
 others developed by Mexicans are an economic answer 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:30.710
 to the housing problem 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.710
 and social and educational spaces 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.080
 and they already enjoy a 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.779
 one to one raffle 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.539
 today our commitment to the environment 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:44.669
 and social development
