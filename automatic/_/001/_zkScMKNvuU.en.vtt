00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.530 
imagine how heavy they are which is
actually<00:00:35.160> why<00:00:35.719> usually<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:38.270> my<00:00:39.270> wall

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
actually why usually it's up on my wall

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.970 
actually why usually it's up on my wall
in<00:00:39.930> my<00:00:40.469> music<00:00:41.010> room<00:00:41.329> mmm<00:00:42.530> rather<00:00:43.530> than<00:00:43.800> we

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
in my music room mmm rather than we

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.490 
in my music room mmm rather than we
played<00:00:44.340> often<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.870> because<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.140> so

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
played often it's just because it's so

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.479 
played often it's just because it's so
heavy<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.860> after<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> few<00:00:47.520> songs<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.620> I<00:00:49.620> can't

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
heavy that after a few songs I I can't

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
heavy that after a few songs I I can't
really<00:00:50.610> play<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.000> anymore<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.620> my<00:00:52.620> back

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
really play it anymore because my back

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.790 
really play it anymore because my back
and<00:00:53.160> shoulders<00:00:53.640> are<00:00:54.000> hurting<00:00:54.960> too<00:00:55.320> much<00:00:55.530> for

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and shoulders are hurting too much for

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
and shoulders are hurting too much for
me<00:00:56.090> however<00:00:57.410> does<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.890> some<00:00:59.250> really<00:01:00.000> nice

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
me however does have some really nice

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
me however does have some really nice
sounds<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:04.199> distortion<00:01:04.739> sound<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.100> this

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
sounds the the distortion sound on this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.500 
sounds the the distortion sound on this
is<00:01:05.430> probably<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> best<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.330> any

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
is probably the best that if any

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.850 
is probably the best that if any
qatari-owned<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:09.200> artificial<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:10.470> pinch<00:01:10.680> our

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
qatari-owned and artificial or pinch our

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:25.930 
qatari-owned and artificial or pinch our
minds

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.570 

really<00:01:26.940> easy<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.480> this<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.580> maybe

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
really easy on this just like they maybe

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.390 
really easy on this just like they maybe
even<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.940> little<00:01:29.970> bit<00:01:30.210> easier<00:01:30.390> than<00:01:30.780> i'm<00:01:30.930> in

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
even a little bit easier than i'm in

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.980 
even a little bit easier than i'm in
gibson<00:01:32.400> les<00:01:32.520> paul<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:34.080> I<00:01:34.230> just<00:01:34.260> showed<00:01:34.500> you

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
gibson les paul and as I just showed you

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.590 
gibson les paul and as I just showed you
tapping<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.760> you<00:01:38.760> get<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> best<00:01:39.150> sound<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
tapping is you get the best sound of

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.780 
tapping is you get the best sound of
tapping<00:01:40.110> um<00:01:40.440> but<00:01:41.070> probably<00:01:41.370> I<00:01:41.460> depending

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
tapping um but probably I depending

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.300 
tapping um but probably I depending
guitar<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.360> including<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> PRS<00:01:43.650> it's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
guitar I have including the PRS it's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.310 
guitar I have including the PRS it's
possible<00:01:44.910> that<00:01:45.030> i<00:01:45.120> haven't<00:01:45.330> just<00:01:45.690> figured<00:01:46.230> out

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
possible that i haven't just figured out

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.610 
possible that i haven't just figured out
that<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.220> right<00:01:47.400> tweak<00:01:47.940> settings<00:01:48.780> i<00:01:49.110> mean<00:01:49.290> for

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
that the right tweak settings i mean for

00:01:49.620 --> 00:02:10.660 
that the right tweak settings i mean for
that

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.110 

I<00:02:11.150> mean<00:02:11.480> even<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.840> regular<00:02:12.230> harmonics<00:02:12.830> are

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
I mean even the regular harmonics are

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.250 
I mean even the regular harmonics are
really<00:02:14.120> like<00:02:14.330> phenomenal<00:02:14.660> on<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.319> guitar<00:02:17.260> I

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
really like phenomenal on this guitar I

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.229 
really like phenomenal on this guitar I
guess<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.709> don't<00:02:18.860> really<00:02:19.040> have<00:02:19.310> much<00:02:19.819> else<00:02:20.090> to

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
guess I don't really have much else to

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.410 
guess I don't really have much else to
say<00:02:20.330> it's<00:02:20.690> it's<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.230> really<00:02:21.440> good<00:02:21.530> metal<00:02:21.890> guitar

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
say it's it's a really good metal guitar

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.880 
say it's it's a really good metal guitar
obviously<00:02:23.420> because<00:02:23.599> that's<00:02:23.780> that's<00:02:24.709> why<00:02:24.860> I

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
obviously because that's that's why I

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.059 
obviously because that's that's why I
want<00:02:25.099> him<00:02:25.630> metal<00:02:26.630> guys<00:02:26.780> use<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:30.069> quite

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
like my partner fly which I guess I

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.509

haven't done a video of yet but I will
at<00:02:49.850> some<00:02:49.880> point<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:51.110> at<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.680> Parker<00:02:51.980> flies

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
at some point that at the Parker flies

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.490 
at some point that at the Parker flies
like<00:02:52.730> it's<00:02:53.600> like<00:02:53.720> picking<00:02:53.930> up<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.230> feather

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
like it's like picking up a feather

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.190 
like it's like picking up a feather
whereas<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.790> like<00:02:56.140> picking<00:02:57.140> up<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.440> tank

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200

this time oh I guess I should go over
the<00:03:10.489> different<00:03:10.610> no<00:03:11.420> because<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.690> forgot<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.110> do

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
the different no because I forgot to do

that on the other guitar videos so this

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:30.420 
that on the other guitar videos so this
is<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.190> setting<00:03:22.430> with<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.760> switch<00:03:23.000> down

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
different actually then you realize how

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:13.420 
different actually then you realize how
different<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.769> more<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.040> little<00:04:13.340> more

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430
