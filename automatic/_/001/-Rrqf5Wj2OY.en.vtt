00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
times helped out there I think yeah I

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.240 
times helped out there I think yeah I
think<00:01:38.340> having<00:01:39.210> done<00:01:39.710> stage<00:01:40.710> races<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
think having done stage races in the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.160 
think having done stage races in the
past<00:01:41.549> was<00:01:41.880> helpful<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> guys<00:01:42.750> hadn't

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
past was helpful some of the guys hadn't

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.120 
past was helpful some of the guys hadn't
so<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
so I think that it's it's it's a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.090 
so I think that it's it's it's a
different<00:01:47.460> type<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:48.170> event<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.979> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
different type of event and that one you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160 
different type of event and that one you
don't<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> carry<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.210> yeah<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.930> kind<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
don't have to carry so yeah it's kind of

there's<00:06:26.280> going<00:06:26.460> to<00:06:26.550> be<00:06:26.640> definitely<00:06:27.150> some

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
there's going to be definitely some

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.860 
there's going to be definitely some
gamesmanship<00:06:28.500> and<00:06:29.570> it's<00:06:30.570> going<00:06:30.690> to<00:06:30.780> be

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
gamesmanship and it's going to be

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.420 
gamesmanship and it's going to be
interesting<00:06:31.110> to<00:06:31.380> see<00:06:31.650> when<00:06:31.890> people<00:06:32.250> try<00:06:32.400> to

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
interesting to see when people try to

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.360 
interesting to see when people try to
make<00:06:32.670> moves<00:06:32.970> and<00:06:33.420> and<00:06:33.720> like<00:06:34.380> if<00:06:34.800> anyone<00:06:35.190> goes

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370
