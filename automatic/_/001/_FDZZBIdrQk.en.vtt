we're gonna pop the trunk and in the
hood<00:02:02.569> here<00:02:02.899> we'll<00:02:03.770> take<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.979> look<00:02:04.130> at<00:02:04.189> this

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
hood here we'll take a look at this

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.359 
hood here we'll take a look at this
convertible<00:02:04.670> top<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.959> there's<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.889> very<00:02:07.069> good

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
convertible top and there's a very good

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.430 
convertible top and there's a very good
condition<00:02:07.729> overall<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.569> see<00:02:08.810> very<00:02:09.050> little

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
condition overall you see very little

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.080 
condition overall you see very little
wear<00:02:09.679> even<00:02:10.220> though<00:02:10.340> we're<00:02:10.459> marks<00:02:10.850> on<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
wear even though we're marks on the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.720 
wear even though we're marks on the
sides<00:02:11.390> there<00:02:11.810> are<00:02:11.959> very<00:02:12.170> very<00:02:12.440> small<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:13.069> do

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
sides there are very very small you do

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.610 
sides there are very very small you do
see<00:02:13.970> some<00:02:14.209> separation<00:02:14.420> back<00:02:15.140> here<00:02:15.410> though

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
see some separation back here though

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.339 
see some separation back here though
we're<00:02:16.490> separating<00:02:17.209> from<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.900> bottom<00:02:18.260> of

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
we're separating from the the bottom of

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.380 
we're separating from the the bottom of
the<00:02:18.410> canvas<00:02:18.650> top<00:02:19.040> now<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.910> looks<00:02:20.090> like<00:02:20.209> it's

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
the canvas top now that looks like it's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.449 
the canvas top now that looks like it's
just<00:02:20.599> glued<00:02:20.959> in<00:02:21.170> from<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.530> factory<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.310> that's

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
just glued in from the factory so that's

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.740 
just glued in from the factory so that's
probably<00:02:22.819> something<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.300> can<00:02:23.420> be<00:02:23.540> taken

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
probably something that can be taken

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.020 
probably something that can be taken
care<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:24.080> fairly<00:02:24.500> easily<00:02:24.709> there's<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.640> small

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
care of fairly easily there's a small

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.910 
care of fairly easily there's a small
cut<00:02:26.330> right<00:02:26.720> there<00:02:26.750> on<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.230> side<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.710> top

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
cut right there on the side of the top

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.270 
cut right there on the side of the top
probably<00:02:28.550> I'm<00:02:28.790> gonna<00:02:29.060> inch<00:02:29.300> long<00:02:29.510> way

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
probably I'm gonna inch long way

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.040 
probably I'm gonna inch long way
but<00:02:31.280> again<00:02:31.520> it's<00:02:31.940> doubled<00:02:32.330> up<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.540> tripled<00:02:32.930> up

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
but again it's doubled up and tripled up

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.320 
but again it's doubled up and tripled up
in<00:02:33.200> fabric<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.770> plastic<00:02:34.550> there<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:34.970> it's<00:02:35.270> not

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
in fabric and plastic there so it's not

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.260 
in fabric and plastic there so it's not
a<00:02:35.420> water<00:02:35.720> leak<00:02:35.930> issue<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.849> take<00:02:37.849> a<00:02:37.880> look<00:02:38.090> under

so<00:03:45.769> overall<00:03:46.280> condition<00:03:46.790> on<00:03:46.910> this<00:03:47.030> vehicle<00:03:47.239> is

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
so overall condition on this vehicle is

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.990 
so overall condition on this vehicle is
absolutely<00:03:48.049> excellent<00:03:48.430> but<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.700> know<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:49.880> is

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
absolutely excellent but you know it is

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.390 
absolutely excellent but you know it is
a<00:03:50.030> 1995<00:03:50.810> vehicle<00:03:51.320> so<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:51.500> course<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.890> can't<00:03:52.280> be

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
a 1995 vehicle so of course it can't be

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.120 
a 1995 vehicle so of course it can't be
