00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
well one thing I tried to do was go in

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.660 
well one thing I tried to do was go in
the<00:00:45.989> lobby<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:46.649> myself<00:00:46.829> killed<00:00:47.309> so

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the lobby and just get myself killed so

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520 
the lobby and just get myself killed so
my<00:00:47.789> Katie<00:00:48.059> would<00:00:48.300> purposely<00:00:48.690> go<00:00:48.930> down<00:00:49.140> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
my Katie would purposely go down and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.529 
my Katie would purposely go down and
that's<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.520> good<00:00:50.850> thing<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.300> can

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
that's just one good thing that can

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
reset you that sucks right now you might

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.700 
reset you that sucks right now you might
as<00:01:08.850> well<00:01:09.000> use<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.420> an<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.780> an<00:01:10.229> advantage

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
as well use it to an it as an advantage

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
as well use it to an it as an advantage
and<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.340> make<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> bunch<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.030> prestigious

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and just make a bunch of prestigious

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.289 
and just make a bunch of prestigious
dummy<00:01:13.020> accounts<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.010> if<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.520> reset<00:01:15.060> one

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
dummy accounts so if they do reset one

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.560 
dummy accounts so if they do reset one
account<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.869> might<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> couple<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
account you might have a couple more and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.780 
account you might have a couple more and
hopefully<00:01:18.570> they<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.110> not<00:01:19.380> all<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.920> reset<00:01:20.580> I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
hopefully they do not all get reset I

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.280 
hopefully they do not all get reset I
know<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> fact<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.630> 12th<00:01:21.930> procedure

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
know for a fact that 12th procedure

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.630 
know for a fact that 12th procedure
counts<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.130> reset<00:01:23.490> because

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
counts are going to get reset because

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.760 
counts are going to get reset because
it's<00:01:23.909> pretty<00:01:24.090> easy<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> tell<00:01:24.750> which<00:01:25.380> account

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's pretty easy to tell which account

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.340 
it's pretty easy to tell which account
is<00:01:26.040> glitched<00:01:26.700> since<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.360> can't<00:01:27.630> even<00:01:27.750> unlock

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
is glitched since you can't even unlock

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.450 
is glitched since you can't even unlock
it<00:01:28.970> legitly<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.479> yeah<00:01:31.439> everybody<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.159> has

it legitly so yeah everybody that has
done<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> glitch<00:01:33.560> make<00:01:34.560> dummy<00:01:34.829> accounts<00:01:35.369> if

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520
