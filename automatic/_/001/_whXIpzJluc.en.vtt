00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 Well 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.519
 Let's take a look at the codes that come out of Bus Coverskin's loneliness amplifiers. 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.299
 I'll do it 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.299
 The first line of code is that of this lenin code. 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:29.310
 Seven rats Amuro # code 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.310
 Route # 4 at line 6 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.320
 There is no # f # minor seventh code rooted in this flat of line # 6 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:53.059
 Next time I see this code. 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:56.989
 This code from rosin is the one from Sangrege 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:03.590
 In this song, from the high position side 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:06.800
 So with your forefinger in line three times in a row every four feet then stop your finger one time 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.860
 Joe's fourth finger 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.190
 Take five places on this line. 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.960
 Give me a finger-style six-line base. 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.039
 5 I got it like this 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.039
 I'll try again. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.000
 Oh Oh Oh Oh 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:31.060
 Because he is not a strum style, line 5 is a line, line 4 is a natural 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.140
 The sound is muted or should come 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.510
 Next, a code 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.510
 This is not the case in high position 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.840
 I played Pride Code a while in My Lokesa 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.740
 Thumb line 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.740
 This is how we got Flash 5 up. 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.100
 Next is a minor code 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.100
 U 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:15.080
 Next to a - x little finger 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.080
 Please give me this flashing # on line 1 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.720
 That concludes the code description. 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.840
 U 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.540
 no.5
