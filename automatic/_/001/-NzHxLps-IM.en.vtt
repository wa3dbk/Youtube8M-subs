 which has been much sought after in shades 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.700
 reds sorry not to record it is a 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.150
 intro but I had to record this 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.400
 tutorial in the early hours of Saturday but 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.520
 here they have it finally it's a look 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.990
 pretty eye-catching they can use with 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.440
 a black dress with a gray dress 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.270
 dark and they will look beautiful I hope 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.430
 Enjoy it and please do not forget 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.510
 subscribe to the channel in addition to adding 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.510
 me to your social networks 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.789
 let's start by applying a prebase of 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.190
 shadows that occupy the demo tips and then 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.780
 use this crayon that is de l'oréal what 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.030
 they get in color supermarkets 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.039
 black and it's pretty intense I 'm not going to 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.989
 put the outer corners of the eyelid 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.659
 and I'm going to blur it perfectly with 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.729
 a lucky brush this is double fiber 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.000
 that allows me to so much dust 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:04.269
 like creams then it's perfect for 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.090
 can extend this black color a little 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.159
 towards the banks later I'm going to take a 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.590
 lip can be any lipstick that 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.960
 want to go taking this one that I had 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.090
 saved es de l'oréal is also a 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.649
 red color any lipstick that is 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.409
 we believe milestone is going to serve them they are going to 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.470
 apply in the middle of the eyelid and what 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.170
 can blur with your fingers or with 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.330
 some brush integrating little by little to 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.330
 the dark intensity of the eyeliner 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.810
 then I'm going to take a shade of color 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.880
 a little too light orange too 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.240
 can you compare it with the salt the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.280
 candy from the palette to face that is very 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.200
 very similar to this color and I'm going to 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.780
 define in the fold I'm making a 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.960
 different diffusion than always 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.790
 use and then I'm going to take a shadow 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.159
 clarita because I feel that I was raised 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.590
 very much orange and with this shadow 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.810
 clarita I will illuminate and illuminate the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.610
 eyebrow bone and I will go down little 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.369
 little color until it reaches the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.910
 intensity that I want to want from this 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.519
 transition orange color after I go 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.010
 to take in the black area very 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.890
 intense the darkest you have in mate 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.110
 and I'm going to compact it little by little in 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.090
 both corners of the eyelid where we have 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.040
 put the eyeliner this is going to 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.769
 reaffirm and will start a sea ​​towards 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.200
 up this tonality they have to do it 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.390
 little by little and take a little 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.640
 product and re-blur and take 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.830
 Another bit and looking in the mirror estarse 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.170
 as it fades upwards 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.210
 it's a kind of truth to have to 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.990
 be retouching the look little by little 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.510
 look in the mirror and pretty much see what 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.700
 So much intensity is taking 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.430
 creating here a small one a small 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.610
 elongation outwards and joining very 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.470
 slightly the top part after I go 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.540
 to take a red shadow can take if 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.640
 is this tone seems very lit 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.830
 You can also use a shadow of 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.880
 wine color or burgundy I'm using 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.220
 also the one with a matte finish of 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.540
 the shadow but I feel that also a 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.160
 shadow with glitter or satin is going to 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.230
 go very well the sky that is your 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.300
 preference 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.610
 to me as in specific they wanted a look 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.230
 red on that's why I'm 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.030
 taking this tonality I'm going to 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.880
 compact little by little so that it 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.610
 integrate in the corners to the black color 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.790
 then with a dark brown color 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.430
 mate I will also start to blur 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.960
 up these colors both the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.970
 black like red that's going to be my 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.430
 second transition color in the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.670
 fold I recommend that just like the 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.040
 black little by little they will go up this 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.190
 look I practice it three times before 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.590
 that came out in this video or I 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.320
 I started as the 9 pm and 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.390
 I ended up really recording as a 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.500
 One o'clock in the morning, they have to 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.090
 practice it do not despair if it comes out 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.030
 simply that it is little by little and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.580
 have patience in blurring as 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.430
 can see return to take the color 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.079
 black and little by little I start it up 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.549
 to the intensity that I want with 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.400
 medium of 60 which is the color black and 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.370
 it's dark enough 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.460
 integrated to the red color I will not be 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.410
 blurring the corners up there and if 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.950
 they feel that they pass away blur with a 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.770
 loose clean brush return to color 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.169
 coffee or return to the red color and come back 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.370
 to blur little by little from small 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.969
 small amounts 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.369
 sometimes exceeds 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.679
 if using a brush here that 

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:51.829
 folds that helps me a lot to 

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:52.909
 integrate both colors then I'm going to 

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:56.089
 delineate the upper lashes 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:59.269
 remember that nothing else is to be able 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:01.939
 prepare on the lashes for the 

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:05.569
 Afterwards, I'm going to curl them and put 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:07.339
 normal mask against water and 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.069
 then applied these false eyelashes 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:12.439
 that are left alone is that they are the 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.110
 iconic to make them sincere I think that 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:16.459
 these tabs are too short 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.769
 for the look I would have liked to have 

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:21.199
 some longer so I think the look 

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:23.599
 lends itself to something more dramatic in 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.390
 eyelashes but well they also look very 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.090
 cute 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.590
 and they look elegant as winged in the 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.510
 bottom part I'm using this 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.390
 brand water pencil eyeliner 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.890
 visual that comes out very good and I am 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.650
 putting also below 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.320
 eyelashes to blend it perfectly 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.140
 with a flat brush and a shadow of 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.970
 brown color this shadow is the same as 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.580
 I used for as the second color of 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.100
 transition in the top fold and what 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.170
 I'm going to go down and blur this 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.570
 tonality until it integrates with me 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.810
 skin color little by little later I'm going to 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.760
 take this shine that is good is 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.969
 an area with many crimes of color 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.429
 like golden silver 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:08.759
 and I'm going to put it in the inner corner 

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:11.519
 of the eye and I'm going to put on mask 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:15.360
 tabs up and down to 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:17.639
 intensify the look even more so that 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.409
 note between the smoked and well this is the 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.659
 final result which changes the lens 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:23.789
 so that the definition of 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.619
 the eyes and as you can see it shows 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.749
 much darker as it is a 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:30.269
 little bit smoked but it is that it changes 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:32.159
 the lens and I hope you like that 

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:34.619
 look in the eyes can use a 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:38.100
 neutral lipstick however I'm already in 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:40.440
 the maquis and for something more dramatic 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.960
 and he gave them the option also because of 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.880
 go even more with the lips I'm 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.460
 using this lipstick that made myers 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:53.100
 from anastacia beverly hills that arrive 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:55.530
 from the USA to Mexico via usps that 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.780
 he passes it to my ex post and if they arrive not 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.570
 they charge additional taxes if 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.220
 it takes 4 or 5 weeks to arrive and if 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.810
 there comes a video of how to buy in 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.750
 internet over put a red plus 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.310
 turned on so that it looked a little 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.290
 more to the eyes and well this is the 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.110
 beautiful final result I hope that you 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.120
 I liked it, I send you a little kiss and 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.100
 please do not forget to tell me more 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.770
 they want to see why I'm trying to 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.440
 answer the messages that I can most 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:25.460
 the questions I send you a kiss and god 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.460
 bless them bye bye
