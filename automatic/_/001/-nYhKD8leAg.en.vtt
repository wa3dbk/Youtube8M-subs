00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
safety is their motivation they say this

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.280 
safety is their motivation they say this
technology<00:01:44.579> could<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.030> day<00:01:45.270> cut<00:01:45.600> traffic

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
technology could one day cut traffic

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.520 
technology could one day cut traffic
deaths<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.860> half

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.039 

it<00:01:50.190> got<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.520> nervous<00:01:50.760> yeah<00:01:51.450> must've

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it got really nervous yeah must've

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.539 
it got really nervous yeah must've
thought<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.440> saw<00:01:52.590> somebody<00:01:52.890> coming<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.369> down

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
thought it saw somebody coming in down

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.200 
thought it saw somebody coming in down
the<00:01:53.700> on-ramp

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the on-ramp

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.330 
the on-ramp
so<00:01:54.360> how<00:01:54.570> does<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.869> handle<00:01:55.049> stop<00:01:55.590> signs<00:01:55.979> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340

but<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.830> was<00:02:17.160> really<00:02:17.550> scared<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.120> wouldn't<00:02:18.330> my

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
but I was really scared it wouldn't my

hope<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:19.610> transformed<00:02:20.610> society<00:02:21.209> to

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
hope is that we transformed society to

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.120 
hope is that we transformed society to
make<00:02:21.620> traffic<00:02:22.850> safer<00:02:23.850> more<00:02:24.780> efficient<00:02:25.560> and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
make traffic safer more efficient and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.960 
make traffic safer more efficient and
also<00:02:26.400> more<00:02:26.640> pleasurable

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
also more pleasurable
