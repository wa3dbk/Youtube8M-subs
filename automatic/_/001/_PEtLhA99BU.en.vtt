00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
hello everyone today I am working with a

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.570 
hello everyone today I am working with a
jade<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:19.020> has<00:00:20.020> grown<00:00:20.890> quite<00:00:21.189> a<00:00:21.250> bit<00:00:21.550> and<00:00:21.910> in

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
jade it has grown quite a bit and in

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.500 
jade it has grown quite a bit and in
urgent<00:00:25.420> need<00:00:25.660> of<00:00:25.920> pruning<00:00:26.920> and<00:00:27.400> I<00:00:28.090> also

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
urgent need of pruning and I also

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.080 
urgent need of pruning and I also
noticed<00:00:29.020> there's<00:00:29.230> a<00:00:29.350> branch<00:00:29.770> which<00:00:30.490> is<00:00:30.820> still

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
noticed there's a branch which is still

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.560 
noticed there's a branch which is still
wide<00:00:31.300> up<00:00:31.540> and<00:00:31.870> this<00:00:32.080> wide<00:00:32.349> is<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.710> be<00:00:32.770> removed

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
wide up and this wide is to be removed

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.680 
wide up and this wide is to be removed
otherwise<00:00:34.570> would<00:00:35.080> leave<00:00:35.350> its<00:00:35.530> mark<00:00:36.239> as<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.300> tree

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
otherwise would leave its mark as a tree

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.690 
otherwise would leave its mark as a tree
goes<00:00:37.930> it's<00:00:38.290> a<00:00:38.470> tree<00:00:38.710> is<00:00:38.770> also<00:00:38.920> fairly<00:00:39.280> brittle

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
goes it's a tree is also fairly brittle

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.470 
goes it's a tree is also fairly brittle
and<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.140> be<00:00:41.230> fairly<00:00:41.440> careful<00:00:41.970> in<00:00:42.970> Whiting

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
and have to be fairly careful in Whiting

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:53.940 
and have to be fairly careful in Whiting
and<00:00:43.570> unwinding<00:00:44.110> it

branches which are going south

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.490 
branches which are going south
ie<00:02:25.900> going<00:02:26.470> downwards<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.600> we<00:02:28.600> don't<00:02:29.230> have

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
ie going downwards and we don't have

ie going downwards and we don't have
that<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.920> bonsai<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.730> remove<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:32.590> one

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
that in bonsai so you remove this one

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.190 
that in bonsai so you remove this one
tidied<00:02:35.080> up<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.380> bit<00:02:35.410> here

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
this could also benefit from being

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.160 
this could also benefit from being
believed<00:02:50.190> as<00:02:50.910> ice<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.510> straight<00:02:51.840> into<00:02:52.020> the

out of the trunk begin a winter room
it's<00:03:40.400> this<00:03:40.640> branch<00:03:40.940> here<00:03:43.840> approach<00:03:44.840> here<00:03:50.560> I'm

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
it's this branch here approach here I'm

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.770 
it's this branch here approach here I'm
also<00:03:51.800> going<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.130> remove<00:03:52.280> new<00:03:53.030> growth<00:03:53.330> which<00:03:53.630> is

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
also going to remove new growth which is

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.830 
also going to remove new growth which is
very<00:03:53.990> close<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.650> trunk<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:56.320> we<00:03:57.320> have<00:03:58.840> this

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
very close to the trunk and we have this

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.470 
very close to the trunk and we have this
pouch<00:04:00.170> as<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:01.010> new<00:04:01.160> health<00:04:01.460> that<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.000> was<00:04:02.180> my

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
pouch as the new health that it was my

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.160 
pouch as the new health that it was my
trunks<00:04:02.960> are<00:04:03.140> move<00:04:03.650> out<00:04:04.360> so<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.420> exposes<00:04:05.750> that

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
trunks are move out so it exposes that

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.059 
trunks are move out so it exposes that
area

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.229 

again<00:04:10.060> I've<00:04:10.360> spotted<00:04:10.720> some<00:04:11.140> more<00:04:11.379> new<00:04:11.769> growth

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
again I've spotted some more new growth

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.349 
again I've spotted some more new growth
pointing<00:04:13.239> downwards<00:04:13.750> so<00:04:14.470> that's<00:04:14.680> coming<00:04:14.950> out

pointing downwards so that's coming out
as<00:04:16.359> is<00:04:16.660> this<00:04:16.870> one<00:04:19.440> makes<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.620> good<00:04:20.769> clean<00:04:21.070> line

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
as is this one makes a good clean line

00:04:22.110 --> 00:05:35.379 
as is this one makes a good clean line
that's<00:04:23.110> what<00:04:23.229> we<00:04:23.380> like<00:04:23.530> in<00:04:23.740> one<00:04:23.919> side

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.860 

I'll<00:05:35.900> start<00:05:36.229> another<00:05:36.349> coach<00:05:37.389> again<00:05:38.389> new

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
I'll start another coach again new

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.350 
I'll start another coach again new
growth<00:05:39.169> on<00:05:39.500> top<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:40.129> a<00:05:40.280> earlier<00:05:41.740> branch<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:43.360> to

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
growth on top of a earlier branch and to

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.029 
growth on top of a earlier branch and to
close<00:05:44.599> the<00:05:44.840> name<00:05:44.990> clunk<00:05:45.289> which<00:05:45.530> is<00:05:45.650> this<00:05:45.800> one

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
close the name clunk which is this one

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:53.320 
close the name clunk which is this one
here<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:47.960> remove<00:05:48.830> this

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.309 

it<00:05:53.960> looks<00:05:54.229> much<00:05:54.409> better<00:05:55.569> exposes<00:05:56.569> that<00:05:56.750> flash

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
it looks much better exposes that flash

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.869 
it looks much better exposes that flash
there

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.429 

it<00:06:00.879> is<00:06:01.030> another<00:06:01.270> branch<00:06:01.569> coming<00:06:02.020> straight<00:06:02.259> out

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439 
it is another branch coming straight out

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.709 
it is another branch coming straight out
of<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.650> trunk<00:06:02.979> because<00:06:03.189> this<00:06:03.520> one<00:06:03.759> here<00:06:04.030> would

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:04.719 
of the trunk because this one here would

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:10.440 
of the trunk because this one here would
remove<00:06:05.139> that

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.820
