00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.400
 also for you yoghurt gums without 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.590
 carbohydrates because I'm there without anything 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.530
 Everything with protein so we need it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.460
 200 milliliters of boiled water we 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.770
 need 100 mg of gensoja 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.910
 yogurt depending on the phase in which 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.829
 of course, could also be located 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.450
 take normal hat or lean quark or 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.129
 lean quark but I have the experience 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.980

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.780
 You can also taste ok 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.730
 I read the water that wide 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.660

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.809

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.920
 Delicious is okay if you are so far 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.470
 with water we'll do it 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.850

 which we have zero carbohydrates 0 85 85 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.530
 Protein is actually when you have it 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.970
 If you like something sweet then you can 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.920
 of course a splash of sweetener or 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.200
 We have to use stevia completely 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.820
 little else will it be too much and we will 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.960
 have a packet of food here 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.939
 once here teach and teach 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.079
 He chose a left today also 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.369
 and we're doing pink 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.140
 goddess that means we have here 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.759
 raspberry flavor the other is violence 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.020
 master we just start now 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.200
 we just chatter the water 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.300
 opening the door almost makes you need one 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.790
 bowl and the shots comes 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.590
 200 milliliters of a cooked one 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.630
 water or evers wide 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.850
 You can also do it in the topgame 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.920
 make the price and everything in the pot so 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.170
 of course it's off or something in this 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.860
 boiled water you make your two 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.210
 powder in girl powder gelantine pure 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.620
 then you have to stir that up very quickly 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.530
 We did exactly that 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:26.010
 recycling always talked about a 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:31.470
 a little further now dams up in pink 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:36.480
 dots the magic potion bibi and tina am 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:39.290
 So you should do the whole thing 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.640
 let it rest for a while now 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.870
 social media to prevent the now 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.750
 come through this whole routine 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.100
 but we complain or so 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.290
 usually that's just five 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.210
 minutes if you take it with you now 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.370
 that you have made wide then you will 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.750
 now, so to speak, ready or could 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.459
 add another pizza sweetener and 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.570
 it would then already in the form 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.400
 Just take ice cubes here 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.150
 is still to come yet for 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.280
 foreign homeland 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.980
 we do it today we do it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.450
 yogi yoghurt gum job board came and 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.290
 that's why there is a bit more 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.110
 I like yogurt, for example 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.280
 Quite often with lean quark and we 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.600
 take 100 grams here 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.760
 it's a little over 30 or me 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.510
 also thought that less but on each 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.950
 case looks really good 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.560
 yes a little more then we have 100 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.430
 grams of the 500 and now we will 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.989
 just stir again 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.480
 so now a bit yogurt 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.830
 we would be more moderate now 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.920
 actually only a parachute 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.020
 film and then that's about 34 hours 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.950
 in the fridge let it there too 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.209
 a cool consistency gets exactly 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.860
 do not have any praline molds now 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.090
 ice cube sourcing still i think so 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.209
 works just as well at home totally 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.989
 I have such a heart shape at home 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.849
 that's pretty cute you can do it 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.989
 nice for your guests still on the table 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.459
 put in heart shape 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.549
 but that's really delicious smells 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:17.949
 but extremely delicious after the rest purely 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:22.780
 no, there are only four left 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:25.240
 we are the part then we are already 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.860
 you see, you can do it so fast 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.280
 we put it in the fridge now 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.350
 and the delicious yoghurt gums too 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.120
 like some night just from television 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.889
 so can it be and 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.840
 Actually we have out for you 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.840

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.419
 We see what they look like 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.570
 for you the fast method and also 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.700
 If the trick alinas trick demonstrated 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.039
 We just do not wait 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.710
 you have a total act with it too 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.620
 looks like they are her look that can 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.320
 It was great for guests 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.820
 to set up or for evenings and you 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.470
 see they are already fixed the now 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.300
 really only wait a three hours 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.510
 the long only a half short 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:16.270
 hour to ask but they are already 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:19.060
 they are already full you have to go too 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.470
 long that you have the consistency with the 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.180
 Of course, yogurt can provide more 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.130
 yogurt now you can see the window 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.990
 But there are also people my friend 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:30.639
 For example, the maxi if you have one 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:33.760
 a little softer have to experiment 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:37.289
 It's really delicious after all 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.340
 It is really quite great recipe 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.720
