00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
want to do this in phases so it kind of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.460

blends<00:01:29.210> up<00:01:29.360> real<00:01:29.570> nice<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.050> what<00:01:30.170> I'll<00:01:30.290> do<00:01:30.440> is

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
blends up real nice so what I'll do is

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.680 
blends up real nice so what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:30.650> put<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.890> oranges<00:01:31.340> in<00:01:31.460> first<00:01:31.910> I'll<00:01:32.210> blend

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
it up and then when that kind of gets

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.310 
it up and then when that kind of gets
all<00:01:34.670> liquefied<00:01:35.180> I'll<00:01:35.420> put<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.660> in<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.840> bananas

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
all liquefied I'll put it in the bananas

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.110 
all liquefied I'll put it in the bananas
and<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.190> last<00:01:37.220> step<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.760> i'll<00:01:37.880> throw<00:01:38.090> in

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
and then the last step is i'll throw in

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.060 
and then the last step is i'll throw in
the<00:01:38.270> ice<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:38.750> let's<00:01:39.200> get<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:39.530> started<00:01:39.770> right

the<00:03:03.870> bananas<00:03:04.590> are<00:03:04.680> about<00:03:04.890> 100<00:03:05.280> calories<00:03:05.400> each

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910
