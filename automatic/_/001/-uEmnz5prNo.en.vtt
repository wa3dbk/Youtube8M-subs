there's a number of options for physical

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.870 
there's a number of options for physical
therapy<00:00:07.589> when<00:00:07.770> we're<00:00:07.950> having<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.370> meniscus

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
therapy when we're having a meniscus

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.660 
therapy when we're having a meniscus
patient<00:00:09.480> if<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.349> torn<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.099> meniscus<00:00:11.490> is

patient if it's torn the meniscus is
torn<00:00:11.870> the<00:00:12.870> likelihood<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.349> them<00:00:13.590> having<00:00:13.920> it

repaired<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.519> pretty<00:00:14.790> strong<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.900> doctor

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
repaired is pretty strong so the doctor

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.050 
repaired is pretty strong so the doctor
will<00:00:16.470> often<00:00:16.590> provide<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.279> protocol<00:00:17.789> based

have to consider first of all the fact
that<00:00:33.660> there's<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.020> tear<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.500> there<00:00:34.649> got<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.250> be

that there's a tear in there got to be
real<00:00:35.670> careful<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> conservative<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.870> the

real careful and conservative in the
beginning<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.559> typically<00:00:37.890> use<00:00:37.980> as

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
beginning and we typically use as

lot of pain and a lot of swelling and
those<00:00:47.640> first<00:00:47.910> few<00:00:48.030> days<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.300> crucial<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.899> turn

those first few days of crucial to turn

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.720 
those first few days of crucial to turn
off<00:00:49.469> some<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.800> pain<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> swelling<00:00:50.430> so

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
off some of that pain and swelling so

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.760 
off some of that pain and swelling so
with<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> rest<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> ice<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.260> compression

and<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.250> elevation<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.449> will<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.230> be

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and the elevation that will really be

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.529 
and the elevation that will really be
helpful<00:00:55.649> those<00:00:55.920> first<00:00:56.190> few<00:00:56.340> days<00:00:56.520> once<00:00:57.300> there

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
start returning to functional exercises

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.830 
start returning to functional exercises

level exercise that you want to wait
till<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.980> end<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> recovery

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
till the end of the of the recovery

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.290 
till the end of the of the recovery
process<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.080> work<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:17.160> really<00:02:17.370> challenges

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
process to work on it really challenges

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.509 
process to work on it really challenges
your<00:02:18.420> muscles<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.900> your<00:02:19.050> legs<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.440> work<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:20.400> a

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
your muscles of your legs to work in a

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.280 
your muscles of your legs to work in a
functional<00:02:21.030> manner<00:02:21.209> because<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:21.840> spend<00:02:22.170> most

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
functional manner because we spend most

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.290 
functional manner because we spend most
of<00:02:22.470> our<00:02:22.590> days<00:02:22.830> getting<00:02:23.459> up<00:02:23.550> from<00:02:23.670> chairs<00:02:24.030> or

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
of our days getting up from chairs or

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.630 
of our days getting up from chairs or
going<00:02:24.569> down<00:02:24.750> stairs<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.530> these<00:02:26.010> exercises

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
going down stairs so these exercises

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.860 
going down stairs so these exercises
really<00:02:26.790> allow<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.120> muscles<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.720> work

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
really allow the muscles to work

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.080 
really allow the muscles to work
functionally<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.370> four<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.760> six<00:02:29.790> week

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
functionally so it's a four to six week

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.600 
functionally so it's a four to six week

then usually the doctor will tell us

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.350 
then usually the doctor will tell us
sort<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.739> where<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.129> go<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.549> when<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:42.030> terms<00:02:42.180> of
