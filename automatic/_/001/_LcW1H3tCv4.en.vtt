00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.520
 hello how are we going to teach 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:11.370
 today is like changing the port of our 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.370
 remote desktop me here I have 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:19.340
 a virtualized server with server 2003 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:23.320
 and with virtualization guards and what 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.420
 let's do my main 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.420
 is to go 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.210
 ah 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.150
 beginnings in the bonus will go to the beginning 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.280
 as if to execute 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.280
 let's write edit 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.310
 edit 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.829
 and let's go to where it says local 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.870
 maximum 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.870
 let's open the tab 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.970
 I'm going to click on the most 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.040
 let's click on system let's 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.350
 open the max 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.280
 let's find where it says current 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.280
 control set 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.130
 also click on weapons 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.630
 let's click on control also in 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.299
 that in the most 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.810
 let's find a term for a beer 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.320
 to find it and we're also going to do 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.320
 click on more 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.510
 then let's go to a new stadium 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.180
 your station folders 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:43.540
 and we can click on more and we're going to 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.540
 look for the rpp folder and 11 sp 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.040
 let's open a little to make it look 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.860
 best 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.330
 in rpp tcp 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.450
 we click on the folder and look for the 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.450
 file called port bloomberg 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.110
 the file 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.100
 the file 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.100
 let's double click 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:18.980
 and we will give a value the decimal hexa 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.620
 I'm going to click on unequal and not 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.780
 give a value that is the default port 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.360
 that I will write whenever it is the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.190
 remote desktop that we are going to 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.110
 place and its code a new port that 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.130
 it has to be 4 digits in my case I 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.600
 I will place for example 81 25 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.600
 and that lesson of you index of 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.490
 four digits if once placed the 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.130
 port let's click again on 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.680
 unequal extra to give us a value 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.319
 in unequal exa and we're going to click on 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.090
 to accept 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.890
 we are going to close everything and we are going to restart 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.090
 the team 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.510
 to pay and we're going to click on rabat in 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.490
 restart but 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.810
 initiated 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.810
 and let's see it 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.120
 I'm going to pass the video so it's not too late 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.120
 so much 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.740
 good 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.710
 once 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.210
 we have the team restarted us 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.060
 let's direct our main team 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.750
 and we're going to do let's go through the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.750
 remote criterion 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.090
 let's put the felipe our 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.810
 our gps or virtual servers in this 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.460
 case 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.780
 filipe miles 200 points according to 18.58 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.580
 point 83 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.700
 two points by 31-25 the normal port and 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.819
 you enter opponents perfectly 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.580
 conscious and 125 you settled we closed no 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.510
 you're going to try and take out the port with 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.489
 the cage port 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.400
 and he's going to tell us that the team where 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.519
 can connect perfect we close 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.070
 then and well this more than anything is 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.740
 for a security issue 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.389
 there are people that certain programs exist 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.420
 what do I have then look for 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:33.600
 and shoot blue screens and so on 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:37.529
 but good with this you're going to avoid that 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.529
 maybe it's going to be less 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:43.739
 it's not going to be that fast because it's going to 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:46.259
 cost you more to hacker who loves you not 

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:48.539
 has the server or in addition to having to 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.329
 be scanning ports and so on 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:55.709
 well that was it and I hope you have 

00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:58.849
 enjoyed and do not learn something something like 

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:58.849
 goodbye days
