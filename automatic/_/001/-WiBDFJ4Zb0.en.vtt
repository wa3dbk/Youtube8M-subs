these<00:00:27.960> tips<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.619> really<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.449> women<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.599> are

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
these tips are really for women that are

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.540 
these tips are really for women that are
transitioning<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:31.740> stretching<00:00:32.399> their

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
transitioning or stretching their

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.299 
transitioning or stretching their
relaxers<00:00:33.149> because<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.140> hardest<00:00:34.590> part<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
relaxers because the hardest part of

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.869 
relaxers because the hardest part of
doing<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:37.489> maintaining<00:00:38.489> those<00:00:38.610> two

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
doing so is maintaining those two

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.430 
doing so is maintaining those two
textures<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.899> you're<00:00:40.020> not<00:00:40.140> careful

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
textures because if you're not careful

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440 
textures because if you're not careful
you<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.100> breakage<00:00:41.579> right<00:00:41.940> where<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
you will get breakage right where the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.940 
you will get breakage right where the
straight<00:00:42.750> hair<00:00:42.960> meets<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:43.770> natural

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
straight hair meets with your natural

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310 
straight hair meets with your natural
texture<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.059> hardest<00:00:45.450> thing<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.809> especially

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
texture the hardest thing is especially
