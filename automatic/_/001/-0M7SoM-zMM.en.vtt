tutorial this is a minecraft tutorial on
the<00:00:07.480> fact<00:00:07.720> that<00:00:07.840> I<00:00:07.960> built<00:00:08.290> a<00:00:08.440> cottage<00:00:08.740> last

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130 
the fact that I built a cottage last

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.640 
the fact that I built a cottage last
week<00:00:09.460> and<00:00:09.760> I<00:00:10.390> built<00:00:10.570> a<00:00:10.660> fireplace<00:00:10.900> and<00:00:11.470> how<00:00:11.590> to

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
week and I built a fireplace and how to

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.710 
week and I built a fireplace and how to
fire<00:00:11.950> burning<00:00:12.370> in<00:00:12.460> and<00:00:12.610> I<00:00:12.730> used<00:00:12.970> netherrack

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:13.720 
fire burning in and I used netherrack

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.410 
fire burning in and I used netherrack
this<00:00:14.710> is<00:00:14.860> where<00:00:15.070> you<00:00:15.250> get<00:00:15.400> netherrack<00:00:16.000> from

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
this is where you get netherrack from

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.220 
this is where you get netherrack from
this<00:00:16.990> is<00:00:17.170> a<00:00:17.200> portal<00:00:18.010> to<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.430> nether

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
this is a portal to the nether

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.750 
this is a portal to the nether
essentially<00:00:20.230> it<00:00:20.380> is<00:00:20.500> a<00:00:20.530> portal<00:00:20.980> to<00:00:21.160> Hell<00:00:21.430> and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
essentially it is a portal to Hell and

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.880 
essentially it is a portal to Hell and
this<00:00:22.390> is<00:00:22.570> where<00:00:22.750> you<00:00:22.900> would<00:00:23.050> get<00:00:23.170> netherrack

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
this is where you would get netherrack

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.279 
this is where you would get netherrack
so<00:00:24.490> let's<00:00:24.699> jump<00:00:24.910> into<00:00:25.240> it<00:00:25.270> i'll<00:00:25.900> show<00:00:25.990> you<00:00:26.170> how

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
so let's jump into it i'll show you how

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.599 
so let's jump into it i'll show you how
to<00:00:26.350> make<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.619> portal<00:00:26.920> in<00:00:27.039> a<00:00:27.130> second<00:00:27.520> I

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
to make the portal in a second I

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.580 
to make the portal in a second I
actually<00:00:27.760> jumped<00:00:28.119> right<00:00:28.300> through<00:00:28.600> it<00:00:28.750> stop<00:00:29.410> in

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
actually jumped right through it stop in

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.099 
actually jumped right through it stop in
the<00:00:29.650> middle<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.910> then<00:00:31.029> you<00:00:31.060> do<00:00:31.840> the<00:00:31.990> little

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:32.109 
the middle and then you do the little

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.479 
the middle and then you do the little
time<00:00:32.529> warping

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.180 

so<00:00:36.149> we're<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> nether<00:00:36.809> now<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.010> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
so we're in the nether now and this is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 
so we're in the nether now and this is
essentially<00:00:38.940> hell

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
essentially hell

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.950 
essentially hell
lots<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.710> lava<00:00:40.980> lots<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.850> Red<00:00:42.110> Rock<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:45.510> goes<00:00:45.690> on

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
lots of lava lots of Red Rock it goes on

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.770 
lots of lava lots of Red Rock it goes on
and<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.210> we're<00:00:48.360> after<00:00:48.540> is

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and on and on so what we're after is

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.970 
and on and on so what we're after is
this<00:00:49.170> Red<00:00:49.440> Rock

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this Red Rock

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.170 
this Red Rock
and<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.850> use<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.720> pick<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.970> hit<00:00:54.150> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and if you use your pick I just hit it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.069 
and if you use your pick I just hit it
once<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> diamond<00:00:55.680> pick<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.850> I've<00:00:57.780> got<00:00:58.050> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
once with a diamond pick and I've got a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.500 
once with a diamond pick and I've got a
piece<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.710> let's<00:00:59.250> go<00:00:59.370> back<00:00:59.399> into<00:00:59.970> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
piece of it so let's go back into the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.630 
piece of it so let's go back into the
real<00:01:00.839> world<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.860> we'll<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:07.979> back<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
real world so we'll go back here and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.790 
real world so we'll go back here and
I'll<00:01:08.850> show<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.140> stuff<00:01:10.350> catches

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
I'll show you that this stuff catches

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.410 
I'll show you that this stuff catches
fire<00:01:11.270> we'll<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.570> right<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:14.420> to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
fire we'll put it right there and to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.590 
fire we'll put it right there and to
light<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.050> need<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.470> make<00:01:16.979> flint<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.910> steel

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
light it we need to make flint and steel

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.889 
light it we need to make flint and steel
so<00:01:18.720> here's<00:01:19.080> steel<00:01:19.759> here's<00:01:20.759> flint<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.390> there's

the rock that you get from when you pour
water<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.660> lava<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:24.180> we'll<00:02:24.510> get<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.260> a

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
water on lava and we'll get to it in a

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.430 
water on lava and we'll get to it in a
second<00:02:26.269> believe<00:02:27.269> it's<00:02:27.420> down<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:27.810> way<00:02:28.049> I

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
second believe it's down this way I

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.699 
second believe it's down this way I
marked<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:28.980> with<00:02:29.010> some<00:02:29.250> torches<00:02:29.549> you<00:02:30.709> just

marked it with some torches you just
have<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.890> be<00:02:32.010> careful<00:02:32.220> there's<00:02:32.730> up<00:02:32.910> sitting

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
have to be careful there's up sitting

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.870 
have to be careful there's up sitting
right<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:33.660> there's<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:34.680> lava<00:02:34.890> water<00:02:35.700> is

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
right there there's your lava water is

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.400 
right there there's your lava water is
pouring<00:02:36.090> onto<00:02:36.299> this<00:02:36.540> lava<00:02:36.720> which<00:02:37.049> turn<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
pouring onto this lava which turn it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.410 
pouring onto this lava which turn it
into<00:02:37.530> his<00:02:37.620> obsidian<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.150> have<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.329> be

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
into his obsidian you just have to be

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.729 
into his obsidian you just have to be
really<00:02:39.630> careful<00:02:39.840> when<00:02:40.200> you're<00:02:40.320> digging<00:02:40.500> this

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
really careful when you're digging this

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.130 
really careful when you're digging this
stuff<00:02:40.980> up<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:42.019> I<00:02:43.160> think<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.280> put<00:02:44.699> some

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
stuff up that I think I put some

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.050 
stuff up that I think I put some
oh<00:02:47.420> we've<00:02:48.420> got<00:02:48.450> some<00:02:48.569> guys<00:02:48.810> burning<00:02:49.110> up<00:02:49.319> cool

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
oh we've got some guys burning up cool

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.430 
oh we've got some guys burning up cool
so<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.300> be<00:02:51.390> careful<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:51.780> if<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.170> dug

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
so you have to be careful like if I dug

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.559 
so you have to be careful like if I dug
this<00:02:52.680> out<00:02:52.950> right<00:02:53.190> now<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.670> would<00:02:53.819> fall<00:02:54.120> into

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
this out right now it would fall into

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.110 
this out right now it would fall into
the<00:02:54.660> lava<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.620> what<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.459> have<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.640> do<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.850> try

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the lava so what you have to do is try

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.330 
the lava so what you have to do is try
to<00:02:57.150> put<00:02:57.660> some<00:02:57.900> rock<00:02:58.170> underneath<00:02:58.740> it<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.160> that

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
to put some rock underneath it so that

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.309 
to put some rock underneath it so that
when<00:02:59.490> that<00:02:59.580> piece<00:02:59.880> Falls<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.420> doesn't<00:03:00.690> go<00:03:00.810> into

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
when that piece Falls it doesn't go into

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.059 
when that piece Falls it doesn't go into
the<00:03:01.560> lava

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
the lava

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.070 
the lava
I<00:03:02.100> guess<00:03:02.760> I'll<00:03:02.910> quickly<00:03:03.120> show<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.870> if<00:03:06.959> you

I guess I'll quickly show you and if you

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.600 
I guess I'll quickly show you and if you
don't<00:03:07.350> use<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> diamond<00:03:08.070> pick<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.340> dig<00:03:08.520> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
don't use a diamond pick to dig the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.670 
don't use a diamond pick to dig the
stuff<00:03:08.820> out<00:03:09.060> yeah<00:03:09.420> you'll<00:03:09.840> be<00:03:10.020> here<00:03:10.230> for<00:03:10.410> quite

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
stuff out yeah you'll be here for quite

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680 
stuff out yeah you'll be here for quite
a<00:03:10.740> while<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.340> think

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
a while I think

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.960 
a while I think
there<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.620> go<00:03:13.739> see<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:14.160> lost<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:14.700> piece

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
there you go see I just lost that piece

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.560 
there you go see I just lost that piece
I<00:03:15.180> believe<00:03:15.510> there's<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.780> piece<00:03:16.130> under<00:03:17.130> here<00:03:17.570> and

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
I believe there's a piece under here and

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.660 
I believe there's a piece under here and
we<00:03:18.660> need<00:03:18.810> 14<00:03:19.560> pieces<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:22.400> don't<00:03:23.400> think<00:03:23.520> there's

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
we need 14 pieces I don't think there's

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.720 
we need 14 pieces I don't think there's
any<00:03:23.820> lava<00:03:24.090> underneath<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.660> piece<00:03:25.730> yeah

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
any lava underneath this piece yeah

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.030 
any lava underneath this piece yeah
there<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:28.640> anyway<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:29.970> what<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:30.480> have<00:03:31.040> just

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
there is so anyway so what we have just

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.350 
there is so anyway so what we have just
pick<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.459> out<00:03:32.640> because<00:03:32.760> I'm<00:03:32.880> keep<00:03:33.120> hitting

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
pick that out because I'm keep hitting

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.720 
pick that out because I'm keep hitting
my<00:03:33.450> head<00:03:33.570> on<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:38.190> we'll<00:03:38.280> dig<00:03:38.459> out<00:03:38.580> this

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
my head on it so we'll dig out this

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.400 
my head on it so we'll dig out this
piece<00:03:38.940> then<00:03:39.209> we'll<00:03:39.330> grab<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:39.600> just<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.230> show

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410
