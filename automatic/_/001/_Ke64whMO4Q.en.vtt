enough for me to try out the new set of

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.740 
enough for me to try out the new set of
rest<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.650> pick<00:00:13.860> up<00:00:14.040> at<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.309> store<00:00:14.429> today<00:00:14.790> so

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
rest and I pick up at the store today so

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.880 
rest and I pick up at the store today so
let's<00:00:15.929> get<00:00:16.049> started<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:18.410> didn't<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.619> want<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
let's get started I didn't just want to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.470 
let's get started I didn't just want to
put<00:00:20.039> up<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> plane<00:00:20.460> board<00:00:20.760> onto<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.150> front

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
put up the plane board onto the front

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.050 
put up the plane board onto the front
door<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> figured<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:23.010> bone<00:00:23.369> shaped<00:00:23.760> board

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
door so I figured a bone shaped board

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.060 
door so I figured a bone shaped board
would<00:00:24.390> be<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> nice<00:00:24.810> thing<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.289> dog<00:00:25.710> leashes

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
would be a nice thing for dog leashes

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.730 
would be a nice thing for dog leashes
and<00:00:26.130> car<00:00:26.430> keys<00:00:29.599> first<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.810> glued<00:00:31.109> together<00:00:31.320> two

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
and car keys first I glued together two

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
and car keys first I glued together two
half-inch<00:00:32.279> boards<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.180> got<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> dollar

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
half-inch boards that I got for a dollar

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:49.850 
half-inch boards that I got for a dollar
piece<00:00:34.230> at<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.010> store<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:48.350> drew<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.530> design<00:00:49.829> on

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
piece at the store I drew the design on

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.910 
piece at the store I drew the design on
before<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> glued<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.030> together<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.649> can

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
before I glued them together so I can

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:15.840 
before I glued them together so I can
start<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.340> by<00:00:53.550> cutting<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> out

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.520 

as<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:16.970> can<00:01:17.120> see<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.630> rough<00:01:17.780> cut<00:01:17.810> out<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.350> done

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
as you can see the rough cut out is done

00:01:18.530 --> 00:02:13.580 
as you can see the rough cut out is done
so<00:01:19.070> let's<00:01:19.250> start<00:01:19.460> shaping<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.030> thing

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.170 

on<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.709> back<00:02:14.860> side<00:02:14.890> I'm<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.519> using<00:02:15.760> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
on the back side I'm just using the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:33.560 
on the back side I'm just using the
router<00:02:16.390> with<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> roundover<00:02:17.140> bit

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:42.900 

so<00:02:34.570> that's<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.930> front<00:02:35.170> side<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:41.730> that's<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
so that's the front side and that's the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:03:26.360 
so that's the front side and that's the
back<00:02:43.060> side<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.140> get<00:02:50.320> more<00:02:50.530> sailing<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.040> do

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:41.300 

so<00:03:27.370> first<00:03:27.610> I'm<00:03:27.850> mark<00:03:28.060> in<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.270> middle<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:34.380> then

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.700 

mark<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> spots<00:03:42.880> where<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.330> want<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.780> parents

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
mark the spots where I want the parents

00:03:44.710 --> 00:04:15.280 
mark the spots where I want the parents
to<00:03:45.040> go

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.300 

actually<00:04:16.290> I<00:04:16.350> wanted<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.709> build<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.040> hangers

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
actually I wanted to build the hangers

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.460 
actually I wanted to build the hangers
myself<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.150> saw<00:04:18.480> those<00:04:18.810> stainless<00:04:19.440> steel

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
myself but I saw those stainless steel

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.890 
myself but I saw those stainless steel
ones<00:04:19.920> at<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.220> hardware<00:04:20.459> store<00:04:20.610> and<00:04:20.900> figured

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
ones at the hardware store and figured

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.630 
ones at the hardware store and figured
they'd<00:04:22.019> come<00:04:22.230> in<00:04:22.260> pretty<00:04:22.530> handy<00:04:22.620> since<00:04:23.220> direct

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
they'd come in pretty handy since direct

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.040 
they'd come in pretty handy since direct
is<00:04:23.730> going<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.000> hang<00:04:24.120> on<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.420> apartment<00:04:24.780> door

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
is going to hang on the apartment door

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.440 
is going to hang on the apartment door
and<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:26.370> little<00:04:26.550> tip<00:04:26.790> is<00:04:26.940> going<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.180> prevent

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
and this little tip is going to prevent

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.210 
and this little tip is going to prevent
keys<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.200> leashes<00:04:28.440> from<00:04:28.800> falling<00:04:29.130> off

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
keys and the leashes from falling off

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:48.689 
keys and the leashes from falling off
when<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.640> close<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:29.880> from<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.270> outside

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.759 

I'm<00:04:49.699> putting<00:04:50.029> shallow<00:04:50.239> holds<00:04:50.659> in<00:04:50.809> the<00:04:50.869> bags<00:04:51.169> so

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:51.769 
I'm putting shallow holds in the bags so

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:54.129 
I'm putting shallow holds in the bags so
that<00:04:52.129> the<00:04:52.489> screw<00:04:52.729> is<00:04:52.969> underneath<00:04:53.539> the<00:04:53.929> surface

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
that the screw is underneath the surface

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:24.009 
that the screw is underneath the surface
and<00:04:54.649> doesn't<00:04:54.949> scratch<00:04:55.129> the<00:04:55.369> door<00:05:22.779> so<00:05:23.779> that's

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:24.019 
and doesn't scratch the door so that's

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:25.929 
and doesn't scratch the door so that's
it<00:05:24.199> already<00:05:24.949> and<00:05:24.979> smells<00:05:25.309> a<00:05:25.519> little<00:05:25.639> bit<00:05:25.849> of

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:25.939 
it already and smells a little bit of

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:54.679 
it already and smells a little bit of
paint

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:54.689 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.569 

so<00:05:55.689> I<00:05:55.719> attached<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.169> hangers<00:05:56.679> to<00:05:56.979> for<00:05:57.459> the

00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:57.579 
so I attached the hangers to for the

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:00.359 
so I attached the hangers to for the
leashes<00:05:57.759> one<00:05:58.689> for<00:05:58.929> the<00:05:59.019> keys<00:05:59.229> and<00:05:59.739> one<00:06:00.069> for<00:06:00.309> the

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:00.369 
leashes one for the keys and one for the

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:04.889 
leashes one for the keys and one for the
nighttime<00:06:00.819> collars<00:06:01.559> I<00:06:03.239> put<00:06:04.239> felt<00:06:04.479> on<00:06:04.629> the<00:06:04.719> back

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:04.899 
nighttime collars I put felt on the back

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:06.979 
nighttime collars I put felt on the back
so<00:06:05.229> it<00:06:05.319> doesn't<00:06:05.589> scratch<00:06:05.739> the<00:06:05.979> front<00:06:06.189> door<00:06:06.459> and

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:06.989 
so it doesn't scratch the front door and

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:09.689 
so it doesn't scratch the front door and
put<00:06:07.989> also<00:06:08.499> those<00:06:08.709> stainless<00:06:09.399> steel

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
put also those stainless steel

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.599 
put also those stainless steel
hangers-on<00:06:10.539> so<00:06:11.409> you<00:06:11.499> can<00:06:11.739> just<00:06:12.099> hang<00:06:12.429> it<00:06:12.519> over

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:12.609 
hangers-on so you can just hang it over

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:31.079 
hangers-on so you can just hang it over
the<00:06:12.759> front<00:06:13.089> door<00:06:29.489> so<00:06:30.489> here<00:06:30.699> is<00:06:30.729> the<00:06:30.939> finished

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:31.089 
the front door so here is the finished
