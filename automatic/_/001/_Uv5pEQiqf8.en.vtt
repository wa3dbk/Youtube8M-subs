00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 now we talk 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.980
 path 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.760
 What's up with kids here in general? 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.539
 new with a little trick to get on 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.690
 above a spot on the terminal map in 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:22.320
 modern warfare 3 and what we need is 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.360
 the shield the red cuckoo made and the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 drone of recognition then we have 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.160
 to do the trick this one for the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.750
 I know people who I recommend you 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.989
 you put in the configuration of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.240
 buttons in the tactic and what you have 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.310
 what to do is give the circle and r2 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.690
 normally that of people who do it very 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.420
 quickly circle two but I 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:51.600
 I recommend doing it circle r2 well with 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:55.870
 that speed and a second circle r2d2 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.760
 and you see there and I go up and there I am up is 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.970
 a good example the truth about everything 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.950
 for you 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.739
 and I want to make a story with 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.520
 colleagues or anything 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.340
 and nothing for you to see what 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.580
 or whatever and it can shoot that the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.570
 xalapeÃ±a 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.070
 on the left you can throw 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.600
 and there's nothing but that I'm 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.920
 investigating in dust but there is nothing and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.229
 it costs no weapon for there 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.509
 because you have the chest that leaves us 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:33.369
 jump but not 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:36.290
 if I can jump down there, you see 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.230
 a saint is that he can jump without any 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.180
 problem after doing it quietly 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.530
 and now I'm going to get the drone out of 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.810
 recognition for you to see 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.729
 as you stand when when 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.090
 you have to help your partner to 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.270
 climb here I just pulled out nailing 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.369
 with a red warning and you already have to 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 hang exactly in the bin that 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.759
 wedding and what do you find back to gather 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.979
 you lower it and with your finger if it's over 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.990
 trick to that site I hope that I have 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.360
 liked there are no favorites to subscribe 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.750
 for more tricks and until next time 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.750
 kids
