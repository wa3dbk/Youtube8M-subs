00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.010
 welcome to our educational capsule 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.950
 so today we receive in 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.290
 chantal studio hello in a joy neither 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.550
 cobaty talk to us today 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.300
 today I want to talk about 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.780
 chinchillas then j from two 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.120
 varieties this one is called cloud 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.370
 was infatuated with the mosaic that there 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.530
 it's firedi it's a chinchilla more 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.280
 standard there are about 10 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.320
 varieties of chinchilla the name of a final 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.769
 of this non Spanish which means 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.839
 little monday so it's a small animal 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.339
 who is presented in a jar because 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.040
 that his life in the mountains of chile 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.479
 in the rocky burrows and when we 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.979
 puts in a jar as probes get 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.930
 feel safe it's like 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.640
 were in a burrow and I think 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.460
 that we do not see it then the same principle 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.290
 forbidden if the easel in his 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.880
 terrier they see us but we do not 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.830
 do not see then it's the same principle 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.530
 it's very active that his case since 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.840
 the air and then at the maintenance level the 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.520
 Chinchilla does not ask for much 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.340
 maintenance because we do not want 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.590
 life he will wash by putting a 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.730
 sam dropped shiloh in her baccalaureate she'll get 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.700
 to roll in the sand 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.380
 so 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.000
 it's his way of washing not need 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.329
 cut gray because looking for it there is 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.729
 no grid so it's a small side 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.960
 positive that is nice when we get 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.840
 does not have a lot of flu 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.670
 it's very fun to see at home 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.950
 it's a small animal too that is 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.729
 herbivore since he was since in his 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950
 natural environment 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.990
 he will drink the water after after the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.509
 leaves water from the morning dew 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.610
 ok what does it eat in captivity 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.310
 in captivity they eat me fashion 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.470
 and we buy chila who are leaving 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.200
 enriched with vitamins and it's very 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.980
 important to give them 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.750
 hay and 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.790
 it's needed every day it's 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.190
 very very very good words for for their 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:16.510
 system came out alive they live 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.160
 in the mountains of chile 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.880
 ok in the chile mountains including 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.650
 and without fur with the researchers of 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.760
 mcgill and kill is it done 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.540
 still theoretically it should 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.140
 it's done more by cons there will be a 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.670
 other process that make that because the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.260
 chinchilla when he is stressed is going 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.510
 lose his hair as his main 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.079
 predator to him his legacy in his midst 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.079
 natural 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.610
 man there are predators and that's 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.780
 him who was a sport that is on track 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.000
 to be selection then the daily legacy 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.890
 to catch up with the chinchilla he sees there 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.629
 and they grab the hair to look 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.640
 there is going to drop his hair launched 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.099
 his defense is called that of the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.200
 next hair and as being his part for 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.849
 tip-fir cease about three months 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.019
 and then to make the coats of 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:10.290
 fur that took about 2250 to 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.819
 200 even 250 look for him there for a 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.690
 coat you are going to make the size of the 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.980
 coat so that's it's huge but 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.170
 are affected by the cold 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.780
 no they are affected by the heat 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.659
 be careful about the shots 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.190
 heat or sulo 30 degrees water 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.260
 they can they can die so 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.940
 it's very important to put them in 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.460
 a 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.160
 a place that will not be too hot is 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.450
 also a place where we will not hear 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.800
 too much noise because given that 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:43.490
 is that since there if you put that 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.240
 in your room next to the cage 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.700
 what does it necessarily take 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.860
 have in the cage and what types of 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.490
 cages and recommended here is the title 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.700
 15 convÃ®nmes pet 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.890
 if it is the minimum it is very for me 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.050
 it's very small for them 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.430
 go out when we have a cage like that 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.810
 not give up go out at least once by 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.920
 day so that they can do their 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.810
 activities but you really need them 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.330
 monitor my class who are very very 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.680
 very pink to us what we have is a 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.510
 cap much larger than this 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.670
 which is all metal and that three palis 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.960
 to respect his needs by doing 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.430
 that they like a lot jumped to who is 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.340
 what it's like to learn it in metal 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.250
 yes exactly it's in metal because 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.820
 that he eats the red jersey and the bottom 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.500
 of the cage 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.820
 if you put no offer things to 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.580
 left and pascal mbuku if the 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.760
 apple branches that is clean of 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.120
 wood the bronzes of pomy weapons that 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.560
 made the right bowls because seen 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.660
 we said it was really a big 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.430
 rodents like we could that's it 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.350
 important to take them ceramic or 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.520
 a little wind or do we use 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.440
 bullets as essential to my 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.990
 girls their bedding that we used 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.200
 natural aggregates of wood pellets 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.150
 natural and then metal bowls and 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.710
 then a little bowl of water as only one other 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.120
 we can use for to prevent that 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.770
 the jugs for the alter are they 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.580
 are going to go into their business yes they are going 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.680
 in their entirety for the time being the 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.650
 urine so and because that's not even 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.810
 not soaked in urine but he 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.310
 going to be the two titles a little 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.810
 everywhere but it's very small because that 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.110
 works very well and will play the beautiful 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.320
 history that rages in finishing chantal 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.320
 because you love the look you there 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.630
 I love chinchilla it's a good little 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.160
 pet except that you have to be 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.070
 spent in the beginning when we are at home 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.450
 must be created 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.470
 with the north shanxi it is necessary 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.720
 tame him thank you very much chantal 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.280
 it's exciting this interview with the 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.120
 ch is here and we see each other again during the 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.120
 next capsule
