the power from the to the front and the
rear<00:01:59.240> it's<00:02:00.240> also<00:02:00.479> got<00:02:00.810> fluid<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.829> it's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
rear it's also got fluid in it and it's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.940 
rear it's also got fluid in it and it's
one<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.140> one<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> fluids<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.799> is

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
one of the one of the fluids that is

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.730 
one of the one of the fluids that is
never<00:02:05.280> checked<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:05.909> vehicles<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.719> sits<00:02:07.140> off

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
never checked on vehicles it sits off

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.580 
never checked on vehicles it sits off
and<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:08.310> come<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.810> transfer<00:02:09.810> cases<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.349> tend

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
and they come in transfer cases do tend

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.339 
and they come in transfer cases do tend
to<00:02:10.679> leak<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.160> bit<00:02:11.750> if<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.989> hasn't<00:02:13.170> been

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
to leak a little bit if it hasn't been

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.080 
to leak a little bit if it hasn't been
checked<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.739> years<00:02:14.010> sometimes<00:02:14.340> they're<00:02:15.060> just

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
checked in years sometimes they're just

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.990 
checked in years sometimes they're just
playing<00:02:15.780> empty<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:17.220> know<00:02:17.340> I've<00:02:17.550> replaced

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.280 
owns one of these four-wheel drive
vehicles<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.250> check<00:02:29.780> well<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.230> you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
vehicles so check well you know you

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.350 
vehicles so check well you know you
should<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.830> your<00:02:32.130> car<00:02:32.340> serviced<00:02:32.730> oil

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
should have your car serviced oil

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.040 
should have your car serviced oil
changed<00:02:33.840> at<00:02:34.260> least<00:02:34.290> every<00:02:34.739> 5,000<00:02:35.370> miles<00:02:35.550> and

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
changed at least every 5,000 miles and

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.660 
changed at least every 5,000 miles and
basically<00:02:37.050> if<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.739> haven't<00:02:38.040> done<00:02:38.280> correctly

basically if you haven't done correctly

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.280 
basically if you haven't done correctly
they<00:02:38.880> should<00:02:39.060> check<00:02:39.239> all<00:02:39.390> those<00:02:39.540> fluids<00:02:39.810> both

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
they should check all those fluids both

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.410 
they should check all those fluids both
the<00:02:40.470> differentials<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.850> transfer<00:02:42.269> case

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
the differentials and the transfer case

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.990 
the differentials and the transfer case
so<00:02:43.160> before<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.310> go<00:02:44.459> up<00:02:44.640> into<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.970> mountains

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
of if it's been 5,000 miles you would
