00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.649
 so the base is ready to be honest I do not know 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.769
 will it be possible to pass the first wave with this 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.199
 base but if not then look for something 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.800
 another put some angular 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:23.119
 bases if dobby 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.769
 well let's try see how how 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.470
 heroes 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:33.500
 affects the passage of the wave given that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:38.370
 I have a pumpkin and a pharaoh who 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:42.570
 perfect for the waves now 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:47.360
 let's see anyway further need 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.829
 will improve the town hall and the tower at least 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.239
 rebuild them already of course not 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.500
 enough cathedral for more or less for more 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.590
 less good bases but anyway 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.559
 the fence will also need to be raised at least 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.240
 several levels because at first 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.290
 level of course seriously for that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.320
 I'll have to farm again, nothing 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.140
 don't know dreadfully I don't remember 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.290
 like my first base at first 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 account from what level it started 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.920
 although I probably needed more camps 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.290
 these build at least someone 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.119
 but in any case at least a couple out 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:37.560
 I must pass again, too, will be what 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.450
 then plus so of course punch base 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.950
 my reach 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.200
 Well the archers and then the task will be 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.590
 of course replace the paladin on the arc and 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.689
 [music] 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.810
 improve skill 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:00.119
 kind of because he is now 2 out of 9 and 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:04.320
 only three of you are treated at least 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:08.039
 four out of nine to five turn off so 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:15.470
 when that bases still probably half a year 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:18.379
 or more help or no help 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.319
 this skill 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:28.790
 the pharaoh of reviving where the same bay 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:31.920
 Of course it is understandable and two pass 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.879
 I think I â€™m doing all the heroes until the twentieth 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.640
 level and 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.160
 or give 20 then took another 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.430
 time to try 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:47.069
 pass this wave a3 more precisely completely 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.260
 it is too early to cover for us 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.060
 fence and more or less competent you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.900
 of course the tower also suits her 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.510
 that such here we have the fruit think to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.819
 tomorrow I'll pump a little bit 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.239
 love not and see what of it so far 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.720
 that will cancel because it makes no sense to wait 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:14.000
 all the same and lose look all 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.000
 thank you all
