00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.309
 Hello friends with you Hades and today 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 we will see a mod for minecraft which 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.020
 add us to mystical totems and also 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.420
 I would like to draw your attention to 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.160
 that my skin has changed and I would like to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.980
 ask you to write in the comments 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.349
 he became better or worse for me of course 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.420
 new skin like more since i 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.399
 still put it exactly but 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.710
 let us move on to the fashion already here 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.750
 by the way came out on version 1.8 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.030
 and now about half the mods 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.059
 coming out on this version so we smoothly 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.370
 let's move to version 1.8 here 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.500
 4 types of new totems will be added 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.989
 the first totem is the main totem 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.570
 Kraft it is quite expensive but it is also 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.280
 there is the most expensive totem here and so he 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.410
 only needed to craft 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.500
 the remaining totems we have three more 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.890
 other this totem skeleton totem 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.690
 creeper is the pace of zombies these totems need 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.820
 in order to protect any 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.400
 place or in order to mine loot 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.619
 here let's say we have a house to such here 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.900
 I built a house specifically for review and 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.880
 we have a totem now I will show you how 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.799
 build it for a start we put in 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.540
 lower block ordinary obsidian further 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.700
 choose any article move for example 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.460
 let it be a zombie and put the top block 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.220
 another obsidian near our totem 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.500
 lightning strikes it means the totem is ready 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.350
 and now let's work next set 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.479
 totem against skeletons skeletons broads 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.759
 zip again and put the totem against 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.159
 creeper so let's put it between 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.810
 them all the same and yes somehow strange i 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.090
 I set arson on my whole house from 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.759
 lightning let's we quickly put out 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.280
 I think I blocked my house a little 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.290
 okay it's not so important designer 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.460
 part of it we will leave for later so 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.860
 I have skeletons left 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.930
 and the totem against the creeper is also mine 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.909
 we quickly put out our house 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.009
 so that nothing extra burns out and everything 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.259
 ready now when past our house 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.630
 will pass these mobs them will 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.060
 kill here let's say goes such a zombie 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.310
 really he didn't even have time to go well 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.920
 we will give him that opportunity 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.160
 we mean zombies and then I got out of this 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.410
 his house and the zombies decided that he 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.750
 I kill zombies you're so determined and the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.600
 he starts to approach me i'm afraid of him 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.970
 but here is my totem it simply takes and 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.860
 destroys and by the way some 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.200
 fireworks do not know what it is connected 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.630
 maybe totem rejoices i'm happy 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.640
 and in honor of this server we appear 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.290
 we can use this to kill a huge 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.810
 the number of mobs what some 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.630
 traps for them let's create 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.520
 big big army of mobs army of mobs 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.290
 Well, I think here is such an army to us 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.240
 enough true zombies are missing 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.610
 let's dilute these creepers and 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.830
 skeletons using zombies and here is our 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.200
 army of us starts to attack me and 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.090
 starts killing them with totems 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.790
 so after all they had stones 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.820
 get close but totem destroys them alone 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.310
 after another and the whole army crumbles except 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.680
 these tricky skeletons that remained 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.950
 live well what skeletons you come to me 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.570
 yes he came up and still died well 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.400
 skeleton are you ready to fight them 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.980
 totems and come on well broads he also 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.990
 dying like that 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.720
 Totems mod no longer adds and 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.760
