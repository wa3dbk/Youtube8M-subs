00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.710
 greetings friends of youtube les 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.440
 Hello andy pm 21 and today I want to talk 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.260
 with you on a subject I would like to give 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.210
 my opinion about girls gamers good 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.630
 to start I want to tell you a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.119
 little anecdote when I turned 8 years old 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.119
 Aunt gave me a gift that belonged to me 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.149
 cousin the month came with five games and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.519
 Albert so amazing gift we decided 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.949
 put it immediately to the television and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.410
 play my sister and I had known 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.770
 the new world of videogames 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.420
 I personally felt very happy 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.970
 I remember well that the first game that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.580
 We played was Mario Bros and we passed 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.620
 many hours with my sister the bad is 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.260
 that every time we played we should 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.870
 do it from scratch because ernest does not 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.450
 I kept the games good when passing the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.329
 not even like my sister lost her 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.270
 I liked playing games then I played 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.300
 I had a good time playing double 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.640
 dragon one day my mother told me daughter by 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.130
 why do not you play with the other girls at 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.920
 dolls I told him that was why 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.280
 I liked him and he was happy playing 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.009
 in the 10 she told me the videogames 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.560
 They are only for men and I do not like that 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.259
 you do it because you are a woman and you must 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.600
 play things that are created for you in 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.460
 his moment did not understand well but at 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.429
 growing up I realized that what I had 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.100
 said my mother was macho so 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.530
 I decided to talk to her again, I told them 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.869
 mother remember that you years ago 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.600
 he told me that video games were just 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.420
 for men then let me tell you that 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.209
 is wrong the video games are not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.789
 for a genre therefore I am 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.849
 free to keep playing she told me 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.909
 that not that I did not understand when passing two 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:56.250
 years more they gave me a playstation one 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.860
 and my sister decided to accompany me 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.590
 new to play as they always gave me 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.380
 five games and the first one we play 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.630
 out magnet good returned the discussion with 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.149
 my mother saying that it was only for 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.670
 children and that I had to do more things to 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.860
 my gender I kept insisting that the 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.250
 video games are for all genres 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.070
 good to finish telling you I understood 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.680
 with that if there are not many girls 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.840
 win in this era is because in the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.350
 past it was handled that video games 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.600
 They are only for men, that's why there is 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.600
 one of the reasons of which there 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.660
 few girls gamers and now how are you 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.000
 fashion that many girls do not play it 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.930
 take pictures with the consoles to call 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.510
 attention 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.370
 which is bad besides let's stop 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.980
 discriminate both those that really 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.770
 are girls gamers most of 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.470
 male players tease them 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.200
 treat them less I tell them by 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.840
 experience whenever I played online 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.080
 They will criticize me very much, I missed the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.260
 respect, look, I would like especially 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.930
 there is more respect towards women in that 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.270
 aspect because we all have the right to 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.480
 play freely without us 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.420
 discriminate people let's clarify something 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.610
 guys gamers if there are just that many do not 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.920
 They decide to say it because in some 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.200
 places is still macho 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.959
 remember that the rights of 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.599
 women is a subject that is not yet finished 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.390
 to apply fully we must start 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.480
 changing that aspect and respecting 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.520
 Few girls who are real gamers and 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.890
 to women who take photos with 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.530
 Not all games are false 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.900
 some people talked about men and 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.989
 women photos taken with your game 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.780
 favorite or some special edition game 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.670
 just to teach others what 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.760
 they like those who had trouble getting 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.670
 I for example have a picture with me 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.980
 animates and favorite video game and I did it 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.200
 with the fact that I felt proud 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.410
 of having finished the game and also 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.140
 for teaching my friends the genre of 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.720
 game that I like good I hope you guys 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.390
 have understood why they do not exist 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.910
 many gamers guys and I hope that in the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.209
 future there is not so much discrimination 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.139
 towards the woman in no way and all 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.990
 we can continue playing and having fun 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.689
 good people I leave in your criteria this 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.150
 I just wanted to share with you my 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.879
 opinion and people who know me know 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.310
 that I am one of the people who 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:39.249
 they fight for respect for girls 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.370
 gamers because I am one I am 12 years old 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:44.949
 of playing and I feel happy because of it I have 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.050
 gone through several consoles and in the 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.599
 current events and lack of resources 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.479
 I only have consoles 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:55.029
 laptops i am faithful to mind not them 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.090
 respect and crushes have consoles 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:05:00.639
 homemade good friends I wanted to make this 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.490
 video with my voice so that it would be understood 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.279
 better but accidentally ruined the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.050
 recorder of my cell phone so maybe in 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:10.930
 the future will talk about this again 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.719
 I want to personally thank the 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.330
 creators of video games for giving us a 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:18.490
 new world in which we can be what 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.400
 that in real life we will not be and 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.009
 help us to speed up our mind about 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.589
 all create a healthy vice and at most 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.770
 personal if it were not for video games 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:32.650
 I was not studying engineering 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.500
 because thanks to it I discovered my love 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.509
 towards technology and proudly I 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.389
 I want to keep fighting so that 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:43.330
 gender equality be stronger that 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:46.240
 It was everything I hope you liked the 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.300
 video we'll talk about this topic because 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.610
 I want to clarify many more things I will wait 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.069
 your comments on what you think of this 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.830
 topic and I would like to know which of the 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:01.020
 who watch my videos are friendly players 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.020
 see you until my next video
