would<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.430> defeated<00:02:23.790> nappa

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
would have defeated nappa

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.340 
would have defeated nappa
if<00:02:25.769> Machida<00:02:26.220> hadn't<00:02:26.700> warned<00:02:26.940> him<00:02:27.030> if<00:02:27.350> nappa

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
if Machida hadn't warned him if nappa

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.900 
if Machida hadn't warned him if nappa
cuz<00:02:28.830> he<00:02:28.920> was<00:02:29.010> too<00:02:29.160> cocky<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:29.610> he<00:02:29.700> would<00:02:29.820> have

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
cuz he was too cocky if he would have

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.759 
cuz he was too cocky if he would have
let<00:02:30.030> why<00:02:30.390> am<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.630> not<00:02:30.720> Madonna<00:02:30.989> oh<00:02:31.140> my<00:02:31.320> gosh

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.699 
let why am I not Madonna oh my gosh
if<00:02:32.060> Vegeta<00:02:33.060> hadn't<00:02:33.330> warned<00:02:33.570> nappa<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.380> nappa

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
if Vegeta hadn't warned nappa and nappa

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.080 
if Vegeta hadn't warned nappa and nappa
would<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.010> let<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.190> destructor<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:35.850> hit

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
would have let the destructor just hit

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.210 
would have let the destructor just hit
him<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.900> drillin<00:02:37.230> would<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.470> beat<00:02:37.830> Napa<00:02:38.040> it

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
him the drillin would have beat Napa it

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.259 
him the drillin would have beat Napa it
would<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.459> sliced<00:02:38.730> him<00:02:38.910> right<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.150> half

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
would have like sliced him right in half

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.310 
would have like sliced him right in half
and<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.570> would<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.750> been<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.989> for<00:02:40.019> that

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
and that would have been it for that

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.440 
and that would have been it for that
fight<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.890> if<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.700> weren't<00:02:41.850> for<00:02:41.880> Vegeta<00:02:42.300> there

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
fight so if it weren't for Vegeta there

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.699 
fight so if it weren't for Vegeta there
nappa<00:02:42.870> would<00:02:43.110> have<00:02:43.200> been<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.320> goner<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
nappa would have been a goner and

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.900 
nappa would have been a goner and
curling<00:02:44.160> would<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.340> won<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.489> fight<00:02:44.730> now<00:02:44.850> he

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
curling would have won that fight now he

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.130 
curling would have won that fight now he
probably<00:02:45.180> wouldn't<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.660> beaten<00:02:45.780> Ishida

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
probably wouldn't have beaten Ishida

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.229 
probably wouldn't have beaten Ishida
obviously<00:02:46.650> Vegeta<00:02:47.310> was<00:02:47.430> like<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.760> was<00:02:48.150> on

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
obviously Vegeta was like it was on

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.250 
obviously Vegeta was like it was on
another<00:02:48.330> league<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.959> point<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
another league at that point of the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.370 
another league at that point of the
series<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.959> Crillon<00:02:51.959> would<00:02:52.079> have<00:02:52.200> gotten

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
series so Crillon would have gotten

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.020 
series so Crillon would have gotten
rocked<00:02:52.680> there<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.070> Kofi<00:02:53.370> shows<00:02:53.579> up<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.910> saves

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
rocked there and Kofi shows up and saves

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.600 
rocked there and Kofi shows up and saves
the<00:02:54.209> day<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:55.049> still<00:02:55.410> Krillin<00:02:56.100> takes<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.519> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
you could say at that point the purlins

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.060 
you could say at that point the purlins
does<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.510> damage<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.960> him<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.980> know

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
one's doing well in that fight but

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.790 
one's doing well in that fight but
Crillon<00:05:21.390> is<00:05:21.510> their<00:05:21.720> hit<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:22.260> he's<00:05:22.590> not

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
Crillon is their hit and he's not

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.490 
Crillon is their hit and he's not
winning<00:05:23.070> but<00:05:23.430> he's<00:05:23.940> keeping<00:05:24.120> up<00:05:24.480> just<00:05:25.080> as<00:05:25.260> well

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
winning but he's keeping up just as well

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.340 
winning but he's keeping up just as well
as<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:26.550> Super<00:05:26.880> Saiyans<00:05:27.270> were<00:05:27.480> and<00:05:27.840> that's<00:05:28.230> why

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
as the Super Saiyans were and that's why

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.900 
as the Super Saiyans were and that's why
it's<00:05:28.530> kind<00:05:28.650> of<00:05:28.740> weird<00:05:28.919> because<00:05:29.040> obviously<00:05:29.310> you

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
it's kind of weird because obviously you

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.140 
it's kind of weird because obviously you
know

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
know

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.730 
know
who<00:05:30.630> wish<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.780> say<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.139> Crillon<00:05:31.440> is<00:05:31.560> just

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
who wish to say the Crillon is just

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.960 
who wish to say the Crillon is just
wrong<00:05:31.919> is<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.190> super<00:05:32.430> saying<00:05:32.639> because<00:05:32.820> he's

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
wrong is the super saying because he's

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.200 
wrong is the super saying because he's
clearly<00:05:33.270> not<00:05:34.070> but<00:05:35.070> he's<00:05:35.520> there<00:05:35.760> and<00:05:36.030> he's

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
clearly not but he's there and he's

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.939 
clearly not but he's there and he's

putting in work on the resale Junior's
when<00:05:38.250> everyone<00:05:38.550> else<00:05:38.669> is<00:05:38.940> seemingly<00:05:39.389> you<00:05:39.780> know

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
when everyone else is seemingly you know

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.620 
when everyone else is seemingly you know
struggling<00:05:41.000> no<00:05:42.000> one<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:42.180> there<00:05:42.270> holding<00:05:42.540> his

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
struggling no one is there holding his

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.960 
struggling no one is there holding his
own<00:05:42.810> once<00:05:43.080> again<00:05:43.430> so<00:05:44.430> you<00:05:44.490> know<00:05:44.669> that's<00:05:44.790> a

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
own once again so you know that's a

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.960 
own once again so you know that's a
valid<00:05:45.449> point<00:05:45.600> to<00:05:45.930> makes<00:05:46.139> and<00:05:46.380> then<00:05:47.010> once<00:05:47.639> more

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
valid point to makes and then once more

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.200 
valid point to makes and then once more
in<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.449> booth<00:05:48.690> saga<00:05:49.350> Krillin<00:05:49.940> actually<00:05:50.940> could

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
in the booth saga Krillin actually could

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.110 
in the booth saga Krillin actually could
have<00:05:51.300> killed<00:05:51.570> boo<00:05:51.840> I<00:05:52.110> mean<00:05:52.290> technically<00:05:53.120> he

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
have killed boo I mean technically he

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.120 
have killed boo I mean technically he
got<00:05:54.300> a<00:05:54.330> hit<00:05:54.570> on<00:05:54.600> him<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:55.020> he<00:05:55.110> sliced<00:05:55.620> him<00:05:55.860> in<00:05:56.010> a

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
got a hit on him and he sliced him in a

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.850 
got a hit on him and he sliced him in a
few<00:05:56.190> sliced<00:05:56.639> boo<00:05:56.910> in<00:05:57.090> half<00:05:57.300> but<00:05:58.229> obviously

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
few sliced boo in half but obviously

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.950 
few sliced boo in half but obviously
with<00:05:59.100> bruise<00:05:59.340> regeneration<00:06:00.240> powers<00:06:00.660> you<00:06:00.930> know

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
with bruise regeneration powers you know

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.990 
with bruise regeneration powers you know
he<00:06:01.139> didn't<00:06:01.380> die<00:06:01.650> so<00:06:02.370> you<00:06:02.460> can't<00:06:02.639> really<00:06:02.729> say

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
he didn't die so you can't really say

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.170 
he didn't die so you can't really say
that<00:06:03.030> Crillon<00:06:03.539> killed<00:06:04.229> him<00:06:04.350> there<00:06:04.910> but<00:06:05.910> he<00:06:05.970> got

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
that Crillon killed him there but he got

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.960 
that Crillon killed him there but he got
a<00:06:06.210> hit<00:06:06.419> off<00:06:06.479> and<00:06:07.199> actually<00:06:07.760> cut<00:06:08.760> him<00:06:08.850> in<00:06:08.940> half

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
a hit off and actually cut him in half

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.060 
a hit off and actually cut him in half
so<00:06:09.479> if<00:06:09.870> if<00:06:10.139> who<00:06:10.410> hadn't<00:06:10.740> been<00:06:10.830> able<00:06:10.919> to

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
so if if who hadn't been able to

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.770 
so if if who hadn't been able to
regenerate<00:06:11.490> then<00:06:12.300> that<00:06:12.449> would<00:06:12.570> have<00:06:12.600> been<00:06:12.690> a

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
regenerate then that would have been a

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.950 
regenerate then that would have been a
win<00:06:13.229> for<00:06:13.470> Crillon<00:06:13.830> so<00:06:14.010> that's<00:06:14.190> pretty<00:06:14.370> crazy

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
win for Crillon so that's pretty crazy

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.480 
win for Crillon so that's pretty crazy
and<00:06:15.960> you<00:06:16.050> know<00:06:16.080> there's<00:06:16.650> all<00:06:17.160> the<00:06:17.310> other

cry<00:06:37.169> when<00:06:37.380> he's<00:06:37.530> against<00:06:37.889> Kid<00:06:38.099> Buu<00:06:38.280> he's<00:06:38.550> got

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
cry when he's against Kid Buu he's got

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.540 
cry when he's against Kid Buu he's got
the<00:06:38.789> Spirit<00:06:39.060> Bomb<00:06:39.150> and<00:06:39.560> he's<00:06:40.560> all<00:06:40.740> you<00:06:41.190> know<00:06:41.310> oh

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
the Spirit Bomb and he's all you know oh

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.420 
the Spirit Bomb and he's all you know oh
this<00:06:41.910> is<00:06:42.090> worthless<00:06:42.300> we're<00:06:42.720> not<00:06:42.810> gonna<00:06:42.930> win

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
this is worthless we're not gonna win

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.960 
this is worthless we're not gonna win
I'm<00:06:44.720> sad<00:06:45.800> and<00:06:46.800> then<00:06:47.400> he<00:06:47.520> gets<00:06:47.669> all<00:06:47.760> of<00:06:47.880> his

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
I'm sad and then he gets all of his

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.279 
I'm sad and then he gets all of his
power<00:06:48.150> backing<00:06:48.330> his<00:06:48.570> up<00:06:48.690> winning<00:06:48.870> obviously

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:49.289 
power backing his up winning obviously

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.080 
power backing his up winning obviously
cos<00:06:49.440> goes<00:06:49.620> to<00:06:49.740> zero<00:06:50.039> so<00:06:50.099> he's<00:06:50.340> supposed<00:06:50.580> to<00:06:50.700> win

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
cos goes to zero so he's supposed to win

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.550 
cos goes to zero so he's supposed to win
but<00:06:51.300> the<00:06:51.360> point<00:06:51.570> is<00:06:51.690> Crillon<00:06:52.080> never<00:06:52.200> gives<00:06:52.410> up

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
but the point is Crillon never gives up

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.839 
but the point is Crillon never gives up
once<00:06:52.740> he<00:06:52.889> knows<00:06:53.070> he's<00:06:53.310> not<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:53.550> strongest

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 
once he knows he's not the strongest

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.070 
once he knows he's not the strongest
fighter<00:06:54.060> he<00:06:54.300> knows<00:06:54.510> he's<00:06:54.690> pretty<00:06:54.930> weak

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
fighter he knows he's pretty weak

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.420 
fighter he knows he's pretty weak
compared<00:06:55.470> to<00:06:55.500> everyone<00:06:55.770> else<00:06:55.919> but<00:06:56.310> he

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
compared to everyone else but he

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.920 
compared to everyone else but he
continues<00:06:56.940> to<00:06:56.970> fight<00:06:57.330> through<00:06:57.599> all<00:06:57.750> that

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
continues to fight through all that

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.170 
continues to fight through all that
doubt<00:06:58.139> as<00:06:58.440> many<00:06:58.800> times<00:06:59.010> he's<00:06:59.280> been<00:06:59.310> killed<00:06:59.729> he

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
doubt as many times he's been killed he

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.730 
doubt as many times he's been killed he
doesn't<00:07:00.479> follow<00:07:00.630> the<00:07:00.810> Yamcha<00:07:01.320> route<00:07:01.500> and<00:07:01.650> go

doesn't follow the Yamcha route and go

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.050 
doesn't follow the Yamcha route and go

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
himself

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.560 
himself
Krillin<00:07:17.490> is<00:07:17.610> up<00:07:17.760> there<00:07:17.910> because<00:07:18.180> he<00:07:18.330> always

Krillin is up there because he always

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.180 
Krillin is up there because he always
sticks<00:07:18.840> around<00:07:19.050> and<00:07:19.410> he<00:07:19.680> always<00:07:19.830> helps<00:07:20.099> out

sticks around and he always helps out

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.680 
sticks around and he always helps out
his<00:07:20.310> friend<00:07:20.520> and<00:07:20.699> he's<00:07:20.789> absolutely<00:07:21.300> fearless

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690 
his friend and he's absolutely fearless

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.689 
his friend and he's absolutely fearless
even<00:07:21.990> though<00:07:22.139> he's<00:07:22.289> he<00:07:22.949> knows<00:07:22.979> he's<00:07:23.490> probably

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 
even though he's he knows he's probably

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.210 
even though he's he knows he's probably
going<00:07:24.090> to<00:07:24.270> die<00:07:24.419> in<00:07:24.810> every<00:07:25.320> battle

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 
going to die in every battle

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.920 
going to die in every battle
but<00:07:26.820> he<00:07:26.880> goes<00:07:27.060> out<00:07:27.210> there<00:07:27.390> anyway<00:07:27.660> so<00:07:27.720> maybe

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
but he goes out there anyway so maybe

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.850 
but he goes out there anyway so maybe
maybe<00:07:28.170> I<00:07:28.290> don't<00:07:28.350> know<00:07:28.470> maybe<00:07:28.500> he's<00:07:28.740> just

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 
maybe I don't know maybe he's just

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.580 
maybe I don't know maybe he's just
stupid<00:07:29.250> but<00:07:29.750> so<00:07:30.750> that's<00:07:30.900> my<00:07:31.050> theory<00:07:31.290> that's

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
stupid but so that's my theory that's

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.170 
stupid but so that's my theory that's
why<00:07:31.740> I<00:07:31.770> say<00:07:31.980> the<00:07:32.100> Crillon<00:07:32.430> is<00:07:32.520> probably<00:07:32.970> one<00:07:33.150> of

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
why I say the Crillon is probably one of

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.700 
why I say the Crillon is probably one of
the<00:07:33.300> greatest<00:07:33.510> z<00:07:33.750> fighters<00:07:33.960> out<00:07:34.320> of<00:07:34.470> all<00:07:34.680> of
