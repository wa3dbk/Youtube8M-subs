00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.760
 hello your life today is about one 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.280
 brand new protection sniper rifle goll 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.219
 magnum 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.020
 it is so that secondos place for the 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.880
 xbox already exists and there you can 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.540
 Gold mission play for the reduction 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.790
 that brings expansion pack and unfortunately 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.550
 for pc and playstation we have that 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.579
 really get it but it should be in 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.800
 february sometime it will appear 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.219
 no exact date but we all hope 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.149
 very soon with places patch came now 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.499
 but already 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.850
 the secondos rolls weapons into the game 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.739
 probably something like virgin 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.230
 racing because she was intent on it this time 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.469
 or not in any case means 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.179
 that for example the esw knows one 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:58.329
 maybe from battlefield 3 that way 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:59.739
 a machine who does what seems already 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.390
 simply with built in very high 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.729
 Feuerrad has the is already unlockable 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.610
 has to do something with any 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.500
 which vehicles repair because of that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.420
 I am not quite sure about my engineer 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.010
 surely you would have to eat googles 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.910
 red or that's not what it's about 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.310
 but the cucumbers is also with the game 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.020
 and you can not unlock the 200 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.500
 because he is there to make a picture 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.830
 you have to go on caspian border or on 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.160
 Operation firestorm five kills of one 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.290
 tower make a round and as well 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.990
 generally catch up 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.040
 I have to do it all a round then 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.370
 you're gonna get taken bremer 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.690
 So it does not seem to be that difficult 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.540
 but we can do that over the day 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.170
 the maps do not have that nice yet 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.930
 but it is now 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.580
 there is ranked server where all weapons 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.160
 This game is available 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.890
 so that the secondos forest throw 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.970
 this means that you can play the ko 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:03.090
 there you can play the f2000 and the im 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:06.700
 to be something of machine rifle 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.170
 I had no idea about it 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.880
 I of course now on his server 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.870
 I found the European servers 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:18.190
 with a relatively good pink thank you 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.170
 jpy on youtube linking the server 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.920
 had and now I have the club 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.800
 tried magnum and is incredible 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.560
 she is perfect I'm almost 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.190
 So just say the sniper 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.190
 I waited 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.790
 Excited so enthusiastic about stop 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.940
 can be a computer game thing and 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.150
 The weapon is visually similar to the 40 15 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.800
 looks great and she sounds great to me 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.810
 and all the animations hold this somehow 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.870
 So there is loading and next google 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.250
 insert and that is really very good that 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.350
 is somehow right for me 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.900
 can play at that time is in principle 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.010
 Perfect for trainer press frequency 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.000
 game style 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.160
 we do not have any states yet 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.840
 of the effect not yet but you can 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.489
 of course still play called 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.760
 already a lot from one also machines 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.530
 you can play that 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.850
 about estimate and you notice film 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.670
 is based on a very high fire rate 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.769
 probably in the direction of skeleton or 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.420
 like this 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.830
 that is of course excellent and 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.090
 Generally everything feels very fast 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:31.060
 and directly to specially for super and 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.190
 to zoom in on something like that too 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.720
 the animation is slightly different 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.519
 many others and I feel at home 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.110
 a little bit faster has me very short 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.790
 up to 500 was then very cool and 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.010
 fire shooting from the hip shines 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.540
 enough to be ok a couple of kids 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.560
 done with it when I'm there to the opponents 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.790
 was probably similar to the m40 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.790
 not very good about ascot elite 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.330
 bottrop I would say standard by 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.660
 many 81 have almost all is 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.290
 a few weapons besides the vhs and the 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.610
 swr 1 60 the only six meters per second 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.110
 to have 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.400
 and there are a few who would have heard 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:19.120
 actually is not a problem and 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.130
 to judge that for you here so yes 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.980
 I can wait even less now 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.570
 finally it is to play because 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.230
 i think then i would not be the customers 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.270
 give more out of hand and of course 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.330
 she also does well for caspian border 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.880
 his or also metro is playing along 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.970
 in the beginning and generally simple 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.440
 on all maps and and I'm happy 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.150
 very accurate 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.320
 I still want a disadvantage , I still want 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.420
 say she has only five bullets or one 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.700
 directly after Peter then also the 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:57.600
 sixth run in the magazine that under 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.520
 a run or I believe you the 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.350
 Practitioner is also so natural disadvantage 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.350
 will of course be even more blatant and 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.770
 somehow ne ball would have but I think 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.330
 not so bad 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.380
 unlike anything else good 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.920
 is and otherwise 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.090
 maybe too exaggerated if 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.890
 you want to test that or 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.170
 any others thats the word 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.990
 open I leave the link to the server 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.730
 in the description and then we hope 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.640
 Now all hand press the thumb that 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.620
 secondos should be timely 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.090
 february appears when I like that 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.060
 you will like the gameplay 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.580
 if you liked the info or what 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.860
 always do with your thumbs 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.550
 Up there that makes me happy and good for 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.200
 the channel 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.500
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.500
 next time
