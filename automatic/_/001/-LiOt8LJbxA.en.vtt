this<00:00:00.599> has<00:00:00.719> been<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:00.930> pretty<00:00:01.230> hot<00:00:01.560> topic<00:00:02.070> as<00:00:02.220> of

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
this has been a pretty hot topic as of

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.460 
this has been a pretty hot topic as of
late<00:00:02.520> so<00:00:02.760> today<00:00:03.120> I'm<00:00:03.300> going<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.540> give<00:00:03.810> you<00:00:04.110> my

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
late so today I'm going to give you my

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.680 
late so today I'm going to give you my
reasons<00:00:04.680> as<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.160> why<00:00:05.279> we<00:00:05.580> will<00:00:05.700> most<00:00:06.029> likely

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
reasons as to why we will most likely

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.270 
reasons as to why we will most likely
see<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.500> primal<00:00:08.960> repository<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.980> biggest

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
see a primal repository the biggest

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.400 
see a primal repository the biggest
reason<00:00:11.700> as<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.090> why<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:12.540> will<00:00:12.660> most<00:00:12.900> likely<00:00:13.110> see

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
reason as to why we will most likely see

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.740 
reason as to why we will most likely see
a<00:00:13.440> primer<00:00:13.889> or<00:00:14.130> quaza<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.820> well<00:00:15.210> think<00:00:15.480> about<00:00:15.630> it

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
a primer or quaza is well think about it

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.680 
a primer or quaza is well think about it
like<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.980> pokemon<00:00:17.789> emerald<00:00:18.029> when<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.480> saw

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
like and pokemon emerald when you saw

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.000 
like and pokemon emerald when you saw
the<00:00:18.750> cutscene<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.380> all<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.650> there<00:00:19.830> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
the cutscene and all that there it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.070 
the cutscene and all that there it
looked<00:00:20.220> like<00:00:20.400> we're<00:00:20.640> quaza<00:00:20.970> was<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.660> like

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
looked like we're quaza was like like

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.380 
looked like we're quaza was like like
the<00:00:22.410> fought<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.160> father<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.760> he<00:00:24.119> was<00:00:24.240> like

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the fought like a father but he was like

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.620 
the fought like a father but he was like
more<00:00:25.170> powerful<00:00:26.039> than<00:00:26.430> both<00:00:26.760> Groudon<00:00:27.449> and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
more powerful than both Groudon and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.870 
more powerful than both Groudon and
Kyogre<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.920> those<00:00:29.160> guys<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
Kyogre and if those guys are going to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.970 
Kyogre and if those guys are going to
get<00:00:30.119> some<00:00:30.449> sort<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.779> ancient<00:00:30.990> evolution<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
get some sort of ancient evolution and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.040 
get some sort of ancient evolution and
it's<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.340> make<00:00:32.460> them<00:00:32.669> stronger<00:00:33.210> then

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it's going to make them stronger then

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.720 
it's going to make them stronger then
that<00:00:34.290> wouldn't<00:00:34.620> really<00:00:34.800> makes<00:00:35.190> sense<00:00:35.520> if

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that wouldn't really makes sense if

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.530 
that wouldn't really makes sense if
requisite<00:00:36.600> didn't<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:37.020> its<00:00:37.140> own<00:00:37.370> primal

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
requisite didn't get its own primal

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.080 
requisite didn't get its own primal
evolution<00:00:39.540> as<00:00:39.690> well<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:41.850> that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
evolution as well so I really think that

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.330 
evolution as well so I really think that
that's<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.540> big<00:00:42.780> reason<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> why<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.739> there

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that's a big reason as to why that there

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.580 
that's a big reason as to why that there
will<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> primal<00:00:45.120> quaza<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.989> course<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.440> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
will be a primal quaza of course we just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
will be a primal quaza of course we just
haven't<00:00:46.829> heard<00:00:46.980> anything<00:00:47.280> about<00:00:50.809> repository

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
haven't heard anything about repository

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
haven't heard anything about repository
whatnot<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.590> I'll<00:00:52.710> talk<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.430> just

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
whatnot and I'll talk about that in just

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.939 
whatnot and I'll talk about that in just
a<00:00:53.879> second<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> huge<00:00:55.770> fan

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
a second here also it's a huge fan

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.400 
a second here also it's a huge fan
favorite<00:00:56.520> elos<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.969> closet<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> great

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
favorite elos a closet it's a great

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.410 
favorite elos a closet it's a great
Pokemon<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.340> we're<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> lot<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.969> fun<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> use

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
Pokemon it so we're a lot of fun to use

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.470 
Pokemon it so we're a lot of fun to use
as<00:01:00.629> great<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> new<00:01:01.079> verse<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.440> whatnot<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
as great a new verse and whatnot and I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.620 
as great a new verse and whatnot and I
know<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.260> quaza<00:01:04.619> also<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:06.180> might<00:01:06.420> be

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
know I just like quaza also it might be

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.300 
know I just like quaza also it might be
an<00:01:06.720> essential<00:01:06.990> part<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> story<00:01:07.710> line<00:01:08.100> we

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
an essential part to the story line we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.520 
an essential part to the story line we
don't<00:01:08.610> know<00:01:08.970> yet<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.479> now<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.810> could<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.140> in

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
don't know yet right now it could be in

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.870 
don't know yet right now it could be in
a<00:01:10.560> central<00:01:10.860> part<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.159> storyline<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.760> it

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a central part of the storyline and it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.750 
a central part of the storyline and it
probably<00:01:12.180> will<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.290> some<00:01:13.680> significance<00:01:14.549> if

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
probably will have some significance if

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.480 
probably will have some significance if
there<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.360> no<00:01:15.630> Delta<00:01:16.590> emerald<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.189> they're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
there is no Delta emerald and they're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
there is no Delta emerald and they're
most<00:01:17.759> likely<00:01:17.880> will<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> Delta<00:01:19.229> emerald

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
most likely will not be a Delta emerald

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.370 
most likely will not be a Delta emerald
even<00:01:19.950> though<00:01:20.189> Pokemon<00:01:21.049> trademarked<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
even though Pokemon trademarked it and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.929 
even though Pokemon trademarked it and
they<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:22.799> registered<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.759> whatnot

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
they you know registered it and whatnot

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.300 
they you know registered it and whatnot
they<00:01:24.840> probably<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.290> did<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.920> back<00:01:26.280> up

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
they probably just did that as back up

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.969 
they probably just did that as back up
and<00:01:26.790> left<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.450> case<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.960> Pokemon<00:01:28.500> Omega<00:01:28.530> or

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and left in case like Pokemon Omega or

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.140 
and left in case like Pokemon Omega or
being<00:01:29.159> outside<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
being outside for like for the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.719 
being outside for like for the
best-selling<00:01:30.869> games<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.310> eternity

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
best-selling games like of all eternity

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.480 
best-selling games like of all eternity
but<00:01:33.180> anyways<00:01:34.079> let's<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.040> reasons

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
but anyways let's get on to the reasons

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.190 
but anyways let's get on to the reasons
and<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.030> only<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.630> there<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.960> couple

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and the only really there are a couple

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.890 
and the only really there are a couple
of<00:01:37.470> reasons<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.189> why<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:39.270> might<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:39.659> be

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
of reasons as to why there might not be

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.380 
of reasons as to why there might not be
a<00:01:40.320> primal<00:01:40.860> closet<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.820> are<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.000> few<00:01:42.210> reasons

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
a primal closet here are the few reasons

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.749 
a primal closet here are the few reasons
why<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.200> could<00:01:43.590> only<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.640> won't

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
why I could only think that there won't

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.190 
why I could only think that there won't
be<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> primal<00:01:45.390> closet<00:01:45.780> right<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.079> I'm

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
be a primal closet right now I'm

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.170 
be a primal closet right now I'm
thinking<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> eighty<00:01:47.909> percent

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
thinking is it like a eighty percent

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.690 
thinking is it like a eighty percent
chance<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:49.020> will<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.380> one<00:01:49.590> anyways<00:01:50.460> um

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
chance that we will see one anyways um

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.810 
chance that we will see one anyways um
it<00:01:51.570> possibly<00:01:52.290> could<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.920> saved<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:53.490> there<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it possibly could be saved if there is a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.359 
it possibly could be saved if there is a
delta<00:01:54.119> Emeril<00:01:54.630> game<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.070> was

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
delta Emeril game if there really was

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
delta Emeril game if there really was
going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.869> would<00:01:58.079> probably

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
going to be one then it would probably

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.800 
going to be one then it would probably
just<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.579> would<00:01:59.700> probably<00:01:59.909> make<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.360> primal

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
just it would probably make it to primal

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.080 
just it would probably make it to primal
debut<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.409> guess<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> could<00:02:01.770> say<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.250> Delta

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
debut I guess you could say and Delta

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.880 
debut I guess you could say and Delta
emerald<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.079> unlikely<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.680> happen

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
emerald but that is unlikely to happen

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.679 
emerald but that is unlikely to happen
we<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.189> never<00:02:05.610> seen<00:02:05.969> Pokemon<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
we have never seen Pokemon do that

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.440 
we have never seen Pokemon do that
before<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.259> never<00:02:07.700> remade<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.940> sequel

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
before they have never remade a sequel

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.420 
before they have never remade a sequel
so<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.050> don't<00:02:10.590> think<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> happen

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
so I don't think that's going to happen

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.920 
so I don't think that's going to happen
unless

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
unless

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.720 
unless
like<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.349> said<00:02:13.409> Pokemon<00:02:14.069> Omega<00:02:14.099> Ruby<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.670> alpha

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
like I said Pokemon Omega Ruby and alpha

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.910 
like I said Pokemon Omega Ruby and alpha
sapphire<00:02:14.909> does<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.870> well<00:02:16.049> that<00:02:16.349> they<00:02:16.439> want<00:02:16.680> to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
sapphire does so well that they want to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770 
sapphire does so well that they want to
and<00:02:17.159> then<00:02:17.609> that<00:02:18.000> might<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.299> happen<00:02:18.480> because

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
and then that might just happen because

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.750 
and then that might just happen because
remember<00:02:19.170> pokemon<00:02:19.739> ruby<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.099> sapphire<00:02:20.129> were

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
remember pokemon ruby and sapphire were

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.459 
remember pokemon ruby and sapphire were

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
like the best-selling games from pokemon

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.220 
like the best-selling games from pokemon
they<00:02:22.590> did<00:02:22.739> extremely<00:02:23.459> well<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.150> Omega<00:02:25.079> Ruby

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230

really<00:02:27.299> well<00:02:27.450> as<00:02:27.659> well<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.620> not<00:02:29.280> exactly<00:02:29.459> sure

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
really well as well so not exactly sure

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.550 
really well as well so not exactly sure
but<00:02:30.299> I<00:02:30.480> don't<00:02:30.599> think<00:02:31.019> there's<00:02:31.170> going<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:31.439> be<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
but I don't think there's going to be a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.429 
but I don't think there's going to be a
Delta<00:02:31.920> emerald<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:33.030> only<00:02:33.450> other<00:02:33.480> reason<00:02:34.230> as

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
Delta emerald the only other reason as

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.379 
Delta emerald the only other reason as
to<00:02:34.500> why<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:34.829> think<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.370> thing<00:02:35.849> won't<00:02:36.120> get<00:02:36.359> a

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389

to why I think this thing won't get a

primal devolution evolution whatever

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.660 
primal devolution evolution whatever
it's<00:02:39.000> called<00:02:39.209> is<00:02:39.450> because<00:02:40.439> it's<00:02:40.829> completely

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
it's called is because it's completely

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.729 
it's called is because it's completely
unrelated<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.510> story<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:43.079> doesn't<00:02:43.530> matter

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
unrelated to the story it doesn't matter

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.670 
unrelated to the story it doesn't matter
at<00:02:43.950> all<00:02:44.099> it<00:02:44.340> has<00:02:44.730> no<00:02:45.090> significance<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.260> even

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
at all it has no significance but even

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.740 
at all it has no significance but even
if<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.889> doesn't<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.549> any<00:02:47.790> significance<00:02:48.510> it's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
if it doesn't have any significance it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.129 
if it doesn't have any significance it's
still<00:02:49.079> pretty<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:50.060> big<00:02:51.060> legendary<00:02:51.629> pokemon

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
still pretty like big legendary pokemon

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.080 
still pretty like big legendary pokemon
for<00:02:52.319> pokemon<00:02:52.680> ruby<00:02:52.859> and<00:02:53.099> sapphire<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:54.060> I

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
for pokemon ruby and sapphire so I

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.479 
for pokemon ruby and sapphire so I
definitely<00:02:54.359> think<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.079> even<00:02:55.650> if<00:02:55.829> it<00:02:56.010> has<00:02:56.159> no

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
definitely think that even if it has no

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.369 
definitely think that even if it has no
relation<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> story<00:02:57.569> at<00:02:57.689> all<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.260> you

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
relation to the story at all and you

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.440 
relation to the story at all and you
just<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.680> know<00:02:58.709> go<00:02:59.430> catch<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.730> after<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.269> beat

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
just you know go catch it after you beat

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.330 
just you know go catch it after you beat
the<00:03:00.599> e4<00:03:01.019> I<00:03:01.260> still<00:03:01.560> think<00:03:01.590> it's<00:03:01.859> probably<00:03:02.159> going

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the e4 I still think it's probably going

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.780 
the e4 I still think it's probably going
to<00:03:02.400> have<00:03:02.579> a<00:03:03.260> primal<00:03:04.260> form<00:03:04.530> now<00:03:04.980> I'm<00:03:05.310> going<00:03:05.609> to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
to have a primal form now I'm going to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.970 
to have a primal form now I'm going to
explain<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.840> guys<00:03:07.079> as<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.439> why<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.739> haven't

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
explain to you guys as to why we haven't

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.789 
explain to you guys as to why we haven't
heard<00:03:08.010> anything<00:03:08.459> about<00:03:08.930> ricotta<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.319> general

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
heard anything about ricotta in general

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.909 
heard anything about ricotta in general
at<00:03:10.980> all<00:03:11.189> now<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.419> could<00:03:12.810> possibly<00:03:13.409> be<00:03:13.650> wrong

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
at all now I could possibly be wrong

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.129 
at all now I could possibly be wrong
about<00:03:14.159> black<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.790> white<00:03:14.939> but<00:03:15.269> i<00:03:15.480> think<00:03:15.900> i<00:03:16.079> am

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
about black and white but i think i am

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.500 
about black and white but i think i am
correct<00:03:16.500> about<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.739> too<00:03:17.129> but<00:03:17.699> just<00:03:17.909> hear<00:03:18.479> me

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
correct about that too but just hear me

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.649 
correct about that too but just hear me
out<00:03:18.629> on<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> pokemon<00:03:20.040> X&amp;Y<00:03:20.310> we<00:03:21.299> did<00:03:21.479> not

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
out on this for a pokemon X&amp;Y we did not

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.589 
out on this for a pokemon X&amp;Y we did not
know<00:03:21.870> anything<00:03:22.409> about<00:03:22.919> zygarde<00:03:23.459> until<00:03:24.359> we

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
know anything about zygarde until we

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.360 
know anything about zygarde until we
actually<00:03:24.720> went<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.349> go<00:03:25.409> play<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.739> game<00:03:26.069> and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
actually went to go play the game and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.619 
actually went to go play the game and
that's<00:03:26.459> when<00:03:26.729> we<00:03:26.909> all<00:03:27.060> figured<00:03:27.389> out<00:03:27.449> about

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
that's when we all figured out about

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.719 
that's when we all figured out about
zygarde<00:03:28.229> Pokemon<00:03:28.739> did<00:03:28.889> not<00:03:29.040> say<00:03:29.340> anything

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
zygarde Pokemon did not say anything

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.839 
zygarde Pokemon did not say anything

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.789 
about it so and then for black and white
I<00:03:33.150> don't<00:03:33.659> believe<00:03:33.750> we<00:03:34.139> learned<00:03:34.409> anything

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
I don't believe we learned anything

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.280 
I don't believe we learned anything
about<00:03:35.129> kiram<00:03:36.120> i'm<00:03:36.510> not<00:03:36.689> talking<00:03:36.930> about<00:03:36.989> black

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
about kiram i'm not talking about black

about kiram i'm not talking about black
2<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.620> white<00:03:37.769> Tim<00:03:38.040> talking<00:03:38.340> about<00:03:38.459> black<00:03:38.729> and

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
2 and white Tim talking about black and

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.490 
2 and white Tim talking about black and
white<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.389> don't<00:03:39.750> think<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:39.959> learned<00:03:40.109> anything

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
white I don't think we learned anything

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.309 
white I don't think we learned anything
about<00:03:40.680> kiram<00:03:41.189> at<00:03:41.340> all<00:03:41.549> until<00:03:42.449> later<00:03:42.900> on<00:03:43.019> when

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
about kiram at all until later on when

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.539 
about kiram at all until later on when
we<00:03:43.409> played<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.650> game<00:03:43.919> I<00:03:43.949> can't<00:03:44.280> even<00:03:44.400> remember

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
we played the game I can't even remember

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.640 
we played the game I can't even remember
it's<00:03:45.090> been<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.540> long<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.959> don't<00:03:46.019> remember<00:03:46.349> that

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
it's been so long I don't remember that

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.899 
it's been so long I don't remember that
it's<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:46.859> an<00:03:46.979> event<00:03:47.280> or<00:03:47.489> something<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.819> had

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
it's like an event or something you had

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.030 
it's like an event or something you had
to<00:03:47.970> download<00:03:48.209> or<00:03:48.479> whatnot<00:03:48.689> but<00:03:49.439> we<00:03:49.859> didn't

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
to download or whatnot but we didn't

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.469 
to download or whatnot but we didn't
really<00:03:50.099> know<00:03:50.400> much<00:03:50.639> about<00:03:50.699> their<00:03:51.090> legendary

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
really know much about their legendary

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.780 
really know much about their legendary
Pokemon<00:03:51.959> at<00:03:52.109> all<00:03:52.259> which<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.919> very<00:03:53.220> well<00:03:53.459> what

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
Pokemon at all which is very well what

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.429 
Pokemon at all which is very well what
pokemon<00:03:54.389> could<00:03:54.659> be<00:03:54.750> doing<00:03:54.989> right<00:03:55.019> here<00:03:55.169> they

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
pokemon could be doing right here they

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.259 
pokemon could be doing right here they
just<00:03:55.620> want<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.829> save<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.220> for<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.639> know<00:03:56.790> to

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
just want to save it for you know to

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.089 
just want to save it for you know to
play<00:03:57.449> the<00:03:57.599> game<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:57.930> whatnot<00:03:58.290> it's<00:03:58.530> pretty

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
play the game and whatnot it's pretty

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.159 
play the game and whatnot it's pretty
obvious<00:03:59.609> that<00:03:59.639> request<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.540> going<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.989> be<00:04:01.079> in

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
obvious that request is going to be in

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.439 
obvious that request is going to be in
this<00:04:01.319> game<00:04:01.530> I'm<00:04:01.769> almost<00:04:02.099> certain<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:03.090> will<00:04:03.269> be

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
this game I'm almost certain it will be

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.449 
this game I'm almost certain it will be
it's<00:04:04.319> just<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.590> question<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:04.979> whether<00:04:05.189> we'll

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
it's just a question of whether we'll

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.699 
it's just a question of whether we'll
get<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.609> primal<00:04:06.120> evolution<00:04:07.079> or<00:04:07.229> not<00:04:07.379> and<00:04:07.590> I

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
get a primal evolution or not and I

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.229 
get a primal evolution or not and I
definitely<00:04:07.919> think<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.459> there<00:04:08.699> will<00:04:08.849> be<00:04:08.909> one

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
definitely think that there will be one

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.030 
definitely think that there will be one
just<00:04:09.449> because<00:04:09.569> like<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.139> said<00:04:10.199> it<00:04:10.620> really

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
just because like I said it really

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.909 
just because like I said it really
wouldn't<00:04:11.400> make<00:04:11.669> sense<00:04:11.970> at<00:04:12.209> all<00:04:12.389> for<00:04:13.019> Groudon

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
wouldn't make sense at all for Groudon

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.810 
wouldn't make sense at all for Groudon
and<00:04:13.949> Kyogre<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:15.030> have<00:04:15.209> these<00:04:15.590> evolutions

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
and Kyogre to have these evolutions

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.630 
and Kyogre to have these evolutions
then<00:04:17.030> for<00:04:17.650> causing<00:04:18.650> onto<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.040> specially<00:04:19.550> since

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
then for causing onto a specially since

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.850 
then for causing onto a specially since
it<00:04:19.820> like<00:04:20.000> looks<00:04:20.450> like<00:04:20.510> that<00:04:20.900> was<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.680> like

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
it like looks like that was that like

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.790 
it like looks like that was that like
controls<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.940> two<00:04:23.150> not<00:04:23.900> list<00:04:24.440> sir<00:04:24.620> like

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
controls the two not list sir like

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.620 
controls the two not list sir like
controls<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.370> two<00:04:25.520> or<00:04:25.760> has<00:04:25.970> like<00:04:26.180> more

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
controls the two or has like more

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.140 
controls the two or has like more
authority<00:04:27.380> than<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.620> two<00:04:27.890> so<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.520> definitely

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
authority than the two so I definitely

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.910 
authority than the two so I definitely
think<00:04:29.480> that's<00:04:29.660> what's<00:04:29.870> going<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.200> happen<00:04:30.470> like

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
think that's what's going to happen like

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.980 
think that's what's going to happen like
I<00:04:31.100> said<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.580> think<00:04:31.850> Pokemon<00:04:32.270> is<00:04:32.420> just<00:04:32.600> waiting

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
I said I think Pokemon is just waiting

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.630 
I said I think Pokemon is just waiting
for<00:04:33.170> everyone<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.560> play<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.920> game<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.430> then

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
for everyone to play the game and then

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.550 
for everyone to play the game and then
you<00:04:34.820> know<00:04:34.940> we'll<00:04:35.240> end<00:04:35.510> up<00:04:35.570> seeing<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:36.110> primal

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
you know we'll end up seeing a primal

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.910 
you know we'll end up seeing a primal
carazo<00:04:37.010> once<00:04:37.700> we<00:04:38.210> get<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.660> skype<00:04:39.200> iller<00:04:39.530> so

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
carazo once we get to skype iller so

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.860 
carazo once we get to skype iller so
that's<00:04:40.220> what<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:40.430> think<00:04:40.670> I<00:04:41.090> definitely<00:04:41.360> let<00:04:41.720> me

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
that's what I think I definitely let me

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.330 
that's what I think I definitely let me
know<00:04:41.960> what<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.140> guys<00:04:42.230> think<00:04:42.410> about<00:04:42.530> that<00:04:42.920> down

know what you guys think about that down
below<00:04:43.490> in<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:43.760> comment<00:04:44.120> I<00:04:44.270> can't<00:04:44.870> really

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
below in the comment I can't really

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.580 
below in the comment I can't really
think<00:04:45.410> of<00:04:45.650> any<00:04:46.070> other<00:04:46.580> reason<00:04:46.730> as<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.480> why<00:04:48.050> this

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
think of any other reason as to why this

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.370 
think of any other reason as to why this
thing<00:04:48.650> wouldn't<00:04:49.310> get<00:04:49.670> a<00:04:49.850> primal<00:04:50.300> form<00:04:50.540> but<00:04:51.140> I'm

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
thing wouldn't get a primal form but I'm

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.170 
thing wouldn't get a primal form but I'm
pretty<00:04:51.710> certain<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.190> well<00:04:52.430> we're<00:04:52.880> just<00:04:53.060> kind
