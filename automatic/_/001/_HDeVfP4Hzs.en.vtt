00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
obviously it's going to be a little bit

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.549 
obviously it's going to be a little bit
of<00:00:38.420> time<00:00:38.570> before<00:00:38.750> you<00:00:38.960> can<00:00:39.079> actually<00:00:39.199> get<00:00:39.440> on

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.320 
god I've been preparing the same way for
the<00:01:27.979> past<00:01:28.159> years<00:01:28.369> when<00:01:28.549> I<00:01:28.610> playoff<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.119> so

the past years when I playoff you so

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.050 
the past years when I playoff you so
long<00:01:29.509> I<00:01:30.020> think<00:01:30.380> it's<00:01:30.470> really<00:01:30.710> different

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
long I think it's really different

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.160 
long I think it's really different
obviously<00:01:32.060> what<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.240> said<00:01:32.479> how<00:01:32.600> bigger<00:01:32.899> old

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
obviously what you said how bigger old

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.749 
obviously what you said how bigger old
engineering<00:01:33.649> on<00:01:33.740> horribly<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:35.000> stuff<00:01:35.300> like

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
engineering on horribly and stuff like

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.340 
engineering on horribly and stuff like
pressure<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:37.970> comes<00:01:38.090> I<00:01:38.330> think<00:01:38.539> I<00:01:38.840> should<00:01:39.259> be

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
pressure that comes I think I should be

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.350 
pressure that comes I think I should be
fine<00:01:39.530> with<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.740> too

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
fine with that too

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.120 
fine with that too
no<00:01:41.360> we
