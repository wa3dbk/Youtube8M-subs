00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.330
 triple for free so anyway almost 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.120
 Crytek is his new multiplayer shooter 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.929
 warface together moment why then 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.960
 free of charge now warface is consistent on the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.300
 currently as popular as it is controversial 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.000
 free to play model sets and doing 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.369
 nevertheless the usual high quality 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.920
 Submit picture ripley for free 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.160
 whether these are just hole marketing phrases 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.690
 we played warface and though 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.920
 See for yourself, for example 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.379
 graphic just like crysis 2 or that for 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.420
 2013 planned price 3 uses warface 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.370
 the current cryengine and sees 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320
 accordingly great from then too 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.930
 impress like the first pictures 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 Crysis 3 will be playing warface though 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 not for that should be 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.510
 hardware requirements but also in 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.629
 keep manageable borders 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.270
 a geforce 8600 and 1 gigabyte 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.920
 According to crytek, working memory is sufficient for 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.659
 Liquid game on high details for 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.159
 a good shooter is the graphic 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.530
 Of course only half the rent 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.170
 and as soon as we get into it 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.880
 pvp and be with our magic too 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.740
 immediately rausgeballert because it at 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.490
 Warface comparatively fast and 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.930
 uncompromising approaching 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.820
 in comparison to battlefield 3 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.040
 for example, they stay with us 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.020
 played warface maps with maximum 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.180
 that's right, eight to eight players 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.610
 manageable and the next action is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.619
 just a few seconds away 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.450
 should not be a criticism because warface 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.820
 deliberately chooses these fast ones 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.619
 battles without high entry hurdles and 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.380
 still plays comfortably 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.430
 afloat without a certain complexity over 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.829
 to throw on board 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.780
 At this point, we would give them now 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.790
 like the character development of 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.280
 a total of four classes show and one 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.530
 We are allowed to throw a glance at the itemshop 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.200
 but not because the corresponding menus 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.189
 still being processed so we tell 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.469
 him just that the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.840
 Adjustment options a very good 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.010
 because we make a comprehensive impression 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.050
 but currently 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.330
 can not assess to what extent 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.670
 paying players enjoy benefits 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.830
 Crytek certainly promises the warface 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.510
 consistently on pagewizz elements 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.340
 will do without and get that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.920
 business model instead on 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.950
 points of experience and cosmetics items 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.380
 what we focus on them 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.970
 already can show that pretty cool 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.280
 cut a feature that we already have 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.380
 crysis 2 know with us in this 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.360
 scene an opponent player as well 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.380
 surprisingly as stylish from the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.030
 darting and, of course, the 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.790
 co-op from the developers also dvi 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.490
 called because next to the classic 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.730
 deathmatch capture the flag or bombs 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.640
 modes such warface also daily two each 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.740
 give new pv emission in which we are 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.110
 with up to three pals by computer 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.350
 shooting enemies and doing so as well as in the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.680
 pvp weapons and equipment unlock 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.840
 the tvg inserts will be random 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.180
 set pieces together again and again 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.310
 diced and start after a short 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.510
 briefing with the helicopter landing in 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.700
 a hot stone 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.650
 from then on it means checkpoints 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.230
 rattle off and opponents and ball on 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.390
 Of course this is the most effective if 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.850
 the four-man team under 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.470
 the poor, for example , attacks us 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.530
 each other over a high wall 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.880
 Help or the sniper by fire ladder 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.880
 on a good shot position 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.610
 Teamwork is also at the end of one 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.680
 Commission is waiting there because waiting 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.870
 Boss and this way would be ours 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.160
 sniper in his eyes 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.019
 disassemble items 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.000
 if our fellow players do not know him 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.030
 would distract us and thus the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.780
 possibility would be hasty to 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.890
 rocket launcher to rush 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.360
 in turn this tin can in 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.360
 your items disassembled 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.280
 aja vehicle-so there is also, however, 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.380
 only in pp and we are allowed to control ourselves 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.900
 The things do not go instead 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.660
 in certain corp maps to us from 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.940
 point a to point b to schippern are 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.980
 all team members on board rattles the 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.840
 transporter automatically go and we 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.100
 shoot from the loading area to everything 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.080
 what somehow marked in red is co- op 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.240
 Mode down like title at the end 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.220
 the old question remains like free to play 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.200
 is the free-to-play of warface 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.590
 in fact we are without 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.330
 Credit card is not competitive 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.520
 quite unimportant points can be 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.830
 but currently not serious 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.650
 let's say we can say 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.720
 current time so just fun 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.320
 Warface in the version you have tried 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.320
 all
