00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.340
 more recognized than currently also 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.970
 is jessica butrich likewise 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.940
 every time is a 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.649

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.300
 most imported 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.799
 For this race, the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.500
 adequate infrastructure you need a 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.150

 in patterns it is enough to be the sixth of 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.980
 all three are in their web therefore 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.900

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.530
 possibility of our hand 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.560
 It has affected other people 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.959
 you also need latest technology 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.049
 generation machines that work 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.239
 well that they are current in the market 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.949
 software programs us 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.900
 we drive now 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:28.329
 bold 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.480
 the computer designed your computer 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:35.920
 we have access to a fashion portal 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.629
 I am in English corn threshold action and 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.019
 where your crops just for our 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.939
 students our kids at least not 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.379
 have any problems in our 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.810
 work I believe that our investment 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.859
 work any of those 90 percent 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.560
 because we also have a good 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.459
 trajectory a good name won 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.859
 undoubtedly like in any career 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.430
 they ask you where he came from and 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:59.500
 that has our name has a weight 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.659
 pretty strong that makes it also be 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.900
 a guarantee is one is an investment that 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.760
 is going to repay its fruits is not 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.280
 as in all work that is already going to 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.000
 also depend on say the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.569
 company will also depend on 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.370
 mounting the experience because 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.500
 logically if you just go out soon you're going to 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.299
 have a lot of experience but it 's their 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.040
 attitudes of their abilities but in 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.040
 average I would say that once 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.410
 and now fresh out can be 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.410
