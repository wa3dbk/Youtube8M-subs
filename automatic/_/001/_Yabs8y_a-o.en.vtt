00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.800

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.369
 current happen 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.500
 I think that also in their interest 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.680
 the state of elias semi at the moment 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.029
 unchanged compared to only yesterday 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.150

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.070
 on the way of stabilization and in the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.630

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.820
 But we also ask for understanding that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.469
 we do not new every day now 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.559

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.690

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.590
 from our side on the subject 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.579

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.930
 Otherwise, then continue to do so 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.399

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.760
 explanation with the first FC Nuremberg

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.140

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.080
 Information and the photo you can find 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.210
 on the homepage otherwise 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.880
 organizationally to derby still the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.770
 Another is for the guests from the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.369

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.420
 800 places are buffer and free 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.520
 and then we still ask everyone 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.680
 on to an early arrival two 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.110
 hours before the game open the stadium 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.000
 i am allowed to welcome frank kramer ours 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.920
 trainer and then also to the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.770
 sporting and monday then hand over 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.470
 know good day together first 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.890
 on the personal situation Mr. florian mohr 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.159
 is also known that he with the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.340
 inner band tear in the knee is missing the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.550
 his patellan tendon will be the year to come 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.280
 irritated is not available 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.750
 the marketplace, too, is known 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.710
 and we have already been addressed 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.960
 of course because I think that's it 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.830
 basically what the sporty 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.260
 Of course, that's a very big deal 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.160
 sexy part that's clear that is 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.590
 a derby an evening game which of course 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.890
 bring a lot of atmosphere 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.740
 becomes 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:38.620
 and of course they will try too 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.510
 to implement appropriate on the place 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.030
 that means you have to be very focused 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.630
 you have to work it will be a lot 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.850
 commitment and you have to 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.760
 also stay with yourself in any 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.830
 regard to stay with his 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.020
 focus on tasks and in the sense of doing so 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:02.410
 manage the team to 100 percent 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.830
 it is also clear club is well started 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:11.100
 in the season has a qualitative 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:17.350
 really good troop together and us 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:19.180
 of course we want to be there too 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.739
 We would like to be there accordingly 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.670
 enforce that is clear 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.440
 I think it's an intense game 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.780
 it will have to be clear to all of us 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.360
 It must be this one's expenditure 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.730
 of course, to be ready and to go 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.690
 You still have to say this as well 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.680
 will be 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:45.340
 you must not be exuberant otherwise 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.910
 a kerchief is going on then go ahead 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.220
 error 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.080
 who play in those of course where the 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.209
 Smallness matters crucially 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.620
 Of course, then, too 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.850
 decisively influence game outcome 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.850
 have to play with a lot of pressure each 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.390
 perceive opportunity to the opponent 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.519
 gate 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:09.420
 maybe this little step earlier 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:12.820
 to be on it and have to be robust as well 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.340
 precisely deal with the opponent if he 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.600
 own possession is that means we 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.290
 Of course I want to print as well 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.750
 exercise 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.510
 there is the march route and know 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.710
 everything else will certainly be there 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.280
 few questions to clarify 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.450
 if there are two before he asks 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.740
 I can also go to the referee 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.370
 have the almost now have 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.230
 to forget 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.850
 that will be the experienced on monday 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.220
 wolfgang be strong together with mike 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.620
 pimple martin petersen and marcel 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.030
 so that then the 4 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.760
 who will lead this encounter 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.760
 should now please ask yours 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.840
 dollar 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.480
 Kramer rejected the accident 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.290
 azemi now discussed in the cabin 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.449
 been 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.139
 is there already reactions there 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:10.430
 already contacts him in the hospital 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:14.370
 as before before last year 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.290
 Martin Meichelbeck had permanently 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.919
 contact is also good that it 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.800
 of course, filtered because the boy 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.479
 Now, of course, needs some rest 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.180
 and I think once such a 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.669
 has to come to a bit and if there 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.850
 every half an hour somebody else 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.280
 Invite and, of course, be compassionate 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.470
 yes clearly the mandate to express 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.240
 I want to bring over then I think 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.970
 It would not help him at the moment either 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.190
 but we are thinking of him 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.820
 just a cabin is spoken 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.630
 a thought at and if easy 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:58.350
 try to take him 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:59.729
 in the spirit he is in the spirit and tries 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.060
 everything we can do 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.810
 right now she is morally too 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.240
 support 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.330
 and then consider but it is certainly 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.340
 helpful if we are suitable for the 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:16.430
 with races for the cooperation and 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.430
 are successful 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:23.550
 we are also open and 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.530
 speak openly about it 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.530
 everything else makes no sense 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.540
 stefan blum can 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.150
 at a show win the heavy 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.040
 traffic accident where about that would be said 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.420
 you will want to go far with Vienna 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.070
 It may have wanted to fight 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.570
 number percent release the the 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.230
 output of the double also affect 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.000
 or it will show 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.820
 but if everyone is ready 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.740
 alone brings over his point 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.570
 once more a reason a reason 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.280
 to have more over one point 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:04.160
 to go out then it is always 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:09.410
 Helpful there are still questions about the game 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:11.810
 on Monday apparently not and say 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.480
 thanks for coming now wish one 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.830
 pleasant friday and ask her too 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.600
 again the early arrival 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.600
 communicate accordingly thanks
