00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.540
 I will show you how to make a lav or 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.790
 mini the compu 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.360
 these are the icons this is the board 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.730
 and it's very beautiful in the front is like 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.730
 I ask him forever 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.510
 to make this nice recent computer in 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.510
 sun stuff 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.400
 a decorated paper like this 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.750
 scissors 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.820
 the glue or silicone or silicone 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.740
 hot a dip 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.770
 the dip is optional if you like to use or 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.770
 do not 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.850
 the black color with pencil 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.850
 a magazine whatever it is I have a 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.949
 disc but when I was good to start 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.629
 let's fold your paper in half 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.480
 but if they have it or this can 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.100
 use a piece of cardboard 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.469
 paper the outlets carton and decorate it 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.490
 with a leaf and now they put color and 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.869
 cough and already double it and the dakar if a 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.369
 part is going to be where they are going to be 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.369
 the icons of finishing the board 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.580
 to start as I put you 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.190
 I will cover it first of all, expensive 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.990
 cover 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.980
 If he wants to cover me, he will keep them 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.810
 So good is left for me if I was 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.090
 that would look more like 1 point later 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.390
 look in some paper that you have in the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.840
 image of some phone cut out 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.840
 ah 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.250
 and then they keep it here 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.830
 make the app and the leftovers are removed 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.080
 so that it is already so good what 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.240
 they hit it they did not put anything 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.640
 outside because if it does not stay outside and 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.980
 as is already we hit the tape if you 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.640
 hit then if not then 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.690
 in some paper that is blank 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.190
 how are you doing your board after 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.250
 that they already made their board what 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.790
 they cut it and they're going to stick it for me 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.100
 be ready and disrupt of this 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.160
 form what they already have 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.680
 they finished their lap closes and by 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.240
 acting the beautiful detail and it opens and 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:37.810

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.810
