hey this is a

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.140 
hey this is a
part<00:00:17.550> fits<00:00:18.550> in<00:00:18.760> that<00:00:19.060> hole<00:00:19.750> there<00:00:20.050> and<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.910> put

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150

part fits in that hole there and you put
it<00:00:22.240> in<00:00:22.330> from<00:00:22.660> the<00:00:22.779> front<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:25.119> need<00:00:25.300> to

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
it in from the front and we need to

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.320 
it in from the front and we need to
stick<00:00:25.660> some<00:00:25.840> grease<00:00:26.080> on<00:00:26.230> it<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:28.029> the<00:00:28.090> part

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
stick some grease on it but the part

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:36.570 
stick some grease on it but the part
greased<00:00:28.770> so<00:00:29.770> bring<00:00:30.009> the<00:00:30.099> front<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:36.160> turn<00:00:36.370> it

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580

like<00:00:36.730> that<00:00:36.790> so<00:00:37.510> it's<00:00:37.660> going<00:00:37.840> in<00:00:38.019> backwards<00:00:38.500> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
like that so it's going in backwards and

recently<00:00:40.180> do<00:00:40.360> this<00:00:40.510> you<00:00:40.720> turn<00:00:40.960> it<00:00:41.170> few<00:00:41.920> threads

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.529 

backwards<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.410> then<00:00:47.500> and<00:00:47.680> do<00:00:47.860> it<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.360> what

backwards and then and do it and what
you<00:00:49.600> try<00:00:49.719> and<00:00:49.780> do<00:00:49.989> is<00:00:50.110> clear<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.379> thread<00:00:50.829> a<00:00:50.860> bit

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
you try and do is clear the thread a bit
