00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 at the end of today we will unveil the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.390
 mystery 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.880
 we will find out what business has 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.550
 gone motorcycle the musicians start there 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.220
 so come on O may it arrives on time 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.720
 of learning 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:23.039
 [Music] 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.350
 so come on continuing the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.000
 matter that we spoke in class 21 only 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.369
 gives a quick review 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.009
 we talk about intervals which is the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.020
 issue and the right tone only 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.600
 revising this then we know that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.430
 without me tone is of less distance between 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.420
 two techniques for example I 'm even with 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.940
 of 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.149
 The shortest distance from here is to this key. 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.879
 black or if it has been decreasing 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.309
 for that white key then in 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.800
 from here to here or from here to here 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.469
 right or if you talk a black button 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.989
 without a victory from here to here that the smaller 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.270
 away from the 'brand' I will always have 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.190
 one ascending one descending 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.000
 from this understanding of tone and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.559
 semi tone 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.350
 We're going to jump over to our next one. 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.810
 subject the names of the black keys 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.180
 these black keys they have name and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.830
 understand this way the people 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.320
 You know that here 's my sunshine there. 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.720
 these notes here they will receive names 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.729
 like this one do re mi do sol 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.009
 there but they will receive a surname 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.650
 how is it that only this last name is what the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.299
 People are going to call it endemol 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.820
 Let's start by talking about sus 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.070
 A sharp fear is the name we give when 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.200
 We want to represent a grade 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.909
 plus 6 ton for example the people 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.790
 feel sorry note of pity note forth us 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.340
 has a half-tone or semi-tone range 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.439
 then this note that will receive the name 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 where she came from she did not come from me 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.399
 I was here and I came here so she goes 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.979
 receive doi name will receive 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.020
 surname then what will be the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.560
 full name of this note here 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.869
 sharp does the faw 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.640
 if I'm here on the lighthouse route and I come 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.420
 What is your name for this note? 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.399
 note 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.860

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.459
 farrah plus the name suggested by the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.360
 girls because I rise 1 cm tone of 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.670
 farce 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.610
 So if I 'm on the sun and come to 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.650
 here with the name of the note only if sharp 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.410
 oppose there and came to that note with the name 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.480
 their ties have come if I am on that note 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.760
 and I come here I do not have one here 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.010
 mixed level comes out of him to talk 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.870
 Because of me, I do not have to talk. 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.569
 black key in the middle the same happens 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.580
 I do not know, I do not have a key. 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.410
 which in the middle then a name 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.290
 We will initially grant him 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.450
 as not having sustained and those also 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.980
 not having sustained 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.260
 already in the case of the baby dies people have a 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.150
 If I 'm here, I'll come and go. 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.950
 this note already understands that this note but 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.100
 call C - sharp because she's 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.239
 rising 1cm in the tone and will receive the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.340
 january name 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.069
 now bÃª mall already the opposite instead 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.940
 I went up I'm going down for example I 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.519
 I'm in here and I'm dying for this note. 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.150
 I dropped here 1cm shot was not the smallest 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.680
 distance your two keys here then 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.260
 on this note that will receive the name of back 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.269
 because I'm falling back to her I 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.359
 I say fall because I'm coming down 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.459
 here and there from here to here I'm falling 1 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.500
 cm then tried logically this note 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.780
 will receive the name of the back however as I 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.109
 I'm falling and no going up it goes 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.840
 then called the mole is 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.120
 when I go up and demon is when I come down 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.390

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.910
 different names will this note will be the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.940
 C - sharp is rising from the pity 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.810

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.620
 of fear or the sun flat depending on whether 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.810
 is rising down 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.630
 this here will be only following this that 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.900
 It's going to be there, this one's going to be there. 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.489
 or if my brother then all 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.040
 these black notes 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.940
 we have five these five notes 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.980
 black 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.840
 they will receive the name or of sustenido 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.239

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.760
 where you are coming from if you are 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.220
 going up this way down from the mall 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.790
 soon all the black notes will have two 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.139
 different names this one there mdb mall 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.060
 this issue of having two names 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.540
 different what we call notes 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.479
 Harmonic notes are then harmonic notes are 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.880
 fashions that have two different names put 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.949
 running is even if I press this 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.210
 note I can say I'm you 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:47.639
 giving C - sharp and D flat this right 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.860
 part of priests and I measure the webmotors 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.960
 this varies more by writing because the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.850
 execution is really this I love 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.810
 female and handball this is ct 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.389
 nest of the sun 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.630
 then this will vary more from writing 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:04.020
 that of the right running so well the 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.889
 We closed this piece of sustaining gone 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.210
