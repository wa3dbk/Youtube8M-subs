there you can line up onto the tree very

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.899 
there you can line up onto the tree very
good<00:01:56.380> spot

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
good spot

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.850 
good spot
next<00:01:57.909> there's<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.479> few<00:01:59.110> ways<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.290> get<00:01:59.530> up<00:01:59.650> onto

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
next there's a few ways to get up onto

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.100 
next there's a few ways to get up onto
this<00:02:00.100> building<00:02:00.520> first<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.540> can<00:02:01.720> hop<00:02:01.900> onto

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
this building first you can hop onto

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.219 
this building first you can hop onto
that<00:02:02.320> toe<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.670> trailer<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.509> can<00:02:04.840> get<00:02:05.020> I

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
that toe of the trailer I can get I

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.020 
that toe of the trailer I can get I
guess<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.650> can<00:02:05.770> call<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.460> can<00:02:06.700> get<00:02:06.790> off<00:02:06.880> to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
guess you can call it you can get off to

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.669 
guess you can call it you can get off to
here<00:02:07.180> you<00:02:07.300> can<00:02:07.420> alter<00:02:07.690> lay<00:02:07.810> down<00:02:07.990> nobody<00:02:08.560> will

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
here you can alter lay down nobody will

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.559 
here you can alter lay down nobody will
see<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:08.950> unless<00:02:09.160> some<00:02:09.819> people<00:02:10.090> can<00:02:10.209> come<00:02:10.420> over

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
see you unless some people can come over

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.910 
see you unless some people can come over
there<00:02:10.690> for<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.230> can<00:02:11.380> just<00:02:11.530> hide<00:02:11.739> over

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
there for that you can just hide over

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.650 
there for that you can just hide over
this<00:02:11.980> side<00:02:12.220> not<00:02:12.550> many<00:02:12.819> people<00:02:13.000> use<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:13.420> area

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
this side not many people use this area

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.170 
this side not many people use this area
and<00:02:13.959> infected<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:14.860> you're<00:02:15.100> more<00:02:15.790> like<00:02:16.000> more

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and infected so you're more like more

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.300 
and infected so you're more like more
than<00:02:16.330> likely<00:02:16.510> be<00:02:17.440> able<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.680> get<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.920> last<00:02:18.069> part

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
than likely be able to get the last part

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.910 
than likely be able to get the last part
on<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:18.880> map<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.660> also<00:02:19.780> use<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.470> ladder

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
on this map you can also use this ladder

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.560 
on this map you can also use this ladder
so<00:02:21.190> if<00:02:21.430> people<00:02:21.880> know<00:02:22.090> where<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.330> are<00:02:22.450> it's

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
so if people know where you are it's

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.060 
so if people know where you are it's
quite<00:02:22.810> easy<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.110> get<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.440> that's<00:02:23.830> what<00:02:24.010> I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
quite easy to get you that's what I

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.259 
quite easy to get you that's what I
don't<00:02:24.250> really<00:02:24.370> recommend<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:24.850> spot<00:02:25.060> and

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
don't really recommend this spot and

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.680 
don't really recommend this spot and
lastly<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:25.690> can<00:02:25.750> get<00:02:25.870> up<00:02:25.989> here<00:02:26.380> hop<00:02:26.980> up<00:02:27.160> there

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
lastly you can get up here hop up there

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.960 
lastly you can get up here hop up there
and<00:02:28.690> get<00:02:28.900> off<00:02:28.989> into<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:30.250> that's<00:02:30.580> what<00:02:30.910> I

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
and get off into this so that's what I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.090 
and get off into this so that's what I
thought<00:02:31.209> now<00:02:31.420> next<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:32.230> have<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.590> chalk<00:02:32.860> is

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
jump into the safe you can walk down the

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:18.900 
jump into the safe you can walk down the
other<00:03:18.670> side

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
other side

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.449 
other side
come<00:03:19.690> over<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.019> this<00:03:20.110> tree<00:03:20.170> here<00:03:20.590> with<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:20.950> it's

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
come over to this tree here with it it's

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.080 
come over to this tree here with it it's
like<00:03:21.760> four<00:03:22.360> trees<00:03:22.570> in<00:03:22.900> from<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.260> branch<00:03:24.090> up

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
like four trees in from the branch up

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.120 
like four trees in from the branch up
then<00:03:25.329> here<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:25.720> just<00:03:25.750> basically<00:03:26.260> walk<00:03:26.680> down<00:03:26.920> and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
then here I just basically walk down and

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.130 
then here I just basically walk down and
crouch<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.790> nobody<00:03:28.120> will<00:03:28.209> ever<00:03:28.299> see<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.720> you

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
crouch and nobody will ever see you you

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.740 
crouch and nobody will ever see you you
can<00:03:29.290> also<00:03:29.410> lean<00:03:29.799> over<00:03:29.980> here<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:30.880> nobody<00:03:31.090> will

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
can also lean over here so nobody will

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.390 
can also lean over here so nobody will
be<00:03:31.900> able<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.350> it<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:32.739> people<00:03:33.100> coming<00:03:33.310> from

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
be able to it so people coming from

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.630 
be able to it so people coming from
there<00:03:33.609> you<00:03:34.060> can<00:03:34.209> kill<00:03:34.359> them

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
there you can kill them

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.920 
there you can kill them
basically<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.450> can<00:03:35.600> do<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.750> from<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
basically and you can do it from the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.110 
basically and you can do it from the
left<00:03:35.990> side<00:03:36.260> as<00:03:36.380> well<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.800> it's<00:03:37.640> really<00:03:37.850> got<00:03:38.090> a

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
left side as well so it's really got a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.680 
left side as well so it's really got a
spot<00:03:38.390> here<00:03:38.960> you<00:03:39.170> can<00:03:39.320> also<00:03:39.500> jump<00:03:39.980> up<00:03:40.100> to<00:03:40.690> there

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
spot here you can also jump up to there

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.930 
spot here you can also jump up to there
from<00:03:41.990> you<00:03:42.710> can<00:03:42.860> get<00:03:43.010> back<00:03:43.160> into<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.490> spot<00:03:43.730> and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
from you can get back into the spot and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.210 
from you can get back into the spot and
jump<00:03:44.540> up<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.690> here<00:03:45.050> then<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.710> can<00:03:45.800> crawl<00:03:46.100> up

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
jump up to here then you can crawl up

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.220 
jump up to here then you can crawl up
this<00:03:46.310> tree<00:03:46.550> a<00:03:46.580> bit<00:03:46.880> further<00:03:47.150> but<00:03:47.780> ferry<00:03:48.080> that

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
this tree a bit further but ferry that

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.800 
this tree a bit further but ferry that
goes<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:48.560> any<00:03:48.620> job<00:03:48.890> from<00:03:49.070> there<00:03:49.720> there's<00:03:50.720> also

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
goes in any job from there there's also

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.390 
goes in any job from there there's also
a<00:03:50.960> few<00:03:51.110> more<00:03:51.230> spots<00:03:51.410> on<00:03:51.650> there<00:03:51.800> that<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.040> need<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
a few more spots on there that I need to

as<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:55.130> already<00:03:55.280> said<00:03:55.670> is<00:03:55.910> very<00:03:56.120> good<00:03:56.330> for

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
as I already said is very good for

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.360 
as I already said is very good for
infected<00:03:56.870> spots<00:03:57.110> you<00:03:57.470> know<00:03:57.590> it's<00:03:57.890> probably

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
infected spots you know it's probably

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.100 
infected spots you know it's probably
the<00:03:58.460> best<00:03:58.670> for<00:03:58.940> infected<00:03:59.390> on<00:03:59.570> this<00:03:59.720> game<00:03:59.930> that

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
the best for infected on this game that

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.170 
the best for infected on this game that
I've<00:04:00.410> found<00:04:00.530> unless<00:04:00.830> it<00:04:01.160> called<00:04:01.790> chasm

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
I've found unless it called chasm

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.790 
I've found unless it called chasm
roadmap<00:04:02.600> for<00:04:03.050> infection<00:04:03.440> because<00:04:03.620> it's

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
roadmap for infection because it's

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.949 
roadmap for infection because it's
basically<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:04.370> big<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:04.820> so<00:04:04.970> open<00:04:05.270> a<00:04:05.450> lot<00:04:05.810> of

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
rooms that you can hide it but let's get

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.730 
rooms that you can hide it but let's get
back<00:04:08.720> over<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:09.020> this<00:04:09.110> spot<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.470> I'll<00:04:09.560> show<00:04:09.680> you
