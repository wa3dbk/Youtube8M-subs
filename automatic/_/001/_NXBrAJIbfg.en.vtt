yes<00:00:57.820> today<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:59.120> let's<00:00:59.840> replace<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.530> batteries

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
yes today is let's replace the batteries

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.310 
yes today is let's replace the batteries
in<00:01:01.129> your<00:01:01.160> NES<00:01:01.670> day<00:01:01.910> for<00:01:02.180> great<00:01:02.390> fun<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:02.839> profit

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
in your NES day for great fun and profit

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.649 
in your NES day for great fun and profit
we're<00:01:04.190> gonna<00:01:04.309> open<00:01:04.549> up<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.820> cartridge<00:01:05.360> and

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
we're gonna open up the cartridge and

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.690 
we're gonna open up the cartridge and
believe<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.650> or<00:01:06.770> not<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:07.159> is<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.549> most

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
believe it or not that is the most

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.450 
believe it or not that is the most
difficult<00:01:07.909> thing<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.810> do

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
difficult thing to do

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.300 
difficult thing to do
mostly<00:01:10.460> because<00:01:10.940> Nintendo<00:01:11.630> decided<00:01:11.750> hey<00:01:12.619> you

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
mostly because Nintendo decided hey you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.910 
mostly because Nintendo decided hey you
know<00:01:13.430> we<00:01:13.880> have<00:01:14.060> these<00:01:14.210> wonderful<00:01:14.509> games<00:01:15.050> why

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
know we have these wonderful games why

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.830 
know we have these wonderful games why
don't<00:01:16.100> we<00:01:16.190> make<00:01:16.369> them<00:01:16.610> ridiculously<00:01:17.330> hard<00:01:17.659> to

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
don't we make them ridiculously hard to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.930 
don't we make them ridiculously hard to
open<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:18.440> way<00:01:18.590> nobody<00:01:18.950> can<00:01:19.190> ever<00:01:19.340> fix<00:01:19.700> them

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
open that way nobody can ever fix them

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.460 
open that way nobody can ever fix them
even<00:01:20.300> if<00:01:20.420> it's<00:01:20.600> twenty<00:01:20.930> years<00:01:21.140> into<00:01:21.320> the

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
even if it's twenty years into the

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.030 
even if it's twenty years into the
future

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
future

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.169 
future
so<00:01:22.490> they<00:01:22.610> use<00:01:22.790> these<00:01:23.030> ridiculous<00:01:23.720> screws<00:01:24.170> that

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
so they use these ridiculous screws that

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.779 
so they use these ridiculous screws that
no<00:01:26.179> screwdriver<00:01:26.869> will<00:01:27.110> actually<00:01:27.590> fit<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.160> if

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
no screwdriver will actually fit and if

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.820 
no screwdriver will actually fit and if
I<00:01:28.910> can<00:01:29.090> hold<00:01:29.330> it<00:01:29.539> steady<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.960> think<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.470> would<00:01:30.649> do

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
I can hold it steady I think I would do

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.639 
I can hold it steady I think I would do
that<00:01:30.979> for<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.429> see<00:01:31.640> that<00:01:31.820> that<00:01:32.750> is<00:01:33.050> not<00:01:33.080> a

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
that for you see that that is not a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.690 
that for you see that that is not a
regular<00:01:34.100> screw<00:01:35.289> you<00:01:36.289> need<00:01:36.470> a<00:01:36.710> special<00:01:37.310> bit<00:01:37.490> to

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
regular screw you need a special bit to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.870 
regular screw you need a special bit to
get<00:01:37.820> these<00:01:38.000> out<00:01:38.920> if<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.070> did<00:01:40.250> want<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.550> get<00:01:40.700> the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
get these out if you did want to get the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.510 
get these out if you did want to get the
bit<00:01:41.119> it's<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.479> 3/8<00:01:41.869> inch<00:01:42.110> security<00:01:42.710> bit<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.340> can

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
bit it's a 3/8 inch security bit you can

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.040 
bit it's a 3/8 inch security bit you can
get<00:01:43.640> them<00:01:43.850> on<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.060> internet<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:44.569> got<00:01:44.840> mine<00:01:45.020> from

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
get them on the internet I got mine from

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.779 
get them on the internet I got mine from
the<00:01:45.380> same<00:01:45.590> place<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:46.130> got<00:01:46.310> these<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.700> have

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
the same place that I got these to have

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.330 
the same place that I got these to have
batteries<00:01:49.179> so<00:01:50.259> anyway<00:01:51.259> take<00:01:51.860> these<00:01:52.039> screws

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
batteries so anyway take these screws

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.980 
batteries so anyway take these screws
out<00:01:53.170> once<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:54.319> take<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.649> screws<00:01:54.979> out<00:01:55.990> there

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
out once you take the screws out there

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.199 
out once you take the screws out there
are<00:01:57.110> these<00:01:57.200> little<00:01:57.410> tabs<00:01:57.800> up<00:01:58.130> here<00:01:58.160> that<00:01:59.030> the

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
are these little tabs up here that the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.900 
are these little tabs up here that the
cartridge<00:01:59.750> hooks<00:01:59.989> on<00:02:00.170> all<00:02:00.739> you<00:02:01.130> have<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.489> do<00:02:01.640> is

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
cartridge hooks on all you have to do is

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.339 
cartridge hooks on all you have to do is
lift<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:03.020> top<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:03.619> pull<00:02:04.489> down<00:02:04.670> in<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:06.080> top<00:02:06.229> of

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
lift the top and pull down in the top of

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.380 
lift the top and pull down in the top of
the<00:02:06.410> cartridge<00:02:06.800> will<00:02:06.920> come<00:02:07.069> right<00:02:07.250> off<00:02:07.390> so

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
the cartridge will come right off so

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.710 
the cartridge will come right off so
flip<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.349> circuit<00:02:09.530> board<00:02:09.920> over<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:11.569> can

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
flip the circuit board over and you can

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.240 
flip the circuit board over and you can
see<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.020> battery<00:02:12.170> right<00:02:12.650> there<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.129> upper

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
see the battery right there in the upper

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.430 
see the battery right there in the upper
left<00:02:13.610> hand<00:02:13.730> corner<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.390> can<00:02:14.959> either<00:02:15.200> replace

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
left hand corner you can either replace

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.119 
left hand corner you can either replace
it<00:02:15.860> with<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.330> these<00:02:17.629> with<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.530> tabs<00:02:18.800> pre

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
it with one of these with the tabs pre

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:25.020 
it with one of these with the tabs pre
soldered<00:02:19.550> or<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:21.140> can<00:02:21.319> replace<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:22.360> with

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
soldered or you can replace it with

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.300 
soldered or you can replace it with
some<00:02:25.750> regular<00:02:26.110> batteries<00:02:26.620> if<00:02:26.860> you're<00:02:26.980> feeling

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
some regular batteries if you're feeling

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:36.040 
some regular batteries if you're feeling
particularly<00:02:27.700> adventurous

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.140 

so<00:02:37.050> get<00:02:37.800> your<00:02:37.920> desoldering<00:02:38.400> pump<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.940> by<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
so get your desoldering pump and by the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.740 
so get your desoldering pump and by the
way<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.750> pretty<00:02:40.410> easy<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:42.390> you're

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
way this is pretty easy but if you're

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.390 
way this is pretty easy but if you're
unfamiliar<00:02:43.230> with<00:02:43.350> soldering<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.100> might<00:02:44.250> want

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
unfamiliar with soldering you might want

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.550 
unfamiliar with soldering you might want
to<00:02:44.430> pay<00:02:44.610> close<00:02:44.940> attention<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:46.110> still<00:02:46.350> pretty

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
to pay close attention it's still pretty

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.170 
to pay close attention it's still pretty
easy<00:02:46.680> even<00:02:47.190> if<00:02:47.430> you're<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.640> novice<00:02:48.030> at

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
easy even if you're a novice at

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.780 
easy even if you're a novice at
soldering<00:02:48.540> though<00:02:48.810> just<00:02:49.350> pay<00:02:50.040> attention<00:02:50.100> and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
soldering though just pay attention and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.510 
soldering though just pay attention and
don't<00:02:51.570> burn<00:02:51.720> yourself<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:55.100> you're<00:02:56.100> gonna<00:02:56.190> flip

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
don't burn yourself so you're gonna flip

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.300 
don't burn yourself so you're gonna flip
the<00:02:56.700> board<00:02:56.880> over<00:02:57.060> there's<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.110> one<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.620> then

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the board over there's this one and then

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.000 
the board over there's this one and then
there's<00:02:59.490> this<00:02:59.700> one<00:02:59.880> right<00:03:00.120> here<00:03:00.890> you're<00:03:01.890> gonna

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
there's this one right here you're gonna

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.820 
there's this one right here you're gonna
want<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.370> desolder<00:03:03.330> both<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:04.020> these<00:03:04.170> with<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
want to desolder both of these with the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.880 
want to desolder both of these with the
desoldering<00:03:05.340> pump<00:03:05.670> mine<00:03:06.540> which<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.590> just

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
desoldering pump mine which is just

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.890 
desoldering pump mine which is just

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.710 
pretty much our Radio Shack special you
push<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.410> bulb<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.490> then<00:03:14.209> you<00:03:15.209> press<00:03:15.510> on<00:03:15.660> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
push the bulb and then you press on the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.410 
push the bulb and then you press on the
solder<00:03:16.080> joint<00:03:16.440> get<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.400> nice<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.610> fluid<00:03:18.030> and

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
solder joint get it nice and fluid and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.240 
solder joint get it nice and fluid and
then<00:03:18.630> release<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.170> bulb<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.800> will<00:03:19.980> suck

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
then release the bulb and it will suck

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.630 
then release the bulb and it will suck
the<00:03:20.430> solder<00:03:20.700> right<00:03:21.060> off<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.390> tab<00:03:22.370> just<00:03:23.370> like

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
the solder right off the tab just like

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.560 
the solder right off the tab just like
that<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:25.790> I'm<00:03:26.790> going<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:26.970> wait<00:03:27.120> for<00:03:27.300> this<00:03:27.390> to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
that so I'm going to wait for this to

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.970 
that so I'm going to wait for this to
heat<00:03:27.750> up<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.170> then<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:28.500> going<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:28.800> both

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
heat up and then I'm going to do both

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.630 
heat up and then I'm going to do both
tabs<00:03:30.140> so<00:03:31.140> once<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:31.560> get<00:03:31.740> a<00:03:31.770> good<00:03:31.980> majority<00:03:32.520> of

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
tabs so once you get a good majority of

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.670 
tabs so once you get a good majority of
the<00:03:32.730> solder<00:03:33.000> off<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.870> pants<00:03:34.140> with<00:03:34.530> your

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
the solder off the pants with your

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.790 
the solder off the pants with your
desoldering<00:03:35.190> pump<00:03:35.630> just<00:03:36.630> heat<00:03:36.900> these<00:03:37.140> tabs<00:03:37.530> up

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
desoldering pump just heat these tabs up

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.830 
desoldering pump just heat these tabs up
and<00:03:38.040> then<00:03:38.459> pull<00:03:38.820> on<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.180> battery<00:03:39.540> on<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
and then pull on the battery on the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.979 
and then pull on the battery on the
opposite<00:03:40.290> side<00:03:40.620> with<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> pair<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.580> pliers<00:03:42.269> or

opposite side with a pair of pliers or

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.470 
opposite side with a pair of pliers or
just<00:03:43.769> pop<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.070> screwdriver<00:03:44.580> under<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.239> pry

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
just pop a screwdriver under it and pry

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.990 
just pop a screwdriver under it and pry
and<00:03:45.810> these<00:03:46.650> tabs<00:03:46.950> should<00:03:47.250> lift<00:03:47.489> right<00:03:47.760> through

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
and these tabs should lift right through

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.830 
and these tabs should lift right through
the<00:03:48.090> board<00:03:49.400> this<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.640> helping<00:03:51.090> hands<00:03:51.330> and

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
the board this is a helping hands and

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.740 
the board this is a helping hands and
what<00:03:52.769> I'm<00:03:52.860> gonna<00:03:52.980> do<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:54.090> I'm<00:03:54.180> gonna<00:03:54.269> take<00:03:54.540> the

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna take the

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.080 
what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna take the
board<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.890> I'm<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.250> gonna<00:03:56.340> put<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.060> here

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
board and I'm just gonna put it in here

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.820 
board and I'm just gonna put it in here
like<00:03:57.769> so

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.300 

all<00:04:05.490> right<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.320> holding<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.100> board

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
all right so this is holding the board

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.350 
all right so this is holding the board
steady<00:04:08.790> for<00:04:09.180> me<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.220> all<00:04:11.520> I'm<00:04:11.730> going<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.090> do

steady for me and so all I'm going to do

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.500 
steady for me and so all I'm going to do
at<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:12.690> point<00:04:13.020> is<00:04:13.940> I'm<00:04:14.940> going<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.150> use<00:04:15.300> my

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
at this point is I'm going to use my

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.780 
at this point is I'm going to use my
screwdriver<00:04:15.890> I'm<00:04:16.890> going<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.130> pry<00:04:17.489> on<00:04:17.519> the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
screwdriver I'm going to pry on the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.420 
screwdriver I'm going to pry on the
battery<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:18.540> side<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:19.280> I'm<00:04:20.280> going<00:04:20.370> to

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
battery on this side and I'm going to

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:30.010 
battery on this side and I'm going to
heat<00:04:20.640> up<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.910> tabs<00:04:21.180> on<00:04:21.420> this

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.290 

this<00:04:30.830> one<00:04:31.069> actually<00:04:31.220> fell<00:04:31.699> through<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:31.970> board

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
this one actually fell through the board

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.999 
this one actually fell through the board
by<00:04:32.509> itself<00:04:33.970> there<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.090> go<00:04:35.590> so<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.680> battery

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
by itself there you go so the battery

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:46.159 
by itself there you go so the battery
dropped<00:04:37.370> right<00:04:37.610> off<00:04:37.669> the<00:04:37.940> board

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.469 

there<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:46.860> go<00:04:47.900> I've<00:04:48.900> flipped<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.979> lead<00:04:50.759> to<00:04:51.360> be

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
there you go I've flipped the lead to be

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.390 
there you go I've flipped the lead to be
a<00:04:51.509> little<00:04:51.810> bit<00:04:51.990> thinner<00:04:52.349> on<00:04:52.469> this<00:04:52.830> side<00:04:53.039> as<00:04:53.279> you

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
a little bit thinner on this side as you

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.260 
a little bit thinner on this side as you
can<00:04:53.460> see<00:04:54.080> so<00:04:55.080> I'm<00:04:55.800> going<00:04:56.159> to<00:04:56.430> put<00:04:56.789> this<00:04:56.909> on<00:04:57.120> the

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
can see so I'm going to put this on the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.249 
can see so I'm going to put this on the
board<00:04:57.620> remember<00:04:58.620> positive<00:04:59.490> tab<00:04:59.789> to<00:05:00.569> positive

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
board remember positive tab to positive

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.450 
board remember positive tab to positive
negative<00:05:02.099> to<00:05:02.340> negative<00:05:03.919> I'm<00:05:04.919> just<00:05:05.129> going<00:05:05.340> to

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
negative to negative I'm just going to

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.820 
negative to negative I'm just going to
insert<00:05:05.879> this<00:05:06.240> tab<00:05:06.599> here<00:05:07.050> I've<00:05:07.199> already<00:05:07.379> bent

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
insert this tab here I've already bent

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.980 
insert this tab here I've already bent
them<00:05:08.039> into<00:05:08.370> kind<00:05:09.090> of<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.270> C<00:05:09.930> shape<00:05:10.490> so<00:05:11.840> take<00:05:12.840> the

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
them into kind of a C shape so take the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.959 
them into kind of a C shape so take the
one<00:05:13.199> tab<00:05:13.550> stick<00:05:14.550> it<00:05:14.669> into<00:05:14.819> the<00:05:15.779> positive<00:05:15.990> slot

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:16.969 
one tab stick it into the positive slot

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.429 
one tab stick it into the positive slot
then<00:05:17.969> take<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.419> other<00:05:18.479> tab<00:05:18.779> stick<00:05:19.199> it<00:05:19.319> into

then take the other tab stick it into

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.920 
then take the other tab stick it into
the<00:05:19.620> negative<00:05:20.360> like<00:05:21.360> so<00:05:21.689> and<00:05:22.259> then<00:05:23.099> just

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
the negative like so and then just

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.170 
the negative like so and then just
wiggle<00:05:24.930> it<00:05:25.080> back<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.289> forth<00:05:25.529> here<00:05:26.180> batteries

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
wiggle it back and forth here batteries

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.959 
wiggle it back and forth here batteries

in place both tabs are in the slots

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.469 
in place both tabs are in the slots
where<00:05:30.270> they<00:05:30.389> need<00:05:30.599> to<00:05:30.629> be<00:05:30.749> and<00:05:32.089> on<00:05:33.089> the<00:05:33.270> back
