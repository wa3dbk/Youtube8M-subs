00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 facing the most desired waves of the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.700
 planet life lesson that he is 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.639
 passing to us for example of life 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.610
 I do not want to live a more blind boy. 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.610
 Jose the show is roni What is the language? 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.830
 i 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.100
 interest in longboard skateboarding and 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.160
 came when I returned from my first 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.390
 season at light and ms diana here at 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.489
 season of one year had not yet 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.739
 started and I was agonized that he 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.809
 is surfing had an opportunity with this 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.370
 Network people or I came face to face with 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.220
 I talked to you, man. 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 little boy with slow tongue and tongue 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.949
 is widely tied when the type 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.739
 several days in a row in the photos 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:04.540
 capping 12 michereff and even learning to 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.330
 seek to deal with the other knowing that 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.670
 You can not see him getting used to the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.890
 My way too is going bowling. 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.409
 For freava there he already notices mine. 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.720
 movement and is in the process of 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.880
 of course the meaning that I use 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.909
 enough for me to play the sport is the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.150
 health also the tact all that is 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.640
 kind of noise whatever it is kind of 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.090
 sensitivity and put I found 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.149
 after 48 John they encourage me to 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.740
 too damn if it was not for them here 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.079
 dedicated to teaching to make a river with 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.579
 sure you would not be making the energy 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.649
 The positive they pass on to me is very 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:50.350
 good, they will be able to practice 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:53.109
 my goal is to evolve more and more 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.509
 increasingly break challenges 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:58.240
 I think the downhill speed longboard and 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.859
 brings many benefits to me because I 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.929
 I like radical sports, I feel 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:04.600
 Like I'm going down a hill in 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.850
 a skateboard I feel happy of her only 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.950
 sport already provide health benefits 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.680
 a radical sport then we are not even talking about 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.400
 company is always a lesson 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.010
 realize that what I have difficulty 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.710
 to achieve anything within the vision despite 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.900
 that he is being smaller than us 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.060
 problems every difficulty in each 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.970
 challenge is in cents overcoming 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.480
 to sit 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.590
 passing over it is that business 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.590
 With the help of God, anything is possible. 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.769
 now
