00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
going to be a good thing and it's going

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.890 
going to be a good thing and it's going
to<00:03:48.519> you're<00:03:48.730> going<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.910> be<00:03:48.970> able<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.239> keep<00:03:49.570> up<00:03:49.750> on

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
to you're going to be able to keep up on

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.870 
to you're going to be able to keep up on
your<00:03:50.080> multiplayer<00:03:50.440> skill<00:03:51.130> level<00:03:51.430> things<00:03:51.670> like

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
your multiplayer skill level things like

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.210 
your multiplayer skill level things like
that<00:03:52.060> they<00:03:52.510> said<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.050> AI<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.440> scalable

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
that they said that the AI is scalable

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.009 
that they said that the AI is scalable
so<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.550> better<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.880> get<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.420> better<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.870> AI

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
so the better you get the better the AI

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.490 
so the better you get the better the AI
gets<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:57.100> while<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:58.180> AI<00:03:58.360> might<00:03:58.870> not<00:03:59.080> be<00:03:59.290> the

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
gets so while the AI might not be the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.190 
gets so while the AI might not be the
best<00:03:59.769> in<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.040> world<00:04:00.280> right<00:04:00.640> away<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.300> scales

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
best in the world right away it scales

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.900 
best in the world right away it scales
with<00:04:02.500> your<00:04:02.680> character<00:04:03.130> as<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.550> get<00:04:03.730> better

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
with your character as you get better

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.580 
with your character as you get better
and<00:04:04.180> progressed<00:04:04.570> throughout<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.019> game<00:04:05.200> as<00:04:05.470> it

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
and progressed throughout the game as it

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.590 
and progressed throughout the game as it
knows<00:04:05.860> how<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.459> are<00:04:06.730> when<00:04:07.180> you're<00:04:07.330> playing

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
knows how you are when you're playing

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.840 
knows how you are when you're playing
and<00:04:07.840> things<00:04:08.050> like<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.290> so<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.340> think<00:04:09.610> that

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
and things like that so I think that

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.400 
and things like that so I think that
that's<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.239> good<00:04:10.450> thing<00:04:10.630> it<00:04:10.780> will<00:04:10.900> teach<00:04:11.140> people

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
that's a good thing it will teach people

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.110 
that's a good thing it will teach people
some<00:04:11.739> things<00:04:11.980> like<00:04:12.190> lines<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.640> sight<00:04:12.880> within

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
some things like lines of sight within

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.300 
some things like lines of sight within
the<00:04:13.420> game<00:04:13.630> itself<00:04:14.050> and<00:04:14.320> get<00:04:14.739> things<00:04:14.950> going

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
the game itself and get things going

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.759 
the game itself and get things going
that<00:04:15.459> way<00:04:15.670> but<00:04:16.299> I<00:04:16.359> really<00:04:16.930> feel<00:04:17.260> that<00:04:17.290> this<00:04:17.709> is

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
that way but I really feel that this is

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.949 
that way but I really feel that this is
going<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.220> be<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.370> haven<00:04:18.700> for<00:04:19.120> people<00:04:19.269> wanting

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
going to be a haven for people wanting

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.680 
going to be a haven for people wanting
