00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
very high-end in a performance and Bowl

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.340 
very high-end in a performance and Bowl
we<00:03:40.760> can<00:03:40.880> see<00:03:41.000> here<00:03:41.240> that's<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.930> pretty<00:03:42.140> decent

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
we can see here that's a pretty decent

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.380 
we can see here that's a pretty decent
job<00:03:42.530> opening<00:03:43.220> up<00:03:43.310> different<00:03:43.490> applications

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
job opening up different applications

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.910 
job opening up different applications
and<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.840> normal<00:03:45.110> function<00:03:45.470> seems<00:03:45.680> pretty

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
and the normal function seems pretty

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.190 
and the normal function seems pretty
quick<00:03:46.310> let's<00:03:47.030> just<00:03:47.300> try<00:03:47.570> and<00:03:47.630> see<00:03:47.840> if<00:03:47.900> we<00:03:48.020> could

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
quick let's just try and see if we could

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.720 
quick let's just try and see if we could
change<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.770> wallpaper<00:03:49.220> here<00:03:49.430> give<00:03:49.700> it

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
change the wallpaper here give it

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.250 
change the wallpaper here give it
something<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.120> little<00:03:50.330> bit<00:03:50.420> more<00:03:50.450> processor

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
something a little bit more processor

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.800 
something a little bit more processor
intensive<00:03:51.610> see<00:03:52.610> what<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.060> performance<00:03:53.480> looks

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
intensive see what the performance looks

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.740 
intensive see what the performance looks
like<00:03:54.050> with<00:03:54.320> that<00:03:55.090> so<00:03:56.090> let's<00:03:56.240> go<00:03:56.390> with<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.570> live

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
like with that so let's go with the live

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.620 
like with that so let's go with the live
wallpaper<00:03:56.990> here<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:58.640> usual<00:03:58.820> stuff<00:03:59.270> let's

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
wallpaper here the usual stuff let's

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.330 
wallpaper here the usual stuff let's
just<00:03:59.720> select<00:04:00.140> this<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:03.530> responsive<00:04:04.130> no

doubt but every now I would just see a

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.440 
doubt but every now I would just see a
little<00:04:06.620> bit<00:04:06.770> of<00:04:06.830> a<00:04:06.950> stutter<00:04:07.520> but<00:04:07.790> it's<00:04:08.120> nothing

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
little bit of a stutter but it's nothing

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.970 
little bit of a stutter but it's nothing
really<00:04:08.930> terrible<00:04:09.560> doesn't<00:04:09.830> really

pretty quick and really really good with

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.250 
pretty quick and really really good with
this<00:04:28.700> performance<00:04:29.180> right<00:04:29.390> now<00:04:29.420> from<00:04:29.810> oversea

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260

this<00:04:30.470> prototype<00:04:31.100> unit<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:32.690> finally<00:04:33.080> there's

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
this prototype unit and finally there's

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.530 
this prototype unit and finally there's
the<00:04:33.530> s-pen<00:04:34.040> here<00:04:34.340> same<00:04:34.670> functionality<00:04:35.360> you'd

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
the s-pen here same functionality you'd

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.600 
the s-pen here same functionality you'd
expect<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.140> have<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.440> air<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:37.340> have<00:04:37.460> the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
expect you have the air you have the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.160 
expect you have the air you have the
hover<00:04:37.790> functionalities<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:38.810> it's<00:04:38.960> very

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
hover functionalities so it's very

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.590 
hover functionalities so it's very
useful<00:04:39.440> for<00:04:39.470> things<00:04:39.920> like<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.190> web<00:04:40.340> browser

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
useful for things like the web browser

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.840 
useful for things like the web browser
so<00:04:41.600> if<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:42.230> have<00:04:42.470> certain<00:04:43.250> websites<00:04:43.640> out

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
so if you have certain websites out

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.490 
so if you have certain websites out
there<00:04:43.880> that<00:04:44.060> rely<00:04:44.540> on<00:04:44.570> different<00:04:45.080> menu<00:04:45.380> driven

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
there that rely on different menu driven

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.650 
there that rely on different menu driven
systems<00:04:46.010> instead<00:04:46.820> of<00:04:46.940> clicking<00:04:47.300> on<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.570> link

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
systems instead of clicking on a link

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.360 
systems instead of clicking on a link
and<00:04:48.140> you<00:04:48.170> can<00:04:48.230> hover<00:04:48.500> over<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.860> which<00:04:49.070> is<00:04:49.190> nice

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
and you can hover over it which is nice

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.520 
and you can hover over it which is nice
and<00:04:49.640> it's<00:04:50.060> great<00:04:50.210> for<00:04:50.390> a<00:04:50.450> note-taking<00:04:51.230> memo

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
and it's great for a note-taking memo

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.970 
and it's great for a note-taking memo
you<00:04:52.460> have<00:04:52.610> all<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.000> SS<00:04:53.510> nimble<00:04:54.050> apps<00:04:54.380> onboard
