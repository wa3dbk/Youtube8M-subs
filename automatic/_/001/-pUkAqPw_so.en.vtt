00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.640
 of those rites when they go with the ouija 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.950
 the dependence generated by the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.450
 cell phones is a pod 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.540
 crazy you get yourself healed of a 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.280
 addiction to the drink or the drug but if 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.739
 you do not fill that void that the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.860
 anxiety that leads you to consume yourself 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.030
 change of vice then no longer no longer 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.920
 take a drink and not get into the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.780
 casinos and back to casinos and not 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.890

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.549
 when one makes fun of defects 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.680
 physical from others when one damages you 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.159
 the good fame a person 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:21.109
 I am the fruit of an experience 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:24.200
 diabolical that only understands it and only 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.510
 understands initially and believes it 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.579
 live it if you are one of those who feels 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.780
 that your life that in your life you do not 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.219
