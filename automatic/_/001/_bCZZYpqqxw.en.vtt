so here we are now this right here this
is<00:00:06.580> the<00:00:06.960> render<00:00:07.960> I<00:00:08.139> I<00:00:08.670> was<00:00:09.670> wondering<00:00:10.210> what<00:00:10.540> I

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
is the render I I was wondering what I

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.950 
is the render I I was wondering what I
when<00:00:11.259> I<00:00:11.290> locked<00:00:11.559> you<00:00:11.679> and<00:00:12.420> here<00:00:13.420> you<00:00:13.750> can<00:00:13.900> see

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
when I locked you and here you can see

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.950 
when I locked you and here you can see
that<00:00:14.400> there<00:00:15.400> are<00:00:15.429> you<00:00:15.820> know<00:00:15.960> various

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
that there are you know various

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.429 
that there are you know various
repeating<00:00:17.820> patterns<00:00:18.820> right<00:00:19.060> here<00:00:19.390> but<00:00:20.140> I

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
repeating patterns right here but I

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.260 
repeating patterns right here but I
selected<00:00:21.720> these<00:00:22.720> two<00:00:23.020> frames<00:00:23.380> right<00:00:23.619> here

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
selected these two frames right here

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.440 
selected these two frames right here
this<00:00:25.270> one<00:00:25.590> these<00:00:26.590> three<00:00:26.860> and<00:00:27.099> I<00:00:28.059> stretch

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
this one these three and I stretch

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.780 
this one these three and I stretch
stretch<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.470> animation<00:00:30.009> made<00:00:30.309> some<00:00:30.520> were<00:00:30.640> key

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
stretch the animation made some were key

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.880 
stretch the animation made some were key
frames<00:00:31.119> and<00:00:31.390> try<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:31.719> enjoy<00:00:32.020> some<00:00:32.410> more<00:00:32.649> of

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
frames and try to enjoy some more of

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.610 
frames and try to enjoy some more of
that<00:00:32.920> so<00:00:33.399> I<00:00:33.430> could<00:00:33.880> look<00:00:34.570> into<00:00:34.780> more<00:00:34.990> details<00:00:35.380> I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
that so I could look into more details I

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.910 
that so I could look into more details I
also<00:00:36.480> keyframe<00:00:37.480> some<00:00:37.900> of<00:00:38.020> these<00:00:38.140> values<00:00:38.380> right

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
also keyframe some of these values right

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.270 
also keyframe some of these values right
here<00:00:39.160> like<00:00:40.020> wise<00:00:41.020> distance<00:00:41.560> and<00:00:41.740> Mike's<00:00:41.890> angle

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
here like wise distance and Mike's angle

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.100 
here like wise distance and Mike's angle
and<00:00:42.490> basically<00:00:43.300> instead<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.690> you<00:00:44.080> know

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
and basically instead of you know

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.920 
and basically instead of you know
tweaking<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.190> settings<00:00:45.390> rendering<00:00:46.390> tweaking

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
tweaking the settings rendering tweaking

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.380 
tweaking the settings rendering tweaking
the<00:00:47.050> settings<00:00:47.079> rendering<00:00:47.920> I<00:00:48.130> just<00:00:48.820> keyframed

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
the settings rendering I just keyframed

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.800 
the settings rendering I just keyframed
those<00:00:49.990> things<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:50.650> and<00:00:51.280> created<00:00:52.060> a<00:00:52.210> rendered

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
those things and and created a rendered

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.400 
those things and and created a rendered
movie<00:00:53.140> so<00:00:54.040> I<00:00:54.070> could<00:00:54.550> just<00:00:54.790> you<00:00:55.300> know<00:00:55.329> go<00:00:56.140> away

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
movie so I could just you know go away

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.979 
movie so I could just you know go away
for<00:00:56.650> a<00:00:56.680> while<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.190> then<00:00:57.430> just<00:00:58.120> choose<00:00:58.480> which

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
for a while and then just choose which

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.560 
for a while and then just choose which
frame<00:00:59.320> I<00:00:59.530> like<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.860> best<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.399> stay<00:01:01.329> with

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
frame I like the best and stay with

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.310 
frame I like the best and stay with
those<00:01:01.780> settings<00:01:02.200> right<00:01:02.440> there<00:01:02.710> so<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:05.140> some

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
those settings right there so for some

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.020 
those settings right there so for some
reason<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:07.090> animated<00:01:07.780> just<00:01:08.050> the<00:01:08.200> height

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
reason here I animated just the height

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.360 
reason here I animated just the height
while<00:01:10.030> I<00:01:10.060> was<00:01:10.450> already<00:01:11.140> set<00:01:11.350> set<00:01:11.950> on<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.250> right

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
while I was already set set on the right

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.540 
while I was already set set on the right
angle<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:12.820> lights<00:01:13.090> distance<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:15.340> some

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
angle and lights distance and for some

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.940 
angle and lights distance and for some
reason<00:01:15.580> it<00:01:16.290> basically<00:01:17.290> repeats<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.920> same

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
reason it basically repeats the same

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.210 
reason it basically repeats the same
pattern<00:01:18.610> over<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:18.940> over<00:01:19.120> again<00:01:19.530> anyway<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:20.950> I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
pattern over and over again anyway so I

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.410 
pattern over and over again anyway so I
chose<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:23.680> know<00:01:23.799> after<00:01:24.430> i<00:01:24.610> rendered<00:01:24.970> this<00:01:25.180> i

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
chose a you know after i rendered this i

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.380 
chose a you know after i rendered this i
chose<00:01:26.020> one<00:01:26.380> frame<00:01:26.850> went<00:01:27.850> back<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.180> cinema'

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
chose one frame went back to cinema'

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.420 
chose one frame went back to cinema'
selected<00:01:29.170> that<00:01:29.260> frame<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.770> looked<00:01:29.920> which

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
selected that frame and looked which

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.000 
selected that frame and looked which
which<00:01:30.850> values<00:01:31.420> were<00:01:31.659> selected<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.320> i<00:01:32.470> left

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
which values were selected and i left

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.789 
which values were selected and i left
left<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.670> with<00:01:33.880> those<00:01:34.030> are<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:34.659> these<00:01:35.560> are<00:01:35.770> the

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
left it with those are so these are the

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.390 
left it with those are so these are the
values<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.549> I<00:01:37.229> basic<00:01:38.229> chose<00:01:38.500> based<00:01:39.040> on<00:01:39.250> those

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
values I I basic chose based on those

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.500 
values I I basic chose based on those
animations<00:01:39.820> those<00:01:40.360> renders<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:42.330> you're<00:01:43.330> not

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
animations those renders and you're not

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.740 
animations those renders and you're not
at<00:01:43.869> all<00:01:44.409> men's<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:45.010> exactly<00:01:45.670> replicate<00:01:45.760> of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
at all men's to exactly replicate of

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.469 
at all men's to exactly replicate of
these<00:01:47.229> values<00:01:47.439> for<00:01:47.830> garments<00:01:48.400> to<00:01:48.610> go<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.299> the

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
these values for garments to go to the

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.170 
these values for garments to go to the
same<00:01:49.689> process<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.380> choose<00:01:50.950> whichever<00:01:51.369> you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
same process and choose whichever you

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.700 
same process and choose whichever you
know<00:01:52.270> which<00:01:52.659> are<00:01:52.990> which<00:01:54.390> ever<00:01:55.390> result<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.350> you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
know which are which ever result you you

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.679 
know which are which ever result you you
like<00:01:56.920> best<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:57.820> know<00:01:57.850> go<00:01:58.270> through<00:01:58.540> the

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
like best and you know go through the

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.050 
like best and you know go through the
project<00:01:58.900> process<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.799> that<00:02:00.250> is<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:00.909> way<00:02:01.000> you

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
project process and that is the way you

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.880 
project process and that is the way you
learn<00:02:01.360> you<00:02:01.630> won't<00:02:01.869> learn<00:02:02.080> anything<00:02:02.470> if<00:02:02.770> you

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
learn you won't learn anything if you

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.310 
learn you won't learn anything if you
just<00:02:02.920> do<00:02:03.490> everything<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:04.090> do<00:02:04.150> enter<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.960> exact

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
numbers I do but so this is this is it

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.349

so sorry so right now we pretty much
have<00:02:13.749> our<00:02:13.959> caustic<00:02:14.560> set

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
have our caustic set

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.190 
have our caustic set
and<00:02:16.300> let's<00:02:17.300> look<00:02:17.480> at<00:02:17.659> this<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:19.510> actually<00:02:20.510> really

like how they look only right now
they're<00:02:23.299> very<00:02:23.510> very<00:02:24.260> well<00:02:25.069> resolution<00:02:25.670> when<00:02:25.819> I

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
they're very very well resolution when I

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.240 
they're very very well resolution when I
try<00:02:26.599> to<00:02:26.629> undo<00:02:27.019> them<00:02:27.200> with<00:02:27.440> high<00:02:27.650> resolution

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
try to undo them with high resolution

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.270 
try to undo them with high resolution
that<00:02:28.370> they<00:02:28.700> look<00:02:28.909> much<00:02:29.120> better<00:02:29.470> but<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.709> don't

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
that they look much better but I don't

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.100 
that they look much better but I don't
like<00:02:31.430> white<00:02:31.610> one<00:02:31.940> thing<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.360> don't<00:02:32.480> like<00:02:32.780> this

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
like white one thing I don't like this

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.229 
like white one thing I don't like this
big<00:02:33.440> circle<00:02:33.890> on<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.459> big<00:02:34.670> circle<00:02:35.060> is

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
big circle on this big circle is

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.380 
big circle on this big circle is
projected<00:02:36.230> by<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.530> one<00:02:37.519> light<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.180> middle

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
projected by the one light in the middle

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.720 
projected by the one light in the middle
if<00:02:38.690> we<00:02:38.959> turn<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.319> off<00:02:41.170> now<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.230> will<00:02:42.829> see<00:02:42.860> the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
if we turn it off now you will see the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.199 
if we turn it off now you will see the
circle<00:02:44.329> isn't<00:02:44.629> there<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.769> want<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.760> circle

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
circle isn't there so I want that circle

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.920 
circle isn't there so I want that circle
to<00:02:47.420> be<00:02:47.569> less<00:02:48.280> less<00:02:49.280> intense<00:02:49.730> not<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.629> have<00:02:50.780> so

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
to be less less intense not to have so

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.119 
to be less less intense not to have so
much<00:02:51.049> intensity<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:52.040> will<00:02:52.310> unlink<00:02:52.849> that<00:02:53.480> I

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
much intensity so I will unlink that I

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.289 
much intensity so I will unlink that I
will<00:02:55.129> go<00:02:55.280> into<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.640> expresso<00:02:56.120> tag<00:02:56.359> and<00:02:56.620> unlink

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
will go into the expresso tag and unlink

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.960 
will go into the expresso tag and unlink
whichever<00:02:59.299> this<00:02:59.540> one<00:02:59.810> is<00:03:00.049> I<00:03:00.579> think<00:03:01.579> it<00:03:01.819> should

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
whichever this one is I think it should

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.589 
whichever this one is I think it should
always<00:03:02.299> be<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.840> last<00:03:02.989> one<00:03:03.379> so<00:03:04.299> there<00:03:05.299> is<00:03:05.480> our

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
always be the last one so there is our

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.900 
always be the last one so there is our
caustics<00:03:07.030> strength<00:03:08.739> so<00:03:09.739> let's<00:03:09.980> unlink<00:03:10.519> this

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
caustics strength so let's unlink this

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.410 
caustics strength so let's unlink this
last<00:03:11.359> one<00:03:11.799> surface<00:03:12.799> energy<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.030> should<00:03:14.269> be

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
last one surface energy that should be

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.610 
last one surface energy that should be
it<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:15.340> now<00:03:16.340> let's<00:03:17.120> change<00:03:17.480> us<00:03:17.780> try<00:03:18.140> this<00:03:18.200> if

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
it and now let's change us try this if

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.229 
it and now let's change us try this if
we<00:03:18.859> enter<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:19.250> different<00:03:19.430> value<00:03:21.099> right<00:03:22.099> here

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
we enter a different value right here

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.190 
we enter a different value right here
now<00:03:23.239> enter<00:03:24.079> 20<00:03:24.819> go<00:03:25.819> here<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.359> should<00:03:26.599> stay<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.169> I

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
now enter 20 go here it should stay so I

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.589 
now enter 20 go here it should stay so I
disconnected<00:03:28.099> the<00:03:28.160> right<00:03:28.400> one<00:03:28.609> so<00:03:29.389> now<00:03:29.540> you

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
disconnected the right one so now you

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.940 
disconnected the right one so now you
can<00:03:29.840> put<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.410> lower<00:03:30.620> number<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.220> try<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.000> again

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
can put a lower number and try it again

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.370 
can put a lower number and try it again
until<00:03:34.000> we<00:03:35.000> have<00:03:35.329> some<00:03:35.599> pleasing<00:03:35.870> results

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
until we have some pleasing results

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.960 
until we have some pleasing results
lights<00:03:36.590> maybe<00:03:36.859> increase<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.459> photons<00:03:37.880> a

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
lights maybe increase the photons a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.610 
lights maybe increase the photons a
little<00:03:38.150> bit<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:38.419> we<00:03:38.810> have<00:03:38.989> actually<00:03:39.410> something

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
little bit so we have actually something

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.770 
little bit so we have actually something
nice<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.160> look<00:03:40.190> at<00:03:40.459> oh<00:03:42.639> right<00:03:43.639> here<00:03:43.819> the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
nice to look at oh right here the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.990 
nice to look at oh right here the
photons<00:03:45.230> ice<00:03:45.410> next<00:03:45.919> Oh<00:03:46.040> needs<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.430> enter<00:03:46.700> an

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
photons ice next Oh needs to enter an

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.789 
photons ice next Oh needs to enter an
here<00:03:47.180> in<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.510> rig<00:03:47.739> but<00:03:48.739> let's<00:03:49.130> check<00:03:49.430> this<00:03:49.549> out

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
here in the rig but let's check this out

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.250 
here in the rig but let's check this out
they<00:03:51.799> are<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.160> taking<00:03:52.549> a<00:03:52.609> little<00:03:52.700> bit<00:03:52.849> longer

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
they are is taking a little bit longer

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.309 
they are is taking a little bit longer
open<00:03:54.260> link<00:03:54.470> up<00:03:56.500> let's<00:03:57.500> see<00:03:57.919> and<00:03:58.359> also<00:03:59.359> their

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
open link up let's see and also their

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.770 
open link up let's see and also their
the<00:04:00.680> reflections<00:04:01.280> are<00:04:01.549> nice<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.269> everything

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
the reflections are nice and everything

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.110 
the reflections are nice and everything
so<00:04:03.349> it's<00:04:03.530> it's<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:03.919> best<00:04:04.190> match<00:04:04.430> between<00:04:04.819> you

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
so it's it's the best match between you

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.640 
so it's it's the best match between you
know<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.419> caustics<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:07.489> reflections<00:04:08.650> so

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
know the caustics and the reflections so

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.430 
know the caustics and the reflections so
let's<00:04:09.889> look<00:04:10.040> at<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.900> this<00:04:11.900> is<00:04:12.079> actually

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
let's look at this this is actually

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.349 
let's look at this this is actually
pretty<00:04:12.680> nice<00:04:14.769> maybe<00:04:15.769> maybe<00:04:16.340> maybe<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.880> want<00:04:17.299> to

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
pretty nice maybe maybe maybe I want to

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.719 
pretty nice maybe maybe maybe I want to
take<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.930> whole<00:04:18.169> thing<00:04:18.440> down<00:04:18.979> a<00:04:19.370> little<00:04:19.519> bit

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
take the whole thing down a little bit

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:26.560 
take the whole thing down a little bit
so<00:04:19.970> let's<00:04:20.180> try<00:04:20.449> maybe<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:22.479> 15<00:04:23.479> for<00:04:24.880> all<00:04:25.880> done

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
so let's try maybe the 15 for all done

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.950 
so let's try maybe the 15 for all done
at<00:04:26.950> five<00:04:27.950> four

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
at five four

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.320 
at five four
or<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.290> middle<00:04:30.680> light<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.490> let's<00:04:31.940> try<00:04:32.150> that

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
or the middle light so let's try that

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.720 
or the middle light so let's try that
again<00:04:35.500> like<00:04:36.500> everything<00:04:37.100> else<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.490> don't

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
again like everything else you don't

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.330 
again like everything else you don't
want<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.120> overdo<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.650> effect<00:04:40.070> the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
want to overdo the the effect the

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.390 
want to overdo the the effect the
caustics<00:04:40.880> are<00:04:41.060> there<00:04:41.360> because<00:04:41.690> if<00:04:42.440> they're

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
caustics are there because if they're

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.130 
caustics are there because if they're
not<00:04:43.580> there<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:44.180> image<00:04:44.450> will<00:04:44.690> look<00:04:44.720> kind<00:04:45.080> of

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
not there the image will look kind of

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.030 
not there the image will look kind of
dirty<00:04:45.410> know<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.950> grass<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.930> will<00:04:48.170> see<00:04:48.800> that

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
dirty know the grass you will see that

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.100 
dirty know the grass you will see that
there<00:04:49.310> is<00:04:49.370> something<00:04:49.730> missing<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.510> that<00:04:50.750> the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
there is something missing and that the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.500 
there is something missing and that the
glass<00:04:51.290> just<00:04:52.100> looks<00:04:52.310> weird<00:04:52.550> as<00:04:52.940> it's<00:04:53.150> just

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
glass just looks weird as it's just

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.050 
glass just looks weird as it's just
sitting<00:04:53.840> on<00:04:54.140> that<00:04:54.380> surface<00:04:54.650> but<00:04:55.520> anyway<00:04:55.880> this

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
sitting on that surface but anyway this

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.530 
sitting on that surface but anyway this
is<00:04:56.240> very<00:04:56.630> nice<00:04:56.840> like<00:04:57.110> this<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.380> lot<00:04:58.330> I'm<00:04:59.330> not

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
is very nice like this a lot I'm not

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.990 
is very nice like this a lot I'm not
sure<00:04:59.600> if<00:04:59.870> maybe<00:05:00.320> maybe<00:05:00.680> these<00:05:01.280> caustics<00:05:01.790> all

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
sure if maybe maybe these caustics all

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.440 
sure if maybe maybe these caustics all
are<00:05:02.270> still<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:02.900> little<00:05:03.140> strong<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:04.070> might<00:05:05.030> try<00:05:05.300> to

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
are still a little strong I might try to

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.400 
are still a little strong I might try to
put<00:05:06.230> them<00:05:06.440> down<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.370> 10<00:05:07.700> perhaps<00:05:08.390> how<00:05:09.140> much<00:05:09.260> is

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
put them down to 10 perhaps how much is

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.980 
put them down to 10 perhaps how much is
this<00:05:09.590> one<00:05:09.800> fine<00:05:10.300> let's<00:05:11.300> try<00:05:11.480> to<00:05:11.540> run<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:11.780> us

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
this one fine let's try to run it us

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
this one fine let's try to run it us
again<00:05:12.290> anyway<00:05:14.230> you<00:05:15.230> don't<00:05:15.380> want<00:05:15.650> to<00:05:15.770> overdo

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
again anyway you don't want to overdo

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.250 
again anyway you don't want to overdo
the<00:05:16.310> caustics<00:05:16.730> you<00:05:16.850> know<00:05:16.940> they're<00:05:17.330> meant<00:05:18.170> to

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
the caustics you know they're meant to

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.290 
the caustics you know they're meant to
be<00:05:18.410> subtle<00:05:18.770> as<00:05:19.040> any<00:05:19.400> effect<00:05:19.940> you're<00:05:20.090> ever

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
be subtle as any effect you're ever

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.410 
be subtle as any effect you're ever
doing<00:05:20.890> they're<00:05:21.890> just<00:05:21.920> these<00:05:22.400> little<00:05:22.700> hints<00:05:23.240> at

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
doing they're just these little hints at

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.680 
doing they're just these little hints at
reality<00:05:24.170> and<00:05:24.410> I<00:05:25.000> see<00:05:26.000> all<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.360> time<00:05:26.540> for

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
reality and I see all the time for

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.600 
reality and I see all the time for
example<00:05:27.110> people<00:05:27.290> over<00:05:27.650> doing<00:05:27.890> depth<00:05:28.130> of<00:05:28.280> field

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
example people over doing depth of field

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.560 
example people over doing depth of field
which<00:05:29.510> always<00:05:29.960> can<00:05:30.770> ruin<00:05:31.730> the<00:05:31.970> animation<00:05:32.450> if

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
which always can ruin the animation if

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.170 
which always can ruin the animation if
you<00:05:32.690> just<00:05:32.960> add<00:05:33.380> a<00:05:33.410> little<00:05:34.010> bit<00:05:34.160> of<00:05:34.220> any<00:05:34.760> effect

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
you just add a little bit of any effect

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.440 
you just add a little bit of any effect
it's<00:05:35.480> its<00:05:35.750> best<00:05:36.050> so<00:05:37.040> I<00:05:37.250> think<00:05:37.370> this<00:05:37.670> right<00:05:38.210> here

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
it's its best so I think this right here

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.760 
it's its best so I think this right here
isn't<00:05:38.780> very<00:05:38.870> nice<00:05:40.210> and<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.930> is<00:05:42.050> very<00:05:42.140> nice<00:05:42.470> so

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
isn't very nice and that is very nice so

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.950 
isn't very nice and that is very nice so
that's<00:05:43.460> our<00:05:43.700> caustics<00:05:44.150> were<00:05:44.330> set<00:05:44.660> on<00:05:44.690> our

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
that's our caustics were set on our

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.500 
that's our caustics were set on our
caustics<00:05:45.680> and<00:05:46.070> now<00:05:47.590> we<00:05:48.590> need<00:05:48.620> to<00:05:49.450> let's<00:05:50.450> just

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
caustics and now we need to let's just

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.630 
caustics and now we need to let's just
turn<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:51.200> turn<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.620> caustics<00:05:51.980> off<00:05:52.130> so<00:05:52.370> we<00:05:52.490> can

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
turn the turn the caustics off so we can

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.270 
turn the turn the caustics off so we can
have<00:05:52.850> a<00:05:53.180> quikr<00:05:53.540> Revere<00:05:54.140> angers<00:05:54.500> and<00:05:54.740> now<00:05:55.220> we

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
have a quikr Revere angers and now we

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.020 
have a quikr Revere angers and now we
want<00:05:55.730> to<00:05:56.060> determine<00:05:56.390> our<00:05:57.580> white<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:58.820> San

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
want to determine our white and San

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.520 
want to determine our white and San
infancy<00:05:59.620> and<00:06:00.620> also<00:06:01.310> as<00:06:01.580> we<00:06:01.880> rendered<00:06:02.780> last

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
infancy and also as we rendered last

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.500 
infancy and also as we rendered last
time<00:06:03.770> when<00:06:04.010> we<00:06:04.040> are<00:06:04.220> rendering<00:06:04.610> rendering<00:06:05.120> the

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
time when we are rendering rendering the

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.690 
time when we are rendering rendering the
previews<00:06:05.960> in<00:06:05.990> this<00:06:06.440> this<00:06:06.770> view<00:06:07.040> you<00:06:07.340> need<00:06:07.550> to

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
previews in this this view you need to

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.840 
previews in this this view you need to
go<00:06:07.910> back<00:06:08.240> the<00:06:08.690> main<00:06:08.870> n<00:06:09.260> 1<00:06:09.530> and<00:06:09.710> use<00:06:09.980> this<00:06:10.010> as<00:06:10.460> an

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
go back the main n 1 and use this as an

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.040 
go back the main n 1 and use this as an
interview<00:06:11.300> just<00:06:11.480> as<00:06:12.410> you<00:06:13.010> know<00:06:13.100> when<00:06:13.310> we'll<00:06:13.880> be

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
interview just as you know when we'll be

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.230 
interview just as you know when we'll be
doing<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.080> final<00:06:15.500> render<00:06:15.950> we<00:06:16.310> want<00:06:16.730> don't

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
doing the final render we want don't

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.560 
doing the final render we want don't
want<00:06:17.480> to<00:06:17.570> be<00:06:17.690> rendered<00:06:18.820> anyway<00:06:19.820> I<00:06:20.000> think<00:06:20.300> this

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
want to be rendered anyway I think this

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.300 
want to be rendered anyway I think this
might<00:06:20.900> be<00:06:21.320> pretty<00:06:21.800> nice<00:06:23.320> perhaps<00:06:24.320> the

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
might be pretty nice perhaps the

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.330 
might be pretty nice perhaps the
lighting<00:06:25.820> could<00:06:26.150> be<00:06:26.300> stronger<00:06:27.010> nice<00:06:28.010> maybe

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
lighting could be stronger nice maybe

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.010 
lighting could be stronger nice maybe
try<00:06:28.760> up<00:06:28.910> a<00:06:29.150> little<00:06:29.390> bit<00:06:29.510> more<00:06:29.720> 225<00:06:30.620> perhaps<00:06:32.020> for

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
try up a little bit more 225 perhaps for

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.310 
try up a little bit more 225 perhaps for
the<00:06:33.230> intensity<00:06:33.830> let's<00:06:34.160> check<00:06:34.370> this<00:06:34.520> out<00:06:38.320> and

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
the intensity let's check this out and

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.700 
the intensity let's check this out and
I'm<00:06:39.770> not<00:06:39.830> sure<00:06:40.010> maybe<00:06:40.490> I<00:06:40.640> will<00:06:40.970> too<00:06:41.240> much

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
I'm not sure maybe I will too much

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.510 
I'm not sure maybe I will too much
as<00:06:42.640> just<00:06:43.180> put<00:06:43.390> two<00:06:43.600> done<00:06:43.870> no<00:06:44.470> just<00:06:45.130> a<00:06:45.280> little

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
as just put two done no just a little

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:53.580 
as just put two done no just a little
bit<00:06:45.670> extra<00:06:46.180> light<00:06:46.600> I<00:06:49.500> think<00:06:50.500> this<00:06:50.590> is<00:06:50.650> okay<00:06:51.040> now
