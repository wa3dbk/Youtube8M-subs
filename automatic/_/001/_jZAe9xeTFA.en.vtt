this<00:00:03.629> segment<00:00:04.049> let's<00:00:04.259> go<00:00:04.410> ahead<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.890> discuss

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
this segment let's go ahead and discuss

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.309 
this segment let's go ahead and discuss
significant<00:00:06.000> figures<00:00:06.330> or<00:00:06.540> as<00:00:07.109> you've

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
significant figures or as you've

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.870 
significant figures or as you've
probably<00:00:07.500> heard<00:00:07.890> they're<00:00:08.220> more<00:00:08.670> likely

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
probably heard they're more likely

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.060 
probably heard they're more likely
called<00:00:09.269> sig<00:00:09.599> figs<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.620> something<00:00:10.920> that's

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
called sig figs this is something that's

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.640 
called sig figs this is something that's
going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> come<00:00:11.460> up<00:00:11.519> throughout<00:00:12.030> your

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
going to come up throughout your

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.780 
going to come up throughout your
scientific<00:00:13.650> career<00:00:14.040> as<00:00:14.219> long<00:00:14.460> as<00:00:14.610> you're

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
scientific career as long as you're

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.029 
scientific career as long as you're
doing<00:00:14.990> chemistry<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.320> physics<00:00:16.680> or<00:00:16.890> anything

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
doing chemistry and physics or anything

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.740 
doing chemistry and physics or anything
of<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.279> nature<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.850> you're<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.600> want

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
of that nature so you're going to want

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.150 
of that nature so you're going to want
to<00:00:18.779> go<00:00:18.900> ahead<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.439> your<00:00:19.560> best<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:20.010> get<00:00:20.100> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
to go ahead and do your best to get a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.670 
to go ahead and do your best to get a
handle<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.580> understanding<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.510> sig<00:00:21.810> figs<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
handle on understanding of sig figs the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.140 
handle on understanding of sig figs the
beautiful<00:00:23.039> part<00:00:23.220> about<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.789> there

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
beautiful part about this is that there

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.750 
beautiful part about this is that there
are<00:00:24.269> actually<00:00:24.720> some<00:00:24.750> rules<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.590> very<00:00:26.519> few

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
are actually some rules and very few

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000 
are actually some rules and very few
exceptions<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.859> with

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
exceptions so that if you do it with

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.980 
exceptions so that if you do it with
practice<00:00:29.279> over<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.849> over<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.269> should<00:00:30.720> become

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
practice over and over it should become

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.290 
practice over and over it should become
second<00:00:31.380> nature<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:33.149> do

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
second nature for you so we do

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.880 
second nature for you so we do
significant<00:00:33.899> figures<00:00:34.170> because<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.649> need<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
significant figures because we need to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530 
significant figures because we need to
account<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.610> degree<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.030> uncertainty

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
account for the degree of uncertainty

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.200 
account for the degree of uncertainty
and<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.469> final<00:00:37.710> numerical<00:00:38.340> result<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.120> if

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and a final numerical result so if

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.490 
and a final numerical result so if
you're<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> laboratory<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.200> you've<00:00:40.320> got<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
you're in a laboratory and you've got a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.080 
you're in a laboratory and you've got a
bunch<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.800> measurements<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> want<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
bunch of measurements and you want to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.750 
bunch of measurements and you want to
add<00:00:42.180> them<00:00:42.360> together<00:00:42.950> to<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> final<00:00:44.280> result

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
add them together to get a final result

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.220 
add them together to get a final result
you<00:00:45.180> want<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> make<00:00:45.510> sure<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.050> final

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
you want to make sure that your final

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.049 
you want to make sure that your final
result<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.860> accurate<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:47.789> initial

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
result is as accurate as your initial

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.959 
result is as accurate as your initial
measurements<00:00:48.930> where<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> let's<00:00:50.610> start<00:00:50.850> with

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
measurements where so let's start with

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:51.529 
measurements where so let's start with
the<00:00:51.120> rules

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the rules

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.959 
the rules
the<00:00:51.960> first<00:00:52.199> rule<00:00:52.500> applies<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.309> nonzero

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the first rule applies to nonzero

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.450 
the first rule applies to nonzero
integers<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.050> non<00:00:55.320> zero<00:00:55.590> zero<00:00:56.010> integers

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
integers so non zero zero integers

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.270 
integers so non zero zero integers
always<00:00:57.120> count<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.690> sig<00:00:58.050> figs<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
always count as sig figs so if I have a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.970 
always count as sig figs so if I have a
number<00:00:59.640> one<00:01:00.059> two<00:01:00.300> three<00:01:00.629> four<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:01.079> four<00:01:01.739> those

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
number one two three four all four those

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.690 
number one two three four all four those
numbers<00:01:02.309> will<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.609> significant<00:01:03.210> figures

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
numbers will be significant figures

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.390 
numbers will be significant figures
secondly<00:01:05.700> zeros<00:01:06.450> zeros<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
secondly zeros zeros are going to be the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.760 
secondly zeros zeros are going to be the
largest<00:01:08.909> source<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.270> complication<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.439> there

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
largest source of complication so there

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.130 
largest source of complication so there
are<00:01:10.890> three<00:01:11.159> classes<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.909> zeros<00:01:12.540> when<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.900> comes

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
are three classes of zeros when it comes

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.830 
are three classes of zeros when it comes
to<00:01:13.320> counting<00:01:13.650> sig<00:01:13.950> figs<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.790> first<00:01:15.090> applies

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
to counting sig figs the first applies

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.649 
to counting sig figs the first applies
to<00:01:16.200> leading<00:01:16.860> zeros<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.759> those<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> zeros

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
to leading zeros so those are the zeros

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.320 
to leading zeros so those are the zeros
that<00:01:18.840> precede<00:01:19.350> nonzero<00:01:20.130> digits<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.880> those

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that precede nonzero digits and those

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.410 
that precede nonzero digits and those
guys<00:01:21.540> never<00:01:22.110> count<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.860> sig<00:01:23.310> figs<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:24.150> just

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
guys never count as sig figs they just

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.270 
guys never count as sig figs they just
indicate<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> position<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.890> decimal

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
indicate the position of the decimal

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
indicate the position of the decimal
point<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:27.240> instance<00:01:27.630> zero<00:01:28.290> point<00:01:28.619> zero

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
point so for instance zero point zero

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.789 
point so for instance zero point zero
zero<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.400> two<00:01:29.909> three<00:01:30.270> these<00:01:31.020> zeros<00:01:31.500> are<00:01:31.680> all

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
zero one two three these zeros are all

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.770 
zero one two three these zeros are all
leading<00:01:32.220> zeros<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:33.030> never<00:01:33.360> count<00:01:33.659> as

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
leading zeros they never count as

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
leading zeros they never count as
significant<00:01:34.320> figures<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.400> number<00:01:35.700> only

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
significant figures so this number only

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
significant figures so this number only
has<00:01:36.119> three<00:01:36.689> significant<00:01:37.290> figures<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.040> only

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
has three significant figures so only

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.719 
has three significant figures so only
the<00:01:38.460> nonzero<00:01:38.640> integers<00:01:39.420> count<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:41.310> second

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the nonzero integers count the second

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.999 
the nonzero integers count the second
are<00:01:41.880> captive<00:01:42.540> zeros<00:01:42.869> those<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> zeros

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
are captive zeros those are the zeros

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.399 
are captive zeros those are the zeros
that<00:01:44.189> fall<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.610> between<00:01:44.810> nonzero<00:01:45.810> digits<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
that fall in between nonzero digits and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.670 
that fall in between nonzero digits and
those<00:01:46.829> guys<00:01:47.100> always<00:01:47.430> count<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.299> sig<00:01:48.720> figs<00:01:49.049> for

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
those guys always count as sig figs for

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.950 
those guys always count as sig figs for
instance<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.250> had<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.640> number<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.630> point

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
instance if you had the number one point

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.499 
instance if you had the number one point
zero<00:01:52.320> zero<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.770> two<00:01:53.280> you're<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> have

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
zero zero one two you're going to have

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.630 
zero zero one two you're going to have
five<00:01:54.780> significant<00:01:55.470> figures<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.520> these

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
five significant figures so all of these

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760 
five significant figures so all of these
numbers<00:01:56.820> are<00:01:57.229> significant<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:58.409> these

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
numbers are significant because these

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.580 
numbers are significant because these
zeros<00:01:59.130> are<00:01:59.450> captivated<00:02:00.450> basically<00:02:00.899> by<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
zeros are captivated basically by the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.389 
zeros are captivated basically by the
nonzero<00:02:01.799> integers<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.729> either<00:02:03.299> end<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:05.219> third

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
nonzero integers on either end the third

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.150 
nonzero integers on either end the third
class<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.909> zeros<00:02:06.270> are<00:02:06.540> trailing<00:02:07.259> zeros<00:02:07.590> so

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
class of zeros are trailing zeros so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.279 
class of zeros are trailing zeros so
these<00:02:08.340> guys<00:02:08.580> are<00:02:08.640> zeros<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.720> end<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
these guys are zeros at the end of the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.500 
these guys are zeros at the end of the
number<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.770> they're<00:02:11.280> significant<00:02:11.940> only<00:02:12.330> if

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
number and they're significant only if

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.920 
number and they're significant only if
the<00:02:12.629> numb

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the numb

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.709 
the numb
is<00:02:13.049> written<00:02:13.409> with<00:02:13.799> a<00:02:14.010> decimal<00:02:14.489> point<00:02:14.549> so<00:02:15.450> for

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719 
is written with a decimal point so for

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.170 
is written with a decimal point so for
instance<00:02:16.079> if<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.439> have<00:02:16.670> 1,000<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:17.939> written

so if you've got 100 Witten one zero

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.990 
so if you've got 100 Witten one zero
zero<00:03:26.389> that's<00:03:27.389> got<00:03:27.690> three<00:03:28.049> sig<00:03:28.290> figs<00:03:28.319> if<00:03:29.000> you

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
have to actually do significant figures

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.240 
have to actually do significant figures
in<00:03:45.299> some<00:03:45.900> calculations<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.739> let's<00:03:46.919> discuss

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
in some calculations so let's discuss

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.429 
in some calculations so let's discuss
how<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.579> applies<00:03:47.849> to<00:03:48.180> multiplication<00:03:49.019> and

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
how it applies to multiplication and

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.249 
how it applies to multiplication and
division<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:49.919> addition<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:51.000> subtraction<00:03:51.509> so

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:52.259 
division and addition and subtraction so

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.110 
division and addition and subtraction so
for<00:03:52.470> multiplication<00:03:52.859> and<00:03:53.189> division<00:03:53.639> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
for multiplication and division the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.420 
for multiplication and division the
number<00:03:54.389> of<00:03:54.540> sig<00:03:54.750> figs<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.199> the<00:03:55.259> result<00:03:55.799> is<00:03:55.979> the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
number of sig figs and the result is the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.280 
number of sig figs and the result is the
same<00:03:56.459> number<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.509> in<00:03:57.689> the<00:03:57.810> measurement

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
same number as that in the measurement

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.949 
same number as that in the measurement
with<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.680> smallest<00:03:59.129> number<00:03:59.609> of<00:03:59.790> sig<00:04:00.090> figs<00:04:00.120> so

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
with the smallest number of sig figs so

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.420 
with the smallest number of sig figs so
we<00:04:01.079> call<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.470> number<00:04:01.769> with<00:04:02.009> the<00:04:02.159> smallest

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
we call the number with the smallest

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.580 
we call the number with the smallest
number<00:04:02.759> of<00:04:02.879> sig<00:04:03.090> figs<00:04:03.359> basically<00:04:04.229> you're

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
number of sig figs basically you're

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.619 
number of sig figs basically you're
limiting<00:04:05.040> term<00:04:05.310> okay<00:04:05.879> so<00:04:05.939> you're<00:04:06.209> limited<00:04:06.359> by

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
limiting term okay so you're limited by

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.740 
limiting term okay so you're limited by
how<00:04:06.989> many<00:04:07.049> by<00:04:07.560> how<00:04:07.709> accurate<00:04:08.280> your<00:04:08.759> smallest

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
how many by how accurate your smallest

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.140 
how many by how accurate your smallest
measurement<00:04:10.379> is<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.340> for<00:04:11.519> instance<00:04:11.849> here<00:04:12.030> I've

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
measurement is so for instance here I've

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.749 
measurement is so for instance here I've
written<00:04:12.299> five<00:04:12.959> point<00:04:13.319> one<00:04:13.560> six<00:04:13.799> times<00:04:14.430> one

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:14.759 
written five point one six times one

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.069 
written five point one six times one
point<00:04:15.030> three<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.720> you're<00:04:15.810> going<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:15.989> be

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
point three so you're going to be

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.620 
point three so you're going to be
limited<00:04:16.229> by<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.829> two<00:04:17.159> sig<00:04:17.430> figs<00:04:17.459> here<00:04:17.909> in<00:04:18.090> 1.3

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
limited by the two sig figs here in 1.3

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.839 
limited by the two sig figs here in 1.3
so<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.709> answer<00:04:20.009> as<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> result<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.759> this

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
so the answer as a result of this

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.089 
so the answer as a result of this
multiplication<00:04:21.029> is<00:04:21.750> six<00:04:22.349> point<00:04:22.680> seven<00:04:22.919> zero

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
multiplication is six point seven zero

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.640 
multiplication is six point seven zero
eight<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:24.330> something<00:04:24.719> to<00:04:24.840> note<00:04:24.960> here<00:04:25.169> too<00:04:25.440> is

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
eight so something to note here too is

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.879 
eight so something to note here too is
that<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.340> want<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.610> write

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
that you want to write

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.249 
that you want to write
all<00:04:27.099> the<00:04:27.370> digits<00:04:27.729> first<00:04:28.180> before<00:04:28.539> you<00:04:28.990> round

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
all the digits first before you round

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.929 
all the digits first before you round
otherwise<00:04:29.889> you're<00:04:30.310> not<00:04:30.430> going<00:04:30.639> to<00:04:30.699> be<00:04:30.819> as

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:30.939 
otherwise you're not going to be as

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.719 
otherwise you're not going to be as
accurate<00:04:31.150> in<00:04:31.479> your<00:04:31.629> final<00:04:31.990> measurement<00:04:32.550> so<00:04:33.550> if

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
accurate in your final measurement so if

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.999 
accurate in your final measurement so if
we're<00:04:33.969> dividing<00:04:34.289> let's<00:04:35.289> say<00:04:35.439> we<00:04:35.590> have<00:04:35.740> five

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
we're dividing let's say we have five

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.760 
we're dividing let's say we have five
point<00:04:36.310> one<00:04:36.460> six<00:04:36.759> eight<00:04:36.930> divided<00:04:37.930> by<00:04:38.050> one<00:04:38.529> point

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
point one six eight divided by one point

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.279 
point one six eight divided by one point
four<00:04:39.069> three<00:04:39.400> so<00:04:40.029> one<00:04:40.270> point<00:04:40.479> four<00:04:40.779> three<00:04:41.020> is

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
four three so one point four three is

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.350 
four three so one point four three is
going<00:04:41.499> to<00:04:41.560> be<00:04:41.680> our<00:04:41.800> limiting<00:04:42.249> term<00:04:42.460> meaning<00:04:43.270> we

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
going to be our limiting term meaning we

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.999 
going to be our limiting term meaning we
can<00:04:43.509> only<00:04:43.689> have<00:04:43.960> three<00:04:44.319> significant<00:04:44.979> figures

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
can only have three significant figures

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.029 
can only have three significant figures
in<00:04:45.460> our<00:04:45.669> final<00:04:46.090> answer<00:04:46.210> so<00:04:47.139> the<00:04:47.560> result<00:04:47.919> of

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
in our final answer so the result of

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.399 
in our final answer so the result of
this<00:04:48.189> division<00:04:48.699> is<00:04:48.849> three<00:04:49.599> point<00:04:49.870> six<00:04:50.110> one

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
this division is three point six one

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.920 
this division is three point six one
three<00:04:50.650> nine<00:04:50.979> eight<00:04:51.249> six<00:04:51.729> zero<00:04:52.029> one<00:04:52.120> all<00:04:52.539> the

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
three nine eight six zero one all the

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.239 
three nine eight six zero one all the
numbers<00:04:53.199> that<00:04:53.349> showed<00:04:53.499> up<00:04:53.620> on<00:04:53.710> my<00:04:53.830> calculator

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:54.249 
numbers that showed up on my calculator

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:56.790 
numbers that showed up on my calculator
and<00:04:54.430> then<00:04:55.090> I<00:04:55.150> will<00:04:55.330> round<00:04:55.509> that<00:04:55.779> down<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.349> three

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
and then I will round that down to three

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.980 
and then I will round that down to three
sig<00:04:57.009> figs<00:04:57.310> which<00:04:57.849> would<00:04:58.029> be<00:04:58.150> three<00:04:58.449> point<00:04:58.719> six

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
sig figs which would be three point six

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.709 
sig figs which would be three point six
one<00:04:59.289> again<00:05:00.069> I'm<00:05:00.340> limited<00:05:00.879> by<00:05:01.090> my<00:05:01.300> limiting

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:01.719 
one again I'm limited by my limiting

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:04.230 
one again I'm limited by my limiting
term<00:05:01.900> which<00:05:02.139> had<00:05:02.319> three<00:05:02.620> sig<00:05:02.860> figs<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:04.000> let's

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
term which had three sig figs so let's

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.170 
term which had three sig figs so let's
lastly<00:05:04.900> do<00:05:05.110> addition<00:05:05.979> and<00:05:06.129> subtraction<00:05:06.669> so

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
lastly do addition and subtraction so

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.760 
lastly do addition and subtraction so
it's<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:07.419> little<00:05:07.569> bit<00:05:07.779> different<00:05:08.020> as<00:05:08.289> the

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
it's a little bit different as the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.740 
it's a little bit different as the
limiting<00:05:09.159> term<00:05:09.370> here<00:05:09.849> is<00:05:09.969> the<00:05:10.240> one<00:05:10.449> with<00:05:10.629> the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
limiting term here is the one with the

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.709 
limiting term here is the one with the
smallest<00:05:11.050> number<00:05:11.259> of<00:05:11.469> decimal<00:05:12.340> places<00:05:12.370> so<00:05:12.909> if

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:13.719 
smallest number of decimal places so if

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.920 
smallest number of decimal places so if
I<00:05:13.870> had<00:05:14.110> 16<00:05:14.919> point<00:05:15.219> one<00:05:15.430> five<00:05:15.639> fourteen<00:05:16.629> point

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
I had 16 point one five fourteen point

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.499 
I had 16 point one five fourteen point
one<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:17.379> one<00:05:18.009> point<00:05:18.279> zero<00:05:18.339> six<00:05:18.819> and<00:05:19.120> I'm

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
one and one point zero six and I'm

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.119 
one and one point zero six and I'm
adding<00:05:19.779> them<00:05:19.870> together<00:05:20.080> I'm<00:05:20.800> going<00:05:20.949> to<00:05:21.039> be

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
adding them together I'm going to be

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.369 
adding them together I'm going to be
limited<00:05:21.490> by<00:05:21.550> fourteen<00:05:22.150> point<00:05:22.449> one<00:05:22.509> because<00:05:23.229> it

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
limited by fourteen point one because it

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:26.129 
limited by fourteen point one because it
only<00:05:23.529> has<00:05:23.770> one<00:05:24.069> decimal<00:05:24.879> place<00:05:25.060> so<00:05:25.389> then<00:05:26.020> my

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
only has one decimal place so then my

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.920 
only has one decimal place so then my
answer<00:05:26.319> on<00:05:26.710> my<00:05:26.740> calculator<00:05:27.249> would<00:05:27.490> become<00:05:27.930> 31

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
answer on my calculator would become 31

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.350 
answer on my calculator would become 31
point<00:05:29.229> two<00:05:29.439> six<00:05:29.680> six<00:05:29.949> and<00:05:30.249> I<00:05:30.759> would<00:05:30.939> round<00:05:31.150> that

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
point two six six and I would round that

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.929 
point two six six and I would round that
to<00:05:31.659> thirty<00:05:31.930> one<00:05:32.169> point<00:05:32.349> three<00:05:32.589> because<00:05:33.550> again

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:33.939 
to thirty one point three because again

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.640 
to thirty one point three because again
I'm<00:05:34.120> limited<00:05:34.569> in<00:05:34.719> my<00:05:34.839> answer<00:05:35.139> by<00:05:35.289> the<00:05:35.349> one

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
I'm limited in my answer by the one

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.519 
I'm limited in my answer by the one
decimal<00:05:36.099> place<00:05:36.689> same<00:05:37.689> thing<00:05:37.930> for<00:05:38.169> subtraction

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
decimal place same thing for subtraction

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.649 
decimal place same thing for subtraction
if<00:05:38.860> I<00:05:39.400> had<00:05:39.550> sixteen<00:05:40.029> point<00:05:40.330> one<00:05:40.479> five

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
if I had sixteen point one five

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.860 
if I had sixteen point one five
subtracted<00:05:41.500> by<00:05:41.939> and<00:05:42.939> I'm<00:05:43.089> subtracting<00:05:43.270> point

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
subtracted by and I'm subtracting point

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.139 
subtracted by and I'm subtracting point
four<00:05:44.189> my<00:05:45.189> limiting<00:05:45.550> term<00:05:45.699> is<00:05:45.849> going<00:05:45.939> to<00:05:46.000> be

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.149 
four my limiting term is going to be

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:48.209 
four my limiting term is going to be
point<00:05:46.449> four<00:05:46.689> again<00:05:47.349> I'm<00:05:47.500> limited<00:05:47.889> to<00:05:47.919> one

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
point four again I'm limited to one

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.399 
point four again I'm limited to one

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
decimal place in my answer so my answer

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.379 
decimal place in my answer so my answer
on<00:05:50.620> the<00:05:50.800> calculator<00:05:51.250> would<00:05:51.460> be<00:05:51.610> fifteen<00:05:52.089> point

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
on the calculator would be fifteen point

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.240 
on the calculator would be fifteen point
seven<00:05:52.569> five<00:05:52.899> which<00:05:53.500> I<00:05:53.680> would<00:05:53.860> round<00:05:54.069> to

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
seven five which I would round to

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.999 
seven five which I would round to
fifteen<00:05:54.909> point<00:05:55.210> eight<00:05:55.389> having<00:05:56.259> one<00:05:56.500> decimal
