00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
as is so anyways one the lux

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.860 
as is so anyways one the lux
is<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.219> really<00:00:50.460> basic<00:00:50.760> chorus<00:00:51.510> pedal

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
is a really really basic chorus pedal

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.979 
is a really really basic chorus pedal
with<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.440> level<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.399> detune<00:00:53.879> knob<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.899> you

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
with a level and a detune knob so you

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.020 
with a level and a detune knob so you
can<00:00:55.140> detune<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.739> kind<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.640> unity

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
can detune it kind of like what unity

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.840 
can detune it kind of like what unity
would<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.440> about<00:00:58.620> 12<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.340> then

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
would just be right at about 12 and then

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.360 
would just be right at about 12 and then
to<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> left<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.020> negative<00:01:01.410> space<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to the left is the negative space and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.799 
to the left is the negative space and
then<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> positive<00:01:03.660> space

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
then to the right is the positive space

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.140 
then to the right is the positive space
so<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.769> kind<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.159> different<00:01:05.339> wavering

like<00:01:51.479> an<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.810> or<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.020> type<00:01:52.170> thing<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.640> goes

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
like an on or off type thing so it goes

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.450 
like an on or off type thing so it goes
all<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> way<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:55.020> from<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.890> step<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.340> an

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
all the way up from one step to an

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.520 
all the way up from one step to an
octave<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.780> set<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> want<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
octave you can set it if you want it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.810 
octave you can set it if you want it
down<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.250> you're<00:01:59.369> trying<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> play

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
down to and if you're trying to play

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.649 
down to and if you're trying to play
like<00:02:00.469> to<00:02:01.469> Nirvana<00:02:02.280> nevermind<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.450> don't

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
like to Nirvana nevermind and you don't

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.290 
like to Nirvana nevermind and you don't
want<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> tune<00:02:04.049> your

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
want to tune your

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.700 
want to tune your
down<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.840> could<00:02:04.960> probably<00:02:05.080> just<00:02:05.230> kick<00:02:05.530> this

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
down you could probably just kick this

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.990 
down you could probably just kick this
thing<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.280> it'll<00:02:06.400> work<00:02:06.580> or<00:02:06.700> any<00:02:06.850> of<00:02:06.940> the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
thing on and it'll work or any of the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.660 
thing on and it'll work or any of the
90s<00:02:07.360> bands<00:02:07.570> like<00:02:08.020> half<00:02:08.619> Daryl<00:02:09.190> step

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
90s bands like half Daryl step

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.310 
90s bands like half Daryl step
yeah<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.240> tuned<00:02:10.450> down<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.690> half<00:02:10.840> or<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.170> whole

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
yeah the tuned down a half or a whole

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.210 
yeah the tuned down a half or a whole
step<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.430> that's<00:02:12.610> really<00:02:12.790> cool

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
step so that's really cool

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.460 
step so that's really cool
my<00:02:15.220> favorite<00:02:15.880> function<00:02:16.390> about<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:16.960> thing<00:02:17.200> is

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
my favorite function about this thing is

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.720 
my favorite function about this thing is
the<00:02:17.680> momentary<00:02:18.220> feature<00:02:18.870> which<00:02:20.310> makes<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.550> so

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
the momentary feature which makes it so

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.670 
the momentary feature which makes it so
you<00:02:21.790> can<00:02:22.090> just<00:02:22.300> kind<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:22.690> blast<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.500> the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
you can just kind of like blast on the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.980 
you can just kind of like blast on the
knob<00:02:23.860> or<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.430> switch<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.420> it'll<00:02:25.630> just<00:02:25.810> kind

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
knob or the switch and it'll just kind

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.140 
knob or the switch and it'll just kind
of<00:02:26.110> be<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> second<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.430> know<00:02:27.550> so

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
of be on for a second you know so

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.110 
of be on for a second you know so
there's<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:29.200> drink<00:02:30.070> blue<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.490> Nels<00:02:30.670> client

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
there's a a drink blue and Nels client

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.940 
there's a a drink blue and Nels client
kind<00:02:31.270> of<00:02:31.360> had<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.600> trick<00:02:31.960> where<00:02:32.380> with<00:02:32.770> the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
kind of had this trick where with the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.950 
kind of had this trick where with the
landing<00:02:33.310> pedal<00:02:33.610> what<00:02:34.120> these<00:02:34.330> dudes<00:02:34.570> would<00:02:34.750> do

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
landing pedal what these dudes would do

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.560 
landing pedal what these dudes would do
is<00:02:35.620> they<00:02:35.950> would<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.250> find<00:02:36.580> like<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.880> random

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
is they would just find like a random

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.500 
is they would just find like a random
setting<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:39.430> kind<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.820> usually<00:02:40.120> over<00:02:40.330> on<00:02:40.390> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
setting like kind of usually over on the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.940 
setting like kind of usually over on the
right<00:02:40.660> side<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.080> let's<00:02:41.230> just<00:02:41.380> say<00:02:41.560> kind<00:02:41.860> of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
right side and let's just say kind of

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.790 
right side and let's just say kind of
like<00:02:42.100> at<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.370> fourth<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.150> then<00:02:43.600> just<00:02:43.930> set<00:02:44.440> this

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
like at a fourth and then just set this

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.670 
like at a fourth and then just set this
and<00:02:45.130> like<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.340> weird<00:02:45.730> random<00:02:46.360> spot<00:02:46.660> for<00:02:47.530> like

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
and like a weird random spot for like

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.740 
and like a weird random spot for like
this<00:02:47.830> non<00:02:48.070> musical<00:02:48.550> sound<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.300> then<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.450> just

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
this non musical sound and then you just

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.230 
this non musical sound and then you just
kind<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:49.990> blast<00:02:50.350> on<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:50.920> switch<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.730> get<00:02:52.090> this

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
kind of blast on this switch to get this

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.230 
kind of blast on this switch to get this
weird<00:02:52.570> like<00:02:52.870> kind<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.260> glitchy<00:02:53.820> solo-e<00:02:54.820> effect

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
weird like kind of glitchy solo-e effect

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.790 
weird like kind of glitchy solo-e effect
type<00:02:55.390> thing<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.900> couldn't<00:02:56.230> really<00:02:56.320> do

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
type thing that you couldn't really do

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.340 
type thing that you couldn't really do
otherwise<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:58.390> any<00:02:58.570> other<00:02:58.720> pedals<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.260> then

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
otherwise with any other pedals and then

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.210 
otherwise with any other pedals and then
digitech<00:02:59.880> actually<00:03:00.880> did<00:03:01.030> like<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:02.280> adrian<00:03:03.280> blue

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
digitech actually did like a adrian blue

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.770 
digitech actually did like a adrian blue
digital<00:03:06.220> thing<00:03:06.490> there<00:03:06.850> there<00:03:07.180> do<00:03:07.600> you<00:03:07.660> have

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
digital thing there there do you have

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.420 
digital thing there there do you have
one<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:07.990> those<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.410> digital<00:03:08.739> devils<00:03:09.100> they<00:03:09.160> did

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
one of those the digital devils they did

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.340 
one of those the digital devils they did
and<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.850> will<00:03:09.970> my<00:03:10.120> fun<00:03:10.330> things<00:03:10.630> they<00:03:11.080> did<00:03:11.230> like

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
and it will my fun things they did like

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.170 
and it will my fun things they did like
a<00:03:11.380> signature<00:03:11.860> Adrian<00:03:12.400> Belew<00:03:12.610> pedal<00:03:12.910> which<00:03:13.060> is

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
a signature Adrian Belew pedal which is

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.060 
a signature Adrian Belew pedal which is
really<00:03:13.450> really<00:03:13.570> cool<00:03:13.810> as<00:03:13.989> well<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:14.770> basically

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
really really cool as well so basically

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.830 
really really cool as well so basically
they<00:03:15.310> kind<00:03:15.580> of<00:03:15.610> like<00:03:15.790> shove<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.270> all<00:03:16.480> in<00:03:16.690> this

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
they kind of like shove that all in this

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.690 
they kind of like shove that all in this
guy<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.410> momentary<00:03:17.860> feature<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.459> me<00:03:18.580> is

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
guy and the momentary feature to me is

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.100 
guy and the momentary feature to me is
what<00:03:18.880> makes<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.239> thing<00:03:19.450> really<00:03:19.630> special

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
what makes this thing really special

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.470 
what makes this thing really special
it's<00:03:20.890> also<00:03:21.010> got<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.459> octave<00:03:21.790> down<00:03:21.970> plus<00:03:22.330> the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
it's also got the octave down plus the

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.720 
it's also got the octave down plus the
dry<00:03:22.690> sound<00:03:22.989> which<00:03:23.620> is<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.860> exact<00:03:24.190> same<00:03:24.220> as<00:03:24.520> the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
dry sound which is the exact same as the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.640 
dry sound which is the exact same as the
landing<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:25.239> it's<00:03:25.480> like<00:03:25.900> probably<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.380> best

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
landing but it's like probably the best

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.460 
landing but it's like probably the best
octave<00:03:27.580> down<00:03:27.730> plus<00:03:28.060> dry<00:03:28.330> that<00:03:28.570> I've<00:03:28.660> heard<00:03:28.870> so

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
octave down plus dry that I've heard so

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.170 
octave down plus dry that I've heard so
maybe<00:03:30.430> we'll<00:03:30.610> kind<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.850> like<00:03:30.970> go<00:03:31.150> through

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
maybe we'll kind of like go through

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.850 
maybe we'll kind of like go through
these<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.720> I'll<00:03:31.840> show<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.050> how<00:03:32.260> they<00:03:32.380> sound

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
by digitech this is with the level at

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.870 
by digitech this is with the level at
about<00:03:39.520> 12<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:41.140> detune<00:03:41.620> knob<00:03:41.650> also<00:03:42.580> at

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
about 12 and the detune knob also at

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.490 
about 12 and the detune knob also at
about<00:03:43.090> 12<00:03:43.420> which<00:03:43.660> is<00:03:43.810> their<00:03:43.959> unity<00:03:44.380> so<00:03:46.500> nice

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
about 12 which is their unity so nice

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.530 
about 12 which is their unity so nice
little<00:03:47.830> standard<00:03:48.430> chorus<00:03:48.790> sound<00:03:49.060> but<00:03:49.420> that's

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
little standard chorus sound but that's

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.070 
little standard chorus sound but that's
the<00:03:49.989> safe<00:03:50.260> version<00:03:50.709> on<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:51.430> bone

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
the safe version on this bone

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.220 
the safe version on this bone
then<00:03:53.410> you<00:03:54.160> could<00:03:54.310> get<00:03:54.460> into<00:03:54.760> like<00:03:55.080> detuning<00:03:56.080> it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
then you could get into like detuning it

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.160 
then you could get into like detuning it
so<00:03:56.440> I'm<00:03:56.590> going<00:03:56.710> to<00:03:56.770> detune<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.700> about<00:03:58.170> nine

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
so I'm going to detune it to about nine

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.410 
so I'm going to detune it to about nine
o'clock<00:03:59.470> which<00:04:00.100> is<00:04:00.130> in<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.520> little<00:04:00.970> negative

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
o'clock which is in that little negative

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:10.900 
o'clock which is in that little negative
zone<00:04:01.630> see<00:04:02.080> what<00:04:02.230> happens

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.640 

that's<00:04:11.910> nine<00:04:12.180> o'clock<00:04:12.510> I'm<00:04:12.870> going<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.410> hit<00:04:13.530> it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
that's nine o'clock I'm going to hit it

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:26.620 
that's nine o'clock I'm going to hit it
all<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:14.160> way<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.370> zero

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.830 

okay<00:04:27.630> back<00:04:28.290> 12<00:04:28.850> and<00:04:29.850> then<00:04:30.000> here's<00:04:30.300> all<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.750> way

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
okay back 12 and then here's all the way

00:04:30.840 --> 00:05:28.700 
okay back 12 and then here's all the way
cranked<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.460> right<00:04:32.639> side

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.499 

so<00:05:29.710> that's<00:05:29.889> the<00:05:30.009> locks<00:05:30.250> it's<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:31.090> really<00:05:31.389> really
