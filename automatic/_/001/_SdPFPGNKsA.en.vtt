00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.500
 that art is not just for kids 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 have nina schmitz and her team 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.790
 together with their charities on the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.370
 equitana open air impressively proved 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.410
 whether jumps over balloons or circus 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.460
 Lessons the little quadrupeds showed 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.070
 the whole of the audience can give us the audience 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.750
 it now since 2008 have all with 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 one of being launched by now 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.670
 we are three with three ponies trend 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.800
 hopefully rising and yes what to do 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.120
 we would like to show that 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.309
 This breed has far more than 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.270
 lawnmowers and children ponies that the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.710
 just really for adult 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.059
 can be quite demanding that 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.070
 you have a lot of fun with them 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.120
 can 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.770
 even if the three members of the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.899
 Czech teams are not on their 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.149
 Ponies could ride was the love to the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.100
 chat countries quickly awakened in their 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.329
 demonstrations will soon be clear that too 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.579
 the work from the ground one 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.800
 challenge is and especially at 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.620
 the attentive and very active ponies 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.030
 patience and discipline is required 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.650
 I have a shetland pony in my life 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.300
 watched television and then said 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.890
 I would like to have such a pony and have 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.080
 then informed me and then have 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.560
 I would like to say someday someday 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.330
 a pony to train up to the moon school 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.040
 maybe keep some other preferences 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.100
 as I originally planned 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.600
 and when I kicked her too she was the one 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.850
 shetland pony do not even buy 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.920
 planned but she stopped there and it 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.170
 has just love yourself at first 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.670
 look and I knew those or none too 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.900
 if you are quite exhausting at the beginning 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.729
 was because she did not know any 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.750
 had education and nothing but he has 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.640
 just become one for me 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.869
 eerie heart bangs developed 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.190
 So is very important and I think there 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.490
 It's on and off the team too 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.810
 we really have everything connys the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.369
 We really care about each other 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.450
 a lot of fun and all that 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.009
 their very own history also 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 if most chips are only one size 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.990
 of a maximum of 1 107 centimeters 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.040
 One should be the conscious quadruped 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.040
 not underestimate 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.179
 These are incredibly intelligent 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.440
 So I'll say something big five 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.800
 years need to have the five minutes 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.780
 but it just about not only 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.120
 intelligent but also scary 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.330
 Nervous and by doing so 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.769
 are intelligent yes make his 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.989
 Quick stroke through the bill so 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.330
 it's just a challenge as well 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.239
 for many to work with this pony 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.209
 and you have to be very versatile too 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.019
 the ponies are working because they are fast 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.190
 go and say now I have 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.660
 boredom that's what we have yesterday 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.280
 already done and yesterday and today 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.709
 I would like to do something different 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.630
 and yes you have to stop pretty much 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.440
 to come up with 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.630
 every day the shetland ponies want 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.230
 physically but also mentally challenged 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.230
 become
