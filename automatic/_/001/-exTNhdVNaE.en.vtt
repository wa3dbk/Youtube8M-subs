00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.009
 today I bring you a new job of the 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.860
 new maps that involve and teach you the 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.360
 new streak east of this map that are 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.549
 missile attacks that from the sky 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.860
 pretty nice the truth what happens 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.019
 I do not think it's too lethal 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.550
 it's not easy enough to dodge it then 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.289
 I think it's called ska equal or something like that 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.910
 is a is a kind of plane you open the 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.949
 little screen of the gusts and from the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.269
 sky you select a point on the map and what 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.039
 you throw there not then well here you are 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.870
 seeing as then some low cons 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.980
 to get the package I get two 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.510
 times during this example so 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.399
 just cut the pieces of my skin 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.320
 that killed a little bit and that I get 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.899
 the streak for you to see and well then 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.109
 I do not like this map practically anything 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.600
 it's called calment and I think it's good 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.239
 it's a plan in london italy for the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.609
 pipen and really in general horacio is 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.289
 a summary today my intention is if I can 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.699
 put six streaming key to the a 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.840
 8 o'clock in the afternoon or in Spanish 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.250
 that yesterday is worth the same thing as yesterday 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.960
 live I'll lend zombies the truth 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.100
 that yesterday the wind the object was very 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.210
 I am very happy with my appetite 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.070
 Atocha them because the truth is that 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.960
 It was super fun we had a great time 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.710
 the truth and good many people in the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.840
 direct 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.280
 the fun so I'm very happy 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.630
 so he's going to have another direct from 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.490
 zombies playing four people in 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.869
 cooperative obviously and good if I do not 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.100
 wrong here is when means and 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.440
 ammunition I say good because I think I 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.640
 kill of I say more back the streak and here 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.110
 half without bullets that what he threw me for 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.000
 back and good let's let us micro 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.979
 no bullets and shot the streak no and good 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.690
 Well, that is my intention if I can 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.090
 He could not promise us anything but I can 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.890
 I will bring you something from each map today that is 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.869
 today for example is the traitor 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.340
 first department here you see how 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.530
 the packages arrived to change just 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.600
 I took it out, I take a shot because my intention 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.800
 is to be kids and try good here 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.229
 I'll teach you how to do it so 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.520
 it has been said about the little screen opens 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.259
 kind of fire there is in plan 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.220
 pretty cool you throw the missile I 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.300
 I thought it was like a special and 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.160
 against the principle that's why he launched it on 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.810
 plan bad and good here what just kills me and 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.220
 I see how they were visible in the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.300
 sky are falling the visit I'm going to 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.399
 look at the area a bit so you can see 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.770
 how they fall not having is not that the gusts 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.030
 as several normal missiles we are going to 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.159
 to say that they fall I do not know how so 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.929
 be mega lethal but today it's okay not the 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.640
 gusts and selection is a site and a 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.710
 flag or hot spot busting 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.780
 it is open plan and good those 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.740
 My intention is to try to climb 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.720
 today 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.040
 and something from each map either by a streak 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.410
 in this case I think the only streak 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.750
 I think there is this in the new DLCI 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.580
 I also have to use the map of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.290
 hirise what good was called the sky 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.730
 rights that is the modern remake 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.040
 warfare 2 you already know is what I want to upload 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.840
 now in a ratillo and I also want 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.090
 upload them on the map of Kremlin that 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.830
 they place the prize because of Russia and such 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.090
 that I also have others starting from 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.590
 saved to be taught a little 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.760
 new above because they are not 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.380
 I like to get into first pressures 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.960
 the map I like to teach more we go a 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.630
 little playing in it and such and finally 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.450
 it's about uploading a map in buy I do not follow 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.760
 as well as summary of saying that it has not 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.380
 liked too the dlc or if I 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.170
 you ask if it's worth the tlc 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.610
 I can clearly tell you that yes 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.350
 as if I said that the second yes that 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.600
 I really liked the gusts because you 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.850
 they gave the voice for the zombies at the moment 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.290
 so what is multiplayer I do not like 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.790
 apart from that there are only departures 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.470
 practically against Americans in the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.770
 connection goes wrong based for all the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:11.410
 at 3 to 3 or 3 false because they are 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.410
 Americans and you go with enough and I do not know 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.159
 when people change a lot they do not 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.269
 move the maps to me really I 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.069
 they like how they are made unique 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.810
 hirise but practically because you are 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.159
 I resinate for something else but good 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.049
 let's wait then to try the zombies 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.190
 how it works so good kids 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.659
 I'm leaving, deciding here, there's 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.340
 get a game of shorter ones 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.480
 after it comes it's like there's 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.930
 the missiles I did not know throw another 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.250
 part of the ship so favorites and their 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.250
 goodbye fiber
