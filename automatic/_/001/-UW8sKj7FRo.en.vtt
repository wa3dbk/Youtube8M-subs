00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.320 

so<00:03:48.810> there<00:03:49.020> you<00:03:49.140> go<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:50.030> little<00:03:51.030> bit<00:03:51.270> thinner

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
so there you go a little bit thinner

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.449 
so there you go a little bit thinner
much<00:03:54.330> bigger<00:03:54.599> screen<00:03:57.349> much<00:03:58.349> taller<00:03:58.709> device<00:03:59.190> of

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
much bigger screen much taller device of

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.479 
much bigger screen much taller device of
course<00:04:01.489> and<00:04:02.489> as<00:04:02.670> you're<00:04:03.090> stacked<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:04.489> little

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
course and as you're stacked a little

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.759 
course and as you're stacked a little
bit<00:04:05.640> extra<00:04:05.760> edge<00:04:06.150> over<00:04:06.360> here<00:04:10.250> look<00:04:11.250> at<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.489> hd7

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
bit extra edge over here look at the hd7

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:19.250 
bit extra edge over here look at the hd7
with<00:04:13.769> its<00:04:15.290> 4.3<00:04:16.290> inch<00:04:16.440> screen<00:04:16.760> versus<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.260> 4.5

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
with its 4.3 inch screen versus the 4.5

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.560 
with its 4.3 inch screen versus the 4.5
inch<00:04:19.500> screen<00:04:19.769> over<00:04:19.979> here

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.730 

see<00:04:26.290> that's<00:04:26.940> thinner<00:04:27.940> there<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:32.440> guess

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
see that's thinner there and I guess

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.470 
see that's thinner there and I guess
we'll<00:04:32.950> look<00:04:33.190> at<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.520> nokia<00:04:34.150> n8<00:04:36.480> this

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
we'll look at the nokia n8 this

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.970 
we'll look at the nokia n8 this
obviously<00:04:37.720> has<00:04:38.080> much<00:04:38.830> smaller<00:04:39.220> screen<00:04:43.980> so

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
obviously has much smaller screen so

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.330 
obviously has much smaller screen so
there<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.250> go<00:04:45.450> we<00:04:46.450> are<00:04:46.570> going<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.780> take<00:04:46.990> this

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
there you go we are going to take this

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.950 
there you go we are going to take this
through<00:04:48.340> its<00:04:48.520> paces<00:04:48.760> and<00:04:49.270> let<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:49.660> know<00:04:49.810> how

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
through its paces and let you know how

00:04:49.960 --> 00:05:02.930 
through its paces and let you know how
it<00:04:49.990> is<00:04:50.170> that's<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.250> for<00:04:51.400> now

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.240
