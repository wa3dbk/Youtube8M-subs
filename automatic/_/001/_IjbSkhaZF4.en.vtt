slowly finding a closer and closer lock

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.269 
slowly finding a closer and closer lock
as<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:26.910> used<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.470> now<00:00:28.470> remember<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
as you get used to it now remember the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.429 
as you get used to it now remember the
nose<00:00:29.490> bluntslide<00:00:29.970> consists<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.960> basically

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
nose bluntslide consists of basically

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.690 
nose bluntslide consists of basically
two<00:00:31.769> parts<00:00:32.250> giving<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.750> sliding<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
two parts giving in to and sliding and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.819 
two parts giving in to and sliding and
popping<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.090> rolling<00:00:36.329> away<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
popping out and rolling away so this is

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.979 
popping out and rolling away so this is
how<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.489> get<00:00:38.640> better<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.390> first<00:00:39.629> part

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
how you can get better at the first part

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.110 
how you can get better at the first part
so<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.160> you're<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> want<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:41.910> is

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
so what you're going to want to do is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.350 
so what you're going to want to do is
approach<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.780> ledge<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.230> about<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.360> parallel

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
approach the ledge at about a parallel

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.049 
approach the ledge at about a parallel
direction<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.140> Ollie<00:00:46.860> over<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> top<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
direction and Ollie over the top and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.110 
direction and Ollie over the top and
turn<00:00:48.840> 90<00:00:49.320> degrees<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> air<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:51.000> going

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
turn 90 degrees in the air you're going

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.660 
turn 90 degrees in the air you're going
to<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> land<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.430> board

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
to want to land and just have your board

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.270 
to want to land and just have your board
slide<00:00:54.090> across<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.690> top<00:00:54.899> by<00:00:55.770> putting<00:00:56.190> your

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
slide across the top by putting your

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.299 
slide across the top by putting your
weight<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.059> tip<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> nose<00:00:57.660> and

sliding your wheels across the top the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.799 
sliding your wheels across the top the
object<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.370> test<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.780> have

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
object is to test it out and not have

your back wheels come down and touch but

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.320 
your back wheels come down and touch but
also<00:01:06.930> not<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.740> lock<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.189> yet<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:09.090> want<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
also not to lock in yet you want to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.109 
also not to lock in yet you want to
slide<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.659> across<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.140> top<00:01:10.729> once<00:01:11.729> you've<00:01:11.939> done

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
slide it across the top once you've done

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.240 
slide it across the top once you've done
this<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> few<00:01:12.479> times<00:01:12.740> you're<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> want<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
this a few times you're going to want to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
this a few times you're going to want to
sneak<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.240> further<00:01:15.600> over<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
sneak a little bit further over to the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.190 
sneak a little bit further over to the
edge<00:01:16.439> every<00:01:16.979> time<00:01:17.220> until<00:01:18.180> eventually<00:01:18.450> you'll

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
edge every time until eventually you'll

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050 
edge every time until eventually you'll
find<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.159> lock<00:01:20.460> into<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> nose

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
find that you can lock into the nose

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.399 
find that you can lock into the nose
bluntslide<00:01:21.509> position<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.790> see<00:01:23.790> how<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> feels

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
bluntslide position and see how it feels

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
bluntslide position and see how it feels
when<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.530> first<00:01:25.799> start<00:01:26.130> doing<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.640> you're

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
when you first start doing this you're

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.969 
when you first start doing this you're
gonna<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> start<00:01:27.780> rolling<00:01:28.320> slow<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
gonna want to start rolling slow and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.399 
gonna want to start rolling slow and
getting<00:01:29.250> into<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.270> slowly<00:01:30.720> building

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
getting into it and then slowly building

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.310 
getting into it and then slowly building
more<00:01:31.590> speed<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.939> more<00:01:33.150> speed<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.570> add<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
more speed the more speed you add to it

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.740 
more speed the more speed you add to it
slowly<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:35.640> you'll<00:01:35.790> find<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.600> you're

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
slowly the more you'll find that you're

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.600 
slowly the more you'll find that you're
going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.900> slide<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.590> little<00:01:37.680> bit<00:01:38.100> further

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
going to slide a little bit further

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.719 
going to slide a little bit further
every<00:01:39.000> time<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.770> great<00:01:41.040> way<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.430> learn

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
every time this is a great way to learn

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.330 
every time this is a great way to learn
how<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.540> into<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.960> trick<00:01:43.470> since<00:01:44.130> it's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
how to get into this trick since it's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.389 
how to get into this trick since it's
kind<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.030> critical<00:01:45.600> position<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
kind of a critical position to be in the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.880 
kind of a critical position to be in the
nose<00:01:47.579> bluntslide<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.840> best<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.320> start<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
nose bluntslide it's best to start and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.940 
nose bluntslide it's best to start and
slow<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.520> figure<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.210> trick<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.950> so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
slow and figure this trick out so

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.789 
slow and figure this trick out so
remember<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> great<00:01:54.899> way<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.409> learn

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
remember this is a great way to learn

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.359 
remember this is a great way to learn
slowly<00:01:56.340> sneaking<00:01:57.090> over<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.680> sliding<00:01:58.680> away

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
slowly sneaking over and sliding away

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.510 
slowly sneaking over and sliding away
and<00:02:00.110> eventually<00:02:01.110> getting<00:02:01.950> better<00:02:02.250> at

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and eventually getting better at
