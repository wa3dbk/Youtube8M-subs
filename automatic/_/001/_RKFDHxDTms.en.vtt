you<00:01:46.240> can<00:01:46.390> see<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.720> inner<00:01:47.289> parts<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.130> right

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
you can see the inner parts of it right

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.730 
you can see the inner parts of it right
here<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:50.079> went<00:01:50.590> ahead<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:50.979> put<00:01:51.280> both<00:01:51.789> heads

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
here and I went ahead and put both heads

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.370 
here and I went ahead and put both heads
onto<00:01:53.740> one<00:01:53.920> player<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:55.420> type<00:01:55.659> of<00:01:55.840> tape<00:01:56.140> deck

TCM<00:02:00.250> 8<00:02:00.700> 1<00:02:01.000> 8<00:02:01.210> I<00:02:01.590> used<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.710> have<00:02:02.829> one<00:02:03.009> of<00:02:03.039> those

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
TCM 8 1 8 I used to have one of those

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.260 
TCM 8 1 8 I used to have one of those
younger<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:04.179> a<00:02:04.360> work<00:02:04.869> really<00:02:05.110> well<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.909> out

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
younger it's a work really well so out

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.150 
younger it's a work really well so out
from<00:02:07.509> there<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:08.050> have<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.500> connected<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.950> a

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
from there I have it connected to a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.229 
from there I have it connected to a
mixing<00:02:09.880> board

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
mixing board

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.620

temporarily<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.640> Holly<00:02:12.850> have<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.150> hooked<00:02:13.360> up<00:02:13.480> to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
temporarily so Holly have I hooked up to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.570 
temporarily so Holly have I hooked up to
the<00:02:13.750> mixing<00:02:14.049> board<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.500> let's<00:02:15.100> say<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:15.400> is

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the mixing board is let's say this is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.530 
the mixing board is let's say this is
tape<00:02:15.790> type<00:02:16.030> 1<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.569> this<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.380> tape<00:02:17.620> deck<00:02:17.860> 2

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540

taped<00:02:19.540> up<00:02:19.750> one<00:02:20.049> I'm<00:02:20.620> using<00:02:21.100> mic<00:02:21.459> input<00:02:21.940> on<00:02:22.569> it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
taped up one I'm using mic input on it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.440 
taped up one I'm using mic input on it
and<00:02:23.080> from<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.250> have<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.610> connected<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:25.269> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
and from that I have it connected to the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.620 
and from that I have it connected to the
left<00:02:25.840> channel<00:02:26.200> out<00:02:26.560> on<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.489> mixing<00:02:28.000> board<00:02:28.060> and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
left channel out on the mixing board and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.430 
left channel out on the mixing board and
tape<00:02:29.319> deck<00:02:29.560> 2<00:02:29.890> from<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> output<00:02:31.299> I'm<00:02:31.569> bringing

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
tape deck 2 from the output I'm bringing

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.800 
tape deck 2 from the output I'm bringing
that<00:02:32.470> back<00:02:32.830> in<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> channel<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.540> mixing

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
that back in to a channel on the mixing

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.410 
that back in to a channel on the mixing
board<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.950> my<00:02:36.370> guitar<00:02:36.700> comes<00:02:36.970> in<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.269> this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420

the left and right I can control how
much<00:02:45.700> guitar<00:02:46.260> goes<00:02:47.260> into<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.620> tape<00:02:47.829> deck<00:02:48.070> and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
much guitar goes into the tape deck and

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.500 
much guitar goes into the tape deck and
the<00:02:49.600> amplifier<00:02:50.049> I've<00:02:50.500> got<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:50.920> amplifier

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the amplifier I've got the amplifier

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.780 
the amplifier I've got the amplifier
hooked<00:02:52.510> up<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.560> right<00:02:54.010> output<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:56.790> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
hooked up to the right output and the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.030 
hooked up to the right output and the
same<00:02:58.000> for<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.480> tape<00:02:59.410> deck

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
same for the tape deck

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.699 
same for the tape deck
where<00:03:00.579> it<00:03:00.700> comes<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:02.109> control<00:03:02.440> how<00:03:02.590> much

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
where it comes in I can control how much

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.240 
where it comes in I can control how much
feedback<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:04.780> send<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.319> tape<00:03:05.650> deck<00:03:05.859> if

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
feedback I can send to the tape deck if

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.229 
feedback I can send to the tape deck if
that<00:03:07.239> makes<00:03:07.450> sense<00:03:07.600> this<00:03:08.049> is<00:03:08.109> it<00:03:08.410> right<00:03:09.239> and

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
that makes sense this is it right and

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.690 
that makes sense this is it right and
what<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:10.959> did<00:03:11.139> over<00:03:11.380> here<00:03:11.410> is<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.220> made<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.400> simple

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
what I did over here is I made a simple

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.720 
what I did over here is I made a simple
circuit<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.480> control<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.400> speed<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.579> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
circuit to control the speed that the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.960 
circuit to control the speed that the
tapes<00:03:16.030> running<00:03:16.299> at<00:03:16.769> so<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:17.799> can<00:03:18.069> change<00:03:18.790> the

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
tapes running at so I can change the

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.979 
tapes running at so I can change the
delay<00:03:19.420> time<00:03:19.690> from<00:03:20.049> no<00:03:20.950> faster<00:03:21.489> -<00:03:21.700> slower

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.780 

sorry<00:03:25.470> about<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.769> mess<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.430> more<00:03:26.700> or

cut<00:03:42.959> holes<00:03:43.140> for<00:03:43.440> all<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.590> knobs<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:44.099> the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
cut holes for all the knobs and the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.539 
cut holes for all the knobs and the
input<00:03:45.090> in<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.299> output<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:46.650> went<00:03:47.250> ahead<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.489> did

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
input in the output I went ahead and did

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.300 
input in the output I went ahead and did
a<00:03:47.610> quick<00:03:47.819> mock-up<00:03:48.060> with<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.810> other<00:03:49.739> tape<00:03:50.099> tech

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
a quick mock-up with the other tape tech

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.420 
a quick mock-up with the other tape tech
that<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.519> had<00:03:50.700> laying<00:03:50.879> around<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:53.040> other<00:03:53.250> thing

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
that I had laying around the other thing

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.250 
that I had laying around the other thing
I<00:03:53.519> wanted<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.819> show<00:03:54.060> was<00:03:54.329> uh<00:03:54.360> what<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.930> did<00:03:55.110> with

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
I wanted to show was uh what I did with

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.809 
I wanted to show was uh what I did with
the<00:03:55.349> tape<00:03:55.590> here<00:03:55.950> let<00:03:56.340> me<00:03:56.370> go<00:03:56.519> ahead<00:03:56.610> and

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
the tape here let me go ahead and

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.390 
the tape here let me go ahead and
carefully<00:03:57.799> no<00:03:58.799> not<00:03:59.040> like<00:03:59.190> that

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
carefully no not like that

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.080 
carefully no not like that
hang<00:03:59.730> on<00:03:59.849> come<00:04:00.599> on<00:04:01.549> there<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.609> go<00:04:02.730> let<00:04:02.879> me<00:04:02.910> take

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
hang on come on there you go let me take

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.630 
hang on come on there you go let me take
the<00:04:03.209> cover<00:04:03.420> off<00:04:03.540> uh<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.739> can<00:04:04.920> see<00:04:05.069> down<00:04:05.190> here<00:04:05.250> I

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
the cover off uh you can see down here I

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.390 
the cover off uh you can see down here I
went<00:04:06.090> ahead<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.390> cut<00:04:07.290> some<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.709> plastic

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
went ahead and cut some of the plastic

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.880 
went ahead and cut some of the plastic
off<00:04:08.609> from<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.359> inside<00:04:09.480> so<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.019> can<00:04:10.170> fit<00:04:10.379> both

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
off from the inside so I can fit both

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.509 
off from the inside so I can fit both
heads<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.400> there<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:12.799> just<00:04:13.799> threw<00:04:14.489> some

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
heads in there and I just threw some

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.300 
heads in there and I just threw some
material<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.329> there<00:04:15.540> so<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.780> could<00:04:16.049> hold<00:04:16.949> the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
material in there so I could hold the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.199 
material in there so I could hold the
tape<00:04:18.090> down<00:04:18.389> onto<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.410> heads<00:04:19.789> this<00:04:20.789> is<00:04:20.940> just<00:04:21.120> a

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
tape down onto the heads this is just a

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.400 
tape down onto the heads this is just a
mock-up<00:04:21.449> right<00:04:21.840> now

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
mock-up right now

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.200 
mock-up right now
the<00:04:22.710> finished<00:04:23.190> one<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.729> going<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.880> be<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.030> lot

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
the finished one is going to be a lot

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.050 
the finished one is going to be a lot
cleaner<00:04:25.169> than<00:04:25.289> that<00:04:25.470> that's<00:04:26.250> just<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.729> you

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
cleaner than that that's just to you

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.430 
cleaner than that that's just to you
know<00:04:27.180> make<00:04:27.600> sure<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:28.130> so<00:04:29.130> work<00:04:29.280> properly<00:04:30.440> and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
know make sure it so work properly and

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.890 
know make sure it so work properly and
the<00:04:31.919> other<00:04:32.070> part<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.700> is<00:04:32.849> I'm<00:04:33.510> not<00:04:33.690> going<00:04:33.840> to

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
the other part to it is I'm not going to

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.969 
the other part to it is I'm not going to
use<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.169> mixing<00:04:34.590> board<00:04:34.800> in<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.820> final<00:04:36.330> case

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
use the mixing board in the final case

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.650 
use the mixing board in the final case
what<00:04:37.979> I'm<00:04:38.099> going<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.250> do<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.639> go<00:04:39.419> ahead<00:04:39.479> and

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
what I'm going to do is go ahead and

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.800 
what I'm going to do is go ahead and
finish<00:04:39.810> building<00:04:40.139> this<00:04:40.880> tiny<00:04:41.880> mixing<00:04:42.300> board<00:04:42.510> I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
finish building this tiny mixing board I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.250 
finish building this tiny mixing board I
got<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.410> schematics<00:04:43.860> online<00:04:45.050> that's<00:04:46.050> going

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
got the schematics online that's going

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.839 
got the schematics online that's going
to<00:04:46.320> do<00:04:46.380> it's<00:04:46.530> going<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.830> mix<00:04:47.160> all<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.430> signals

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
to do it's going to mix all the signals

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.990 
to do it's going to mix all the signals
for<00:04:48.120> me<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.780> these<00:04:48.930> operational<00:04:49.889> amps<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.820> keep

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
for me to these operational amps to keep

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.060 
for me to these operational amps to keep
the<00:04:51.120> sound<00:04:51.300> nice<00:04:51.539> and<00:04:51.780> clean<00:04:51.990> keep<00:04:52.770> from

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
the sound nice and clean keep from

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.310 
the sound nice and clean keep from
clipping
