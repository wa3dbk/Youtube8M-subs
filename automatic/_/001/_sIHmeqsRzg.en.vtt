00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.560
 hello everyone and as always far less well 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.529
 after pianella happens v this is art 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.080
 I propose today two of the is used 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.800
 enamels of the new line inspired by the 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.760
 north klein runs here are all in vain 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.290
 really very metallic metallics now 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.090
 this year the art was created 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.040
 creating a somewhat particular base e 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.960
 using the newspaper is a lot 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.360
 simple to implement so there is no 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.100
 he wants great dexterity and in any case yes 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.140
 get how you see an effect really 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.600
 really very particular that 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.820
 certainly comes out of the canons of 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.920
 classic in art however I hope you 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.399
 like it and I leave a kiss to the tutorial 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.399
 Hello 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.760
 first thing goes 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.780
 on my nails and I use the base that 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.860
 growth 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.150
 once under the base I go to 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.150
 apply 722 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.259
 and the first a second pass for 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.259
 make it totally consistent 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.409
 at this point I'm going to get 407 that 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:41.380
 this metallic purple I clean 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:44.140
 good zanello and I take very little 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.060
 on the tip and I'm going to blend it on mine 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.399
 unique then placing the brush a 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.090
 side of the nail and fading towards 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.090
 the interior 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.330
 very well at this point once 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.790
 dry the base we need 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.040
 some bits of newspaper 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.860
 I prefer to use these pages 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.050
 which as you see are shiny so not 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.540
 the traditional paper but these things and 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:22.420
 just shiny maybe cut me some 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.100
 strips and is used to fill one 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.000
 tray with hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.010
 I used this sedan door 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.960
 simply because I don't have any 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.280
 small vessels of this size e 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.310
 therefore of use this 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.020
 at this point I take the strip 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.940
 I though I cut 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.380
 simply to soak in the way it is 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.170
 born and I keep it that way for 10 seconds 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.290
 ok at this point little of the excess of 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.570
 water I take my strip and the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.570
 I stick on long 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.390
 for this reason it was necessary that 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.520
 the enamel was completely dry and 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.230
 I'm going to press ok when it seems to me 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.720
 so that the paper is practically 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.320
 almost dry you can go to 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.320
 remove it 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.180
 if you have used this card than a 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.030
 a little shiny will stick to it 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.520
 part of the press 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.010
 at this point very simply seen 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.080
 that the black writing is below and above 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.450
 some more paper 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.370
 I take a disk always soaked with 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.260
 hydrogen peroxide 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.200
 the floor plan then I am going to remove a 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:44.530
 clean from paper and sex and how 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:47.730
 you see the writing will reappear with a 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.730
 much more marked black 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.459
 ok at this point all that remains is 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.410
 apply the touch of use as 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.410
 always the bright enamel fixer 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.930
 however the card and will complete I hope 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.739
 you enjoyed it and leave you to the photos a 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.739
 kiss bye
