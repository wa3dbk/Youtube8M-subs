 cake cooked not in the oven but in 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.509
 printer and diana which device 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.120
 milling machine type 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.190
 dessert has recently stirred the internet 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.469
 Of course, only American development 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.020
 the prototype will not soon be in the kitchen 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.619
 housewives until the chances of becoming household 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.840
 technique 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.330
 Only 3d printer has all these 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 mechanisms that exist and not flight 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.119
 plastic they can print 3 on 3d 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.779
 printer here is the most eloquent 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.390
 example people typing gears 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.460
 plastic grinders from coffee grinders 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.149
 which often break which game 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.399
 can't find 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 seemingly buy a printer and print 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.940
 anything 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.640
 however this home approach does not 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.430
 working prices for quality overseas 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 3d installations eventually turn 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.570
 plastic parts in gold 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.660
 change the situation go Russian 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.239
 engineers we managed from the device which 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 worth no more than a hundred thousand rubles to survive 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.920
 quality which is comparable to 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.899
 industrial analogues almost all 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.659
 Parts are made in Russia and as 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.970
 replacing complex and expensive system 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.729
 Stabilize our printhead 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.290
 know-how here is very accurate 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.820
 which lowers this table with 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.880
 minimal errors this means 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.240
 more evenly more accurately in 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.680
 horizontal 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.810
 topologies are more precisely worn layer friend 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.210
 to a friend in practice that means that 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.049
 the finished model will not require refinement and 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.509
 grinding 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.640
 spectacle frame case for mobile phone 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.280
 toys and tools can be used 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.750
 as soon as the print is over, and if 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.330
 consider that plastic kit which 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.549
 applied non-toxic is very simple 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.799
 provide yourself also with dishes for example 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.479
 came to the cottage and printed out the kitchen 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.860
 set 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.929
 landscaping compact and capable 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.909
 work autonomously to take advantage 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.619
 it is not necessary to connect this printer 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.380
 it needs a socket and a flash drive to the computer 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.580
 with model mockup 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.590
 turn on everything you can wait for it 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.020
 will print all true there are 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.209
 problems which prevents popularization 3d 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.100
 print on the internet is not so much 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.049
 ready virtual models 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.660
 if you need an individual project 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.610
 have to pay a specialist otherwise 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.620
 If you are ready to learn a profession 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.620
 programmer and designer
