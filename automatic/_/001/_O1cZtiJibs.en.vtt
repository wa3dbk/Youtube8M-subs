00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.639
 living in taranto means living in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:20.250
 terror of getting sick 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:25.769
 the name of the production I started 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.460
 this battle for civil duty and for 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.460
 moral duty 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.680
 people get sick 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.570
 children get sick what I could do 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.570
 for this city 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.540
 taranto is a city that has been 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.470
 sacrificed in the name of the big one 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.100
 industry the name also of the pil 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.100
 national 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.790
 but he did a lot in the sense he has 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.320
 definitely condemned this city 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.010
 work and health 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.050
 indeed health and work when to ad 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.300
 children get sick 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.630
 it means that we have gone beyond the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.630
 emergencies 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.420
 no no 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.740
 today you will never become a mother in taranto 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.930
 Ilva workers are exposed to all poison 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.930
 the days like the citizens of taranto 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.010
 I have known I know many workers who 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.990
 they got sick they cared and they are 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.050
 come back to work in there and this 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.580
 is absurd 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.800
 the example of taranto is the example of alle 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.710
 of Italy there are the dead but not yes 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.580
 does nothing to avoid it 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.580
 there is a massacre
