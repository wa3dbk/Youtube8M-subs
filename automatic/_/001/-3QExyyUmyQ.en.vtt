Move<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.820> was<00:04:51.690> never<00:04:51.960> impressed<00:04:52.650> with

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.879 
Move I was never impressed with
playstation<00:04:53.760> move<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:55.380> know<00:04:55.470> I<00:04:55.500> think<00:04:55.620> the

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
playstation move you know I think the

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.060 
playstation move you know I think the
Kinect<00:04:56.280> is<00:04:56.400> probably<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:56.940> best<00:04:57.150> thing<00:04:57.300> going

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
Kinect is probably the best thing going

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.260 
Kinect is probably the best thing going
and<00:04:59.070> so<00:04:59.190> they<00:04:59.340> really<00:04:59.610> have<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.880> do<00:05:00.000> something

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
and so they really have to do something

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.260 
and so they really have to do something
big<00:05:00.479> to<00:05:00.630> make<00:05:00.750> me<00:05:00.979> show<00:05:01.979> any<00:05:02.250> form<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.669> interest

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
big to make me show any form of interest

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.500 
big to make me show any form of interest
