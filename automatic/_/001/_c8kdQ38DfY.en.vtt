it over 12 months which was really cool
because<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:40.019> shears<00:03:40.379> weren't<00:03:41.190> expensive<00:03:41.760> you

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
because the shears weren't expensive you

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.420 
because the shears weren't expensive you
know<00:03:42.690> for<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:42.989> good<00:03:43.349> tool<00:03:43.560> but<00:03:43.949> they<00:03:44.099> it's<00:03:44.310> not

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
know for a good tool but they it's not

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.710 
know for a good tool but they it's not
like<00:03:44.549> they're<00:03:44.730> it's<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.060> drop<00:03:45.239> in<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.419> bucket<00:03:45.449> I

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
like they're it's a drop in the bucket I

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.500 
like they're it's a drop in the bucket I
think<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:45.989> was<00:03:46.079> like<00:03:46.199> 589<00:03:47.040> bucks<00:03:47.430> or<00:03:47.669> 600<00:03:48.480> bucks

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
think it was like 589 bucks or 600 bucks

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.319 
think it was like 589 bucks or 600 bucks
or<00:03:48.750> something<00:03:48.810> like<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.030> allowed

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
or something like that and so it allowed

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.050 
or something like that and so it allowed
me<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.510> pay<00:03:51.750> like<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.609> 50<00:03:53.609> bucks<00:03:53.639> a<00:03:53.910> month
