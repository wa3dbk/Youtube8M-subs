00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.230
 Hello dear friends today with us 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.579
 ready to shoot enough you can 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.460
 say unique pattern 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:34.370
 do not rush to make a unique sample 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.370
 any conclusions now seem 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.379
 nothing new you can not show you 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.480
 reads machine gun system shpagin it 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.170
 civilian version 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.980
 there are lots of such videos on u tube 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.379
 shoot some perfectly 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.260
 crazy people redo the store for 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.390
 shooting at 30 places not worn off than 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.059
 Essentially this sample 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.629
 It is found that you are used to 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.460
 see take outfitted shop 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:07.250
 ask the operator for a larger indicator 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:11.170
 here are people who love weapons appreciate understands 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.619
 immediately remotely understood me 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.640
 unconventional flock 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:21.259
 from the gun . Dad 70 years on 25 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.860
 9 meter chuck 9 active on 19 people 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.259
 or 9 for 19 pair were limited 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.410
 series for the connoisseur of weapons produced 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.130
 civilian version of the rebuilt sample 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.840
 here from to for patron and we have a cart and a 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.899
 we have a unique opportunity on 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.739
 supply you see how it behaves 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.690
 dad when firing such ammo than 

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:48.200
 may before the program you carefully 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.179
 looked into the store and no 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.090
 design changes strongly behind 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.289
 exclusion of store capacity 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.520
 I hope the cartridge that matches 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.679
 legislation 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.259
 I do not know what the 7:25 bottle cartridge 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.890
 forms of another caliber here without any 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:10.789
 delays allows you to fire and type 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.840
 the latter will naturally replace 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.629
 table now let's see how it behaves 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.799
 rosette faces 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:24.590
 sample provided action 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:30.019
 dad as we see and glue together 44 years 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.140
 release here as the shooting is carried out with 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.329
 open shutter well and compare the sensations 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.099
 when firing 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.099
 72 and share mid and 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.140
 Well, all who ever shoot dad 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.840
 all notes resistant to the line of fire 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.549
 insignificant returns but here at 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.370
 using a cartridge active 19 recoil yes 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.170
 just the absence here is the night light not 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.540
 transferred that is so sitting on the beach 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.239
 last ammo well where we got 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:23.109
 Now let's see and then fire too 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:25.489
 a series from store to store us was 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:29.299
 eight bullets everyone reached the goal 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.329
 stood as fluently as possible 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.950
 go goals often vera hotels see 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.310
 you will delay when shooting given as 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.280
 we see no delay occurred 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.970
 as a result, loved the same as that 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.260
 because there 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.299
 sivers answer for 5 great weapons 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.250
 that is, once again show genius 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:54.319
 that wartime conditions were created 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.109
 such a sample u even allows 100 years with 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.879
 use where ammunition 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.919
 Well, now we leave service 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:07.389
 used 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:10.090
 children's store mention all too 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:13.569
 civil legislation 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.569
 10 cartridge 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:57.020
 and because it is very strong but how 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.560
 We see that and about using this store 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:05.210
 too, there were no problems with delays 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.250
 confirms earlier try saying 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.850
 soviet means great good sense 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.560
 the words are gorgeous of course the machine is 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.310
 very pleased that such a historical 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.400
 sample 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.940
 can be used well of course using 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.970
 on the hunt 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.470
 This carbine is doubtful but for 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.470
 some kind of amateur shooting for 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.650
 target lovers for already such a sample 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.860
 definitely nice to have here again 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.600
 I emphasize that there was no return 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.970
 recoil just did not have a bullet 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.820
 flew just like at the same time 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.500
 store but if we roll each other and 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:45.860
 retention is already well and plans should be removed 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.260
 several programs compare dad under 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.750
 72 standard caliber cartridge 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.270
 these samples you will analyze 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.580
 let's see let's talk about history 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.950
 have you got interested in creating this 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.230
 sample we stay as always with us 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.230
 on our channel talk about hunters
