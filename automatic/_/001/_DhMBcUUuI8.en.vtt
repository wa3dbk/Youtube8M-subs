all<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.330> players<00:04:47.540> to<00:04:47.810> get<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:47.960> good<00:04:48.140> sense<00:04:48.380> of

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
all the players to get a good sense of

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.620 
all the players to get a good sense of
their<00:04:48.680> character<00:04:48.890> a<00:04:49.100> good<00:04:49.250> sense<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.640> who<00:04:50.480> they

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
their character a good sense of who they

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.870 
their character a good sense of who they
are<00:04:50.660> as<00:04:50.930> people<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:51.470> know<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.430> couple<00:04:52.610> of<00:04:52.790> them

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
are as people you know a couple of them

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.520 
are as people you know a couple of them
are<00:04:53.020> probably<00:04:54.020> even<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.200> little<00:04:54.320> bit<00:04:54.410> better

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
are probably even a little bit better

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.480 
are probably even a little bit better
than<00:04:54.770> I<00:04:54.800> thought<00:04:54.950> they<00:04:55.100> were<00:04:55.190> going<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.340> be

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
than I thought they were going to be

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.700 
than I thought they were going to be
we'll<00:04:56.180> see<00:04:56.330> how<00:04:56.360> we<00:04:56.540> gel<00:04:56.900> I<00:04:57.080> think<00:04:57.470> when<00:04:57.620> you

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
we'll see how we gel I think when you

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.230 
we'll see how we gel I think when you
add<00:04:57.860> Gertz<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:58.400> add<00:04:58.520> Galiardi<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.150> our

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
add Gertz and you add Galiardi to our

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.030 
add Gertz and you add Galiardi to our
lineup<00:04:59.600> it<00:04:59.750> fundamentally<00:05:00.080> changes<00:05:00.740> us<00:05:00.860> in<00:05:00.980> a

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
lineup it fundamentally changes us in a

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.550 
lineup it fundamentally changes us in a
positive<00:05:01.460> in<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.910> positive<00:05:02.060> way<00:05:02.390> we'll<00:05:03.290> see<00:05:03.440> how

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
positive in a positive way we'll see how

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.500 
positive in a positive way we'll see how
that<00:05:03.620> comes<00:05:04.520> together<00:05:04.820> when<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.180> gets<00:05:05.390> there

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
that comes together when it gets there

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.210 
that comes together when it gets there
but<00:05:05.660> I<00:05:05.930> really<00:05:06.080> like<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.680> fact<00:05:06.830> that<00:05:07.010> you<00:05:07.100> know
