00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
music video I thought it was pretty dope

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.009 
music video I thought it was pretty dope
man<00:03:05.440> but<00:03:06.100> uh<00:03:06.130> that's<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.850> for<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.120> one<00:03:07.390> you

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
man but uh that's it for this one you

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.509 
man but uh that's it for this one you
know<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.380> only<00:03:08.590> thing<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.860> really<00:03:09.340> would

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
know the only thing that really would

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.120 
know the only thing that really would
have<00:03:09.580> been<00:03:09.660> doper<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.530> they<00:03:11.680> actually

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
have been doper is that they actually

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.310 
have been doper is that they actually
did<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.400> remix<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.480> pour<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.870> up<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.170> know<00:03:14.290> and

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
did the remix to pour it up you know and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.590 
did the remix to pour it up you know and
have<00:03:14.620> Juicy<00:03:15.100> J<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.549> Rick<00:03:15.700> Ross<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.180> there<00:03:16.420> I

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
have Juicy J and Rick Ross in there I

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.180 
have Juicy J and Rick Ross in there I
think<00:03:17.049> that<00:03:17.200> would<00:03:17.350> have<00:03:17.440> been<00:03:17.500> really<00:03:17.920> dope

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
think that would have been really dope

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.160 
think that would have been really dope
and<00:03:18.519> uh<00:03:18.610> probably<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.540> would<00:03:19.660> have<00:03:19.780> kicked<00:03:19.959> up

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
and uh probably it would have kicked up

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.990 
and uh probably it would have kicked up
the<00:03:20.230> video<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.769> not<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.430> know<00:03:21.549> what<00:03:21.640> I'm<00:03:21.730> saying
