00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
one point oh that's right version 1

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.889 
one point oh that's right version 1
point<00:00:39.530> 0<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:41.410> this<00:00:42.410> is<00:00:42.590> a<00:00:43.239> camera<00:00:44.239> stabilizer

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
point 0 and this is a camera stabilizer

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.640 
point 0 and this is a camera stabilizer
for<00:00:45.290> video<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.930> mall<00:00:48.110> flow<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.500> name

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
for video and the mall flow the name

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.420 
for video and the mall flow the name
comes<00:00:48.949> from<00:00:49.250> movie<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.510> flow<00:00:52.000> now<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:53.659> is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
comes from movie and flow now this is

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.850 
comes from movie and flow now this is
quite<00:00:55.430> a<00:00:55.489> common<00:00:55.879> thing<00:00:56.000> on<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.269> internet<00:00:56.570> a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
quite a common thing on the internet a

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.890 
quite a common thing on the internet a
do-it-yourself<00:00:57.860> sort<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.900> stabilizer

do-it-yourself sort of stabilizer

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.960 
do-it-yourself sort of stabilizer
because<00:01:01.659> the<00:01:02.659> Merlin<00:01:03.079> steady<00:01:03.440> can<00:01:03.970> retails

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
because the Merlin steady can retails

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.080 
because the Merlin steady can retails
for<00:01:05.710> eight<00:01:06.710> hundred<00:01:06.830> dollars<00:01:07.010> i<00:01:07.369> think<00:01:07.610> the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
for eight hundred dollars i think the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.960 
for eight hundred dollars i think the
end<00:01:08.450> this<00:01:09.380> certainly<00:01:09.740> did<00:01:09.979> not<00:01:10.010> cost<00:01:10.369> me<00:01:10.640> three

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
end this certainly did not cost me three

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.370

are getting frustrated with these
because<00:02:37.650> first<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.640> all<00:02:38.760> they<00:02:38.940> can't<00:02:39.180> balance

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
because first of all they can't balance

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.570 
because first of all they can't balance
it<00:02:39.780> correctly<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.590> even<00:02:41.250> once<00:02:41.400> they<00:02:41.489> get

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
it correctly and even once they get

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.430 
it correctly and even once they get
about<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.180> get<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.299> balanced<00:02:42.810> they're<00:02:43.170> not

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
about and get a balanced they're not

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.130 
about and get a balanced they're not
able<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:44.160> really<00:02:45.060> get<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.390> shots<00:02:45.660> now<00:02:46.019> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
able to really get the shots now the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.759 
able to really get the shots now the
trick<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.989> know<00:02:49.080> what<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.380> don't<00:02:49.620> really

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
trick is you know what I don't really

trick is you know what I don't really
know<00:02:50.010> all<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.190> tricks<00:02:50.340> yet<00:02:50.640> I'm<00:02:50.850> still<00:02:51.120> quite

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
know all the tricks yet I'm still quite

new to this but based on all of the
things<00:02:53.549> I've<00:02:53.790> read<00:02:54.860> technique<00:02:55.860> does<00:02:56.100> involve

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
things I've read technique does involve

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.250 
things I've read technique does involve
some<00:02:57.000> use<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:58.590> thumb<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.069> control<00:03:00.260> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
some use of the thumb to control the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.530 
some use of the thumb to control the
panning<00:03:02.150> motion<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.690> camera<00:03:04.280> okay<00:03:05.510> when<00:03:06.510> I

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
panning motion of the camera okay when I

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.100 
panning motion of the camera okay when I
use<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.410> want<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.680> turn<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.920> corner

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
use this and I want to turn a corner

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.870 
use this and I want to turn a corner
okay<00:03:10.110> you'll<00:03:10.260> notice<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:11.519> doesn't

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
okay you'll notice that it doesn't

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.340 
okay you'll notice that it doesn't
really<00:03:12.030> turn<00:03:12.390> with<00:03:12.600> my<00:03:12.750> wrist

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.420 

okay<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:15.980> can<00:03:16.250> make<00:03:16.460> this<00:03:16.690> motion<00:03:18.160> side<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.400> side

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
okay I can make this motion side to side

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.110 
okay I can make this motion side to side
back<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.480> forth<00:03:21.220> turn<00:03:22.220> sideways<00:03:22.490> so<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:22.970> can

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
back and forth turn sideways so you can

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.380 
back and forth turn sideways so you can
see<00:03:23.360> here<00:03:25.420> camera<00:03:26.420> is<00:03:26.510> going<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.780> stay

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
see here camera is going to stay

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.580 
see here camera is going to stay
relatively<00:03:29.390> balanced<00:03:32.050> okay<00:03:33.050> I<00:03:33.080> can<00:03:33.380> make

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
relatively balanced okay I can make

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.730 
relatively balanced okay I can make
front<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.010> back<00:03:34.190> side<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.300> side<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.900> if

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
front the back side to side and if

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.650 
front the back side to side and if
you've<00:03:36.890> got<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.100> balanced<00:03:37.550> perfectly<00:03:37.850> the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
you've got a balanced perfectly the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.070 
you've got a balanced perfectly the
camera<00:03:39.080> should<00:03:39.260> reset<00:03:39.770> itself<00:03:40.390> got<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.420> tiny

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
camera should reset itself got a tiny

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.400 
camera should reset itself got a tiny
tiny<00:03:42.650> little<00:03:42.950> bit<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.250> sway<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.090> side<00:03:44.420> but

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
tiny little bit of sway to the side but

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.240

depending on the camera that you've
mounted<00:04:51.950> on<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:52.490> there's<00:04:53.090> going<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.270> be<00:04:53.300> a

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
mounted on this there's going to be a

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.690 
mounted on this there's going to be a
different<00:04:53.660> balance<00:04:53.810> point<00:04:54.290> okay<00:04:54.980> so<00:04:55.550> what

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
different balance point okay so what

that you can mount the camera on okay i
prefer<00:06:01.060> to<00:06:01.270> try<00:06:01.599> and<00:06:01.750> balance<00:06:02.139> this<00:06:02.589> with<00:06:03.310> the

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
prefer to try and balance this with the

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.579 
prefer to try and balance this with the
plate<00:06:03.839> pushed<00:06:04.839> all<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.139> way<00:06:05.610> to<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.729> front
