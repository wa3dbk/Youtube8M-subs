00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
this back wall to see if there's

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.790 
this back wall to see if there's
anything<00:00:21.890> it<00:00:22.890> doesn't<00:00:23.189> seem<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.580> much

today what you never now on our troubles
with<00:00:28.769> may<00:00:28.949> see<00:00:29.010> something<00:00:29.720> which<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
with may see something which is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.280 
with may see something which is
worthwhile<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:33.540> I'm<00:00:33.690> gonna<00:00:33.809> cook<00:00:33.930> peer<00:00:34.260> over

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
more mild today 12 degrees between 11

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.610 
more mild today 12 degrees between 11
and<00:00:45.210> 12<00:00:45.450> degrees<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.140> not<00:00:46.230> too<00:00:46.410> bad

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
