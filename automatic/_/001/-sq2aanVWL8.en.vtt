total<00:01:09.030> myth<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.110> takes<00:01:10.410> a<00:01:10.500> little<00:01:10.650> bit

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
total myth and and it takes a little bit

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.420 
total myth and and it takes a little bit
of<00:01:10.890> explanation<00:01:11.730> but<00:01:12.710> electricity<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.190> rates

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430

of explanation but electricity the rates
vary<00:01:15.060> by<00:01:15.360> time<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.810> day<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.650> yes<00:01:17.010> there<00:01:17.340> could

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
vary by time of day so yes there could

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.670 
vary by time of day so yes there could
be<00:01:17.580> four<00:01:18.210> o'clock<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.660> afternoon<00:01:18.750> 100

stressed a little bit that's the most

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.560 
Leaf it could be 3 to 6 cents a kilowatt
hour<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.580> some<00:01:35.760> parts<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.180> country<00:01:36.540> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
hour in some parts of the country so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.530 
hour in some parts of the country so
very<00:01:37.080> very<00:01:37.440> inexpensive<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.580> people<00:01:39.300> worry

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
very very inexpensive and people worry

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.210 
very very inexpensive and people worry
about<00:01:39.630> DC<00:01:40.170> fast<00:01:40.380> charge<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.190> that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
about DC fast charge and they think that

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.890 
about DC fast charge and they think that
that<00:01:41.460> electricity<00:01:41.909> somehow<00:01:42.480> is<00:01:42.659> more

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
that electricity somehow is more

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.260 
that electricity somehow is more
expensive<00:01:43.260> it's<00:01:43.980> just<00:01:44.190> an<00:01:44.310> electron<00:01:44.760> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
expensive it's just an electron the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.300 
expensive it's just an electron the
electrons<00:01:45.690> basically<00:01:46.200> cost<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.650> same<00:01:46.890> so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
electrons basically cost the same so

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.370 
electrons basically cost the same so
it's<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.670> matter<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.600> time<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.870> day<00:01:49.050> time

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it's a matter of what time of day time

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.770 
it's a matter of what time of day time
of<00:01:49.560> day<00:01:49.710> makes<00:01:49.979> more<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:51.150> impact<00:01:51.570> on

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
little bit of a Frankenstein to

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.550 
little bit of a Frankenstein to
understand<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.549> utility<00:02:09.420> industry<00:02:09.560> I've

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
understand the utility industry I've

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.690 
understand the utility industry I've
learned<00:02:10.799> a<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:10.979> bit<00:02:11.220> about<00:02:11.430> their

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
learned a little bit about their

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.160 
learned a little bit about their
generating<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.569> their<00:02:12.690> pricing<00:02:13.110> structure

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
generating and their pricing structure

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.420 
generating and their pricing structure
think<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.160> sine<00:02:15.580> wave<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:17.260> peak<00:02:17.680> at<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.250> top

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
think of a sine wave so peak at the top

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.770 
think of a sine wave so peak at the top
of<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.640> sine<00:02:18.850> wave<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:19.120> when<00:02:19.450> they<00:02:19.540> have<00:02:19.660> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
of the sine wave is when they have the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.809 
of the sine wave is when they have the
highest<00:02:20.110> demand<00:02:20.260> that's<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.310> four<00:02:21.550> o'clock

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
highest demand that's that four o'clock

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:22.920 
highest demand that's that four o'clock
in<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.000> afternoon<00:02:22.090> when<00:02:22.690> it's<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.840> hundred

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
in the afternoon when it's a hundred

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.420 
in the afternoon when it's a hundred
degrees<00:02:23.170> out<00:02:23.590> that's<00:02:23.770> when<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.040> costs<00:02:24.340> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
degrees out that's when it costs the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.420

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
most they have to build power plants to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.330 
most they have to build power plants to
fill<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.060> be<00:02:28.540> ready<00:02:28.720> for<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.230> peak<00:02:29.620> now<00:02:30.160> that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
fill and be ready for that peak now that

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.520 
fill and be ready for that peak now that
typically<00:02:30.820> happens<00:02:31.150> with<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.360> utility<00:02:31.840> less

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.199 
typically happens with the utility less
than<00:02:32.770> 14<00:02:33.220> days<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.459> year<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:33.910> they<00:02:34.000> have<00:02:34.120> to

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
than 14 days a year so they have to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
build all those power plants all that

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.980 
build all those power plants all that

wasted<00:02:48.130> resources<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.120> can't<00:02:49.330> really

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
wasted resources and you can't really

wasted resources and you can't really
save<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:50.020> that's<00:02:50.770> when<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.010> charge<00:02:51.310> electric

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
save it that's when you charge electric

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.390 
save it that's when you charge electric
vehicles<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.959> they<00:02:53.170> love<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.680> fact<00:02:53.860> utility

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
vehicles so they love the fact utility

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.680 
vehicles so they love the fact utility
companies<00:02:54.700> love<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.030> fact<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.360> electric

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
companies love the fact that electric

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.630 
companies love the fact that electric
vehicles<00:02:55.720> charge<00:02:56.320> overnight<00:02:56.650> because<00:02:57.190> that's

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
vehicles charge overnight because that's

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.330 
vehicles charge overnight because that's
filling<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.180> trough<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:59.080> most<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.250> their

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
filling that trough and most of their

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.070 
filling that trough and most of their
business<00:03:00.730> models<00:03:01.120> they<00:03:01.330> get<00:03:01.510> paid<00:03:01.750> on<00:03:01.930> their

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
total kind of generation capacity so

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.780 
total kind of generation capacity so
they've<00:03:05.590> bought<00:03:05.950> they've<00:03:06.130> built<00:03:06.489> all<00:03:06.640> this

you<00:03:08.650> see<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.519> sell<00:03:09.790> more<00:03:09.940> electric<00:03:10.269> vehicles

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
you see you sell more electric vehicles

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.240 
you see you sell more electric vehicles
and<00:03:10.780> sell<00:03:10.959> more<00:03:11.110> energy<00:03:11.440> down<00:03:11.560> here<00:03:11.830> the
