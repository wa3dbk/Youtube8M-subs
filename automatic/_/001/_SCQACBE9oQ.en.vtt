00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.600 
moves than this all why he's not doing
it<00:03:35.060> but<00:03:35.330> uh<00:03:35.740> makes<00:03:36.740> it<00:03:36.860> more<00:03:36.980> difficult<00:03:37.160> when

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
it but uh makes it more difficult when

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.310
