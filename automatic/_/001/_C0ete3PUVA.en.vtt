let's<00:02:18.550> play<00:02:18.760> with<00:02:18.970> us<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> little<00:02:19.300> bit<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.810> play

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
let's play with us a little bit and play

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.560 
let's play with us a little bit and play
with<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:20.650> concept<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.610> adding<00:02:22.120> some<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.450> our

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
with this concept of adding some of our

we're<00:02:24.550> going<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.730> use<00:02:24.850> some<00:02:25.030> rose<00:02:25.210> hips<00:02:25.240> in

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
we're going to use some rose hips in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.740 
we're going to use some rose hips in
this<00:02:25.810> design<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.890> notice<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:28.120> by<00:02:28.300> adding

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
this design and notice that by adding

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.130 
this design and notice that by adding
some<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.110> our<00:02:29.260> rose<00:02:29.500> hips<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.670> our<00:02:30.820> design<00:02:31.240> it's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
some of our rose hips to our design it's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.960 
some of our rose hips to our design it's
going<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.410> make<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.680> feel<00:02:32.860> different<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.700> it

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
going to make it feel different and it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.770 
going to make it feel different and it
doesn't<00:02:34.300> take<00:02:34.480> too<00:02:34.510> much<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:36.040> few<00:02:36.070> pieces

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
doesn't take too much just a few pieces

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.580 
doesn't take too much just a few pieces
here<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.930> there<00:02:37.990> into<00:02:38.590> our<00:02:39.430> arrangement<00:02:40.180> is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
here and there into our arrangement is

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.460 
here and there into our arrangement is
enough<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.740> give<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.190> very<00:02:42.580> very<00:02:42.910> different

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
enough to give a very very different

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.550 
enough to give a very very different
kind<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.590> look<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:45.100> our<00:02:45.820> designing<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:47.290> stuff

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
kind of look to our designing this stuff

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.250 
kind of look to our designing this stuff
is<00:02:47.770> fun<00:02:48.160> it's<00:02:48.610> pretty<00:02:49.470> it's<00:02:50.470> nice<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.890> use<00:02:51.100> and

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
is fun it's pretty it's nice to use and

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.050 
is fun it's pretty it's nice to use and
look<00:02:53.260> how<00:02:53.470> incorporating<00:02:54.460> it<00:02:54.610> into<00:02:54.790> our

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
look how incorporating it into our

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.370 
look how incorporating it into our
design<00:02:55.480> works<00:02:56.380> very<00:02:56.710> very<00:02:57.160> nicely<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:59.260> I'm

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
design works very very nicely so I'm

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.440 
design works very very nicely so I'm
working<00:02:59.740> some<00:02:59.980> up<00:03:00.130> hi<00:03:00.370> working<00:03:01.000> some<00:03:01.240> down<00:03:01.420> a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
working some up hi working some down a

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.160 
working some up hi working some down a
little<00:03:01.630> bit<00:03:01.840> lower<00:03:03.240> I'm<00:03:04.240> putting<00:03:04.690> some<00:03:04.870> over

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
little bit lower I'm putting some over

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.230 
little bit lower I'm putting some over
here<00:03:05.560> on<00:03:05.800> this<00:03:05.980> side<00:03:06.040> on<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.180> bottom<00:03:07.360> still<00:03:09.240> so

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
here on this side on the bottom still so

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.630 
here on this side on the bottom still so
notice<00:03:10.630> how<00:03:11.290> our<00:03:11.650> design<00:03:12.070> is<00:03:12.280> totally

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
notice how our design is totally

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.060 
notice how our design is totally
transformed<00:03:13.300> now<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.510> could<00:03:13.780> continue<00:03:14.140> if<00:03:14.590> this

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
transformed now I could continue if this

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.040 
transformed now I could continue if this
is<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.250> one-sided<00:03:15.760> design<00:03:16.240> I<00:03:16.270> could<00:03:16.600> call<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.960> a

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
is a one-sided design I could call it a

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.290 
is a one-sided design I could call it a
day<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.709> if<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.400> were<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.910> design

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
day like this if this were a design

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.390 
day like this if this were a design
meant<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.630> be<00:03:19.750> viewed<00:03:20.020> all<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.380> way<00:03:20.500> around<00:03:20.860> we

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
meant to be viewed all the way around we

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.070 
meant to be viewed all the way around we
could<00:03:21.610> continue<00:03:21.940> on<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.360> other<00:03:22.510> side<00:03:22.810> but<00:03:23.050> I

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
could continue on the other side but I

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.500 
could continue on the other side but I
think<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.380> can<00:03:23.500> get<00:03:23.650> an<00:03:23.739> idea<00:03:23.860> how<00:03:24.430> quickly<00:03:25.180> we

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
think you can get an idea how quickly we

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.080 
think you can get an idea how quickly we
can<00:03:25.660> take<00:03:25.959> an<00:03:26.200> arrangement<00:03:27.040> that's<00:03:27.700> already

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
can take an arrangement that's already

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.300 
can take an arrangement that's already
beautiful<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:28.900> lovely<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.440> totally

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
beautiful and lovely and totally

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.970 
beautiful and lovely and totally
transform<00:03:30.580> it<00:03:31.120> just<00:03:31.930> with<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.170> few<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.650> our<00:03:32.739> rose

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
transform it just with a few of our rose

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.479 
transform it just with a few of our rose
hips<00:03:33.340> some<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.270> these<00:03:34.330> beautiful<00:03:34.720> berries

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
Beloit isn't that beautiful

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.729 
Beloit isn't that beautiful
it<00:03:40.239> gives<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.630> really<00:03:40.989> really<00:03:41.260> neat<00:03:41.410> effect

let's play with this a little bit more

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.560 
let's play with this a little bit more
this<00:03:44.230> is<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.500> design<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.090> obviously<00:03:46.480> a

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
this is a design that is obviously a

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.150 
this is a design that is obviously a
foam<00:03:46.900> based<00:03:47.110> design<00:03:47.470> let's<00:03:47.709> play<00:03:47.920> with

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
foam based design let's play with

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.000 
foam based design let's play with
something<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:49.270> is<00:03:49.360> water-based<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:50.590> let's

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
something that is water-based and let's

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.150 
something that is water-based and let's
put<00:03:51.459> on<00:03:51.670> our<00:03:52.209> design<00:03:52.690> up<00:03:53.080> here<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.590> back<00:03:53.890> off

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
put on our design up here and back off

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.100 
put on our design up here and back off
our<00:03:54.400> camera<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:54.880> little<00:03:54.970> bit<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.630> can<00:03:55.900> see
