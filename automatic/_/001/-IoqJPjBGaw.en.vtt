00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.090
 today we are a guest at hockey club 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.920
 hdm 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.030
 and in sports and facebook there is the 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.309
 pawns that have been made available 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.570
 through the rabobank and I will take a look today 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.280
 what they do 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.949
 the girls are busy with the hot ones 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.939
 air I naturally want to know what they are then 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.769
 like doe 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.619
 to view with good can or here one 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.569
 new pop talent will be in the 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.789
 Dutch hockey team is back and 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:30.999
 back eh yes 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.050
 and now our pawn is getting very bad 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.540
 important and I think they go 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.540
 rays between the cones 7 look 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.900
 my warm hup and done here 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.770
 a little responsive warm running and now what how 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.790
 friends 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.990
 yes because that exercise for that 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.120
 exercises that are you then 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.060
 so use the pawn there yes 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.430
 salon and how could the opponent too 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.600
 pass to coleslaw 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.670
 who is really your big one 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.500
 example and 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.940
 Well for me not like things like 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.770
 team why 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.629
 after them the same position is certain 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.149
 not very good look look look look 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.039
 hope for snow 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.329
 a circle around the world I can handle it 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.789
 with the football but i think i like this 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:16.270
 can 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:18.609

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.310
 I see you in a few years 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:23.530

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.090

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.090

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.610
 what is the intention what what are we going now 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.310
 do with the pawns 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.049
 long subtle and antagel and this to 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.119
 those in the balcony walk it 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.539
