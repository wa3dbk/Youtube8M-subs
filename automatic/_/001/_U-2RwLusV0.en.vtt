00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.590
 given a little vampire but this is 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.349
 precisely the enamel minetto focus 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.389
 on the gradient in the video the two 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.279
 vampire outfit about which I leave you the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.420
 link here is under the only box if you are 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.550
 from the mobile device 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.010
 this gradient tone on tone then 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.090
 as you can see the same color that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.810
 go very dark almost black has a lot more 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.500
 clear 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.969
 following the line of the fingers obviously 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.870
 what is the color with which I did this 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.090
 manicure 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.180
 I have not used those without 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.399
 use the pupa kit designed for the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.210
 gradient michael but I have drawn the number 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.250
 cie 08 then ceramic f08 delilah che 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.770
 I live view then the packaging 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.600
 small that gave me mirko between 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.239
 the other is a wonderful second color 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.219
 me and it's almost a very dark purple 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.270
 tending to black 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.520
 in fact in its full application 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.110
 that is, three passes seem black is 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.280
 practically black in its application 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.710
 full instead here and here is only one 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 passed the ring finger and is a purple you see 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.310
 identical to the color of my color 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.130
 lips 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.080
 here is a pass in between we say e 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.060
 here are two past and here they are 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.000
 just three in the millet is not one 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.920
 past but what remained in the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.350
 brush after making a pass 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.030
 in the ring finger then I just cleaned the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.440
 brush with the little finger 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.900
 what to tell you about this polish of the other 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.240
 I have not been able to tell wines of durability or quality 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.860
 because in any case they were mixed and these 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 things were not perceived well instead of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.240
 this can make you a real one 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.300
 review as you have seen does not cover 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.830
 immediately the first pass is a little more 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.410
 get out of the usual 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.940
 many glazes to get to this 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.850
 result maybe we should give though 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.430
 enough though 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.250
 as you see it is not understood how 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.280
 many other seramik effects and therefore 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.739
 compared to other ceramics, the coverage 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.959
 the time still I can't tell you where it is 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.640
 I'll leave the tab below in the tab 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.220
 that I always put evaluation of 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.500
 nail polish the color is fantastic is a 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.080
 full color without any glitter without 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.530
 no for science 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.709
 therefore a papa color not opaque crimi 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.130
 here is full without plate completely 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.130
 dish 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.340
 to the touch to the quality of the evening friends fx 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.500
 because it is very shiny and above all after 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.020
 two passes much more polished in the first 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.810
 still the surface is noticeable 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.880
 of the nail however we say the imperfections 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.500
 of the nail surface though 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.380
 however very polished in the third 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.720
 past really looks like it looks like one 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.390
 enamel effect as everyone will be mica fx 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.340
 that I personally love 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.710
 obviously it's not a very look 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.050
 spring, however, here is if you are a soul 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.330
 a little dark or you can try to do it 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.709
 with a more spring color or finally 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.180
 you can use it in the fall 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.180
 a big kiss hello
