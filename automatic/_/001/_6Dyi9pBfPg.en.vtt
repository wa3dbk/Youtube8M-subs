talk about now I want to talk about a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.870 
talk about now I want to talk about a
very<00:01:06.840> specific<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> call<00:01:07.860> brokering<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
very specific what I call brokering and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.910 
very specific what I call brokering and
it's<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.150> way<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> get<00:01:09.689> yourself<00:01:09.869> into<00:01:10.500> two

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
markets at one time okay and this is a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
markets at one time okay and this is a
technique<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.530> used<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.159> whether<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.549> was

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
technique I used to do whether I was

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.350 
technique I used to do whether I was
either<00:01:18.030> routing<00:01:18.720> some<00:01:19.049> bands<00:01:19.500> or<00:01:20.369> especially

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
either routing some bands or especially

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.249 
either routing some bands or especially
if<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.770> hooking<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.240> other<00:01:24.540> bands<00:01:24.960> in

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
if I was hooking up to other bands in

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.740 
if I was hooking up to other bands in
order<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.979> make<00:01:26.280> sure<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.580> could<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:27.000> my<00:01:27.360> band

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
order to make sure I could get my band

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.560 
order to make sure I could get my band
into<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.350> new<00:01:28.590> markets<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:30.060> brokering

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
into to new markets and the brokering

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.679 
into to new markets and the brokering
concept<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.259> very<00:01:31.320> simple<00:01:31.970> I'm<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.420> take

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
