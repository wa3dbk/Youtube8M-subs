 his beast he rode martins and other 102 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.120
 you want above all to the puc 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.010
 reasonably quiet in class and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.930
 producing accompaniment and only that this 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.469
 It 's different for you. 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.500
 most useful and boring is a light kick is the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.230
 What are you going to see send a slide? 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.680
 hold a little and then you jump 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.870
 he besides the kick did not understand the word 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.059
 this Monday and only went average is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.770
 logical the bastard was worth the loss of the door 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.920
 open will have more she does not keep me 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:10.320
 here makes maneuver touch it has 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.869
 difficulty already in the air day guys okay 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.180
 starting to get complex side of you 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.450
 the advantage that you arrive this morning 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.070
 It's not difficult to hit there. 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.979
 so as you sing 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.229
 You're going to have a team, it's not a force, it's a way. 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.020
 and time because it's time you gotta 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.090
 skateboard jump when he's giving 180 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.009
 this maneuver is based not feel so much 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.549
 from beck what I 'm walking down 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.229
 talk is a sector I like the most and 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.870
 midway 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.480
 I smoke I skateboard back on board 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.610
 Do you think 180's when they happen? 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.900
 when you jump and leave the champions 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.900
 not so much tradition 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:59.630
 only then it's more or less so you 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.980
 will give 1 180 but you will abort 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.770
 before 180 pennies it goes away and 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.399
 You stay so there's more you can imagine. 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.890
 If it was you, you gotta know and you got it. 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.470
 if you do not know why the old one 7 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:20.010
 monster hit us she will not talk 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.010
 now went the hill to 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.810
 the low interest rate as a whole being the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.980
 straight godmother this represents 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.980
 a middle of the track 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.110
 I simulated in the jovial mind of you explain 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:08.099
 sure that the yellow line still 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.099
 left margin at the front 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.599
 I arrive in the middle of the lane on the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.819
 an account that position I scoresheet 83 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.000
 see which ones are treated at home but 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.000
 also 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.030
 But when you come to see 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.950
 the sound near coming on the other side let's 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.480
 leave things to do alone 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.120
 Do not attack, do you? 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.970
 When you got here, player kicks when 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.360
 you see your radio clasp you 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.250
 It's a top secret for you to hit. 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.819
 this maneuver kicks him away from what is 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.299
 you 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.489
 the 180 idec car after you had 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.860
 hit you jump you're going to make a 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:05.680
 wrong purpose maneuver is what you 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:07.780

 Let's continue to fall for you. 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.549
 to teach the tunnel that is needed 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.820
 the maneuver I do not see that the 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.430
 My mother, I do not know either. 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.620
 secret in this thing of seeing is not 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.389
 coming to an end 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.930
 our pet project will show you how it is 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.930
 correct 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.700
 You are the brazil topete são gonçalo. 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.170
 so look who saw you, Felipe. 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.770
 verdict 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:48.480
 Look when he arrived I was in this 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.480
 alice or 181 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.290
 You do not look, you 're your profile. 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.810
 normally you do have it in 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.220
 Facebook 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.350
 This is a work you did not see in your neck. 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.950
 on puc is facing the front 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.960
 If you stop, it will spin. 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.820
 was the room where your eyes commanding 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.490
 So where do you look at what you are? 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.630
 bringing what you want to do now is to continue 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:16.170
 with the correct one it does not leave the head turned 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.170
 always looking forward 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.490
 if you let the neck turn you will 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.450
 to perform if a player does not 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:28.000
 my comment was not of good tone brady 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.250
 said hans adu realize the voting takes place 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.780
 in practical hand needle also easy 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.720
 arriving now in the movement is already 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.700
 walking but Gustavo focuses on the stop 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.530
 no use whining in general rule 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.169
 that the maneuver is difficult to 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.530
 Trying the team playing you will be 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:47.350
 but this is part of a jolt even makes 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.160
 part of the stage of 6 that is on time 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.160
 to cry given to me 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:06:06.310
 O look forward, only you, sir. 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.189
 that he did he did what gives him a 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.979
 feedback to be able to one day to 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.779
 control the speed and power already looks at 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.060
 second maneuver then a legal tip 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:17.949
 it's also that you know beck 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.009
 because this will leave you with less 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:22.539
 afraid to kick and will stop 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.180
 be calmer with the fact that you 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.710
 being in the maneuver without turning the neck is 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.199
 The football you 're there for 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.229
