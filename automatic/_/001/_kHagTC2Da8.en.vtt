00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.490
 nice all guys are cts spar that 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.559
 after a long time I don't 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.909
 I make you feel this fantastic 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.849
 channel of port my 152 2 where file 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:25.640
 Raw a nuclear or chopped, however, the 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.339
 first nuclear after that I'll get to 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.180
 about 27 28 and a my partner 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:35.330
 he will kill and then I'll do another one 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.460
 of using and this gameplay is done with 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.190
 rewards the assault so it seems to me 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.200
 that I have not seen jean dog or I had 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.210
 the helicopter was in place of the 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.100
 face I don't remember and in many places 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.600
 of the gameplay enemies will be still though 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.820
 I can't do anything about it because it is 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.800
 however it fills me beautiful and you can 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.760
 see anyway if it is not tasted because 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.950
 enemies will change type 3 or 4 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.189
 they will come out so I can do it 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.069
 nothing came out this gameplay was 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.890
 nice so it's not for sure like a star 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:11.600
 today he was in the company of the zodiac 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.569
 look all guys i meant two 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.640
 things more on the gameplay are 29 

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:19.759
 gastric in the second that kills a 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.740
 mate unfortunately because he wanted to 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.990
 kill an enemy behind sheeran spar 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.990
 that he also kills would have been 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.789
 the triple luca, however, we have a kid 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.030
 always a police for the fact of 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:35.209
 enemies like I said spark in the end you 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.429
 you know as soon as you pull a wizard on black 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.560
 ops 2 all twittano here were also 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.409
 dancing dogs and swarms so you have 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.469
 since they immediately returned in bulk 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.240
 so it is however towards the end of the gameplay 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.829
 at the beginning of the second round there is a bit 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.590
 of firm people who took so much 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.200
 so many times that I left the joystick 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.759
 I don't know what the irvv fucking this dirty e 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.529
 still something to say let's move on to 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.189
 arguments not to praise the income among the 

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:01.009
 arguments 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.780
 ok then I wanted to do it first 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.270
 because it gives so much that 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.159
 I said it more to sponsor like 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.560
 always our chart because anyway 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.500
 alloy like i said i am a little bit 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.350
 pain in the ass so he goes for every night 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.060
 lends itself to making all the miniatures 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.220
 knocked down faces sometimes 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.020
 we are calling his mother sclera 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.750
 also says but who are you talking to 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.160
 he arrives there not always worse than calini 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.890
 but whenever he can do it 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.020
 these miniatures that to me that of 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.520
 Clans love them so much 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.470
 guys if you need a chart 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.720
 so you know we leave his channel 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.680
 you will also find it in the description 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.600
 on box in the roster to our chart of 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.239
 trust in the very great king there 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.040
 so it helps a lot if you need 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.830
 pass by him and now we move on to 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.600
 what were the arguments that 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.330
 however, I kept everything in the dark 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.940
 spark because I wanted to see him for a moment 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.440
 what did he think so in cold blood that 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.230
 however, we also want to know what it is 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.970
 think of you then my arguments yes 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.120
 they were based for a moment on what it was 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.690
 tv series and what were the movies at 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.519
 cinema 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.260
 now we are at the beginning of the TV series 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.930
 I think now it's happening that 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.660
 all the tv series now I don't say 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.930
 beautiful that I follow them so just right 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.200
 to give you an example, so xfactor 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.940
 now from what it was I don't know if yes 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.989
 he saw first on heaven on another 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.269
 bullshit 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.420
 now they are seen only on sky and all 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.000
 these tv series the best ones that 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.180
 they are making more audience now 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.750
 moving all his skype or premier not 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.340
 I therefore believe people if they are only on 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.440
 digital terrestrial are want of 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.870
 redeem because I don't know in 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.329
 italy vi and televisions fails 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.829
 the more I see them now is not that 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.769
 particularly interesting 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:58.130
 I made this observation because every 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.739
 3x2 exposed a series that regards 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.519
 many follow on sky and I wanted 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.430
 know your opinion for a moment 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.250
 because if you think it is right to do it not 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.270
 it is right then surely sky it 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.489
 will pay the fees and all but doing 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.860
 obviously a lot of audience and people do 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.980
 subscribe more to see just that 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.690
 series but doing so people who 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.820
 maybe he doesn't have too much money for 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.590
 afford chess with non stuff 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.930
 he can no longer follow certain series 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.540
 liked it here if you have to review it type 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.430
 ten years later in the sense that by now you know 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.650
 since he has won xfactor it is useless that 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.130
 the regards to you then there is this is a bit 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.070
 my first thing on the soft tv series 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.630
 pack if you want to say something like never 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.390
 TV series have turned into one 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.900
 big cake side now a whole thing 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.520
 organized you know how it will end 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.010
 all done for history indeed 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.990
 lately I don't want to say about 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.460
 pro programs I have to do for photos ad 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.980
 example the big brother as you see 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.460
 now I never really liked you 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.530
 see now it's really kind of crap 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.600
 the visuals have dropped a mess 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.440
 and this because it is becoming everything 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.980
 more and more a thing for money 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.650
 enthusiasts decrease each time to 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.940
 me guys liked personally now 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.530
 take the piss I liked 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.690
 the island of the famous that unfortunately not 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.430
 they do more marabello because it was anyway 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.020
 there, that is, it is nothing but great 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.780
 brother are at home do not do shit 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.640
 pleasant on the island where scar and fat food 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.230
 there was evidence 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.960
 I think it was a little more than we say 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.210
 interactive and this was what it was 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.180
 on TV series and let us know yours 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.370
 the other topic and the cinema now at 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.820
 is giving me an absurd annoyance 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.530
 fact that every 3x2 have to redo a movie 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.360
 they started to repair tarzan of his 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.480
 return godzilla in a while they will do it again 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.030
 I don't know the idiot fish, I don't know 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.430
 remade in 3d with not just putting the 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.500
 things done better though the plot is always 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.960
 that but what sense does it have 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.770
 and also nice because the films were old 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.660
 were less graphically processed proof 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.270
 the story and the message behind 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.990
 they must repair them with a thousand 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.550
 scene effects and graphic absurd things and 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.919
 for what to redo a movie that is already 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.400
 You were made to present it again in 3D 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.220
 you spend 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.139
 the wrath of god for what then makes come 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.490
 these glasses that headache 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.850
 this was a bit all that 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.740
 we had to say about cinema 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.900
 to the TV series but so an opinion was a 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.240
 just right to tell you something not to talk 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.389
 always of the usual things they wanted to know 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.789
 anyway your opinion because you 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.800
 maybe you know something more or 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:44.340
 however, you have a different opinion from the 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.009
 our 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.690
 and it's nice though to interact below 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.030
 more if you have any other topic 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.010
 to propose to treat in the next ones 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.100
 video some gameplay to do then 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.660
 write us below with mentalist 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.199
 adding the term as well as the 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.120
 gameplay 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.070
 I have cut you some parts for not 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.410
