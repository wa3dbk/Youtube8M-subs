00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.070
 my name is skin agudelo here in this 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.340
 moment let's go let's try to look 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:16.490
 how to program this alarm version 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:18.980
 bananas that relax 24s z 11 the alarm of 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.650
 factory comes with the auto system 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.940
 activated disabled and that program by 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.500
 half of me yo but 1 2 3 and 4 in this 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.330
 case the auto- active function the 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.330
 function number 1 then 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.290
 in the case that the controls do not 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.370
 come scheduled is very simple 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:52.150
 we open switch one two three four five 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.079
 of teaching we press control 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.969
 second control 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 we closed the sector to the program 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:04.890
 fiscal controls active low insurance 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.890
 insurance 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.520
 this one that is announcing here is called 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.370
 reassembled and deactivated when opening and 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.940
 close the door the active car works 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.340
 by means of accessories go assured I had 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.229
 safe and now a door should whistle 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.590
 but as it comes from factory disabled 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.190
 As we program simple, we disconnect 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.190
 the alarm 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.790
 we passed the script per number 1 to the part 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.170
 down 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.170
 reconnect 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.080
 we activate we deactivate we open 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.140
 accessories you go to insurance 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.230
 the accessories and we open the door of the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.660
 pit indicating that 30 seconds in 30 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.730
 seconds is activated if you close it again 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.430
 strong and re-open it makes the 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.340
 same function that can not be programmed 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.780
 unless they remove me and so 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.880
 activates the function of we see that it 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.880
 activate delay 30 seconds 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.510
 and she is having the count 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.760
 is going to auto activate and lower insurance 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.430
 in case you do not lower the insurance 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.170
 it is because it has not been programmed 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.960
 internally the number one function says 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.680
 secure closure with automatic weapon 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.680
 if it does not go 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.810
 we simply enter the programming 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.710
 of functions that in this case would be 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.710
 unsafe 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.830
 it would be this manual 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.360
 page 16 and 17 says 15 functions of 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.180
 programming and 4 % 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.610
 perhaps such would be the number one function 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.740
 of the electric insurance closing with the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.180
 automatic weapon like this one from factory does not 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.290
 comes the program before is not going to be 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.520
 sure we turn off accessories 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.590
 we look for accessories 1 2 3 4 5 enter 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.640
 the programming we give the function 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.660
 number 1 and we program locked padlock 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.660
 we close open accessories
