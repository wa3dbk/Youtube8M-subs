00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:04.110
 among the many methods that does not count 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.610
 without throwing the bafana will have the most effective 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.610
 but how not to denature the var 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.759
 This will be a problem 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.050
 I have to find the right temperature at its doors to kill them lying on 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.820
 should perhaps without destroying it is necessary to its aging spades 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.950
 the head but the wine tour is still alive I found the solution there 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.000
 just heat the butter and then cool it more terribly 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.650
 sing at a temperature of 50 60 degrees on a bad ferment 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.240
 without denaturing the yeast 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.870
 it's an average temperature but enough for that 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.650
 Pay attention 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.860
 it is important that you clean your equipment thoroughly and 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.330
 barrels in which you refuel 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.700
 and the letters of 14 experts from england paris the surgeon 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.090
 he discovered a new method for killing microbes based on 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.700
 works 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.440
 it's very rewarding 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.430
 gamespot com 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 at 2:30 am disinfect the surgical instruments 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.010
 was to plunge them into a final solution 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.310
 here is a flagrant example of the same way 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.060
 erevan will also be a scarcity atomizer and not in paris and his 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 translation in the operating room 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.330
 it will take place on Tuesday at the Stade de France among which state present at the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.710
 ceremony 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.070
 before any operation placed in the chelsea ranking 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.070
 and what would it be like that you destroy the case he argued 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.960
 it is not necessary to refocus the lives of many patients without this 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.729
 besides seeing them my father right away 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:55.370
 she the cross-border finland ramalho he arrived at his father's house to see again 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.450
 he understood that his premonition is tragically m 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.590
 m they can not or do not want the miller he was coming too late 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
 his father died in the morning 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.319
 the same year 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.319
 pasqua also allowed 2 0 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:19.979
 eighteen children are well 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:24.189
 mazda himself and a cerebral hemorrhage that paralyzed the arm and the 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.089
 left leg 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:29.419
 what a terrible suffering for one man 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.849
 but despite this he pursued relentlessly researched against the disease 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.509
 I think I'm close to the goal 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.949
 he's studying microbes who's responsible for cholera at home for 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:41.419
 him 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.200
 I found this culture deep in my laboratory 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.489
 and the microbes are still alive 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.489
 is treated and there I was still at a shoulder 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.449
 m 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.779
 he will probably face the verlaine college moving 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.849
 we must remember a few days 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.929
 score by the bank 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:06.939
 incredible discovery of the obligatory cholera 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.989
 do not you think microbes take place for several weeks to be 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.389
 optimistic 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.609
 those who have the experience that I live a game by the virulent microbe 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.719
 as well as a hen who never had two injections 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.760
 that the one who has never objected butter is useful both injections 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.349
 is still alive but what does it mean sir pasqua 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.199
 that means that the hen to whom we had already injected 2 liters 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.940
 develops a resistance 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.230
 when we injected 22 liters turbo the first did not get sick 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.299
 more than four hours 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.099
 pasta managed to find vaccines against coal and ore the red 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.989
 and white 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.219
 what loses in paris to medical research 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.719
 the vaccination 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.029
 here is the roma 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:52.569
 receive an injection of a weakened microbe as long as you are in good health 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.929
 and you get the disease 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:56.139
 it's that too 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.489
 vaccination allows the body to develop resistance to 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.579
 disease 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.609
 twenty-six a mad dog 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.989
 he suffers from one of the most terrible months known to be rabies 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.430
 because bitten by a dog they say he has ramallah rage within two weeks 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:14.430
 and in Switzerland 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.430
 in the city of savannah his human brain 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.319
 I do not see the mic of rabies in the saliva that I took from this 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.509
 enraged dog 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:26.819
 criticism 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:30.509
 stability then blood samples from his dogs and examining them 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:31.499
 microscope 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:34.499
 but there is nothing special 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:39.809
 very weird 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:43.189
 we know that rabies is a disease of the nervous system 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:47.199
 something in the brain but he could not find anything more in the brain 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.909
 quack grass 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.649
 it's quite normal the rabies virus could not be seen with the 

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:53.690
 microscopes of the time 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.139
 it was not necessary to wait for the mention of the electron microscope 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.210
 pastor had he a little microscope he would have found what they were looking for 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.349
 but it was not developed we know that next 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.069
 pastor realize that microbes were more concentrated in 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.030
 the brain that in the bar an injection into the muscle is not 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.349
 immediately fatal 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.759
 but instead of work he says the fastest 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.190
 in the brain one should try an injection directly into the brain 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.210
 if people who can allow 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.210
 to eventually solve the management in this poor dog's brain 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.629
 your work thanks to his star his assistant finishes in his place 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.360
 a few days later the symptoms of rabies appeared 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.279
 it is obvious that the experience had walked that date 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:46.089
 will focus on defending and that is a vaccine against rabies using 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.900
 France 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.160
 by injecting money into doubt in the microcredit in his bel 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.500
 apartment of rabies he ends up getting a very virulent microbe 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:58.089
 it was going to be used to make his own course 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.919
 from these cultures micropollutants 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.759
 it was now necessary to produce a microbe weakened your skim milk 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:07.449
 would be more marked 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.629
 to weaken the germs of girls who are draining at the end of their spinal cord 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:14.750
 of dead alata of rabies with these spinal cord extracts from 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:18.469
 files he made his first vaccinations near the goal 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:21.449
 the actor was going to proceed with the dogs as he had done with the 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.849
 hens gentlemen the day has come I will test the effectiveness of my vaccine 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.080
 the starlet put the 2010 finance rage announced it was clean 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.479
 then it was not necessary to wait two weeks to do it 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.919
 the estimated hcr stay healthy the money trainings 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.360
 pastor's experience which is clear enough 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.249
 like the last three years 15 years 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:52.939
 there is no shareholders pact signed with Islam is the religion is 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.629
 snatched from the capital michel houdbine contracting rage 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:00.629
 the experiment was conclusive 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.550
 it goes too far astonishing I would have never thought of essence like
