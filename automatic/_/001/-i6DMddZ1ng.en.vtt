00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
hi guys so if you've been on my Facebook

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.990 
hi guys so if you've been on my Facebook
channel<00:00:08.010> you've<00:00:08.130> probably<00:00:08.280> seen<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.790> build

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
channel you've probably seen the build

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.930 
channel you've probably seen the build
for<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.360> Spartan<00:00:09.750> wing<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.110> I'm<00:00:10.230> working<00:00:10.530> on

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
for the Spartan wing that I'm working on

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.100 
for the Spartan wing that I'm working on
thought<00:00:11.940> I'd<00:00:12.030> give<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> little<00:00:12.360> update<00:00:12.540> show

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
thought I'd give a little update show

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.140 
thought I'd give a little update show
you<00:00:13.169> kind<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.620> where<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.830> am<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.969> build

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
you kind of where I am in the build

process your video you're about to see

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.980 
process your video you're about to see
is<00:00:19.890> actually<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.820> official<00:00:21.240> first<00:00:21.449> maiden

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
is actually the official first maiden

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.720 
is actually the official first maiden
I'm<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> process<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.220> making<00:00:23.400> some

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
I'm in the process of making some

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.120 
I'm in the process of making some
modification<00:00:24.420> changes<00:00:25.080> doing<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.890> final

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
modification changes doing the final

modification changes doing the final
setup<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.759> fpv<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.810> had<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.830> add<00:00:28.980> quite<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
setup for fpv on this had to add quite a

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.890 
setup for fpv on this had to add quite a
considerable<00:00:30.060> amount<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.599> additional

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
considerable amount of additional

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.880 
considerable amount of additional
battery<00:00:31.529> power<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:33.450> bring<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.290> CG<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
battery power on here to bring the CG to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.610 
battery power on here to bring the CG to
the<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.190> spot<00:00:35.489> made<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> misjudgment<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the right spot made a misjudgment on the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.290 
the right spot made a misjudgment on the
calculation<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> CG<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.489> wing<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
calculation on the CG of this wing and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.260 
calculation on the CG of this wing and
did<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.410> take<00:00:43.680> into<00:00:43.800> account<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.789> blunt<00:00:45.059> nose

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
did not take into account the blunt nose

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.049 
did not take into account the blunt nose
and<00:00:45.629> basically<00:00:46.320> where<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> CG<00:00:47.280> point<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.760> so

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and basically where the CG point was so

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.720 
and basically where the CG point was so
due<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.079> blunt<00:00:49.289> nose<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.340> CG

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
due to the blunt nose on this the CG

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.049 
due to the blunt nose on this the CG
action<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.120> farther<00:00:51.420> forward<00:00:52.850> in<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
action was farther forward in the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.750 
action was farther forward in the
calculations<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:55.109> my<00:00:55.770> calculations<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
calculations then my calculations and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.540 
calculations then my calculations and
basically<00:00:57.769> adjusting<00:00:58.769> for<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.039> blunt<00:00:59.370> nose

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
basically adjusting for the blunt nose

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
basically adjusting for the blunt nose
and<00:00:59.879> moving<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> back<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.019> didn't<00:01:01.350> calculate<00:01:01.739> if

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and moving it back I didn't calculate if

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.670 
and moving it back I didn't calculate if
this<00:01:02.550> was<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> standard<00:01:03.680> basically

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
this was a standard basically

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.620 
this was a standard basically
triangle-shaped<00:01:05.520> nose<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.120> front<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
triangle-shaped nose on the front so

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.100 
triangle-shaped nose on the front so
when<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.890> rest<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.250> video

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
when you see the rest of the video

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.390 
when you see the rest of the video
definitely<00:01:10.110> take<00:01:10.230> note<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.650> move<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> CG

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
definitely take note to that move the CG

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.390 
definitely take note to that move the CG
up<00:01:11.550> about<00:01:11.820> an<00:01:12.000> inch<00:01:12.240> inch<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:12.870> a<00:01:12.960> quarter<00:01:13.400> from

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
up about an inch inch and a quarter from

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.060 
up about an inch inch and a quarter from
where<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.730> is<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.050> calculations<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
where it is in in the calculations but a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.160 
where it is in in the calculations but a
great<00:01:17.520> wing<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.120> excited<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.750> get<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.990> up

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
great wing and excited to get this up

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.440 
great wing and excited to get this up
officially<00:01:19.620> doing<00:01:19.770> fpv<00:01:20.370> so<00:01:20.670> take<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> look<00:01:21.330> at

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
officially doing fpv so take a look at

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.840 
officially doing fpv so take a look at
the<00:01:21.510> rest<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> footage<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.320> you'll<00:01:22.470> see

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
the rest of the footage and you'll see

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.740 
the rest of the footage and you'll see
what<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.940> went<00:01:24.120> through<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> thing

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.430 

that's<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.220> closer<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.450> CG<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.019> where

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
that's in it closer to the CG of where

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.250 
that's in it closer to the CG of where
it<00:03:00.560> was<00:03:00.680> calling<00:03:01.010> for<00:03:01.340> were<00:03:01.459> on<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.730> wing

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
it was calling for were on the wing

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.390 
it was calling for were on the wing
calculator<00:03:03.260> but<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.500> know<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.650> bet<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.130> blunt

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
calculator but you know I bet the blunt

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:35.039 
calculator but you know I bet the blunt
no<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.849> probably<00:03:05.300> you're<00:03:05.510> screwing<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:05.989> up<00:03:20.110> the

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.809 

good<00:03:36.049> thing<00:03:36.230> about<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.590> around<00:03:36.739> three<00:03:37.220> all

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
good thing about it around three all

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.539 
good thing about it around three all
right<00:03:38.239> three<00:03:38.450> or<00:03:38.599> four<00:03:38.810> what<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.739> different<00:03:40.190> one

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
right three or four what a different one

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.990 
right three or four what a different one
is<00:03:40.700> now<00:03:40.819> this<00:03:41.000> round<00:03:41.239> four<00:03:41.450> round<00:03:41.480> four<00:03:43.000> right

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
is now this round four round four right

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.559 
is now this round four round four right
