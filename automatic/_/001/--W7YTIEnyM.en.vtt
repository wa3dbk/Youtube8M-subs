 they come from several places in Spain and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 trying a little to encourage this new 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.270
 discipline of action sports that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.579
 It's the freestyle scooter 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.770
 we have recently appeared in the 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.420
 last two or three years is a 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.630
 discipline that comes a little bit from the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.399
 world of skateboarding and also bmx and it comes out 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.679
 with the special scooters we have 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.390
 here the kids and that the truth that 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.850
 every time they are more complicated every time 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.920
 stronger to withstand the tricks that 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.549
 I 'm sure you 're already seeing what they do 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.549
 our months 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.990
 where 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.730
 when you've been practicing this for two years 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.730
 and you like it is exciting 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.300
 compared to the skateboard skateboarding 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.890
 It was 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.890
 in the skate is more 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.960
 lights 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.770
 first I like skateboarding more or this 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.210
 why then because I with this you 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.570
 you can make mortals with the script more 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.570
 hard 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.180
 this boy who does some pirouettes 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.550
 incredible that he has done the somersault 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.960
 and then you will see what you will have seen 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.440
 because it is engraved 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.200
 it is difficult to perform these pirouettes 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.569
 very difficult 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.140
 how many hours trained per day 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.140
 weekends 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.370
 now 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.170
 ah 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.840
 sometimes 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.100
 except 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.100
 repeaters in containment
