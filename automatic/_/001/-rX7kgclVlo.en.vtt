 a recipe that he makes every year in 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.180
 Christmas has since we know each other

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.600
 who arrive at our house at Christmas 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.260
 uncles cousins ​​always ask about the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.479
 sweet potatoes of which neither then 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.000
 make this recipe because it 's typical of 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.000
 textile and what we need is 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:20.250
 we need sweet potatoes and we're going to boil them 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.540
 in water obviously this pot I do not know if 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.290
 It's big enough for everyone 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.290
 sweet potato 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.870
 our water has been a long time 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.560
 good what we're not going to be a fret 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.220
 to bake butter sugar 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.920
 mascabado or brown sugar and we are going to 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.230
 need miniature marshmallows from the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.850
 white we have back miniature you can 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.400
 buy from the big ones of sip and carlos 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.780
 but they look nicer with miniatures and 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.080
 good the sweet potatoes there are going to be 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.390
 boiling for about 15-20 minutes until 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.900
 that are fully cooked and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.900
 soft 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.950
 or what's here are our sweet potatoes 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.080
 larger are still boiling the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.090
 smaller and they smell super rich the 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.399
 boiling water returning to sweet potatoes 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.320
 smaller ones are already ready and we're going 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.030
 to peel here we're going to bet on the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.610
 process of these but obviously all 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.960
 they peel the same as they are all ready 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.060
 and last about 20 minutes 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.070
 You can peel them with your hands 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.510
 fingers that simple but so you do not 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.450
 burn because they are often 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.740
 hot we can start to peel them 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.540
 well but sometimes my husband and I 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.360
 we sit together at the table we start 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.980
 to peel with the hand and skin of sweet potato 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.980
 It's super good snack for the puppies 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.820
 It's very hot but it's super good 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.460
 snack for the puppies in fact a lot 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.110
 dog food is made from 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.180
 sweet potato then it's full of fiber and 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.100
 believe me my little dog rory oops the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.040
 evidence of what we are doing 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.950
 while we are having dinner 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.959
 and believe in my part he loves it then 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.359
 that's how we're going to peel them 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.400
 we peel them after knowing them because 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:09.390
 they will be much easier 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.540
 I like how we had our little things 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.470
 rare 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.590
 and I heard sweet potato 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.110
 today 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.110
 I do not know how he eats but it's good 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.780
 but it's hot 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.470
 my love 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.470
 loiu 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.480
 debuts 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.570
 and good here are our fears 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:46.550
 cooked and we're going to start 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:49.540
 slice and I have here but I do not have 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.540
 we simply give it away 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.770
 slices of coming as medium 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.700
 millimeter more or less 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.680
 and see how easy it is sliced ​​and we're going to 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.380
 arm as if it were a lasagna let's go 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.710
 to make layers 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.470
 let's make layers of sweet potato 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.180
 basically like it's a lasagna and 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.740
 here was our first layer of 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.960
 sweet potato does not have to be completely 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.959
 covered and now what we 're going to do is 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.160
 put all our menjurjes so that 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.840
 be super delicious 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.580
 and well let's start by applying 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.460
 butter is a little the mind that 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.460
 melted on the sweet potatoes 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.460
 let's make sure everyone is left 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.460
 cutlery 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:40.320
 this male of 80 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.729
 and so it also helps that they do not stick 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.860
 at the bottom 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.849
 Now let's put a lot of sugar 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.240
 masked 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.339
 this is normal muscovado sugar but 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.939
 in others on other occasions we have 

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:57.990
 used the splenda the imitation of 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:00.600
 Brown sugar 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.000
 and now what we are is to put chocolates 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.910
 or marshmallows 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.680
 and now we continue with layer number 2 and 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.290
 we are already in our last layer 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.020
 we do the same 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.020
 we apply butter 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.830
 it's not very healthy but once to 

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:24.870
 year does not hurt 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.870
 and more sugar 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.990
 and now we apply the last layer of 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.530
 chocolates at the end the last layer is going to 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.020
 be super super saturated with chocolates or 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.940
 marshmallows as you call them to 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.410
 that the top layer is white and its 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.120
 gummies are gratina nor do they want 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.310
 damn 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.160
 and here we have already done this, we are going to 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:55.400
 cover with plastic and let's see near 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.400
 tomorrow at 350 degrees I will show you 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:00.980
 when it is ready 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.400
 conveniently these contents that 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.410
 we named 'premier' they bring plug then 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.180
 let's refrigerate all night is not 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.430
 necessary now we can do it 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.930
 put in the oven when cooking it but as 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.510
 let's eat this morning we're 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.990
 preparing everything in advance we are going to 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.990
 refrigerate 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.580
 so that tomorrow we can savor it 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.440
 and here are our sweet potatoes 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.510
 of the oven we leave perfectly 20 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.150
 minutes to warm up and to the 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.480
 final we put the furnace mess so that 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.480
 it will stay like that marito 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.480
 same
