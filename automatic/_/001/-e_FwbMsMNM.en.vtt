really<00:02:54.280> be<00:02:54.400> enough<00:02:54.730> for<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.030> like<00:02:55.360> cuz<00:02:56.140> its

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
really be enough for this like cuz its

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.020 
really be enough for this like cuz its
kind<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.620> thick<00:02:56.830> around<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.220> tails<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.819> like

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
kind of thick around the tails and like

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.180 
kind of thick around the tails and like
when<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.480> gets<00:02:58.660> here<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:58.989> gets<00:02:59.319> thicker<00:02:59.650> when

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
when it gets here it gets thicker when

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.920 
when it gets here it gets thicker when
he<00:03:00.280> gets<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.640> thin<00:03:00.850> its<00:03:01.030> middle<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.720> when<00:03:01.900> I

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
he gets the thin its middle and when I

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.030 
he gets the thin its middle and when I
guess<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.260> middle<00:03:02.530> gets<00:03:02.739> then<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:05.110> got<00:03:05.890> it

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
guess the middle gets then and I got it
