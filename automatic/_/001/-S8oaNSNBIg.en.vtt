pellets of dry ice and a pop-out which

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.460 
pellets of dry ice and a pop-out which
we<00:01:22.250> had<00:01:22.340> water<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.910> which<00:01:23.180> has<00:01:23.390> carbon<00:01:24.080> dioxide

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
we had water to which has carbon dioxide

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.980 
we had water to which has carbon dioxide
we<00:01:24.560> formed<00:01:25.000> what's<00:01:26.000> then<00:01:26.180> how<00:01:26.780> does<00:01:26.840> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
we formed what's then how does the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.630 
we formed what's then how does the
massive<00:01:27.380> explosion<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.250> would<00:01:28.430> be<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
massive explosion and this would be the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.250 
massive explosion and this would be the
African<00:01:28.970> front<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.300> that<00:01:29.450> massive<00:01:29.810> explosion

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260

you

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.360 

here<00:04:08.110> holding<00:04:08.830> up<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.040> shell

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
here holding up a shell

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.920 
here holding up a shell
we<00:04:10.640> put<00:04:10.849> a<00:04:10.880> little<00:04:11.000> mixture<00:04:11.300> of<00:04:11.390> powder<00:04:11.630> into

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
we put a little mixture of powder into

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.710 
we put a little mixture of powder into
this<00:04:12.050> one<00:04:12.400> goes<00:04:13.400> awful<00:04:13.849> faster

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.960 

powder<00:04:21.380> into<00:04:21.620> this<00:04:21.799> one<00:04:22.010> powder<00:04:22.550> into<00:04:22.790> this

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
powder into this one powder into this

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.390 
powder into this one powder into this
one<00:04:23.180> powder<00:04:23.720> into<00:04:23.960> this<00:04:24.140> one<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:25.070> goes<00:04:25.160> off

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
one powder into this one it goes off

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.290 
one powder into this one it goes off
faster

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
faster

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:45.409 
faster
it<00:04:26.660> goes<00:04:26.780> off<00:04:27.020> faster<00:04:27.680> it<00:04:28.280> goes<00:04:28.370> off<00:04:28.610> faster

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:05:14.010 

yeah<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:47.289> then<00:04:47.439> we<00:04:47.529> can<00:04:47.679> actually
