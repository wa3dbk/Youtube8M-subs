00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.200
 long time already gave the wish that 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.730
 We also test out other cameras 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.560
 recognize nikon sony times for always 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.210
 so have pentax and very hot candidate 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.250
 we'll do that with the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.700
 pentax k 3 the new top model if you 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.160
 so will 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.470
 scarcely 1300 euro paid for it with the 18 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.980
 55mm kit lens so I say left 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.050
 just start fresh a big one 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.850
 Special feature recognizes the k3 that is 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.680
 a movable sensor to use it 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.390
 like sony, for example 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.460
 image stabilizer to realize 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.140
 that does not mean objectively but the one 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.610
 However, camera included also 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 some nice other addition to the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.370
 For example, you can put the sensor in 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.170
 to tilt all axes a bit 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.730
 can be achieved with the same effect 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.200
 like with a tilt shift lens that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.730
 is called for architectural recordings and so 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.649
 the sharpness level a bit too 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.850
 move in the axes other nice 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.559
 thing for example when the stars 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.690
 want to take pictures you can the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.700
 maybe from 10 to 15 seconds depending on 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.110
 calorific values of annas the star one such 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.059
 to become stiff simply because of 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.500
 the starry sky passes by 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.120
 Sensor in combination with a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 compensate installed gps 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 automatically and we know exactly that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.430
 sensor has to lead that too 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.690
 really points stay very cool 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.700
 things I find someone integrated 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.020
 had to have it later and 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.530
 accordingly, continue directly 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.570
 with the subject image quality not only with 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.189
 Sony there are some similarities main 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.380
 One also has to decide on nikon 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.259
 have to copy something under it a 24 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.880
 megapixel sensor without low pass filter that 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.140
 means one tastes at very very fine 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.390
 details a bit more 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 drawing in, however, that 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.360
 problem which always without low pass filter it 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.130
 can happen if you just this 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.540
 Fine structure has that are very easy 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.880
 texture film a so-called mori 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.439
 occurs which one steers against here 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.570
 the pentax k 3 you have the possibility 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.159
 minimally created the image sensor 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.140
 so move a half pixel a pixel 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.400
 during the recording and thus a whole 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.110
 very mild blurring 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.450
 you can adjust in two stages the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.250
 strength of this additional artificial 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.869
 blur are quite the idea we are looking at 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.119
 the same time, for example, still pictures 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.890
 otherwise the picture quality really very good 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.049
 noise behavior tiptop have to say 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.790
 These values ​​you can until 51.200 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.799
 So put up for the night one 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.960
 Of course, potential does not come 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.380
 the noise behavior of formats 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.210
 ran 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.940
 rough but on the level of for example 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.630
 a nikon d7000 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.729
 100 on the topic of service does not exist 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.410
 Too much special to say is clear 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.120
 not dslr camera from an arrangement 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.920
 of buttons compare to Canon Nikon 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.420
 and a bit of the mix from it 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.830
 for example with the switch photo 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.230
 video mode start stop button 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.670
 video recordings and and and what is striking 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.590
 you have a different keys 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.420
 for video mode start stop and live view 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.010
 start stop that can be so far 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.900
 not because usually you just combine that 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.420
 both in live photo mode 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.160
 video mode start stop button small 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.260
 There is speciality here already 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.330
 the top with mode dial one has 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.390
 a few more I say half manual 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.980
 modes one of them sv can do 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.420
 you give the iso value to the camera 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.450
 make the other things automatically 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.480
 one and tv in the mode you can 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.230
 as it were, aperture and exposure time 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.150
 pretend and the camera steps 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.910
 iso-value automatically is available at 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.440
 canon nikon so seen there too 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.960
 her in manual mode, so to speak 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.880
 go in and iso automatic set that 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.190
 corresponds approximately to the mode here otherwise 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.900
 relatively little creative please what also 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.070
 again quite normal for a camera 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.840
 in the upscale price range 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.280
 because then it is assumed that you as 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.270
 customer probably more in photoshop 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.820
 or similar things reworked 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.320
 movie that came the pentax k 3 also in full 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.320
 hd resolution like that for the year 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.820
 In 2013 there is something else to say 25 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.360
 or 30 frames per second 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.380
 respectively 50 right 60 fields so 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.160
 also identical to the nikon d7000 100 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.830
 qualitatively, there is not really much 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.019
 Therefore, sharply avoid sharp images 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.920
 full hd what a bit 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.269
 too bad that you have mine 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.380
 headphone output we do not have it 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.070
 but then get it for live 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.630
 monitoring 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.920
 that means you can during the recording 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.970
 not about it and how the level 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.260
 but only if you control 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.890
 after that on play you press that still 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.239
 take a look 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.560
 a bit silly when you have it I 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.630
 I hope that you can update for companies 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.650
 somehow still neighbor of pentax would be 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.600
 too bad 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.800
 Unfortunately, autofocus is also available 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.269
 not really so no 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.769
 continuous sun must be triggered 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.840
 always half press on it again 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.130
 starts to focus and that too is 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.500
 at least with the kit used 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.540
 objectively quite a torturous he comes 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.560
 very nice and sometimes film then focus 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.480
 sometimes not 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.980
 that means in video mode can 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.200
 speak who cooperate but on everyone 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.030
 case with manual focus and no 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.890
 online audio monitoring but only if 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.270
 it looks again so you have one 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.650
 give away a bit of potential at the 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:23.360
 pentax k 3 there in the price range 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.400
 Of course , with over 1000 euros already 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.740
 cameras again canon eos 7d or nikon 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.880
 p7100 tried very important topic 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.440
 series picture for example for 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.780
 sports and you can already quite 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.700
 beautiful 8 pictures per second just over 20 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.650
 then the camera is needed 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.660
 but for a relatively long time to save 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.860
 and the time trouble just completely 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.840
 Skill around you a little bit about 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.669
 to achieve the topic of autofocus 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.560
 Of course you have to 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.180
 say with the kit lens not quite like that 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.250
 to do well because that only micro motor 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.100
 in it accordingly the whole relative 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.910
 loud and not really fix 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.890
 I think if you 're right 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.300
 randstad will be there 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.129
 not a great problem-be 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.379
 not really 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.239
 August is to be judged 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:08.580
 as already shown in unboxing 

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:10.619
 two memory cards if you want here 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.039
 for example, once with alexa 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:12.509
 in it 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.979
 you can in different modes that 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.110
 whole make for example said pelé 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.569
 memory card 14 pictures memory card 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.919
 jetpack pictures or both 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.719
 same save as it were 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.580
 backup solution integrated a whole 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.469
 paranoid time or he says ok 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.209
 memory card 1 if that is full then 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.189
 keep going on the two and and have 

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:31.050
 So quite a lot of possibilities that 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.279
 Set here to use video mode 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.959
 Can you also say that you have to 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.179
 example said pelé menu 1 for 

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:38.069
 photo domann doubt video so you have 

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:39.419
 pretty much all the modes you integrate 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.580
 can imagine 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.499
 a theme are role models you can 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.569
 once the pentax own raw data from 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:47.879
 However, market is currently taking 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.009
 not really many walk 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:51.119
 Fortunately, words have supported 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.249
 one with the pentax k 3 also the 

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:54.240
 possibility to save as bmg and that 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:56.610
 Of course, that's pretty much how it works 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.409
 everyone is currently rocking that with it 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.649
 also have been to the topic and 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.999
 now to the conclusion 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:05.219
 pentax has a lot with the k 3 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.749
 interesting dslr camera created the 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.399
 do not need to hide too 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:10.769
 not against the current top models in the 

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:12.839
 aps c area of ​​canon or nikon da 

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:14.339
 one can definitely keep up with the 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.839
 for example the movable sensor you see 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:17.579
 you can use it for a lot of things 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:19.469
 you have a lot of cool things to do 

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:21.089
 also implemented in the camera something 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.979
 that's a pity, for example 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:25.289
 the video mode does not look that right 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.369
 the pot comes one has indeed full hd but 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.289
 for example a continuous one 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:29.999
 autofocus in video mode the fourth 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.740
 online monitoring works despite 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:33.269
