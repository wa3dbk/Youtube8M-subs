00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 yes, notebook is a fine thing 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.940
 you can join everything until you surf 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.390
 bit of video editing bit 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.599
 to care 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.030
 the choir's wife comes there then 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 often the problem screen too small 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.650
 So you want to watch TV 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.960
 transfer the picture and then the sound on 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.439
 best has run over the 5.1 plant 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.890
 to let 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.210
 Often this is so hdmi cable purely television 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.830
 running running but ton in only two channels 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.429
 why that is and how to do it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.099
 can 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.750
 this is nice in this video 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.750
 you were shocked I was 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.720
 so dvd or blu-ray insert 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.110
 HDMI connection or output of the laptop 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.660
 use and other side of the hdmi cable 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.430
 Simply connect to the TV 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.579
 and since the television was so god thanks 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.589
 make a digital audio output 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.270
 that many also so hdmi cable 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.940
 connected and via the digital 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.610
 output here as a light guide body 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.259
 should run the whole then to the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.710
 directed to corresponding amplifier 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.310
 become 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.690
 Now what does the computer say about that? 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.570
 Let's have a look at the open desktop 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.149
 more precisely so now we have the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.000
 hdmi cable connected to the tv 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.310
 I had to restart the laptop 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.479
 by means of laptop that as well whole 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.560
 output for the audio content we recognize 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.600
 are here now we go 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.970
 right click and let's click here 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.500
 you on replay devices and here 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.649
 the computer recognizes that it is a toshiba 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.869
 tv is that shows but every time 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.899
 So let's not be fooled by that 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.880
 member in just times on it and 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.259
 format supported here we already have 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.530
 there we look , why are we ? 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.840
 and that we are not here 5.1 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.090
 can issue a signal or several 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.920
 channel is just because of that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.300
 a maximum of two channels are supported 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.569
 coded formats like digital are yes 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.280
 also dolby digital 2 channel but more is 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.310
 not in there with the tv support 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.440
 not first with the audio return channel 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.020
 it will have connected here 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.090
 not in here we close the whole 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.090
 a hdmi cable reinforce one 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.230
 so now I just have that 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.980
 laptop now a hdmi cable 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.590
 affiliated 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.250
 at an arbitrary one of the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.250
 amplifier I go in my 6 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.620
 or something similar 96 is the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.720
 Playstation on five is like that every time 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.460
 if I change this I have to do that 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.570
 Restart laptop 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.060
 So that is dvd hdmi interject 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.220
 connection is not new picture 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.930
 not everyone has transmitted sound 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.020
 only restart if the hdmi cable 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.610
 already in there so now we look 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.470
 the whole thing again on the desktop 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.270
 what you have now you always have 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.600
 two more channels are available or if there is one 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.890
 stand up a few more and look now 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.620
 what can you do here is always 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.420
 still toshiba device shows why that 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.190
 I do not know but we are displayed 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.230
 definitely have the amplifier now 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.760
 connected to it so would have there 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.270
 actually yamaha but something like that 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.920
 stand 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.780
 so and now we look supported 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.790
 formats and the screen 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.140
 There will be eight channels here 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.480
 I support that , I suppose that's it too 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.430
 maximum what the soundcard here in 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.769
 this case installed in an asus laptop 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.090
 is giving it when you can do it all 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.980
 light loud cable makes there is even 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.540
 mostly only 5.1 supported and then 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.330
 is there too but we have now 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.900
 there are eight channels here and we can 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.360
 now here 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.570
 Okay, we can just go here now 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.570
 once the speakers configure 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.000
 because we can already see what we want 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.320
 We can now choose here what we 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.900
 We want to have it from the source 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.790
 if he have 5.1 surround source then 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.260
 it is impossible to 7.1 on the whole 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.940
 stretch we have then the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.959
 possibilities also here the us 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.519
 We choose the ones we have 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.790
 loudspeakers arranged there are people 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.890
 to the speakers on the side 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.359
 struck or behind the couch 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.460
 struck or hung 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.370
 we can test this one here 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.900
 can times test the subwoofer 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.900
 make their amplifiers a bit louder 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.410
 so the center is running too 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:47.419
 speakers here too and that runs 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.080
 that's what it was 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.630
 actually already 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.990
 yes so you see the whole right on 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.720
 Connecting a TV is sometimes not 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.639
 so smart because the tv is yes 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.560
 often just as stupid as the computer too 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.020
 it is then at the television the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.979
 he only supports two channels and that 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.690
 do not move on 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.850
 you would then maybe into the 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.650
 watch the tv's guide because 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.360
 Often there is a hdmi 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.710
 entrance of the then also the five channels 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.530
 supported or resp 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.910
 where they are ground with 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.260
 if that is not the case then you have to 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.979
 whole stop right on the amplifier 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.960
 connect 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.320
 that is actually a better one 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.940
 But the idea becomes a problem then that is 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.440
 the problem many of you this 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.599
 have problem have no hdmi 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.250
 input of the amplifier are so to speak 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.470
 about the method with the tv 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.389
 actually instructed with the light loud 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.010
 cable yes if that does not work 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.970
 then you could get one 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.800
 maybe think twice 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.430
 another music card sound card too 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.520
 use 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.770
 a usb sound card for example offers 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.380
 Remember where you get the signal directly 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.750
 to the amplifier can guide and the picture 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.169
 just send it to the TV separately 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.000
 can 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.520
 or you close the tv 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.800
 this cable or this 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.300
 connection to yes good vga connection 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.940
 is in projector playback so 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.550
 many projectors are so served with 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.720
 picture and is also a common method 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.419
 then you can see the picture and the sound 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.520
 directly separate process so picture 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.699
 from television sound to the amplifier and 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.870
 then the whole thing has to be yes 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.330
 We'll be finished, I hope 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.500
 this problem or this 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.660
 video has now with you at this 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.250
 helped a little bit if still 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.440
 I should ask further questions 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.150
 because happy to be especially if 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.099
 now a report also needs one 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.650
 sound card then I stand there quite
