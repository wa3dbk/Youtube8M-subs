00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.959
 hello and welcome I am 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.580
 though again jackson from android tv with 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.560
 another tips and tricks video 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.610
 Today again for the Samsung Galaxy 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 note 2 in particular is one today 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.110
 function of the so-called s pen 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.199
 is supported and in connection 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.489
 with the s not earlier it was probably called smo 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.890
 Now it is said that it will be necessary 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.629
 galaxy note 1 or is there, I believe 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.219
 even for the galaxy note 1 the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.409
 function which I stop there but show 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.999
 there are only for galaxy only two times 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.690
 look like it after the 4 point 1.2 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:51.449
 update is until now only available for 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.760
 this device and indeed a function the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.859
 I find it very helpful 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.649
 because what always bothered me when 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.649
 galaxy note one is when i am now 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.229
 Here's a little note more 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.579
 somehow come up with your finger today 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.009
 which is really just a natural one 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.920
 attitude is then it writes the 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.969
 Of course, soon with the principle 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.469
 it also on finger inputs 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.289
 program the whole smartphone now 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.000
 But there is a function here you see 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.320
 this little kids downstairs 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 but now with the pen over it 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.649
 stop and show it to me 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.380
 already at only sp we press now 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.820
 and now you see that the hand 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.909
 crossed out and that means so 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.009
 a lot like that I can not go with it now 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.140
 the finger can make an input on 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.549
 this note and I think so 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.460
 awesome that means I can now here 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.820
 super nice hang up and makes the pen 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.870
 still my input so yes that 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.600
 is a meaningful one 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.230
 Extension that means so 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.700
 only the pen responds resp 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.210
 the display only reacts to the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.560
 pen input and not on my fingers 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.060
 that means I need it 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.060
 do not worry about it 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.020
 You see, I'm super awesome 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.480
 multitouchfÃ¤hig talk and talk 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.010
 writing does not work at all 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.310
 is that fun too bad now 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.320
 good but the principle you have understood 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.540
 I can not do it with my finger anymore 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.010
 enter but only with the pen 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.710
 Enter that was great too 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.600
 small simple function but real 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.000
 practical and can be the one or 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.350
 others certainly also help and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.940
 will also enjoy one or the other 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.530
 because that is already the problem there 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.330
 should one come up with the finger as 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.590
 that's it, we'll see each other 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.810
 soon with another tip and 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.810
