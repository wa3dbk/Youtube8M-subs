00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 as you can see playing a species 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.170
 background samba it 's a very 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.120
 cool in this character is not the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.980
 update in quote if you put in the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.350
 brazilian scenario he will not be with 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.420
 this song is when you use hotel 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.699
 here is playing this samba a lot 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.890
 I'm not a fan and I'm not a fan. 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.500
 of samba but this one was very cool 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.090
 same guy is a little song and it's short 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.159
 and keeps repeating a lot but has a 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.020
 very cool pace the developers of 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.810
 have hit the mark in putting this 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.400
 music to represent brazil 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.369
 You can sell it here for funds. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.110
 appear in the favela will have some 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.580
 brazilian flags and night author 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.280
 here in the game because once again I am 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.750
 recording the nightly video with the scenery 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.400
 night of the game I 'm not recording the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.619
 video at night which is the time 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.619
 I usually record the videos for you. 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.780
 this character was very caring think 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.970
 was almost 100 thousand that I paid for it in 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.140
 and I had to buy this 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.390
 character if I'm not mistaken for 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.689
 be able to unlock the river scene from 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.979
 January 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.720
 I ended up losing more beauty here. 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.640
 For another gameplay I did little to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.320
 score here I'm still not 100% 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.969
 accustomed to this character but he 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.040
 has a very good ability that I will 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.020
 show now for you to explain right? 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.270
 in this game play then this golden ball 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.520
 My character is circling me. 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.920
 protects against missiles but does not protect 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.569
 100% because it depends sometimes you are 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.690
 walking with the character and that ball 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.730
 it's spinning, I do not know 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.770
 on the back of it is down in 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.390
 up and is not in front so it will not 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.100
 to protect against a missile 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.840
 but you will fall on top of the missile you 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.730
 You have to be lucky and she 's going through 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.810
 underneath him at that very moment 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.580
 helps a lot 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.830
 say you have a percentage of 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.020
 chance of being saved by this and a 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.910
 missile do not hit you so it's very good 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.750
 this character helps a lot 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.760
 you 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.560
 in those moments that come a lot of mass 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.120
 in this direction, including hours in the 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.660
 game you are playing the final and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.310
 face comes many even there dozens that 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.660
 You have to get sidetracked then this 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.030
 character in some moments help 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.200
 It 's really cool outside. 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.640
 character that with this background samba 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.470
 almost picking up a super skateboard looks lonely 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.210
 I just did not talk to them, they'll be able to 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.560
 meet one of the super skateboards here at 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.350
 Brazil these balls for a ball to 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.510
 goal was just you will see in the end looks 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.980
 it's just like it's a goal right there 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.410
 direction that the soccer ball is 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.420
 doing in super skateboard has another one 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.850
 different, if I show you yet 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.980
 This video for you is very 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.540
 funny scala inscribed guys have 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.459
 played too much it's a lot of fun 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.130
 even this game if you have not got it yet 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.600
 he take it is very good even has 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.110
 Too much content, too much cool stuff to 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:31.209
 Exploring looks only are bali 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:36.459
 eita almost hits the drone more beauty 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:38.020
 to survive but I want to leave the 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.120
 field and comments if you have purchased the 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.620
 hotel you are already in the phase of Brazil 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.630
 has already passed through this phase that you found 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.130
 she shares this opinion of the field 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.840
 the comments to enjoy let me 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.459
 I liked the video, it's very important. 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.950
 to see if they want more videos 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.150
 downloaded onto the channel that is 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.250
 subscribe to the channel if you are not 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.660
 subscribed although it is possible to share 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.459
 this video here on your facebook that your 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.140
 friends also checked thank you too 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.130
 much who shares the videos on 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.989
 Facebook 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.620
 if you noticed I've been saved some 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.920
 times here for their golden ball 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.690
 circulating it before that part that is 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.220
 nothing to do with this here as it will be 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.340
 vacancy for your eiffel tower now 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.810
 some a giant wheel and super skateboard 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.100
 seems to be a game standard because I 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.100
 I've seen it in all the updates 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.090
 I ended up falling more beautiful and good to see 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.610
 the margin fell on that he falls on a sofa in the 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.620
 kind of trash in the middle of the street 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.419
 bizarre even then there where this 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.340
 character falls but is not the only country to 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.260
 only city I've seen so far that the 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.669
 character falls into the trash do not think this 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.290
 It's a prejudice with Brazil thing. 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.790
 so they have already done so with 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.100
 other cities are also always local 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.050
 very strange that we end up falling on the 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.880
 previous video we decided that I made it to 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.479
 You guys were the update of Cairo 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.380
 fell on a pile of sand in a building 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:57.290
 las vegas it was falling in the casinos, right? 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.090
 in Paris or think it's bigger than the paris 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.889
 he would also be in the trash then it is 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.300
 normal they make this situation and with 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.770
 several countries with multiple cities not 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.180
 forget to follow the twitter is great 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.380

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.460
 always exchange an idea with the galley 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.139

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.060
 also follow twitter instagram 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.060

 Look at that puppet of attacks. 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.229
 Giant bizarre nÃ© 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.610
 something else that I do not lose here in the 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.860
 game that every day people have entered 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.300
 and have taken that bonus there 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.669
 that I can watch a video and 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.169
 earn two new lines in it every day 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.389
 I enter the game but it's because I 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.200
 every day of the game he has been one of the 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.490
 Most played games on iphone 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.080

 English will not write in Portuguese anymore. 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.330
 although the game is on time I remembered the 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.710
 It 's so Portuguese they should 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.250
 have put in Portuguese then that 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.450
