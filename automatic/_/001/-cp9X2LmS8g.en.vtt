00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
see the robots which they're actually

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350 
see the robots which they're actually
advertising<00:01:19.409> later<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> clip<00:01:20.909> all

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
advertising later on in the clip all

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
advertising later on in the clip all
lined<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.200> over<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:23.310> believe<00:01:23.369> thats<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
lined up over I believe thats like a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.499 
lined up over I believe thats like a
mountain<00:01:24.740> armed<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.770> battle<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.360> an

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
mountain armed for battle now that is an

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.969 
mountain armed for battle now that is an
interesting<00:01:27.810> part<00:01:28.259> obviously<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.740> could<00:01:28.890> be

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
interesting part obviously this could be

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.830 
interesting part obviously this could be
due<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.640> probably<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.180> plants

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
due this is probably to do with plants

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.319 
due this is probably to do with plants
vs.<00:01:31.079> zombies<00:01:31.320> -<00:01:31.530> I'm<00:01:31.770> guessing<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.119> fact

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
vs. zombies - I'm guessing but the fact

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.149 
vs. zombies - I'm guessing but the fact
that<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.509> found<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.990> hidden<00:01:34.590> within<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
that I found this hidden within the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.830 
that I found this hidden within the
video<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> lot<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> people<00:01:36.090> I'd<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
video now a lot of people I'd out of

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.230 
video now a lot of people I'd out of
stainless<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.590> did<00:01:37.770> stress<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.729> enough<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
stainless and I did stress this enough I

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.580 
stainless and I did stress this enough I
might<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.049> first<00:01:40.259> people<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
might be one of the first people to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.639 
might be one of the first people to
mention<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.189> I'm<00:01:41.850> surely<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.110> first<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649

my<00:01:43.680> mates<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.759> I'm<00:01:44.939> guessing

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
my mates to know about this I'm guessing

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.270 
my mates to know about this I'm guessing
but<00:01:46.079> there<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:46.710> guys<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.250> can

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.170 
see on screen there is a picture of all
of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.500> robots<00:01:49.860> lined<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.430> which<00:01:50.820> they<00:01:50.970> later

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
of the robots lined up which they later

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.990 
of the robots lined up which they later
advertised<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.140> protect<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.490> long<00:01:53.729> and

advertised to protect your long and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.609 
advertised to protect your long and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
obviously everyone has bolt them so I'm

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.889 
obviously everyone has bolt them so I'm
guessing<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.700> doctor<00:01:57.149> zomboss<00:01:57.509> command

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
guessing on the doctor zomboss command

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.959 
guessing on the doctor zomboss command
all<00:01:58.409> these<00:01:58.710> robots<00:01:59.159> go<00:01:59.340> marching<00:01:59.640> into<00:01:59.850> battle

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
all these robots go marching into battle

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.730 
all these robots go marching into battle
for<00:02:00.719> him<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.020> obviously<00:02:01.259> they're<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.560> there

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
for him and obviously they're not there
