called<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> aortic<00:00:35.370> valve<00:00:35.780> it<00:00:36.780> seemed<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
called the aortic valve it seemed like a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.069 
called the aortic valve it seemed like a
very<00:00:37.410> simple<00:00:38.070> procedure<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:39.210> me<00:00:39.390> I'm<00:00:39.570> sure

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
very simple procedure to me I'm sure

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.139 
very simple procedure to me I'm sure
it's<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:41.100> get<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.489> thing<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it's not to get that thing up in the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.680 
it's not to get that thing up in the
right<00:00:42.329> spot<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:42.899> there<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> real<00:00:44.280> trick<00:00:44.820> but

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
right spot up there is a real trick but

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.130 
right spot up there is a real trick but
they've<00:00:46.410> learned<00:00:46.680> how<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.870> it's

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
they've learned how to do it and it's

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.900 
they've learned how to do it and it's
amazing<00:00:51.829> what<00:00:52.829> we're<00:00:53.010> approved<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.730> at

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
amazing what we're approved to do at

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.119 
amazing what we're approved to do at
this<00:00:54.059> point<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.199> make<00:00:55.230> an<00:00:55.559> incision<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.070> the

vessels in the pelvis up through the
aorta<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:02.309> descend<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.030> balloon<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.750> open

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
aorta and we descend a balloon to open

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.230 
aorta and we descend a balloon to open
up<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> valve<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.549> also<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
up the valve and then also with that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.899 
up the valve and then also with that
same<00:01:06.510> type<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.810> balloon<00:01:07.200> mechanism<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.430> deploy

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
same type of balloon mechanism we deploy

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.660 
same type of balloon mechanism we deploy
the<00:01:09.210> valve<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.780> place<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.530> valve<00:01:10.770> within<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the valve or place the valve within the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.810 
the valve or place the valve within the
normal<00:01:12.090> anatomic<00:01:12.240> position<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.130> great

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
normal anatomic position it's a great

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.990 
normal anatomic position it's a great
procedure<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.049> great<00:01:16.830> number<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.310> patients

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
procedure for a great number of patients

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.350 
procedure for a great number of patients
who<00:01:18.150> will<00:01:18.659> need<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.200> autograph<00:01:19.530> replacement

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
who will need a autograph replacement

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.450 
who will need a autograph replacement
but<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:22.049> candidates<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
but are not candidates for that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.899 
but are not candidates for that
procedure<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.960> increased<00:01:25.590> risk<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> fires<00:01:26.369> of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
procedure for increased risk of fires of

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.330 
procedure for increased risk of fires of
surgical<00:01:27.570> mortality<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.829> replace<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
surgical mortality we can replace the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.920 
surgical mortality we can replace the
value<00:01:29.549> without<00:01:29.759> stopping<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> heart<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
value without stopping the heart of the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.749 
value without stopping the heart of the
patient<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.560> without<00:01:31.890> cracking<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> chase

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
patient and without cracking the chase

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.719 
patient and without cracking the chase
so<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> recovery<00:01:34.110> time<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.470> faster<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.549> is

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
so the recovery time is faster this is

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.140 
so the recovery time is faster this is
the<00:01:35.880> easiest<00:01:36.210> operation<00:01:36.869> I've<00:01:37.020> ever<00:01:37.290> seen<00:01:38.150> I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the easiest operation I've ever seen I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
the easiest operation I've ever seen I
don't<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.110> when<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
don't know when it was like for the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.520 
don't know when it was like for the
doctors<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> hospital<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.229> me<00:01:43.380> it

swallow some of my words and come up

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.460 
swallow some of my words and come up
with<00:02:15.280> them<00:02:15.459> again<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.940> know<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:16.870> I'm<00:02:17.200> not

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
with them again you know but I'm not

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.770 
with them again you know but I'm not
having<00:02:17.800> too<00:02:18.190> much<00:02:18.340> trouble<00:02:18.700> right<00:02:19.060> now<00:02:19.090> as

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
having too much trouble right now as

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.210 
having too much trouble right now as
much<00:02:20.110> as<00:02:20.290> we're<00:02:20.440> excited<00:02:20.709> about<00:02:20.980> this

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
much as we're excited about this

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.580 
much as we're excited about this
particular<00:02:21.700> technology<00:02:22.569> I'm<00:02:22.810> probably<00:02:23.290> more

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
particular technology I'm probably more

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.740 
particular technology I'm probably more
excited<00:02:23.890> about<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.489> fact<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:25.060> we<00:02:25.540> have

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
excited about the fact that we have

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.470 
excited about the fact that we have
multi<00:02:26.110> disciplines<00:02:26.739> working<00:02:27.370> together<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.300> I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
multi disciplines working together and I

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.670 
multi disciplines working together and I
think<00:02:28.510> that's<00:02:28.870> going<00:02:28.989> to<00:02:29.050> open<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.440> door<00:02:29.620> to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
think that's going to open the door to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.000 
think that's going to open the door to
you<00:02:30.520> know<00:02:30.640> really<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.590> plethora<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.620> new

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
you know really a plethora of new

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.430 
you know really a plethora of new
devices<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.760> new<00:02:33.850> technologies<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:35.200> treat

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
devices and new technologies to treat

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.449 
devices and new technologies to treat
different<00:02:35.800> types<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.130> cardiovascular

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
different types of cardiovascular

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.090 
different types of cardiovascular
diseases
