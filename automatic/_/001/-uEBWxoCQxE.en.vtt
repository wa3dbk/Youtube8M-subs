00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:18.730
 hi to all and gridsure c6 naxos 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.580
 today look we find ourselves on 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.560
 battlefield 3 for a new glitch that 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.560
 will allow you to go out so 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.510
 the amap fortress of dognen alone thanks 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.130
 to glitch dumortier so what does that 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.330
 the glitch dumortier already I invite you 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.760
 to go see my previous video 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.249
 tip 27 that explains to you how 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.839
 walk this gritche but hey I go when 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:41.019
 even explained to them in this video 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.159
 so to realize already this output of 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.829
 maps you have to go to a place 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.780
 where I am currently located 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.780
 so this is the side of ama pouya the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.300
 building that is broken and you go 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.190
 having to put down your crate 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.539
 refueling so with the class 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.309
 support on a small wall a small wall on 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.559
 piece of wall that is broken so you 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.239
 place the supply crate on the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.640
 wall and then with your mortar you 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.960
 will have to make sure that the item 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.750
 it's not good if I do not know if we can 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.850
 call it the brief item your mortar 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.160
 become zone above the cashier 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.360
 so you can put it down and 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.760
 that's when he'll have to 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.930
 realize the glitch dumortier that is 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.700
 so the once you that your 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.840
 young mortar you're going to have to do 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.550
 start then round iron and r1 so you 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.110
 stay pressed on years confesses done r1 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.060
 many times and so you let go all 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.740
 the buttons right after if it works 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.390
 well you will be teleported to 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.910
 where you put your 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.110
 mortar and so you just have to 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.260
 get on the supply crate 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.700
 and do the same gritche on the roof 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.100
 and so as you see there you 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.510
 will be teleported to the roof a 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.850
 times down here you just have to 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.050
 go out in circles and so you go to bed 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.110
 directly once you're there 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.120
 you go to bed and you can continue to 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.800
 advance to the outside of the map so 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.260
 to those of men and once you are 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.290
 roughly in the dom you can you 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.019
 raise and so is the output of maps 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.440
 is done so you are in out of 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.119
 dated 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.680
 and you can do what you 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.590
 so you want a little way to do 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.970
 raving your friends I think to avoid 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.209
 do that online you know them the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.760
 glitchs it's in private for not doing 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.980
 too much trouble playing and so that's it 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.530
 I hope this little glitch out of 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.510
 maps on fortress dounia will have pleased you 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.519
 if so do not hesitate to leave 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.709
 a max of likes it will make me extremely 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.360
 pleasure to go see my channel if this 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.769
 video patients 8 each go see my 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.989
 chain I do a lot of goals on 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.470
 battlefield 3 and on far cry that 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.510
 excluded on far cry and so is that - 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.579
