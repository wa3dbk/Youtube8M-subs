they<00:01:33.240> give<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.380> kind<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
they give out and so it's just kind of

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.980 
they give out and so it's just kind of
like<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> hash<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> material<00:01:35.970> cilenti<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
like a hash and material cilenti of

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.780 
like a hash and material cilenti of
these<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.380> fabric<00:01:37.829> bags<00:01:38.070> which<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.670> buy

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
these on fabric bags which you can buy

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.370 
these on fabric bags which you can buy
canvas<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.479> everything<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.049> than

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
canvas and everything like that than

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.170 
canvas and everything like that than
they're<00:01:40.500> perfect<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.130> I've<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.460> cut<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
they're perfect and I've just cut out to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.120 
they're perfect and I've just cut out to
shape<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.530> even<00:01:44.009> or

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
shape so you don't have to be even or

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.950 
shape so you don't have to be even or
anything<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.299> kind<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
anything and this was kind of just in a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.130 
anything and this was kind of just in a
straight<00:01:46.820> little<00:01:47.820> rectangle<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
straight little rectangle like that and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.660 
straight little rectangle like that and
then<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.770> more<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> curved

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
then this one is more in a curved

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.090 
then this one is more in a curved
circular<00:01:51.149> thing<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.170> actual<00:01:52.649> shoulder

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
circular thing for the actual shoulder

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
circular thing for the actual shoulder
pad<00:01:53.340> which<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.210> sit<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.840> there's

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
pad which can sit here so there's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.690 
pad which can sit here so there's
different<00:01:55.619> shapes<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.159> everything<00:01:56.610> you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
different shapes and everything you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.100 
different shapes and everything you
don't<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> follow<00:01:57.240> these<00:01:57.570> Cesar<00:01:57.869> just

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
don't have to follow these Cesar just

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.410 
don't have to follow these Cesar just
cut<00:01:58.290> out<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.590> shape<00:01:58.680> from<00:01:59.579> your<00:01:59.820> material<00:02:00.299> so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
cut out a shape from your material so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.719 
cut out a shape from your material so
just<00:02:00.600> any<00:02:00.780> material<00:02:01.560> prefer<00:02:01.979> really<00:02:02.399> black

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
just any material prefer really black

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.160 
just any material prefer really black
unless<00:02:03.149> you've<00:02:03.360> got<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.630> same<00:02:03.780> mature<00:02:04.049> as

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
unless you've got the same mature as

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.800 
unless you've got the same mature as
your<00:02:04.380> shirt<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:04.920> black<00:02:05.159> also<00:02:05.430> works<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.090> so

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
your shirt but black also works and so

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.589 
your shirt but black also works and so
one<00:02:07.229> way<00:02:07.740> or<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.280> idea<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.330> may<00:02:09.539> be

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
one way or one idea and so this may be

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.589 
one way or one idea and so this may be
obvious<00:02:10.200> but

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
obvious but

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.120 
obvious but
it's<00:02:12.599> always<00:02:12.840> helpful<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.349> see<00:02:13.650> someone<00:02:13.980> doing

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
it's always helpful to see someone doing

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.440 
it's always helpful to see someone doing
it<00:02:14.280> because<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.640> would<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:14.819> give<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.209> more

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
it because it would just give you more

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.000 
it because it would just give you more
inspiration<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.140> how<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.319> do<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:16.860> this

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
inspiration on how to do it and so this

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.040 
inspiration on how to do it and so this
one<00:02:17.160> was<00:02:17.280> inspired<00:02:17.730> by<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.030> dress<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.599> saw<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.870> a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
one was inspired by a dress I saw in a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.809 
one was inspired by a dress I saw in a
sauce<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.160> pink<00:02:20.520> dress<00:02:20.700> with

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
sauce and it's a pink dress with

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.760 
sauce and it's a pink dress with
feathered<00:02:21.480> shoulder<00:02:21.780> pads<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:22.410> i'll<00:02:22.530> post

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
feathered shoulder pads and so i'll post

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.320 
feathered shoulder pads and so i'll post
a<00:02:22.950> link<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.610> bottom<00:02:23.819> bar<00:02:24.120> if<00:02:24.209> i

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
a link to that in the bottom bar if i

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.540 
a link to that in the bottom bar if i
can<00:02:24.510> find<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.930> again<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.680> all<00:02:25.830> I'm<00:02:26.069> going<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.370> do

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
can find it again so all I'm going to do

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.490 
can find it again so all I'm going to do
is<00:02:26.640> I'm<00:02:26.819> going<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.150> use<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.599> circular<00:02:28.080> one<00:02:28.260> and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
is I'm going to use the circular one and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.070 
is I'm going to use the circular one and
i'm<00:02:29.099> just<00:02:29.370> going<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.760> layer<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.510> feathers<00:02:30.900> in

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
i'm just going to layer the feathers in

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.100 
i'm just going to layer the feathers in
an<00:02:31.530> arrangement<00:02:32.069> which<00:02:32.970> i'll<00:02:33.180> put<00:02:33.750> down<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
an arrangement which i'll put down the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.759 
an arrangement which i'll put down the
screen<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.680> see<00:02:34.920> me<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:36.590> okay<00:02:37.590> and

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
screen so you can see me do it okay and

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.220 
screen so you can see me do it okay and
so<00:02:37.920> if<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.099> see<00:02:38.250> I've<00:02:38.340> got<00:02:38.400> some<00:02:38.760> just<00:02:39.030> some

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
so if you see I've got some just some

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.540 
so if you see I've got some just some
newspaper<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.739> make<00:02:40.860> sure<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.310> you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
newspaper just to make sure that you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.009 
newspaper just to make sure that you
don't<00:02:41.700> dirty<00:02:42.000> anything<00:02:42.480> while<00:02:42.630> doing<00:02:42.840> this

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
don't dirty anything while doing this

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.990 
don't dirty anything while doing this
and<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.769> I'm<00:02:43.830> going<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.040> start<00:02:44.160> with<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
and so I'm going to start with the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.020 
and so I'm going to start with the
longest<00:02:45.480> feathers<00:02:46.250> going<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.519> outside

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
longest feathers going on the outside

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.870 
longest feathers going on the outside
and<00:02:48.330> some<00:02:48.630> sort<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.930> use<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:50.040> layer<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.670> one

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
and some sort of use one layer so one

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.610 
and some sort of use one layer so one
color<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.390> one<00:02:51.540> layer<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.140> first<00:02:52.380> day<00:02:52.530> is

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
color for one layer so the first day is

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.949 
color for one layer so the first day is
going<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.860> be<00:02:53.040> pink<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.510> I'm<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:54.780> going

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
going to be pink and so I'm just going

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.100 
going to be pink and so I'm just going
to<00:02:55.170> lay<00:02:55.319> them<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:58.910> arrangement<00:02:59.910> like<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.690> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
to lay them in a arrangement like so and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.360 
to lay them in a arrangement like so and
I<00:03:01.260> guess<00:03:01.440> on<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.739> side<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:01.980> can<00:03:02.130> start

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
I guess on this side you can start

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.240 
I guess on this side you can start
having<00:03:02.549> them<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:03.090> way<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:07.099> so<00:03:08.099> we're<00:03:08.220> just

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
having them that way but so we're just

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:17.530 
having them that way but so we're just
going<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.640> arrange<00:03:08.940> them<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.720> different<00:03:09.930> way

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.940 

so<00:03:18.540> once<00:03:18.720> you've<00:03:18.989> looked<00:03:19.170> at<00:03:19.350> an<00:03:19.530> arrangement

go<00:05:54.010> on<00:05:54.130> to<00:05:54.250> my<00:05:54.370> second<00:05:55.110> idea<00:05:56.110> which<00:05:56.410> is<00:05:56.650> one

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
go on to my second idea which is one

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.279 
go on to my second idea which is one
inspired<00:05:57.310> by<00:05:57.610> this<00:05:57.669> one<00:05:58.090> here<00:05:58.360> because<00:05:59.139> I<00:05:59.229> know

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
inspired by this one here because I know

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.659 
inspired by this one here because I know
a<00:05:59.410> lot<00:05:59.530> of<00:05:59.590> people<00:05:59.680> probably<00:06:00.039> like<00:06:00.340> this<00:06:00.460> one

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
a lot of people probably like this one

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:01.770 
a lot of people probably like this one
as<00:06:00.820> well<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:01.150> they<00:06:01.210> might<00:06:01.389> not<00:06:01.510> really<00:06:01.690> want

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
as well and they might not really want

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.060 
as well and they might not really want
to<00:06:01.960> go<00:06:02.050> for<00:06:02.229> the<00:06:02.260> feathers<00:06:02.620> because<00:06:02.770> the

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
to go for the feathers because the

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.860 
to go for the feathers because the
feathers<00:06:03.400> can<00:06:03.669> be<00:06:03.850> a<00:06:03.880> little<00:06:04.090> out<00:06:04.300> there<00:06:04.330> and

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
feathers can be a little out there and

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.450 
feathers can be a little out there and
also<00:06:05.860> a<00:06:06.010> little<00:06:06.250> difficult<00:06:06.699> to<00:06:06.760> wash<00:06:07.060> but<00:06:08.460> now

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
also a little difficult to wash but now

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.060 
also a little difficult to wash but now
I'm<00:06:09.669> going<00:06:09.880> to<00:06:10.150> take<00:06:10.360> my<00:06:10.750> little<00:06:10.960> piece<00:06:11.860> of

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
I'm going to take my little piece of

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.590 
I'm going to take my little piece of
black<00:06:12.250> material<00:06:12.580> and<00:06:12.820> so<00:06:12.880> this<00:06:13.000> is<00:06:13.120> just<00:06:13.330> kind

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
black material and so this is just kind

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.330 
black material and so this is just kind
of<00:06:13.660> in<00:06:13.780> a<00:06:13.870> rectangle<00:06:14.470> with<00:06:14.500> some<00:06:14.770> curved<00:06:15.070> edges

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
of in a rectangle with some curved edges

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.830 
of in a rectangle with some curved edges
it<00:06:15.729> doesn't<00:06:16.000> have<00:06:16.120> to<00:06:16.210> be<00:06:16.240> too<00:06:16.510> straight

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
it doesn't have to be too straight

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.750 
it doesn't have to be too straight
because<00:06:17.590> as<00:06:17.770> you<00:06:17.919> can<00:06:18.039> see<00:06:18.190> this<00:06:18.310> one<00:06:18.490> isn't

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
because as you can see this one isn't

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.390 
because as you can see this one isn't
straight<00:06:19.330> either<00:06:19.600> so<00:06:20.139> it<00:06:20.800> should<00:06:21.070> be<00:06:21.100> able<00:06:21.280> to

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
straight either so it should be able to

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.180 
straight either so it should be able to
work<00:06:21.550> and<00:06:22.199> for<00:06:23.199> this<00:06:23.350> one<00:06:23.470> I'm<00:06:23.560> going<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:23.919> use

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
work and for this one I'm going to use

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.820 
work and for this one I'm going to use
some<00:06:24.520> gold<00:06:24.789> chain<00:06:25.090> also<00:06:26.020> some<00:06:26.500> little

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
some gold chain also some little

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.939 
some gold chain also some little
rhinestones<00:06:27.760> and<00:06:28.060> that's<00:06:28.960> it<00:06:29.199> so<00:06:29.560> to<00:06:29.620> begin

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
rhinestones and that's it so to begin

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.740 
rhinestones and that's it so to begin
with<00:06:30.160> what<00:06:30.550> I<00:06:30.580> want<00:06:30.760> to<00:06:30.849> do<00:06:31.030> is<00:06:31.240> I'm<00:06:31.539> just<00:06:31.570> going
