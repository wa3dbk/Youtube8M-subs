using<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.890> number<00:00:02.129> line<00:00:02.689> counting<00:00:03.689> on<00:00:03.870> in<00:00:04.319> one

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
using a number line counting on in one

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.960 
using a number line counting on in one
some<00:00:06.540> we're<00:00:06.690> going<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.899> look<00:00:07.049> at<00:00:07.200> today<00:00:07.379> is

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
some we're going to look at today is

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.789 
some we're going to look at today is
three<00:00:08.970> add<00:00:09.360> five<00:00:11.269> this<00:00:12.269> means<00:00:12.690> that<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.349> start

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
three add five this means that we start

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.019 
three add five this means that we start
at<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.730> member<00:00:15.240> rate<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:16.710> defined<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.580> on

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
at the member rate we defined this on

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.970 
at the member rate we defined this on
our<00:00:18.420> number<00:00:18.900> line

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.470 

next<00:00:22.980> thing<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.539> adding<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:25.849> if<00:00:26.849> we're<00:00:27.240> adding

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
next thing is adding on if we're adding

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.240 
next thing is adding on if we're adding
something<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:29.160> know<00:00:31.160> bigger<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:35.100> we

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
something on we know bigger so then we

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.470 
something on we know bigger so then we
need<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.520> start<00:00:35.760> adding<00:00:36.270> five<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:37.550> five<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
need to start adding five on five is the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:56.260 
need to start adding five on five is the
same<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:40.020> adding<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.920> five<00:00:41.550> times<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:43.050> add<00:00:43.320> one

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.390 

okay<00:00:56.930> let's<00:00:57.410> just<00:00:57.620> check<00:00:57.800> we've<00:00:57.980> got<00:00:58.190> that

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
okay let's just check we've got that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.760 
okay let's just check we've got that
right<00:00:58.580> then<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.360> we'll<00:00:59.510> have<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.690> look<00:01:05.770> we're

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
right then so we'll have a look we're

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.180 
right then so we'll have a look we're
adding<00:01:07.250> on<00:01:07.520> five<00:01:08.470> now<00:01:09.470> we<00:01:09.530> just<00:01:09.740> have<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:09.950> look

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
adding on five now we just have a look

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.420 
adding on five now we just have a look
where<00:01:10.820> did<00:01:11.030> we<00:01:11.150> end<00:01:11.330> up<00:01:11.570> we've<00:01:12.200> ended<00:01:12.680> up<00:01:12.890> at

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
where did we end up we've ended up at

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.810 
where did we end up we've ended up at
the<00:01:13.670> number<00:01:14.210> eight<00:01:14.470> so<00:01:15.470> this<00:01:15.830> will<00:01:16.430> be<00:01:16.670> our

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
the number eight so this will be our

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.650 
the number eight so this will be our
answer

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
answer

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.580 
answer
three<00:01:18.320> add<00:01:18.620> 5<00:01:19.570> equals<00:01:20.570> 8

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
three add 5 equals 8

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.100 
three add 5 equals 8
let's<00:01:22.520> have<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.760> go<00:01:23.180> at<00:01:23.390> another<00:01:23.869> example

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
let's have a go at another example

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.890 
let's have a go at another example
together<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.550> this<00:01:25.760> time<00:01:26.119> I'm<00:01:26.390> working<00:01:26.600> out

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
together so this time I'm working out

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.540 
together so this time I'm working out
the<00:01:27.080> answer<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:28.310> one<00:01:28.790> add<00:01:29.119> four<00:01:29.830> I'm<00:01:30.830> starting

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
the answer to one add four I'm starting

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.800 
the answer to one add four I'm starting
at<00:01:31.670> one<00:01:31.970> find<00:01:32.780> one<00:01:33.290> on<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:34.160> number<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:34.970> know

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
at one find one on the number I know

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.330 
at one find one on the number I know
that<00:01:36.770> I'm<00:01:36.979> adding<00:01:37.310> four<00:01:38.060> on<00:01:38.410> so<00:01:39.410> therefore<00:01:40.070> I

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
that I'm adding four on so therefore I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.620 
that I'm adding four on so therefore I
know<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:41.240> answers<00:01:42.050> getting<00:01:42.530> bigger<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:43.630> I

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
know the answers getting bigger so I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:57.080 
know the answers getting bigger so I
started<00:01:45.380> one<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:45.979> I<00:01:46.310> add<00:01:46.520> four

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.289 

okay<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:58.380> double<00:01:58.560> check<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.820> added

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
okay then we double check have I added

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.969 
okay then we double check have I added
four<00:02:00.630> log<00:02:05.780> let<00:02:06.780> me<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> look<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.619> where

four log let me have a look or where
does<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.459> make<00:02:08.759> me<00:02:09.000> finish<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.780> finish<00:02:10.739> that's

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
does this make me finish I finish that's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.920 
does this make me finish I finish that's
a<00:02:11.489> number<00:02:11.730> five<00:02:12.269> so<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:14.160> my<00:02:14.549> answer<00:02:14.930> one
