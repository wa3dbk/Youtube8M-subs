many many many generations but this is

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.449 
many many many generations but this is
really<00:02:28.570> now<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.110> time<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.860> do<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.220> while<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
really now the time to do it while the

restoring Bambi we look at the artwork

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.430 
restoring Bambi we look at the artwork
very<00:04:43.550> closely<00:04:44.060> and<00:04:44.390> understand<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.930> textures

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
very closely and understand the textures

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.280 
very closely and understand the textures
and<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:46.640> color<00:04:46.940> so<00:04:47.750> that<00:04:47.900> when<00:04:48.020> we're<00:04:48.200> doing

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
and the color so that when we're doing

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.870 
and the color so that when we're doing
our<00:04:48.470> restoration<00:04:49.070> we<00:04:49.160> can<00:04:49.340> try<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.550> make<00:04:49.850> sure
