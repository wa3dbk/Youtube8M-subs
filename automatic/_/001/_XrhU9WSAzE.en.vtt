00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
it you wouldn't know where to begin so

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.360 
it you wouldn't know where to begin so
in<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.050> video<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> combination

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
in this video this is the combination

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:52.520 
in this video this is the combination
that<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.969> will<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.210> learning<00:00:51.199> now<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.379> looks

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that we will be learning now it looks

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.040 
that we will be learning now it looks
fairly<00:00:52.800> complicated<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.480> actually

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
fairly complicated but it is actually

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.770 
fairly complicated but it is actually
quite<00:00:55.559> easy<00:00:55.980> once<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.940> been<00:00:57.090> broken<00:00:57.360> down<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
quite easy once it's been broken down to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.599 
quite easy once it's been broken down to
you<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.379> understand<00:00:59.010> how<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
you you will understand how to do it and

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.990 
you you will understand how to do it and
all<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.510> will<00:01:00.600> take<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.309> maybe<00:01:02.309> an<00:01:02.489> hour<00:01:02.640> maybe

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
all it will take is maybe an hour maybe

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.109 
all it will take is maybe an hour maybe
a<00:01:03.120> couple<00:01:03.390> hours<00:01:03.600> practice<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:05.850> will<00:01:05.970> get

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
a couple hours practice and you will get

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.410 
a couple hours practice and you will get
it<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.490> I'm<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it down so what I'm going to do now is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.490 
it down so what I'm going to do now is
I'm<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> show<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> combination

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
I'm going to show you the combination

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.950 
I'm going to show you the combination
again<00:01:10.920> except<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.790> time<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.630> slow

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
again except this time I'm going to slow

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.380 
again except this time I'm going to slow
it<00:01:13.080> down<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.590> show<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.400> inputs<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.090> they

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
it down and show you the inputs as they

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.820 
it down and show you the inputs as they
are<00:01:15.450> happening<00:01:16.369> we<00:01:17.369> jump<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:20.060> 44<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
are happening we jump in to 44 and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.880 
are happening we jump in to 44 and
enhanced<00:01:22.830> back<00:01:23.100> forward<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:24.259> now<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.500> point

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
enhanced back forward one now this point

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.160 
enhanced back forward one now this point
is<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.520> important<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> understand<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.960> need

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
is very important to understand you need

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
is very important to understand you need
to<00:01:28.350> wait<00:01:28.650> until<00:01:28.860> your<00:01:29.130> opponent<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.759> about

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
to wait until your opponent is about

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.539 
to wait until your opponent is about
this<00:01:30.840> high<00:01:31.110> off<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.590> ground<00:01:31.770> after<00:01:32.189> the

this high off the ground after the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.730 
this high off the ground after the
bounce<00:01:32.820> before<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.659> perform<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.229> next<00:01:34.530> part

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
bounce before you perform the next part

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
bounce before you perform the next part
of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> combination<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:36.150> may<00:01:36.360> take<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
of the combination this may take a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.450 
of the combination this may take a
little<00:01:36.990> bit<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.320> time<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.860> get<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> hang<00:01:38.340> of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
little bit of time to get the hang of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.730 
little bit of time to get the hang of
but<00:01:38.820> you'll<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.600> used<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.229> time<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
but you'll get used to it in time and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.130 
but you'll get used to it in time and
you'll<00:01:40.860> become<00:01:41.070> second<00:01:41.640> nature<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:42.140> once

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
you'll become second nature now once

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.139 
you'll become second nature now once
your<00:01:43.320> opponent<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.950> around<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:45.030> to

press<00:01:45.509> back<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.970> one<00:01:48.140> down<00:01:49.140> back<00:01:51.350> 333

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
press back to one down back 333

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.080 
press back to one down back 333

back forward one

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.870 
back forward one
and<00:01:56.859> again<00:01:57.859> that<00:01:58.250> should<00:01:58.399> look<00:01:58.609> something

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
and again that should look something

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:09.699 
and again that should look something
like<00:01:59.030> this<00:02:07.750> now<00:02:08.750> for<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:09.019> next<00:02:09.080> part<00:02:09.530> I'm

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709

going to actually show you how I learned

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.229 
going to actually show you how I learned
this<00:02:12.470> combination<00:02:13.069> which<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.459> thought<00:02:13.760> was<00:02:13.970> the

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
this combination which I thought was the

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.420 
this combination which I thought was the
easiest<00:02:14.569> way<00:02:14.840> possible<00:02:15.160> see<00:02:16.160> what<00:02:16.310> this

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
easiest way possible see what this

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.520 
easiest way possible see what this
combination<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.360> actually<00:02:17.840> two

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
combination is is actually two

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.490 
combination is is actually two
combinations<00:02:19.250> combined<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:21.230> first

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
combinations combined the first

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:30.670 
combinations combined the first
combination<00:02:21.799> is<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:30.230> second

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
combination is this and the second

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:40.869 
combination is this and the second
combination<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.519> this<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.340> found<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:40.700> best

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
combination is this so I found the best

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.210 
combination is this so I found the best
way<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.090> learn<00:02:41.329> this<00:02:41.480> combination<00:02:42.079> was<00:02:42.319> not<00:02:43.069> to

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
way to learn this combination was not to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.720 
way to learn this combination was not to
try<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.549> do<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.819> whole<00:02:44.060> thing<00:02:44.090> at<00:02:44.840> once<00:02:45.730> try

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
try and do the whole thing at once try

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.630 
try and do the whole thing at once try
to<00:02:46.790> master<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.840> two<00:02:48.140> separate<00:02:48.799> combinations

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
to master the two separate combinations

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.000 
to master the two separate combinations
and<00:02:49.970> then<00:02:50.930> once<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.379> are<00:02:51.530> really<00:02:51.739> comfortable

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
and then once you are really comfortable

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.699 
and then once you are really comfortable
that<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:52.519> perform<00:02:52.940> them<00:02:53.319> then<00:02:54.319> try<00:02:54.650> to

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
that you can perform them then try to

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.440 
that you can perform them then try to
merge<00:02:55.040> them<00:02:55.280> together<00:02:55.400> into<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.239> one

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
merge them together into the one

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.160 
merge them together into the one
combination<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:58.390> once<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.510> do<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.690> you

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
combination and once you do that you

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.629 
combination and once you do that you
should<00:03:00.230> have<00:03:00.410> no<00:03:00.680> problem<00:03:00.709> give<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:01.549> a<00:03:01.609> few

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
should have no problem give it a few

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.470 
should have no problem give it a few
hours<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.420> you'll<00:03:03.170> be<00:03:03.290> right<00:03:03.440> as<00:03:03.590> rain<00:03:04.480> also

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
hours and you'll be right as rain also

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.990 
hours and you'll be right as rain also
just<00:03:05.840> as<00:03:05.959> an<00:03:06.079> added<00:03:06.380> tip<00:03:06.620> sometimes<00:03:07.430> when

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
just as an added tip sometimes when

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.640 
just as an added tip sometimes when
you're<00:03:08.180> versing<00:03:08.630> opponents<00:03:09.139> that<00:03:09.230> could<00:03:09.380> zone

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
you're versing opponents that could zone

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.500 
you're versing opponents that could zone
you<00:03:09.769> out<00:03:09.889> quite<00:03:10.130> easily<00:03:10.160> jumping<00:03:11.120> in<00:03:11.239> and

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
you out quite easily jumping in and

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.759 
you out quite easily jumping in and
doing<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:12.670> 244<00:03:13.670> can<00:03:14.030> be<00:03:14.120> quite<00:03:14.329> difficult<00:03:14.769> in

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
doing the 244 can be quite difficult in

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.680 
doing the 244 can be quite difficult in
these<00:03:15.889> cases<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.430> can<00:03:16.459> simply<00:03:16.790> cut<00:03:17.239> out<00:03:17.359> the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
these cases you can simply cut out the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.930 
these cases you can simply cut out the
244<00:03:18.620> combination<00:03:19.340> at<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.549> very<00:03:19.790> beginning

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
244 combination at the very beginning

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.150 
244 combination at the very beginning
when<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.569> jump<00:03:20.840> in<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.650> can<00:03:21.739> just<00:03:21.920> start

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
when you jump in and you can just start

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.650 
when you jump in and you can just start
off<00:03:22.310> straight<00:03:22.700> with<00:03:22.880> an<00:03:23.000> enhanced<00:03:23.450> back

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
off straight with an enhanced back

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.440 
off straight with an enhanced back
forward<00:03:24.049> one<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:25.340> will<00:03:25.489> give<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.819> less<00:03:26.030> damage

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
forward one it will give you less damage

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.259 
forward one it will give you less damage
I'll<00:03:26.810> show<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:27.079> showing<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.680> here<00:03:28.069> as<00:03:28.269> you

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
I'll show you showing you here as you

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.729 
I'll show you showing you here as you
see<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.540> will<00:03:29.630> do<00:03:29.750> thirty<00:03:30.079> two<00:03:30.290> percent<00:03:30.319> damage

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
see it will do thirty two percent damage

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.940 
see it will do thirty two percent damage
instead<00:03:31.160> of<00:03:31.310> forty-two<00:03:31.760> percent<00:03:31.819> damage<00:03:32.239> but

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
instead of forty-two percent damage but

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.770 
instead of forty-two percent damage but
it<00:03:33.950> is<00:03:34.069> much<00:03:34.220> easier<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.730> pull<00:03:34.910> off<00:03:35.090> if<00:03:35.299> their

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
it is much easier to pull off if their

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.559 
it is much easier to pull off if their
zoning<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.349> out<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.739> can<00:03:36.769> get<00:03:37.130> close

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
zoning you out and you can get close

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.120 
zoning you out and you can get close
okay<00:03:38.569> so<00:03:38.630> I<00:03:38.780> just<00:03:38.870> wanted<00:03:39.109> to<00:03:39.169> tell<00:03:39.319> you<00:03:39.470> why<00:03:39.799> I

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
okay so I just wanted to tell you why I

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.039 
okay so I just wanted to tell you why I
wanted<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:40.970> teach<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.329> just<00:03:41.569> this<00:03:41.780> one

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
wanted to teach you just this one

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.509 
wanted to teach you just this one
combination<00:03:42.380> instead<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.069> trying<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:43.340> teach

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
combination instead of trying to teach

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.089 
combination instead of trying to teach
you<00:03:44.019> five<00:03:45.019> or<00:03:45.230> six<00:03:45.470> or<00:03:45.620> seven<00:03:45.980> different

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
you five or six or seven different

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.069 
you five or six or seven different
combinations<00:03:46.849> is<00:03:47.030> because<00:03:47.329> in<00:03:47.599> game<00:03:47.870> design

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
combinations is because in game design

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.890 
combinations is because in game design
we<00:03:48.829> learned<00:03:49.130> that<00:03:49.280> players<00:03:50.269> have<00:03:50.389> a<00:03:50.569> very

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
we learned that players have a very

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.629 
we learned that players have a very
short-term<00:03:51.319> memory<00:03:51.859> when<00:03:52.069> it<00:03:52.099> comes<00:03:52.400> to

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
short-term memory when it comes to

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.030 
short-term memory when it comes to
trying<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.060> memorize<00:03:53.269> things<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.650> if<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:54.829> try<00:03:55.010> to

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
trying to memorize things so if I try to

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.490 
trying to memorize things so if I try to
teach<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.549> five<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.299> these<00:03:56.540> combinations<00:03:56.959> it

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
teach you five of these combinations it

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.379 
teach you five of these combinations it
would<00:03:57.739> be<00:03:57.829> far<00:03:58.130> too<00:03:58.160> overwhelming<00:03:59.060> firm

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
would be far too overwhelming firm

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.020 
would be far too overwhelming firm
pretty<00:04:00.319> much<00:04:00.500> everybody<00:04:00.829> and<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.819> wouldn't

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
pretty much everybody and you wouldn't

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.959 
pretty much everybody and you wouldn't
end<00:04:02.180> up<00:04:02.239> learning<00:04:02.450> anything<00:04:02.810> at<00:04:03.079> all<00:04:03.670> so<00:04:04.670> in

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:04.969 
end up learning anything at all so in

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:06.759 
end up learning anything at all so in
this<00:04:05.450> way<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.750> have<00:04:05.900> actually<00:04:06.290> got<00:04:06.409> something

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
this way you have actually got something

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.200 
this way you have actually got something
to<00:04:06.890> focus<00:04:07.129> on

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
to focus on

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.420 
to focus on
the<00:04:08.840> beauty<00:04:09.140> about<00:04:09.170> learning<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.860> combination

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
the beauty about learning a combination

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.010 
the beauty about learning a combination
like<00:04:10.670> this<00:04:10.940> and<00:04:11.240> focusing<00:04:11.840> on<00:04:11.960> the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
like this and focusing on the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.080 
like this and focusing on the
combination<00:04:12.230> like<00:04:12.680> this<00:04:12.860> is<00:04:13.070> that<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.880> will

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
combination like this is that you will

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.360 
combination like this is that you will
accidentally<00:04:14.720> realize<00:04:15.410> and<00:04:15.740> learn<00:04:15.980> other

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
accidentally realize and learn other

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.100 
accidentally realize and learn other
smaller<00:04:17.150> combinations<00:04:17.780> that<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:17.930> can

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
smaller combinations that you can

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.080 
smaller combinations that you can
actually<00:04:18.260> do<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:18.860> it<00:04:19.580> will<00:04:19.730> give<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.060> a

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
actually do and it will give you a

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.760 
actually do and it will give you a
better<00:04:20.300> understanding<00:04:20.450> of<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.350> character

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
better understanding of the character

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.400
