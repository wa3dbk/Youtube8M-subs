can use any number of cleaners but

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.969 
can use any number of cleaners but
you're<00:00:54.580> going<00:00:54.699> to<00:00:54.790> use<00:00:54.909> it<00:00:55.089> like<00:00:55.239> sandpaper

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
you're going to use it like sandpaper

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:06.359 
you're going to use it like sandpaper
and<00:00:57.269> just<00:00:58.269> stand<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.659> mark<00:00:58.900> throw<00:00:59.110> it<00:00:59.170> off

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.310 

and<00:01:06.880> we'll<00:01:07.090> just<00:01:07.119> hand<00:01:07.539> it<00:01:07.719> right<00:01:07.929> out

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.800 

it<00:01:12.560> was<00:01:12.710> called<00:01:12.950> retraining<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.790> same

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.370 

it<00:01:17.810> definitely<00:01:17.990> makes<00:01:18.439> a<00:01:18.759> huge<00:01:19.759> difference

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
it definitely makes a huge difference

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.410 
it definitely makes a huge difference
you<00:01:21.619> think<00:01:22.070> look<00:01:22.340> like<00:01:22.549> new

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.060 

the<00:01:29.870> really<00:01:30.170> simple<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.850> effective<00:01:32.380> process

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.740 

once<00:01:38.070> again<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:38.700> elbow<00:01:39.240> grease

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.450 

and<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.229> any<00:01:43.409> number<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.979> types<00:01:44.280> of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and you can use any number of types of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.270 
and you can use any number of types of
cleaner<00:01:50.930> even<00:01:51.930> dish<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.470> works<00:01:52.740> good<00:01:52.950> with

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
cleaner even dish that works good with

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.410 
cleaner even dish that works good with
this<00:01:54.000> technique<00:01:55.369> but<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.670> revives<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
this technique but it really revives the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:11.030 
this technique but it really revives the
sink<00:01:57.950> brings<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.159> back<00:01:59.310> to<00:02:00.200> nice<00:02:01.200> finish

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.180 

get<00:02:12.040> all<00:02:12.190> up

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.229 

nice<00:02:16.190> cool

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
nice cool

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.470 
nice cool
look

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.700 

and<00:02:22.480> there<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.660> could<00:02:22.900> follow<00:02:23.050> after<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
and there I could follow after the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.980 
and there I could follow after the
Polish<00:02:26.430> polish<00:02:27.430> will<00:02:27.730> kind<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.000> help<00:02:28.120> prevent

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
Polish polish will kind of help prevent

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.480 
Polish polish will kind of help prevent
it<00:02:29.080> from<00:02:29.200> getting<00:02:29.440> any<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.890> those<00:02:29.980> marks<00:02:30.370> in

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490
