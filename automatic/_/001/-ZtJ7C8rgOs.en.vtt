00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.440 
found this whole new world which is
which<00:02:01.880> is<00:02:02.060> more<00:02:02.450> than<00:02:02.689> black<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.469> know<00:02:04.420> also<00:02:05.420> a

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
which is more than black you know also a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.180 
which is more than black you know also a
Celina<00:02:06.289> of<00:02:06.590> fashion<00:02:06.979> no<00:02:07.130> no<00:02:07.189> according<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:07.850> you

Celina of fashion no no according to you

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.410 
Celina of fashion no no according to you
definitely<00:02:10.190> bandage<00:02:10.700> dresses<00:02:10.970> are<00:02:11.240> out<00:02:11.390> I

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
definitely bandage dresses are out I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.000 
definitely bandage dresses are out I
think<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.380> see-through<00:02:13.250> dresses<00:02:13.520> and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
think and see-through dresses and

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.910 
think and see-through dresses and
I<00:02:15.150> think<00:02:16.150> too<00:02:16.300> much<00:02:16.510> makeup<00:02:16.960> too<00:02:17.140> much<00:02:17.320> bling

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
I think too much makeup too much bling

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.270 
I think too much makeup too much bling
so<00:02:18.430> maybe<00:02:19.230> minimalistic<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.710> right<00:02:21.250> now

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
so maybe minimalistic is in right now

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.320 
so maybe minimalistic is in right now
and<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.330> think<00:02:22.720> that's<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.320> way<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.530> go<00:02:23.830> you

and I think that's the way to go you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.850 
and I think that's the way to go you
