is like you could now prove that we or
not<00:03:04.489> I'm<00:03:04.670> checking<00:03:05.030> like<00:03:05.359> the<00:03:05.739> realness<00:03:07.000> like

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
not I'm checking like the realness like

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.840 
not I'm checking like the realness like
biting<00:03:08.390> into<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:11.530> useless<00:03:12.530> normally<00:03:13.459> if<00:03:13.700> you

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
biting into it useless normally if you

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.759 
biting into it useless normally if you
make<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.120> check<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.690> bite<00:03:14.959> into<00:03:15.170> code<00:03:15.560> you

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
make a check and you bite into code you

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.949 
make a check and you bite into code you
expect<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.900> go<00:03:18.049> to<00:03:18.290> transform<00:03:18.859> doesn't<00:03:19.190> you

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
expect to to go to transform doesn't you

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:33.880 
expect to to go to transform doesn't you
so<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.320> goes<00:03:27.790> wanted<00:03:28.790> um<00:03:29.680> John<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:33.590> yeah

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
so this is goes wanted um John and yeah

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.220 
so this is goes wanted um John and yeah
