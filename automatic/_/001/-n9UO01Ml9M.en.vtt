00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.620 
show up in it but it just looks really
really<00:03:10.160> cool<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.400> know<00:03:10.610> i<00:03:10.970> like<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.600> fact

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
really cool you know i like the fact

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.240 
really cool you know i like the fact
that<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.990> can<00:03:12.110> like<00:03:12.290> texture<00:03:12.680> packs<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.100> such

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
that you can like texture packs and such

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.120 
that you can like texture packs and such
like<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.670> but<00:03:14.330> um<00:03:14.540> i<00:03:14.750> will<00:03:15.050> say<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.950> is

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
like that but um i will say that this is

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.520 
like that but um i will say that this is
a<00:03:16.190> third<00:03:16.430> generation<00:03:16.460> ipod<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.600> some<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.380> the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
a third generation ipod and some of the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.940 
a third generation ipod and some of the
maps<00:03:18.860> i<00:03:19.070> downloaded<00:03:19.580> are<00:03:19.700> pretty<00:03:20.950> laggy

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
maps i downloaded are pretty laggy

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.520 
maps i downloaded are pretty laggy
they're<00:03:22.550> pretty<00:03:22.700> laggy<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:23.570> i<00:03:23.600> imagine<00:03:23.990> if<00:03:24.410> you

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
they're pretty laggy so i imagine if you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.180 
they're pretty laggy so i imagine if you
make<00:03:24.770> something<00:03:25.130> big<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.410> pretty<00:03:27.410> pretty

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
make something big and pretty pretty

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.580 
make something big and pretty pretty
sick<00:03:28.580> then<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:29.570> would<00:03:29.660> be<00:03:29.780> pretty<00:03:30.020> laggy<00:03:30.350> so

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
sick then it would be pretty laggy so

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.960 
sick then it would be pretty laggy so
let<00:03:30.680> me<00:03:30.740> go<00:03:30.800> I<00:03:30.830> think<00:03:30.980> maybe<00:03:31.160> craft<00:03:31.490> world<00:03:31.760> was

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
let me go I think maybe craft world was

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.040 
let me go I think maybe craft world was
the<00:03:32.120> one<00:03:32.300> I<00:03:32.540> played<00:03:33.170> on<00:03:33.350> this<00:03:33.980> map<00:03:34.460> has

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
the one I played on this map has

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.960 
the one I played on this map has
crapload<00:03:36.050> of<00:03:36.110> stuff<00:03:36.230> on<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.580> made<00:03:37.760> my

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
crapload of stuff on it and it made my

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.750 
crapload of stuff on it and it made my
ipod<00:03:38.780> leg<00:03:39.170> pretty<00:03:39.530> bad<00:03:39.680> but<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.550> game<00:03:40.700> is

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
ipod leg pretty bad but this game is

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.280 
ipod leg pretty bad but this game is
pretty<00:03:41.120> amazing<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.810> mean<00:03:41.840> there's<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.110> few

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
pretty amazing I mean there's a few

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.630 
pretty amazing I mean there's a few
things<00:03:42.440> here<00:03:42.710> and<00:03:42.800> there<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.220> gripe<00:03:43.460> about

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
things here and there that I gripe about

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.820 
things here and there that I gripe about
but<00:03:44.090> they<00:03:44.480> can<00:03:44.660> fix<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:44.990> stuff<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.470> updates

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
but they can fix that stuff and updates

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.860 
but they can fix that stuff and updates
and<00:03:46.160> this<00:03:46.640> game<00:03:46.820> does<00:03:47.030> get<00:03:47.180> updated<00:03:47.600> a<00:03:47.630> lot<00:03:47.840> I

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
and this game does get updated a lot I

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.050 
and this game does get updated a lot I
think<00:03:48.020> this<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.500> like<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.220> 27th

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
think this is it like this is the 27th

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.390 
think this is it like this is the 27th
update<00:03:50.540> for<00:03:50.720> this<00:03:50.810> game<00:03:51.020> so<00:03:51.770> it<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.190> pretty

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
update for this game so it is pretty

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.730 
update for this game so it is pretty
sick<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.000> like<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.600> lot<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.990> definitely<00:03:54.560> would

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
sick and I like a lot I definitely would

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.470 
sick and I like a lot I definitely would
recommend<00:03:54.770> survivalcraft<00:03:55.520> if<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.150> would<00:03:56.330> ever

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
recommend survivalcraft if it would ever

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.770 
recommend survivalcraft if it would ever
load<00:03:57.290> here's<00:03:57.560> my<00:03:57.620> fingers<00:03:57.920> but<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:59.540> we<00:03:59.630> saw

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
load here's my fingers but and we saw

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.150 
load here's my fingers but and we saw
that<00:03:59.900> texture<00:04:00.260> pack<00:04:00.440> on<00:04:00.590> let's<00:04:00.800> switch<00:04:01.130> it

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
that texture pack on let's switch it

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.950 
that texture pack on let's switch it
back<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.580> original<00:04:01.610> texture<00:04:02.150> pack<00:04:02.390> because

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
back to original texture pack because

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.330 
back to original texture pack because
some<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.290> these<00:04:03.410> texture<00:04:03.800> packs<00:04:03.980> don't<00:04:04.220> have

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
some of these texture packs don't have

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.040 
some of these texture packs don't have
textures<00:04:04.790> for<00:04:04.910> certain<00:04:05.210> things<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:05.780> like<00:04:05.930> I

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
textures for certain things so like I

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.360 
textures for certain things so like I
like<00:04:06.200> keeping<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:06.590> in<00:04:06.710> the<00:04:06.740> default<00:04:07.100> I

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
like keeping it in the default I

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.490 
like keeping it in the default I
actually<00:04:07.790> think<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.300> fault<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:08.720> a<00:04:08.750> really

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
actually think to the fault is a really

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.380 
actually think to the fault is a really
pretty<00:04:09.800> texture<00:04:10.250> pack<00:04:10.460> I<00:04:10.730> mean<00:04:11.180> if<00:04:11.270> you<00:04:11.360> think

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
pretty texture pack I mean if you think

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.270 
pretty texture pack I mean if you think
minecraft<00:04:12.020> really<00:04:12.260> ugly<00:04:12.500> but<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:12.830> like<00:04:13.100> the
