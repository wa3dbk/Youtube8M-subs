well<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.900> online<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> found<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
well what online I found this this is a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.000 
well what online I found this this is a
drain<00:00:23.970> plug<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> was<00:00:25.350> wondering<00:00:25.740> how<00:00:25.769> am<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
drain plug and I was wondering how am I

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.620

gonna get to the back of the boat

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.269 
gonna get to the back of the boat
because<00:00:27.960> they<00:00:28.199> really<00:00:28.500> should<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:28.769> mounted

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
because they really should be mounted

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.160 
because they really should be mounted
right<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.599> came<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.080> got

right in here so came out here and got

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.590 
right in here so came out here and got
to<00:00:31.289> looking<00:00:31.710> at<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:33.020> see<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:35.000> this<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.420> if

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
to looking at this see that this here if

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.780 
to looking at this see that this here if
you<00:00:36.750> pull<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.140> away<00:00:37.489> even<00:00:38.489> though<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.700> got

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you pull this away even though it's got

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.610 
you pull this away even though it's got
flotation<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:40.110> right<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
flotation in it you can see right to the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.959 
flotation in it you can see right to the
part<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> boat<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.489> would<00:00:41.730> need<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
part of the boat that you would need to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
part of the boat that you would need to
get<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:43.020> had<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> plug<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
get to if they had a plug in it and you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:01:08.590 
get to if they had a plug in it and you
wanted<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> pull<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> plug<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:04.430> install<00:01:05.430> this

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.890 

probably<00:01:09.600> from<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.500> inside<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:12.390> put<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
probably from the inside you put this to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.719 
probably from the inside you put this to
the<00:01:12.930> back<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> boat<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.799> put<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> couple<00:01:14.549> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the back of the boat you put a couple of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.810 
the back of the boat you put a couple of
screws<00:01:15.210> through<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:17.159> my<00:01:17.310> thinking<00:01:17.640> is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
screws through here and my thinking is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850 
screws through here and my thinking is
if<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.150> had<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.720> piece<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.650> other

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
if you had a little piece on the other

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.789 
if you had a little piece on the other
side<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.430> here<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.820> attach<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.110> you

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
side of here to attach that to and you

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.200 
side of here to attach that to and you
put<00:01:23.340> brass<00:01:24.330> screws<00:01:24.900> through<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.210> then

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
put brass screws through that and then

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
put brass screws through that and then
put<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> two<00:01:27.960> together<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.740> each<00:01:28.860> side<00:01:29.100> of

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
put the two together one on each side of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.710 
put the two together one on each side of
the<00:01:29.220> boat<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.670> put<00:01:29.909> some<00:01:30.060> sealer<00:01:30.420> around

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the boat and put some sealer around

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.090 
the boat and put some sealer around
there<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.900> would<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.259> fine<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.920> would

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
there that would be fine then this would

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.830 
there that would be fine then this would
be<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> inside<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.030> boat<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.720> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
be on the inside of the boat and you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.260 
be on the inside of the boat and you
could<00:01:33.990> reach<00:01:34.170> down<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.590> there<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.009> could

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
could reach down in there and you could

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
could reach down in there and you could
tighten<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:37.920> boat<00:01:38.040> wouldn't

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
tighten that up and your boat wouldn't

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
tighten that up and your boat wouldn't
leak<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:38.820> when<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.180> done<00:01:39.439> when<00:01:40.439> you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
leak and then when you got done when you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.810 
leak and then when you got done when you
got<00:01:40.650> home<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.890> could<00:01:41.220> not<00:01:41.310> reach<00:01:41.579> down<00:01:41.790> there

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
got home you could not reach down there

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.230 
got home you could not reach down there
unscrew<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.579> let<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> water<00:01:45.030> out<00:01:45.119> of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
unscrew that and let the water out of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.370 
unscrew that and let the water out of
your<00:01:45.329> boat<00:01:45.570> went<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.899> way<00:01:46.049> when<00:01:46.229> it's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
your boat went that way when it's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
your boat went that way when it's
sitting<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.860> will

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
sitting it will

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
sitting it will
water<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.510> I<00:01:49.670> don't<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.730> if<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.910> could<00:01:51.090> install

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
water so I don't know if I could install

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.570 
water so I don't know if I could install
all<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.200> another<00:01:52.860> way<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> put<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.550> a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
all of that another way to put it in a

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.130 
all of that another way to put it in a
bit<00:01:53.850> putting<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.240> from<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.510> outside<00:01:54.870> and<00:01:54.930> have

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
bit putting it from the outside and have

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.930 
bit putting it from the outside and have
the<00:01:55.230> plug<00:01:55.470> screw<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.370> and<00:01:56.580> come<00:01:56.760> out

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
the plug screw in and out and come out

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.410 
the plug screw in and out and come out
from<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.210> back

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
from the back

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.240 
from the back
but<00:01:57.720> either<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.260> work<00:01:58.850> I<00:02:00.830> think<00:02:01.830> if<00:02:02.190> I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
but either way would work I think if I

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.680 
but either way would work I think if I
got<00:02:02.400> this<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:02.910> position<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.510> might

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
got this in the right position I might

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.180 
got this in the right position I might
to<00:02:03.870> make<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.170> hole<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.620> boat<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:05.010> put

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
to make the hole in the boat and put

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.420 
to make the hole in the boat and put
that<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.640> drill<00:02:05.910> it<00:02:09.110> yeah<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:11.100> that's<00:02:11.250> one

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
that in and drill it yeah so that's one

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.610 
that in and drill it yeah so that's one
project<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.030> would<00:02:12.180> like<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.690> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
project that I would like to do and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.240 
project that I would like to do and
today<00:02:14.550> I've<00:02:14.850> got<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> time<00:02:15.860> okay<00:02:16.860> then<00:02:17.070> this

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
today I've got the time okay then this

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.890 
today I've got the time okay then this
is<00:02:17.430> going<00:02:17.640> out<00:02:17.760> I'm<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.240> make<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.600> work

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
is going out I'm going to make this work

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.660 
is going out I'm going to make this work
and<00:02:19.200> when<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.770> garage<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> first<00:02:20.520> thing

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
and when the garage and the first thing

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.970 
and when the garage and the first thing
I<00:02:20.760> ran<00:02:20.910> across<00:02:21.060> was<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.660> thing<00:02:22.020> which<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.860> an

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
I ran across was this thing which is an

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.270 
I ran across was this thing which is an
odd-looking<00:02:23.220> thing<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.660> fits<00:02:25.010> who<00:02:26.010> right

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
odd-looking thing but it fits who right

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.390 
odd-looking thing but it fits who right
exactly<00:02:26.820> almost<00:02:27.000> there<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.860> I'm<00:02:28.950> knocked<00:02:29.160> out

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
exactly almost there so I'm knocked out

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.760 
exactly almost there so I'm knocked out
a<00:02:29.430> hole<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.120> side<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:31.520> trimmed<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.760> washer

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
a hole on this side I trimmed a washer

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.680 
a hole on this side I trimmed a washer
for<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.890> other<00:02:35.100> side<00:02:35.520> in<00:02:35.760> order<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.090> shim<00:02:36.420> this

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
for the other side in order to shim this

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.470 
for the other side in order to shim this
shot<00:02:36.930> between<00:02:37.320> there<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.090> there<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.150> I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
shot between there and there and I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.120 
shot between there and there and I
ground<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.959> edge<00:02:40.200> down<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:40.950> all

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
ground this edge down so that this all

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.370 
ground this edge down so that this all
comes<00:02:41.400> together<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.090> then<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.840> trim<00:02:43.140> two

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
comes together and then that trim two

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.340 
comes together and then that trim two
flat<00:02:43.740> washers<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.430> go<00:02:44.550> on<00:02:44.670> top<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:46.260> I

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
flat washers to go on top of that and I

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.260 
flat washers to go on top of that and I
got<00:02:46.530> me<00:02:46.680> some<00:02:46.709> little<00:02:46.980> brass<00:02:47.280> screws<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> nuts

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.070 
all of this I'm gonna drill these holes
small<00:03:14.130> enough<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:15.030> should<00:03:15.870> be<00:03:15.989> able

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
small enough so that I should be able

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.660 
small enough so that I should be able
literally<00:03:16.590> thread<00:03:16.860> those<00:03:17.040> screws<00:03:17.400> right

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
literally thread those screws right

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.190 
literally thread those screws right
through<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.030> plastic<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.570> then<00:03:18.810> go<00:03:18.989> inside

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
through the plastic and then go inside

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.170 
through the plastic and then go inside
and<00:03:19.650> put<00:03:19.739> all<00:03:19.890> my<00:03:20.040> other<00:03:20.250> stuff<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:20.820> there<00:03:21.000> on

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
and put all my other stuff in there on

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.610 
and put all my other stuff in there on
the<00:03:21.269> back<00:03:21.450> side<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.900> then<00:03:21.989> pull<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.470> all

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
the back side and then pull it all

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.890 
the back side and then pull it all
together<00:03:22.739> once<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.459> tighten<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.910> up<00:03:24.030> that's<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
together once I tighten it up that's the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.110 
together once I tighten it up that's the
plan
