there<00:02:52.030> at<00:02:52.150> all<00:02:54.870> I<00:03:00.600> think<00:03:01.600> it's<00:03:01.840> fair<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.230> say

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
there at all I think it's fair to say

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.280 
there at all I think it's fair to say
that<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.800> Americans<00:03:03.340> have<00:03:03.610> enjoyed<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
that the Americans have enjoyed the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.830 
that the Americans have enjoyed the
majority<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.550> roles<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:07.300> this<00:03:07.420> point<00:03:07.660> in

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
majority of the roles to this point in

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.110 
majority of the roles to this point in
the<00:03:07.900> Mosconi<00:03:08.290> cop<00:03:08.620> who<00:03:09.430> could<00:03:09.670> begrudge

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
the Mosconi cop who could begrudge

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.940 
the Mosconi cop who could begrudge
Europe<00:03:10.780> getting<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.170> few<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.770> was

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
Europe getting a few and that was

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.290 
Europe getting a few and that was
certainly<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:13.470> glitch<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.500> bad<00:03:14.920> luck<00:03:15.250> from<00:03:16.000> Team

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
certainly a glitch of bad luck from Team

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.210 
certainly a glitch of bad luck from Team
USA<00:03:19.140> but<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:20.260> think<00:03:20.410> it's<00:03:20.530> also<00:03:20.680> fair<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.070> say

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
now the key shot really in this rack is

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.680 
now the key shot really in this rack is
going<00:04:22.540> to<00:04:22.600> be<00:04:22.690> from<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.020> 4<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:23.950> 5

going to be from the 4 to the 5
Thurston<00:04:25.690> want<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:25.990> leave<00:04:26.110> himself<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.500> little

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
Thurston want to leave himself a little

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.150 
Thurston want to leave himself a little
angle<00:04:27.040> on<00:04:27.220> that<00:04:27.370> 4<00:04:27.760> if<00:04:27.910> he<00:04:28.060> can<00:04:28.889> then<00:04:29.889> try<00:04:30.100> to

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
angle on that 4 if he can then try to

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.000 
angle on that 4 if he can then try to
work<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.550> cue<00:04:30.880> ball<00:04:31.139> back<00:04:32.139> down<00:04:32.380> table<00:04:32.830> for

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
work that cue ball back down table for

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:42.870 
work that cue ball back down table for
the<00:04:33.100> 5<00:04:37.080> yeah<00:04:38.080> Jim<00:04:38.380> this<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.889> shot<00:04:41.880> he

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
the 5 yeah Jim this is the shot he

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.520 
the 5 yeah Jim this is the shot he
doesn't<00:04:43.150> have<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.300> ton<00:04:43.480> of<00:04:43.510> angle<00:04:43.870> Jerry<00:04:44.139> he's

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
doesn't have a ton of angle Jerry he's

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.100 
doesn't have a ton of angle Jerry he's
gonna<00:04:44.680> have<00:04:44.860> to<00:04:44.950> force<00:04:45.250> this<00:04:45.690> when<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.810> looks

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
gonna have to force this when it looks

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.140 
gonna have to force this when it looks
like<00:04:47.380> with<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.860> angle<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.280> he's<00:04:48.400> got<00:04:48.639> he

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
like with the angle that he's got he

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.820 
like with the angle that he's got he
might<00:04:49.389> be<00:04:49.570> able<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.810> try<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:50.169> work<00:04:50.320> this<00:04:50.530> cue

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
might be able to try and work this cue

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.090 
might be able to try and work this cue
ball<00:04:51.040> off<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:53.740> cushion<00:04:54.600> here<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:56.740> try<00:04:56.979> and

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
ball off the cushion here to try and

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.050 
ball off the cushion here to try and
bring<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.400> down<00:04:57.610> into<00:04:57.910> this<00:04:58.120> area<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:59.910> mean<00:05:00.910> that

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
bring it down into this area I mean that

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.140 
bring it down into this area I mean that
looks<00:05:01.330> like<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:01.630> chance<00:05:02.820> tough<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:03.970> tell

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
looks like a chance tough to tell

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.520 
looks like a chance tough to tell
exactly<00:05:04.630> what<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:06.750> what<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.870> angle<00:05:08.169> is<00:05:08.290> on

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
exactly what the what the angle is on

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.980 
exactly what the what the angle is on
this<00:05:08.740> 4<00:05:09.040> but<00:05:09.550> either<00:05:09.729> way<00:05:09.940> he's<00:05:10.479> gonna<00:05:10.570> have<00:05:10.840> to

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
this 4 but either way he's gonna have to

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.990 
this 4 but either way he's gonna have to
