00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
leveling up as fast as possible is just

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.340 
leveling up as fast as possible is just
raiding<00:00:20.410> raiding<00:00:20.590> raiding<00:00:21.420> now<00:00:22.420> I<00:00:22.900> know

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350

you're<00:00:23.680> you<00:00:24.370> probably<00:00:24.700> realized<00:00:25.090> that<00:00:25.270> rating

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690 
you're you probably realized that rating

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.680 
you're you probably realized that rating
isn't<00:00:25.840> what<00:00:26.080> gives<00:00:26.230> you<00:00:26.350> XP<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:26.980> that<00:00:27.190> is<00:00:27.340> true

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
isn't what gives you XP and that is true

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.210 
isn't what gives you XP and that is true
but<00:00:28.690> you<00:00:28.900> need<00:00:29.080> as<00:00:29.200> much<00:00:29.320> loot<00:00:29.619> as<00:00:29.740> possible

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
but you need as much loot as possible

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.770 
but you need as much loot as possible
and<00:00:30.310> as<00:00:30.430> you<00:00:30.580> can<00:00:30.730> see<00:00:30.880> I<00:00:30.910> left<00:00:31.270> this<00:00:31.510> match

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
and as you can see I left this match

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.660 
and as you can see I left this match
with<00:00:32.070> 36,000<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:33.129> 34,000<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:35.429> that's<00:00:36.429> not<00:00:36.609> a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
with 36,000 and 34,000 and that's not a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.970 
with 36,000 and 34,000 and that's not a
ton<00:00:36.999> but<00:00:37.539> it's<00:00:37.719> really<00:00:37.899> good<00:00:38.140> for<00:00:38.170> what<00:00:38.649> level

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
ton but it's really good for what level

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.029 
ton but it's really good for what level
I<00:00:39.100> am<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:40.780> this<00:00:41.019> did<00:00:41.260> was<00:00:41.289> it<00:00:41.620> allowed<00:00:41.710> me

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
I am and what this did was it allowed me

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.489 
I am and what this did was it allowed me
to<00:00:42.069> level<00:00:42.789> up<00:00:42.850> other<00:00:43.059> stuff<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.629> leveling<00:00:44.319> up

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 
to level up other stuff and leveling up

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.009 
to level up other stuff and leveling up
your<00:00:44.530> stuff<00:00:45.100> inside<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:45.909> your<00:00:46.149> base<00:00:46.329> like<00:00:46.629> if

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
your stuff inside of your base like if

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.009 
your stuff inside of your base like if
you<00:00:47.289> upgrade<00:00:47.499> even<00:00:47.829> just<00:00:48.190> your<00:00:48.339> farms<00:00:49.019> those

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
you upgrade even just your farms those

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.479 
you upgrade even just your farms those
are<00:00:50.170> gonna<00:00:50.289> give<00:00:50.469> you<00:00:50.589> XP<00:00:50.949> and<00:00:51.100> that's<00:00:51.309> what

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
are gonna give you XP and that's what

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.759 
are gonna give you XP and that's what
levels<00:00:51.819> you<00:00:51.940> up<00:00:52.120> so<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.389> whole<00:00:52.569> trick<00:00:52.870> is<00:00:52.899> you

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
levels you up so the whole trick is you

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.349 
levels you up so the whole trick is you
want<00:00:53.979> to<00:00:54.100> have<00:00:54.219> all<00:00:54.429> your<00:00:54.609> builders<00:00:54.999> doing

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
want to have all your builders doing

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.959 
want to have all your builders doing
something<00:00:55.749> at<00:00:55.899> all<00:00:55.929> times<00:00:56.530> like<00:00:56.889> you<00:00:57.639> never

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
something at all times like you never

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.369 
something at all times like you never
want<00:00:58.359> your<00:00:58.479> builders<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:58.989> not<00:00:59.109> be<00:00:59.229> doing

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
want your builders to not be doing

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.979 
want your builders to not be doing
something<00:00:59.649> and<00:00:59.920> if<00:00:59.979> you<00:01:00.100> do<00:01:00.339> its<00:01:01.059> you<00:01:01.719> want<00:01:01.929> it

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
something and if you do its you want it

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.369 
something and if you do its you want it
to<00:01:02.079> be<00:01:02.170> because<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.559> can't<00:01:03.330> and<00:01:04.330> that<00:01:05.080> sounds

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
to be because you can't and that sounds

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.050 
to be because you can't and that sounds
weird<00:01:05.560> but<00:01:05.800> you<00:01:06.310> either<00:01:06.490> want<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:06.880> not<00:01:07.030> have

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
weird but you either want to not have

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.850 
weird but you either want to not have
enough<00:01:07.270> money<00:01:07.660> which<00:01:08.140> means<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.560> want<00:01:08.770> to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
enough money which means you want to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.480 
enough money which means you want to
keep<00:01:09.010> raiding<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.640> get<00:01:09.820> money<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:12.130> want<00:01:12.160> to

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
keep raiding to get money or you want to

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.340 
keep raiding to get money or you want to
have<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.880> like<00:01:13.270> maybe<00:01:13.510> you<00:01:13.660> did<00:01:13.810> an<00:01:13.930> awkward

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
have to like maybe you did an awkward

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.930 
have to like maybe you did an awkward
upgrade<00:01:14.710> where<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.070> was<00:01:15.160> like<00:01:15.310> three<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:15.700> four

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
upgrade where it was like three and four

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.940 
upgrade where it was like three and four
and<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.150> only<00:01:16.300> have<00:01:16.480> one<00:01:16.510> builder<00:01:17.050> and<00:01:17.440> that's

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
and you only have one builder and that's

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.800 
and you only have one builder and that's
understandable<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.670> happens<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.300> during

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
understandable it happens and during

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.460 
understandable it happens and during
that<00:01:19.870> time<00:01:19.990> just<00:01:20.620> hunt<00:01:20.770> rabbits<00:01:21.510> but<00:01:22.510> so<00:01:23.290> the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
that time just hunt rabbits but so the

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.010 
that time just hunt rabbits but so the
trick<00:01:23.680> is<00:01:23.850> very<00:01:24.850> literally<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.540> rate<00:01:25.720> as<00:01:25.870> much

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
trick is very literally to rate as much

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.990 
trick is very literally to rate as much
as<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.260> can<00:01:26.470> get<00:01:26.920> as<00:01:27.070> much<00:01:27.190> money<00:01:27.400> as<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:27.730> can

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
as you can get as much money as you can

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.960 
as you can get as much money as you can
it<00:01:28.240> upgrade<00:01:28.570> as<00:01:28.690> much<00:01:28.840> stuff<00:01:29.080> as<00:01:29.260> you<00:01:29.410> can<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
it upgrade as much stuff as you can and

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.460 
it upgrade as much stuff as you can and
that's<00:01:31.570> basically<00:01:32.140> it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
that's basically it

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.370 
that's basically it
like<00:01:32.940> there's<00:01:33.940> not<00:01:34.210> much<00:01:34.480> more<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.780> this<00:01:35.170> game

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
like there's not much more to this game

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.260 
like there's not much more to this game
than<00:01:35.440> that<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:36.100> mean<00:01:36.460> there's<00:01:36.670> obviously<00:01:37.150> is

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
than that I mean there's obviously is

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.940 
than that I mean there's obviously is
but<00:01:37.480> if<00:01:37.570> you<00:01:37.660> that<00:01:37.900> is<00:01:38.110> leveling<00:01:38.530> up<00:01:38.740> they

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
but if you that is leveling up they

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.820 
but if you that is leveling up they
didn't<00:01:39.280> put<00:01:39.490> like<00:01:39.760> a<00:01:39.910> lot<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.480> stuff<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.560> level

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
didn't put like a lot of stuff to level

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.100 
didn't put like a lot of stuff to level
up<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.970> if<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:43.300> want<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.630> level<00:01:43.780> up<00:01:43.930> you're

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
up so if you want to level up you're
