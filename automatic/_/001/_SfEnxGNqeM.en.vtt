 about what is still a sniper weapon in 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.900

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.400
 sks or his competitor Mosin rifle 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.780
 before we consider them not 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.359
 parts let's go deep 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.890
 its history will begin 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.830
 with the Mosin rifle sample 1891 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.990

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 linear magazine rifle 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.329
 because it is a violation of the Russian 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.780
 the imperial army in 1891 actively 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.059
 used period from 1891 to the end 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.000
 great patriotic war in this 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.410
 period repeatedly modernized 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.690
 three-line name comes from 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.149
 caliber rifle barrel which is equal 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.149

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.079
 equal to 7.62 millimeter rifle based 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.910
 Sample 1891 and its modifications 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.489
 a number of designs were created 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.400
 sporting and hunting weapons like 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.049
 rifled and smoothbore 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.549
 mass characteristics four and a half 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.100
 kilogram length of 1738 millimeters with 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.820
 bayonet one thousand three hundred millimeters without 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.840
 because 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.650
 barrel length 800 millimeters cartridge 762 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.189
 by 54 millimeters or 762

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.710
 per second sighting range 2000 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.659
 after all, there is no dark ammunition 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.740
 shop for 5 rounds and curb 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.290
 clip before open or optical 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.140
 now let's move on to the shotgun from ksk 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.210
 either which previous rifle is equal to 7 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.170
 62 mm self-loading carbine 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.090
 Simonov 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.130
 This is a Soviet self-loading carbine 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.259
 designs by Sergey Simonov 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.880
 your cap was put into service in 1949 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:10.140
 the first copies began to arrive in 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.220
 operative parts in early 1945 this 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.460
 was the only application 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.470
 throne 762 by 39 millimeters in the second 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.360
 world war 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.970
 Characteristics weight three and a half 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.190
 kilogram length of one thousand two hundred 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.750
 sixty millimeters with a thousand bayonet 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.640
 twenty millimeters without a bayonet 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.680
 barrel length five hundred and twenty 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.830
 millimeters chuck 762 by 39 millimeters 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.550
 or 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.980
 762 principle of operation vapor gas exhaust 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.400
 locking the periscope shutter down then 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.300
 I mean, this is a self-loading rate of fire 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.720
 3540 shots per minute 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.390
 initial bullet speed of 735 meters per 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.980
 second sighting range thousand 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.940
 meters 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.060
 maximum range which 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.610
 efficient and equals 400 meters flight 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.790
 bullets is 3,600 meters 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.980
 kind of ammunition coffin clean double row not 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.870
 detachable magazine rechargeable 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.200
 10 rounds 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.120
 sector sight of all this let's 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.280
 we conclude that at short range 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.590
 best copes with 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.900
 because of its rate of fire and killer 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.730
 middle distance same time 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.560
 like a mosin rifle best 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.660
 copes on long distances 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.450
 because of the more powerful destructive power and 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.620
 the presence of an optical sight also 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.330
 greater accuracy 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.670
 playing footage to the goal that you 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.830
 expose yourself so far 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.810
 measures everything 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.709
 footage is set with the page up buttons and 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.050
 page down 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.870
 but in general the main feature is 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.530
 straight hands and convolutions of the head these 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.540
 parts are integral to good shooter 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.580
 As for the component, then this 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.760
 the moment they work is pretty crooked and 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.860
 sense from them almost no bayonet unless 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.310
 that will help the enemy to detect you 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.250
 faster on this let's finish this 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.200
 flashes and next time we'll talk about 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.380
 which gun is better 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.910
 fnx 45 or magnum like and 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.459
 subscribe to the channel ask 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.310
 questions in the comments share video with 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.670
 friends and that 's all good luck
