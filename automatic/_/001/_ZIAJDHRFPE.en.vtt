this case the same for the CL we were

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.910 
this case the same for the CL we were
able<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> use<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> scr<00:01:01.289> after<00:01:01.559> treatment

time over the last 20 years we've had to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.670 
time over the last 20 years we've had to
change<00:01:11.040> engines<00:01:11.360> significantly<00:01:12.560> with<00:01:13.560> the

change engines significantly with the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.999 
change engines significantly with the
addition<00:01:14.009> of<00:01:14.070> electronics<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.110> EGR<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.920> of

addition of electronics and EGR and of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.350 
addition of electronics and EGR and of
course<00:01:17.040> particular<00:01:17.430> filters<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.180> last

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
course particular filters in the last

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.710 
course particular filters in the last
round<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:19.189> 2007-2010<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.939> added<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> scr

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
round in 2007-2010 we have added the scr

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.539 
round in 2007-2010 we have added the scr
after<00:01:21.990> treatment<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.979> engine<00:01:23.369> itself

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
after treatment but the engine itself

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
after treatment but the engine itself
didn't<00:01:24.150> need<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.390> add<00:01:24.479> EGR<00:01:24.960> didn't<00:01:25.350> need<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
didn't need to add EGR didn't need to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.020 
didn't need to add EGR didn't need to
add<00:01:25.650> electronics<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> was<00:01:26.579> already<00:01:26.790> there

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
add electronics it was already there

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.480 
add electronics it was already there
common<00:01:27.689> rail<00:01:27.840> system<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.380> well<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.399> were

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
common rail system as well so we were

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.719 
common rail system as well so we were
able<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.880> focus<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.360> time<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.810> reliability

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
able to focus this time on reliability

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
able to focus this time on reliability
so<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.000> refined<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.869> engine<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.590> as

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
so we have refined this engine to be as

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
so we have refined this engine to be as
well<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.430> cnl<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.600> make<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> run<00:01:37.020> better

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
well as the cnl to make the run better

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.260 
well as the cnl to make the run better
make<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:37.890> run<00:01:37.979> more<00:01:38.189> efficiently<00:01:38.280> better

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
make them run more efficiently better

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.420 
make them run more efficiently better
fuel<00:01:39.570> economy<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:40.649> better<00:01:41.159> customer

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
fuel economy a better customer

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.760 
fuel economy a better customer
experience<00:01:41.700> better<00:01:42.450> drivability<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.590> on

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
experience better drivability and so on

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.399 
experience better drivability and so on
I<00:01:43.979> know<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.579> reliabilities<00:01:45.210> better<00:01:45.450> because

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
I know the reliabilities better because

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.870 
I know the reliabilities better because
of<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> tests<00:01:47.009> experience<00:01:47.520> we've<00:01:47.700> got
