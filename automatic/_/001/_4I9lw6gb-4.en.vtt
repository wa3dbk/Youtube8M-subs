00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
I've actually already recorded this like

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.689 
I've actually already recorded this like
three<00:00:19.050> times<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.070> not<00:00:20.250> been<00:00:20.460> working

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
three times and it's not been working

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.160 
three times and it's not been working
and<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.390> I'm<00:00:21.539> really<00:00:21.779> hoping<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.100> works

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
and so I'm really hoping this one works

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.859 
and so I'm really hoping this one works
so<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.490> wish<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.060> could<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.359> recorded

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
takes a long time to build that freakin

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
takes a long time to build that freakin
staircase<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.219> will<00:00:56.340> see

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
staircase so up there you will see

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.869 
staircase so up there you will see
there's<00:00:56.910> water<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.039> there's<00:00:59.039> four<00:00:59.579> nether

cores that are spawning zombie Pigman

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.369 
cores that are spawning zombie Pigman
infinitely<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.570> zombie<00:01:03.840> pigmen<00:01:04.170> are

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
map I think it's really cool because you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.090 
map I think it's really cool because you
can<00:01:36.780> turn<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.229> straight<00:01:37.619> into<00:01:37.979> your

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
can turn this straight into your

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.760 
can turn this straight into your
survival<00:01:38.970> map<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.229> use<00:01:40.470> this

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
survival map and you can just use this

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.060 
survival map and you can just use this
as<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.189> gold<00:01:41.460> farm<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.740> sometimes<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> find

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
as your gold farm and sometimes you find

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.399 
as your gold farm and sometimes you find
creepers<00:01:44.549> come<00:01:44.790> down<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.270> stuff<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.810> it's

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
creepers come down it and stuff and it's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.030 
creepers come down it and stuff and it's
really<00:01:46.439> cool

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
