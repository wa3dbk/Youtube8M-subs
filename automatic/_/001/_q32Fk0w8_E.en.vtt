country where sport is very important
but<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:22.950> knowledge<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.790> this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
but to my knowledge you don't have this

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.440 
but to my knowledge you don't have this
descent<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.080> excellence<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:26.400> tennis<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
descent of excellence in tennis that you

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.240 
may need to have future success all
right<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.860> holds<00:01:32.130> us<00:01:32.220> back

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
right so what do you think holds us back

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.910

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
because if you look at the way the sport

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.200 
because if you look at the way the sport
has<00:01:35.070> been<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> double<00:01:35.729> side<00:01:35.939> we've<00:01:36.090> had

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600 
singles even though it's a bigger coat
and<00:01:46.110> all<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> sudden<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
and all of a sudden I think is a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.370 
and all of a sudden I think is a
question<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.090> mentality<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
question of mentality you know it's a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.539 
question of mentality you know it's a
question<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.770> approach

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.490 

singles<00:01:53.549> success<00:01:53.940> is<00:01:54.930> obviously<00:01:55.290> more

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
singles success is obviously more

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.740 
singles success is obviously more
difficult<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:57.030> based<00:01:57.270> upon<00:01:57.479> your

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
difficult because it's based upon your

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.120 
difficult because it's based upon your
own<00:01:57.840> shoulders<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.770> cannot<00:01:59.070> share

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
own shoulders you know you cannot share

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100 
own shoulders you know you cannot share
the<00:01:59.490> weight<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.970> cannot<00:02:00.780> share<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the weight you cannot share the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.560 
the weight you cannot share the
responsibility<00:02:01.880> but<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.030> all<00:02:03.180> about<00:02:03.390> how

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
responsibility but it's all about how

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
responsibility but it's all about how
you<00:02:03.600> approach<00:02:04.020> tennis<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> whole<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.400> know
