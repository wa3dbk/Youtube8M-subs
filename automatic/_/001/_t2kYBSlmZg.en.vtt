00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
for themselves what people are looking

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.699 
for themselves what people are looking
for<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.090> practical<00:02:09.090> positive<00:02:09.810> solutions<00:02:10.440> I

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
for is practical positive solutions I

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.539 
for is practical positive solutions I
think<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> time<00:02:12.269> where<00:02:13.459> people<00:02:14.459> are

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
think this is a time where people are

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.780 
think this is a time where people are
starting<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.000> realize<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:16.790> solutions

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
starting to realize that solutions

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.270 
starting to realize that solutions
cannot<00:02:18.299> only<00:02:18.690> come<00:02:19.049> from<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.470> government<00:02:20.099> or

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
cannot only come from the government or

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.500 
cannot only come from the government or
from<00:02:21.049> corporations<00:02:22.049> but<00:02:22.709> it's<00:02:23.220> time<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.849> for

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
from corporations but it's time to for

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.380 
from corporations but it's time to for
people<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.959> do<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:26.459> communities<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:27.030> take

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
people to do and for communities to take

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.410 
people to do and for communities to take
action<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.959> solder<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.709> problems<00:02:29.160> from<00:02:29.420> from

there that we can make serious
difference<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.430> think<00:02:38.850> other<00:02:39.000> people<00:02:39.269> should

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
difference I think other people should

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.030 
difference I think other people should
volunteer<00:02:39.750> for<00:02:40.019> Oxfam<00:02:40.049> because<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.829> great

the work that they do I think the great
thing<00:02:45.060> about<00:02:45.269> volunteering<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.680> you

thing about volunteering is that you

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.370 
thing about volunteering is that you
