we will need to make an adjustment using

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.619 
we will need to make an adjustment using
the<00:01:01.500> barrel<00:01:01.890> adjuster<00:01:02.149> located<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.300> the

the barrel adjuster located on the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.830 
the barrel adjuster located on the
handlebars<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:05.270> use<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.450> barrel<00:01:06.720> adjuster

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
handlebars to use the barrel adjuster

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
handlebars to use the barrel adjuster
you<00:01:07.380> pull<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> barrel<00:01:08.130> adjuster<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.119> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
you pull the barrel adjuster out and you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.370 
you pull the barrel adjuster out and you
will<00:01:09.540> rotate<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.260> either<00:01:10.979> clockwise<00:01:12.380> which

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
will rotate it either clockwise which

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.359 
will rotate it either clockwise which
loosens<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.159> tension<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:15.210> counterclockwise

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
loosens the tension or counterclockwise

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
loosens the tension or counterclockwise
which<00:01:17.369> will<00:01:17.610> tighten<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.390> tension<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
which will tighten the tension of the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.460 
which will tighten the tension of the
cable
