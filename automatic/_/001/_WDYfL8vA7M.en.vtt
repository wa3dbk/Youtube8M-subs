00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.890

 The lentils are eaten meat 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.450
 but not for the many hungry 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.450
 Christians were close to the idea that everyone 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.150

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.570

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.319
 clear 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.359
 meat was especially popular 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.859
 just under a dough lid or in 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.379

 and how about fasting 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.040
 bad habits for example 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.710
 completely renounce 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.340
 let the miserable be excuses or 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:44.270

 The number has symbolic character 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.380
 Again and again she appears in biblical 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.660

 on a special encounter with god
