00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
really the biggest thing is not so much

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.670 
really the biggest thing is not so much
to<00:00:20.369> worry<00:00:20.640> about<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.090> depth<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:22.109> keeping

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
to worry about the depth but keeping

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.519 
to worry about the depth but keeping
your<00:00:22.740> volley<00:00:23.160> low<00:00:23.820> obviously<00:00:24.359> our<00:00:24.990> hand<00:00:25.350> goes

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
your volley low obviously our hand goes

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.970 
your volley low obviously our hand goes
well<00:00:26.130> when<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.369> following<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> idea

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
well when you following have the idea

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.890 
well when you following have the idea
maybe<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.250> taking<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> rock<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.480> take<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> rock

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
maybe like taking a rock or take a rock

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.520 
maybe like taking a rock or take a rock
and<00:00:30.929> skip<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> water

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
and skip it on the water

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.799 
and skip it on the water
see<00:00:34.530> how<00:00:34.620> low<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.160> stays<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.760> kids<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.719> you

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
see how low it stays it's kids if you

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.500 
see how low it stays it's kids if you
can<00:00:37.020> keep<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.230> fully<00:00:37.680> low<00:00:38.239> well<00:00:39.239> their

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
can keep that fully low well their

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.940 
can keep that fully low well their
ground<00:00:39.780> strokes<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.620> higher

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
ground strokes are going to get higher

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.310 
ground strokes are going to get higher
so<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.579> angle<00:00:41.969> them<00:00:42.149> away<00:00:42.390> or<00:00:42.870> their<00:00:43.050> lobs

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
so you can angle them away or their lobs

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.310 
so you can angle them away or their lobs
will<00:00:43.559> get<00:00:43.739> shorter<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.610> smash<00:00:45.320> their

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
will get shorter so you can smash their

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.520 
will get shorter so you can smash their
logs<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.460> probably<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.420> perfect<00:00:48.750> scenarios<00:00:49.260> as

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
logs so probably in perfect scenarios as

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.170 
logs so probably in perfect scenarios as
you<00:00:49.649> come<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.219> net<00:00:50.399> slow<00:00:50.670> down<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
you come up to the net slow down and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660 
you come up to the net slow down and
keep<00:00:51.390> your<00:00:51.750> body<00:00:52.050> low<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.190> don't<00:00:53.489> know

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
keep your body low if you don't know

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.500 
keep your body low if you don't know
where<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> go

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
where to go

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
where to go
keep<00:00:54.840> your<00:00:55.079> volley<00:00:55.350> low<00:00:55.829> because<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.550> way

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
they've got to pick it up off the ground

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.020
