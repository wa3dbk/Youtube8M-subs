00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.840
 the Christmas also arrived exhausted so it sounds a carol in Arabic we are in 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.899
 the primary school of the church of san jorge 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.429
 for two years Christian and Muslim children have shared classrooms 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.789
 center that directs the father in life was only separated from the kind of 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:15.499
 religion 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.499
 this could be the playground of any school in the world 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.630
 children playing and laughing and crazy to appear on the foreign TV 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 but these baghdad 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.070
 the church is surrounded by concrete walls to avoid the attack of a 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.539
 car bomb the christians and neighbors chis of this neighborhood are at the point 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.890
 of al Qaeda 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.270
 mayer military and police presence in the access points and walls of 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.679
 concrete like these are the steps taken by the Christian community 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.069
 part to protect their own and thus avoid massive emigration 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.060
 the authorities require 400 Christian agents to protect churches and 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.339
 convents of the capital 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.329
 the strong migration means that there are no candidates to be priests has become 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.069
 in high risk officer the father was adopted for not raising walls in his 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:07.340
 church thinks that those around her brothers do not want to put up barriers 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330
 oo on the other hand 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.790
 that's why I share 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.950
 to 2010 said this indicated 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.330
 in the parishes and every day the same scene 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.850
 whole families come to ask for their baptism certificates to flee to a 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 safe place 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.600
 It is estimated that six hundred families abandoned the ballot in November 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.860
 December data will be even worse 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.360
 The cause of this exodus is the attack that last October 31 cost life to 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.150
 58 people the church of our lady of salvation in the center 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.270
 from the capital the marks of explosions shots and dried blood the walls 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.870
 they talk about the terror that was lived in this temple 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.040
 but let's go back to school to Christmas carols and Christmas motives 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.040
 Father Nadir reports that this year all activities have been 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.320
 suspended because the situation is critical 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.410
 ee 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.100
 the experiment 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.220
 on the day of the sea 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.699
 he found it 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:14.159
 sometimes you want to influence the silence later on christian 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.029
 weather 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.540
 so we only have to congratulate the children 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.380
 and hope that this small oasis of peace and coexistence that your school moves 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.470
 to the rest of the country a day
