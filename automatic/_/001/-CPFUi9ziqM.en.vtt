 canned meat golden golden cock 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.880
 this means that the top is two identical 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.210
 jars in our long time ago to me them 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.460
 brought 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.830
 or sent means long ago I 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.210
 got then another bank it was worth that 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.140
 46 rubles it was 1 and 3 71 dollar 30 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.030
 cents then let's look at these 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.030
 that bank who are interested we pause 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.829
 I will try to close the glare 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.030
 absolutely two identical cans 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.820
 I speak when opening each new 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.160
 canned chicken some kind of bird what with 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.290
 Soviet, too, to catch such were this 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.080
 there was usually a chicken in its own 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.750
 the bones that is, there was a little bit of skin 20 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.120
 cartilage and boiled bones that can 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.130
 it was to wish that canned were considered 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.170
 far from the best not really not 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.850
 were quoted although there were people who I 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.420
 I even know such a person who is street 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.510
 I loved 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.270
 piss the veins cartilage 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.910
 when we look for meat then basically 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.040
 canned heard of meat they bones here 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.619
 let's try to say here I am no longer 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.300
 once said that here are such canned food 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.000
 if you take somewhere much 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.490
 more convenient than high banks more convenient than 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.320
 They that this immediately us already a plate 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.090
 there is such a plate much more convenient 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.130
 eat wear such a jar like how 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.360
 it’s more convenient to eat the plates of the city from 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.360
 high here 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:37.989
 this is 1 open 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:39.239
 opened this first unload a lot 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.400
 fat 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.890
 he stayed well on the lid so 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.230
 you know if we got along did something 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.980
 some kind of dish then we would have this fat 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:56.530
 used but we are looking at having 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.750
 meat and I'll tell you meat is plus there is 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:07.060
 feeds another carrot question carrot 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:09.420
 row yes it is boiled carrot water from 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.420
 meat 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.050
 guys this is great canned food which 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.080
 very much reminds me of the grotto food but 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.940
 while one to taste like a grotto 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.280
 food only gymnastics by force slightly 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.350
 not saluted in my natural 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.510
 everyone has his own taste and grotto food puts 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:42.569
 whole pieces and there is still but is cut 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:47.570
 here on see pieces of meat shelter it's just 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:54.360
 fine this is a great great chicken 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:04:02.209
 here surely fat is huge 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:02.209
 the amount of meat is a little jelly 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.790
 year 1. I just wanted to say that 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.540
 I don’t see any guests here 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.540
 bone mining 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:31.070
 beautiful canned take the second now 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.870
 the fat you see on the lid stayed there 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:40.280
 we take out a lot of carrots too 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.910
 a thin coat of the same gel and went 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.910
 pieces of meat 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.410
 I do not want to eat fat 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:13.050
 exactly the same 2 canned me 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.420
 it seems here here is meat yes no exactly 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.670
 also chopped up 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:21.390
 here too here is one bone to me 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.880
 caught or none 2 bones here 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:34.890
 but it doesn’t matter how much 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:38.040
 here we see the meat here is another state. 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.800
 learn how I can tell you that the skin 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.140
 there is a little bit of quality 1 canned 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.280
 it turned out a little quality because 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.480
 here we have already gone 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:52.230
 come across and skins and he veins some 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.180
 u probably know how to chop some meat 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.669
 how can a bank get here you can't guess but 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.700
 Nevertheless, here you can 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.590
 excellent hitting and from this can here we are 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:08.040
 just fine and no meat at all 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:10.020
 there are no problems here again I try 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.919
 I assure everything is just fine in general 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.930
 excellent contigo and now of course of course 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:19.950
 what canned water began to do so 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:23.040
 ok and honestly tell by comparison 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.820
 price-quality is naturally where they way 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.760
 I chose 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:30.479
 chicken canned passed not only 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.120
 at least two times on him two three four they 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:37.050
 cheaper than meat they are lately 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.600
 the best quality going dreams and if 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.360
 Here take as what this measure as 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.700
 some kind of reference let's say rolf at the blackboard 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.370
 and canned food because there are whole pieces of meat 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.000
 delicious cooked they lie right 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:55.200
 cans here is entirely 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.390
 naturally i would be here for this stew i would 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.610
 put but strong nine with bold 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.220
 bold plus the only negative here 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.990
 too full of equipment but also there 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.650
 plus the fact that there is little bone and sleep 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.720
 here carrot is just beautiful 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.670
 great concert but actually 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.630
 at this all thank you all for your attention and 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.630
