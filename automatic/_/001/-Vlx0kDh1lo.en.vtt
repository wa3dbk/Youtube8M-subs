00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.920 
so yeah the Rings I'm going to be using
for<00:02:49.329> this<00:02:49.569> scope<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.650> one<00:02:51.450> they're<00:02:52.450> worn

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
for this scope that one they're worn

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.400 
for this scope that one they're worn
quick<00:02:53.200> detach<00:02:53.500> mounts<00:02:54.989> medium<00:02:55.989> height<00:02:56.140> which

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
quick detach mounts medium height which

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.020 
quick detach mounts medium height which
actually<00:02:56.769> probably<00:02:56.890> like<00:02:57.160> too<00:02:57.340> high<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.730> I

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
actually probably like too high that I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.740 
actually probably like too high that I
bought<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.989> wrong<00:02:59.109> ones<00:02:59.319> but<00:02:59.680> oh<00:02:59.769> well<00:03:00.750> shit

happens

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.339 
happens
see<00:03:03.970> I'll<00:03:04.090> get<00:03:04.239> them<00:03:04.359> off<00:03:04.480> when<00:03:04.599> I<00:03:04.629> find<00:03:04.870> X<00:03:05.109> key

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
see I'll get them off when I find X key

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.900 
see I'll get them off when I find X key
which<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.859> cannot<00:03:06.190> find<00:03:06.489> at<00:03:06.819> this<00:03:07.120> current<00:03:07.390> time

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
which I cannot find at this current time

your windage I mean windage elevation

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.800 
your windage I mean windage elevation
and<00:04:04.150> then

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.659 

third<00:04:07.810> one<00:04:08.049> which<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:08.859> reckon<00:04:09.160> is<00:04:09.250> pretty<00:04:09.519> cool

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
third one which I reckon is pretty cool

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.920 
third one which I reckon is pretty cool
personally<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:11.049> your<00:04:11.349> um<00:04:11.970> AO<00:04:12.970> adjustment

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
personally is your um AO adjustment

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.990 
personally is your um AO adjustment
which<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:14.799> flow<00:04:15.099> pretty<00:04:15.280> much<00:04:15.400> basically

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
which is flow pretty much basically

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.089 
which is flow pretty much basically
range<00:04:16.510> like<00:04:17.320> that<00:04:17.500> you're<00:04:17.590> shooting<00:04:17.739> out<00:04:17.979> you

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
range like that you're shooting out you

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.680 
range like that you're shooting out you
just<00:04:18.220> adjust<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.699> so<00:04:18.880> it's<00:04:19.150> focused<00:04:19.510> on<00:04:19.599> that

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
just adjust it so it's focused on that

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.290 
just adjust it so it's focused on that
range<00:04:19.930> do<00:04:20.769> these<00:04:20.950> parallax<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.640> stuff

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
range do these parallax and stuff

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.430 
range do these parallax and stuff
and<00:04:25.300> yes<00:04:26.170> but<00:04:26.440> it<00:04:26.530> works<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:28.020> those<00:04:29.020> easy<00:04:29.380> to

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
and yes but it works and those easy to

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.909 
and yes but it works and those easy to
use<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.010> one<00:04:30.160> which<00:04:30.340> is<00:04:30.370> on<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:31.500> end<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.800> the

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
use the one which is on the end to the

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.980 
use the one which is on the end to the
scope<00:04:33.220> like<00:04:33.639> every<00:04:34.300> other<00:04:34.360> arrivals<00:04:34.840> got

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
scope like every other arrivals got

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.290 
scope like every other arrivals got
known<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.440> man<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:36.639> yeah<00:04:36.760> that's<00:04:36.970> that's<00:04:39.300> power

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
known to man so yeah that's that's power

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.670 
known to man so yeah that's that's power
adjustment<00:04:40.810> it's<00:04:40.930> four<00:04:41.080> point<00:04:41.260> five<00:04:41.380> to

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
adjustment it's four point five to

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.230 
adjustment it's four point five to
fourteen<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.370> there's<00:04:42.700> a<00:04:42.760> little<00:04:43.000> dot<00:04:43.180> there

robbery<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:30.940> stuff<00:05:32.160> moving<00:05:33.160> on<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.850> reticle

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
robbery and stuff moving on the reticle

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.760 
robbery and stuff moving on the reticle
let's<00:05:34.600> see<00:05:34.720> if<00:05:34.960> we<00:05:35.020> can<00:05:35.140> get<00:05:35.290> a<00:05:35.320> good<00:05:35.440> look<00:05:35.500> at

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
let's see if we can get a good look at

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.340 
let's see if we can get a good look at
that<00:05:35.919> zoom<00:05:36.760> in<00:05:36.970> obviously<00:05:37.870> it's<00:05:38.050> a<00:05:38.110> better

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
that zoom in obviously it's a better

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.440 
that zoom in obviously it's a better
clearer<00:05:38.830> picture<00:05:39.250> than<00:05:39.430> this<00:05:39.580> this<00:05:40.180> is<00:05:40.240> not<00:05:40.419> a

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
clearer picture than this this is not a

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.200 
clearer picture than this this is not a
