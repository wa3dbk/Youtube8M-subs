cannoneer again this one also works over

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.420 
cannoneer again this one also works over
kindling<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.599> it<00:02:31.140> has<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.470> burn<00:02:31.709> effect<00:02:32.040> so

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430

this makes the decks basically start the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.530 
this makes the decks basically start the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
fire and with handmade and it just

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.050 
fire and with handmade and it just
everything<00:03:33.989> goes<00:03:37.310> along<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.340> trip<00:03:38.790> over

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
everything goes along the trip over

everything goes along the trip over
kindling<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.840> makes<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.199> deck<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.919> lot<00:03:41.519> more

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
kindling it makes the deck a lot more

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:49.069 
kindling it makes the deck a lot more
viable<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.959> those<00:03:46.260> are<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:47.690> guess<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.720> six

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
because everything in the deck is fire

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.450 
because everything in the deck is fire
so<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.450> lot<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.750> decks<00:04:53.200> are<00:04:53.500> very<00:04:54.070> relying

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
so and a lot of decks are very relying

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.700 
so and a lot of decks are very relying
on<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.670> graveyard<00:04:55.260> except<00:04:56.260> for<00:04:56.290> those<00:04:56.470> that

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
are like macro based so this is really

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.880
