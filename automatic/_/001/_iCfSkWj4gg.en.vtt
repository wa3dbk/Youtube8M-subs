00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.139
 hi everyone here in more hams 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.070
 welcome to a new video tutorial 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.349
 about insects this time 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.900
 I will show how to make the insect 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.600
 old man but first let's review some 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.210
 basic things about the 15 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.830
 what are the final concepts are 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.680
 It reaches them when they bug 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.540
 weapon is at level 10 there are four 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.760
 types of final insects that deliver 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.500
 specific skills to the serious 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.270
 the first the balanced that is the one 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.309
 let's make today the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.020
 second of power resistance that we did 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.970
 in the previous video the power 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.950
 speed and the speed of resistance 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.810
 the characteristics of this insect 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.850
 balanced are that you can send 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.000
 up to 8 times therefore has a 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.010
 great resistance does a lot of damage to 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.590
 hit therefore can be used 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.840
 to break some part of the enemy the 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.540
 green extract heals the states 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.000
 altered can have two extracts to the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.190
 time in the insect or you can 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.660
 get the red juice out of your head and 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.490
 then send it to the legs for the 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.270
 white and both will arrive at the same 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.770
 time saving not long time 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.440
 you will recover a lot of life with the extract 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.660
 green usually have the same 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.700
 power that a megafusion so you 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.590
 you can heal constantly with this 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.869
 insect 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.479
 what do I need to create this insect 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:39.189
 balanced a slight insect with the bug 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:43.079
 at level 154 energy nectar 36 nectar 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.189
 of speed and 16 nectar of resistance 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.009
 remember that nectar is what 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.260
 2 more say what can be seen there and 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.080
 they are bought with the wic nobody 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.850
 that the insect must evolve 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.770
 any insect of any law can 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.900
 evolve to one of four ways 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.570
 the only requirement is that the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.970
 bug be level 1 for that the best 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.670
 is to create the weapon directly in the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.580
 let's start then let's see now 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.580
 how the balanced insect is created 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.770
 let's start then to create the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.960
 balanced concept let's start 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:27.190
 going to the armory and we're going to buy 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.620
 bone blake 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.090
 is level 1 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.709
 remember that you can do it 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.780
 with any law that they believe in the 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.040
 armory the only requirement is that the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.159
 bug be level 1 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.150
 and here we go to the law and now we 're going to 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.310
 to get better 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.030
 then we must follow the next 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.340
 sequence to the letter 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.510
 The first thing you will give the insect is 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:59.060
 4 nectar of resistance 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.240
 1 2 3 4 and then there are 19 of power so 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.370
 let's count 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.720
 we give you the 4 resistors and now the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.510
 of energy 1234 remember that when 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.550
 sound zinc have to evolve the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.770
 soul 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.770
 we take to 4 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.959
 I'm going to show you the little bug we're 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.959
 doing there is 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.070
 let's say 4 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:36.340
 5 6 7 8 9 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.340
 I do not know, I do not know 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.379
 we do not evolve 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:49.780
 13 14 15 16 17 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.329
 18 and 19 and we have to fill with 12 of 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.730
 speed here we're going to spend the chin 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.440
 let's do one plus one 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.330
 two 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.330
 and now we evolve insects 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.530
 notice that there are two options a liter 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.080
 and the christ melian we have to 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.650
 follow the middle christ 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.520
 ok we follow the second part 4 of 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.889
 resistance 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.939
 2. 3. 4 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:28.310
 and 12 of power 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:28.310
 12 123 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.000
 we evolved 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.289
 Four. Five 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.289
 Out of 8 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:46.169
 a 9 10 11 12 and the last two that 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.539
 we have to place are speed 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.539
 1 and we spent the chin 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:02.750
 and there we get a single insect that is 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.750
 ciro but there the good 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.309
 we evolved to the chiropter 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.309
 and we go on 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.430
 we have to give 8 resistance 1 2 3 4 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.430
 5 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.710
 678 and then we start with those of 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.030
 power that are 23 so we started to 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.030
 count 1 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.690
 456 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:50.560
 7 8 9 10 11 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.560
 12 13 14 15 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:01.070
 6 17 18 19 20 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.170
 21 22 23 and there we finished giving him the 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.860
 all-star of power now we have to 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.860
 continue with the speed ones that are 4 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.860
 12 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.900
 a father 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:21.700
 and there we have the great terol turn 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.390
 and if we go to the skills look 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.280
 says that I bug all the states more 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.710
 more extract of recovery state and 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.230
 storage of extracts more work 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.320
 then here we have created our 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:38.729
 balanced insect are fixed there 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.580
 can see the skills 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:43.589
 what to evolve and now the only thing 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.440
 have to do is go filling with 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:50.120
 speed up to the maximum 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.120
 I do not know we start with speed 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.590
 There are 28 in total 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.760
 we revolutionized 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.500
 we continue giving 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.870
 and speed nectar 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.190
 and obviously we reach the end of the 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.840
 evolution can no longer continue to rise 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.120
 of level 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.810
 so here we have our insect 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.800
 balanced with 150 energy 84's 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:27.000
 resistance and 126 speed with the 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.040
 skill of the hundreds of I said 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.610
 previously 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.640
 has the possibility of extracting two 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:37.860
 liquids or fluids at the same time 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.890
 green liquid will bring us back to life 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.630
 as a mega emotion and also the 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.120
 green liquid will cure us from the 

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.100
 altered states I hope there's 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.080
 understood and you liked this new 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.910
 tutorial on which insects that are 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.910
 super well take care bye
