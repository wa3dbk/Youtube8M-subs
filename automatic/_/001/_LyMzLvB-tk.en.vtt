00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.750
 all the best time of the day with you 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.890
 again cities and in this video we are with you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.550
 let's talk 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.890
 as you guessed about the game witcher 3 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.980
 wild Hunt 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:29.250
 exactly about in those areas territories on 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:31.779
 which will be the action of the game 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.720
 information directly from the developers and and 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:40.380
 of course small and most of the fans 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.380
 already know for everyone else 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.500
 I tell and so on 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.500
 areas will be 3 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.239
 in the main 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:59.430
 when the area is ravaged lands on 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.430
 the map is marked with a red arrow 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.320
 Skellige Islands 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.000
 blue arrow and new city capital 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.670
 Denmark this green arrow well let's 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.930
 in order 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.380
 as you already know everything 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.680
 the game world will be 30 times more than in 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.740
 the second witch 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.130
 it is very pleased this open world if 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.929
 they are recognized by the developers and rather 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.220
 all they do it because the Poles 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:35.060
 keep their words 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.060
 let's about 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.530
 first big locations 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.280
 just ruined land 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.549
 you will laugh I am of course a little bit 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.479
 neighing in one of the videos if you watched 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.810
 this reflection on the theme of the game witcher 3 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.240
 I just assumed that the imperial 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.140
 the troops just by going and arm move 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.140
 by the simplest 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.170
 profitable long-distance path they just go 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.600
 in Kemer 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.989
 so it finally happened 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.250
 the game will take place later 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:21.200
 half a year after they invaded 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:27.290
 the northern kingdom that is ruined 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.290
 several small kingdoms 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:36.120
 actually occupied the whole theory and not 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.100
 occupied the valley of the panther and now this whole 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.140
 here is a big territory te world plus 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.030
 adjoining kingdom is the first 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.200
 huge location is wasteland or know 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.200
 whatever you want to call 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.299
 so 2 is soon the islands skelege 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.650
 all islands there are 7 and by the way in on 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.120
 each of them can be visited but 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.629
 major events will naturally be 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.400
 happen the biggest islands themselves 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.709
 can read on the map as not 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:20.200
 called the lie on the liar 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:23.659
 but not the essence here friend saying such 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.120
 fantasy on the theme of the Scandinavian legends 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.299
 there we will see something like 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.590
 Vikings with their problems that we and 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:38.440
 you and geralt will have to decide 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:44.050
 and the third finally big location is 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.640
 navigate my game from the capital of reed is not like 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.319
 the developers themselves admitted huge 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.080
 the city is not just a city is a port city 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.620
 again the number of tasks of the test and 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.519
 everything else there is a lot and 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:06.110
 let's talk more about 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:09.530
 settlements what they will be ie table 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.280
 like skyrim either as in other games deal 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.519
 in that big city here 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:20.630
 Naturally 1 is 0 and hail everything else 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.210
 This small settlement of qi fortress 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.470
 type fleet for my old parts you remember 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.210
 yes there is a completely small location not 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.260
 know a little comparison than not 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.940
 compare and that's another will 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.860
 attend 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.439
 village 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:43.360
 of the heat, and that sort of thing 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:46.780
 so about the movement of this 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:52.000
 locations like any self-respecting 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.990
 the game that it uses the concept of 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.719
 open world travel to famous 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.960
 location will be either on foot or on horseback 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:04.319
 Konyashki but getting 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.479
 having been to the location once we can 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:10.560
 move there quickly yes by the way 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.449
 only on konyashki as here 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.439
 present island and we have 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.810
 port city is huge that is and we will 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:22.629
 boat or ship and yes 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.020
 one more such interesting moment 1 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.930
 now having claus but not only swim 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.300
 here 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.690
 can crash through the rock fall 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.449
 and there are no closed locations that means you 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.120
 remember how in the first part there through 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.370
 the fence does could not jump over and no 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.710
 now you can jump over the fence 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:49.820
 her anything to do so about what it is 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.690
 I am well, I lost the idea immediately for her 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.039
 tail grabbed 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.710
 about these fast movements 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.940
 the developers said so guys you 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.570
 can use fast 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.020
 movements if you want completely 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.750
 explore the world more fully imagine 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:11.660
 all you have to do 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:15.440
 it is better to move as though 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:18.470
 uncharted places after all or on foot 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:23.419
 or on horseback otherwise you are not 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:26.330
 be able to open some nishtyaki all 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:29.210
 the rest is nonsense and plus in quality 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.699
 bonus they let slip that now 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.889
 the level of heralt is like in the second 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:36.590
 Witcher 3 hoe limited now he 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:39.740
 it can be upgraded to level 60 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.349
 accordingly to pump up to such 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.860
 degree naturally have to climb on 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:46.099
 the world 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:50.639
 but about 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:53.520
 as I said, these are the three main locations 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:56.729
 in fact, these locations will be 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.949
 broken into sub locations yes i mean this is not 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:02.969
 just there they gave you these 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:05.610
 desert land there went out to the field i 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:08.389
 shit far see me no they will 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:12.539
 broken down into some of their land 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:16.889
 for example there like amd forest then I don't know 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:19.169
 there ruined villages themselves understand 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:21.900
 here I am starting in the realm of fantasy 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:27.090
 leave because all this is like 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:29.460
 trade secret and developers can 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:33.080
 say we can not but still here is 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.729
 that they have already voiced just wonderful 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:40.500
 Here we seem to be all that I wanted 

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:44.849
 say everybody thanks for the wiretapping there 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:47.810
 viewing it is not with you was all gorynych 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:47.810
 happily bye
