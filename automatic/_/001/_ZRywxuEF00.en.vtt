 armored the biggest the most 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.309
 robust and imposing or as vulgarly 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:18.100
 we know them the narco 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.930
 vans so these trucks the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.820
 I put for when you are ingesting 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.920
 online and we like to take this type 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.020
 of trucks and go on how to go in 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.390
 caravan and do many things inside the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.460
 game is worth mentioning that I will not put 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.710
 in this top the most expensive trucks ni 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.020
 the most luxurious or the fastest as 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.420
 is the case of the range rover evoke as 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.760
 is the Mercedes 6 x 6 that is one of the most 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.340
 faces of the game or like the vans 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.410
 faster than we already said it is 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.960
 the bentley then all these 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.790
 Trucks luxurious and fast faces no 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.980
 they will enter this top since in that 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.230
 sector, we are focusing on the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.680
 armored and impressive inside 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.680
 of the game 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.540
 [Music] 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.189
 very well then for the position number 5 and 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.100
 opening the top we will have the 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.049
 cadillac viejita who is one of the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.030
 best vans out there for this 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.220
 kind of how do I tell them shielded inside 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.590
 of the game and that is used a lot in kind of 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.600
 escorts as you can see the spotlights are 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.850
 of the main reference that we have 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.649
 in this truck since the lights are 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.320
 type a range rovers 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.780
 the back is super super sexy and 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.850
 has many things to modify see 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.380
 the bulbs that I tell them the grill me 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.690
 here I changed it I put this grill 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.509
 Honeycomb type to make it look like more 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.369
 swag with more style and also if we are going to 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.170
 have a super armored truck 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.479
 we need to have this kind of wheels 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.729
 off-road to make it much more 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.830
 the personality of the truck by the 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.689
 back and more aesthetically a 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.750
 of the best ones because as you can see 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.939
 it is totally modified it has four 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.009
 mobile phones that make it very sporty and 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.220
 part of the rear bumper looks like 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.439
 raised kind something very tuning so 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.000
 the truck is is amazing to 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.500
 take it out and go in caravan with friends 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.500
 [Music] 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.160
 for number 4 I have decided to put the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.830
 all-terrain bad pit xl that for me in what 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.720
 staff is the best pick up there is 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.640
 inside the game for me is the best 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.410
 pick up that inside the game and 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.690
 visually also this truck and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.450
 I find it imposes no longer the most 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.090
 big and the longest but it was like that before 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.980
 and that's why I decided to leave it the bad of this 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.750
 and many truck is not used and 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.520
 which it is now very few people are 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.920
 having this truck so that does 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.320
 that the classification of the top 5 goes down 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.600
 as much as number 4 but this 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.430
 truck aesthetically as I say 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.070
 as you can see on the screen is 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.750
 of the best from the largest and 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.180
 best of all is that these and area 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.069
 off-road we could pass 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.050
 any river we can enter 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.030
 any small lake and our 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.890
 truck will continue to work not 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.709
 we're going to have to worry about the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.680
 tires break or because the engine 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.060
 stop working this SUV is of 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.010
 the best there is 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.989
 [Music] 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.780
 and in number 4 is one of my 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.689
 favorites in real life the cadillac 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.280
 scale unfortunately here in gt5 not 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.069
 is one of the newest as you can see the 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.930
 design but it is much more recent than 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.269
 the first cadillac we saw in the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.000
 put number 5 the main difference 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.920
 is the grill as you can see how 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.540
 you can see also the headlights are already kind 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.780
 leds are no longer like the others that were 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.280
 of xenon and the skulls are 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.900
 polarized that means that the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.120
 Most sports cars have 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.099
 these skulls type polarized like 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.890
 can see they look a little darker 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.409
 blackest has four mufflers what 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.180
 makes the truck very sporty already 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.430
 that runs too much from eight cylinders 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.760
 and what I like most about this truck 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.180
 is that it's not like tuned type has 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.560
 too much elegance is a truck 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.720
 executive and if you want to walk in 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.400
 escorts are caravans these are from the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.469
 main projects that should be 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.469
 [Music] 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.290
 for the 'number two' we have another 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.900
 truck that non- standard with arc 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.120
 truck but it has too much style and 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.400
 presence and most players 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.790
 in gta online we have this truck 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.430
 I'm talking about the 4x4 hello 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.500
 mercedes that the mercedes in real life 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.020
 it's the most expensive cards there 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.610
 is what we are seeing here and has what 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.139
 What I like most about this truck is 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.450
 that we can customize it to our 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.220
 taste from the vans that most 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.260
 They can customize because up to you 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.419
 we can put a snorkel tube that 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.700
 I honestly do not know for it to work very 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.440
 ok but I guess there must be something 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.780
 as to when the lakes metamos 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.820
 or the marshes take it from above in 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.669
 from below but as you can see 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.490
 this truck is very very good when 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.740
 the wear shield is 100% of the 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.720
 best that resists with the bumpers 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.490
 I would like the fog lights to 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.410
 I could light it so it would look a lot 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.200
 better and how you can be seeing in the 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.360
 tomas is an all-rounder here to 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.370
 Then they will see as a step one 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.620
 some barriers that with any car there 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.610
 it would happen to us but this truck with only 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.580
 speed up a bit 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.400
 it's going to overtake us so it adopts 4x4 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.210
 is among the best and we will see now 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.210
 the number one 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.789
 and for the best truck of this top 5 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.400
 the best narco truck the best 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.219
 armored the most impotent we are going to have 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.460
 that they discovered what in real life 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:46.409
 is the dodge durango in real life not 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.180
 I like it as much as here in yettaw line 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.250
 but it is that here in online card you have 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.590
 put several other characteristics 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.780
 trucks that do this for me the 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.479
 better as you can see the truck is 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.610
 super super sports because he has the 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.979
 most of all the wheels have 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.020
 woman or dynamic lines and especially 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.509
 What I like most about this truck is 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.750
 which is the largest and longest 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:12.210
 heavy and I'm not getting bored so 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.219
 normal think please as you can see 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.600
 in the shots the truck is very long and 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.540
 big 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.760
 robot is robustly amazing is 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.030
 impotent is given 100% yes it is 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.640
 very difficult that the tv has the part 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.220
 main that is the front very 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.670
 sports with those xenon headlights with 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.250
 those sports air intakes have the 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.020
 very large wheels as you can see from 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.180
 the few trucks that you can 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.100
 put luxury wheels that accommodate 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.740
 perfectly to the lines of the 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.330
 original truck has its details of 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.180
 the engraving that as I tell you is the 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.730
 durango and in the back I think 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.800
 something incredible that the skulls are 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.660
 one of the most prestigious brands in 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.940
 cars as you can see if you already 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.500
 they know from cars those skulls are from 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.410
 any baby w 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.230
 any bmw or either truck or car 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.000
 has that kind of skulls and in the 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.370
 part of the exhaust 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.560
 we have two or two exhaust outlets that 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.960
 They are rectangular so they fit for 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.790
 that is more with the sporty design and 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.340
 with the tinted windows this 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.410
 truck is amazing but in color 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.060
 horrible from china I retina but it's 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.610
 I already had a lot of vans in mate 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.190
 black or white or cream and I wanted 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.170
 give something different to this truck like this 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.600
 how good these have been five o'clock 

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.160
 best narco trucks or vans 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.080
 armored as they want to call for 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.150
 me online do you tell me in the 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.430
 comments what do you think if such 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.950
 they would have put another one in the top 5 if 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.960
 all the ones that I put in agree or 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.150
 they would have put a few more or more 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.680
