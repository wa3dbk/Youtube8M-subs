00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.610
 characters dag a nostalgic 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:11.099
 criticism the next critic yes I remember 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.019
 this guy met him once on 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.780
 when I looked for people according to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.609
 participate in an orgy at the cemetery no matter how 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.119
 Strange wishing it turned out not so 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.050
 lot 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.430
 and so he came up to ask me something 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.570
 said he was looking for where to find 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.070
 any loving 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.289
 to talk about everything 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 crazy pinchuk because throughout 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.750
 visibility people on the internet love it and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.670
 answered this is a very good question though 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.530
 technically it was not a question 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.070
 least I pointed a few to the bar that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.960
 was further along the road means I'm sitting behind 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.620
 stand and this guy walks in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.620
 nostalgic critic 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:56.129
 you will not show pictures and so 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.020
 look here and sorry so here it is 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.940
 comes in and says that he is looking for something 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.539
 Kincheva who could show on 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.479
 your website on the Internet 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.400
 probably once the internet is logical well 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.110
 ok and so he says he needs 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.330
 anyone who will expose themselves 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.790
 idiot on camera because viewers are 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.920
 love i tell him you can of course 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.810
 search here but most of the stories 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.180
 who tell local visitors 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.689
 rather sad than funny or at least 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.210
 fascinating so i say if you 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.970
 You are looking for someone who can do for free 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.939
 be very funny though you are small 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.479
 sad little bit funny anyway 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.950
 there is one begging at the entrance 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.840
 Mr. Discovery approached me when I 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.159
 got over and health from the car in the box 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.340
 from his milk and said he was looking 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.119
 someone intelligent and abstruse 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.500
 thinking 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.630
 Well, I said thank you for the offer at night 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.130
 I will have to say he answered 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.799
 movies and I decided to fall down a little I thought 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.920
 for 2 seconds i like talking about movies 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.380
 but even more I love where it's warm 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.810
 at the best told what will happen 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.290
 pay me and pay you a whole bunch 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.360
 grandmas, I immediately realized that he was already 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.940
 it certainly was enemies 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.650
 by this he liked me he heard that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.780
 not very kind to this madness 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.060
 marvel at your family and probably not 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.920
 it was worth their friends he said that they pay 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.569
 not for the waste of oxygen but the more I about 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.300
 I think the more I think that 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.040
 this joke is too cheap and then he 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.700
 comes back and asks if I want 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.340
 I told myself my own show I said that as 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.330
 for me, I don't understand 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.569
 the most suitable person for the internet but 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.030
 he said to this dance come off you know 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.390
 a bit like me but I don't think that 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.450
 someone will notice me never 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.810
 did we ask relatives 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.400
 or why we are so similar and have never really 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.590
 of course this is not the only question 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.420
 which I get again and again every time 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.130
 when I drop in a box because of what you 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.410
 just want to take and strangle it 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.329
 scum 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.430
 pma place the critic has been very persuasive 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.760
 he fooled me easily and pulled in 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.730
 different adventures 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.109
 such as searches and in fact one of the Necronomicon 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.109
 that name scares the hell out of me 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.480
 sorry he was not the best feeling 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.870
 style he seemed to have decided we started them 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.090
 look like professionals but then 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.819
 changed his mind many may remember him as 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.030
 cold cynical dark man 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.639
 but as for me he was still he believed 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.469
 you need to give your daughter probably if he did not 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.959
 I could not tell in the whole story 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:49.540
 I have a great feeling in your country 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.599
 style i took off all this scab clothes 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.219
 and for some reason all these characters never 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.139
 guess what it is not worth me everything 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:58.599
 told infuriated doesn't know about it 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.760
 we don't understand the site and I know what you mean 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.900
 think hugh hefner after all did not die before he died 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.329
 the hero used the secret and always 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.430
 I remember the feeling of pain and numbness 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:15.099
 causal place is actually around 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.810
 tells his zone observant that i 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.959
 I remember from this conversation he measured 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.210
 Lenk gaze sitting corner and asked 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.919
 what do you think the medius he would look like 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.120
 green skirt I said so 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.650
 really think that man 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.030
 making a living this way 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.910
 could die in our world 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.280
 And not at the hands of the envious, of course not a 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.770
 then this horrible acted terrifying 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.000
 reality in a way that never 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.000
 blur out of our memory 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.889
 I suppose to apologize for what I 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.900
 married one of his rabbits but no 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.750
 not one of those attracts women she 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.389
 real rabbits he will be worth 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.889

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:01.300

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.009
 absolutely everything i still visit the dock 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.169
 most of all instead of Rome critics me 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:10.030
 I remember how much he did not 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:12.849
 I liked it and did not know that I can 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.560
 hate at all i remember one more 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.560
 weird he came again I ordered 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.690
 special containing criticism not I asked 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.210
 what kind of a nostalgic radish 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.250
 and he answered I know that this is which 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.280
 almost entirely of alcohol and forbidden 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.740
 almost all for the day live people are not 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.479

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.820
 i said i won't work with him yet 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:39.009
 didn't get a plan and then he said that 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.300
 he has a magical moon drink which 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.639
 made me in front 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:48.669

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.969

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:57.539

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.310
 in my body 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.810
