in<00:02:13.920> front<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.190> me<00:02:14.280> now<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.910> course<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.630> makes

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
in front of me now of course that makes

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.050 
in front of me now of course that makes
the<00:02:16.050> text<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.470> little<00:02:16.560> bit<00:02:16.830> smaller<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.490> if<00:02:17.940> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
the text a little bit smaller so if I

really want to see something it makes it
a<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:20.400> bit<00:02:20.580> harder<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.180> I'd<00:02:21.270> want<00:02:21.570> to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
a little bit harder so I'd want to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.230 
a little bit harder so I'd want to
double<00:02:21.960> tap<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.500> then<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.700> zoom<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.210> and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
double tap and then I can zoom in and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.330 
double tap and then I can zoom in and
really<00:02:24.810> start<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.320> read<00:02:25.560> everything<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.130> see

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
really start to read everything and see

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.990 
really start to read everything and see
those<00:02:26.490> pictures<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:28.050> even<00:02:28.760> pinch<00:02:29.760> and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
those pictures and I can even pinch and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.120 
those pictures and I can even pinch and
zoom<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> little<00:02:30.630> bit<00:02:30.780> further<00:02:31.080> even<00:02:31.950> though

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
zoom in a little bit further even though

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.160 
zoom in a little bit further even though
it<00:02:32.160> does<00:02:32.850> start<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.180> pixelate<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.750> little<00:02:34.050> bit

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
it does start to pixelate a little bit

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.200 
it does start to pixelate a little bit
if<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.380> go<00:02:34.560> too<00:02:34.620> far<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.610> that's<00:02:35.790> not<00:02:35.910> really

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
if you go too far but that's not really

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.830 
if you go too far but that's not really
that<00:02:36.330> bad<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:38.100> typically<00:02:39.090> looks<00:02:39.180> pretty<00:02:39.630> good

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
that bad it typically looks pretty good

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:49.070 
that bad it typically looks pretty good
so<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.370> tap<00:02:44.580> twice<00:02:45.980> zooms<00:02:46.980> man<00:02:47.840> tap<00:02:48.840> twice

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
so I can tap twice zooms man tap twice

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.250 
so I can tap twice zooms man tap twice
again<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:49.680> back<00:02:49.920> tap<00:02:50.370> once<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.090> i've<00:02:52.050> got
