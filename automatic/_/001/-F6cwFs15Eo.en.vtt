00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
I've been using these the same amps for

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.179 
I've been using these the same amps for
God<00:00:17.440> since<00:00:18.310> 1996<00:00:19.210> I<00:00:19.450> guess<00:00:19.780> I<00:00:19.990> met<00:00:20.530> Steve<00:00:20.800> Frey

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
God since 1996 I guess I met Steve Frey

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.300 
God since 1996 I guess I met Steve Frey
at<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.740> company<00:00:24.070> was<00:00:24.189> formerly<00:00:24.670> called<00:00:24.700> VHT

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
at this company was formerly called VHT

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.150 
at this company was formerly called VHT
which<00:00:27.310> we<00:00:27.630> referred<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.780> as<00:00:28.930> very<00:00:29.560> huge<00:00:29.830> tits

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
which we referred to as very huge tits

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.440 
which we referred to as very huge tits
but<00:00:30.400> I<00:00:30.460> think<00:00:30.730> it<00:00:30.789> was<00:00:30.910> actually<00:00:31.060> valve

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
but I think it was actually valve

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.500 
but I think it was actually valve
harmonic<00:00:31.960> technology<00:00:32.559> um<00:00:33.400> but<00:00:34.239> I<00:00:34.270> thought

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
harmonic technology um but I thought

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.210 
harmonic technology um but I thought
very<00:00:35.050> huge<00:00:35.170> tits<00:00:35.440> was<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:35.620> better<00:00:35.830> name<00:00:36.010> for<00:00:36.040> the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
very huge tits was a better name for the

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.770 
very huge tits was a better name for the
company<00:00:36.580> and<00:00:36.760> it<00:00:36.820> would<00:00:36.910> have<00:00:37.030> been<00:00:37.120> huge<00:00:37.480> if

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
company and it would have been huge if

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.799 
company and it would have been huge if
he<00:00:37.900> had<00:00:37.989> taken<00:00:38.320> my<00:00:38.559> advice<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:40.120> he<00:00:40.330> lost<00:00:40.660> his

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
he had taken my advice but he lost his

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.890

with six bang graphic EQ which I

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.469 
with six bang graphic EQ which I
utilized<00:00:55.930> for<00:00:56.229> feedback<00:00:56.530> things<00:00:57.489> mostly<00:00:57.970> it's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
utilized for feedback things mostly it's

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.060 
utilized for feedback things mostly it's
because<00:00:58.690> it's<00:00:58.809> awesome<00:00:59.650> you<00:00:59.710> could<00:00:59.890> pick

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
because it's awesome you could pick

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.670 
because it's awesome you could pick
different<00:01:00.820> frequencies<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:01.629> boost<00:01:02.409> or<00:01:02.650> cut

different frequencies and boost or cut
et<00:01:03.129> cetera<00:01:03.309> and<00:01:04.089> then<00:01:04.299> it's<00:01:04.540> tuned<00:01:05.470> for<00:01:05.740> a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
et cetera and then it's tuned for a

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.110 
et cetera and then it's tuned for a
guitar<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.520> know<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:08.080> opposed<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.620> you<00:01:09.070> know

it's<00:01:12.970> great<00:01:13.119> and<00:01:13.450> some<00:01:13.570> great<00:01:13.750> EQ<00:01:14.320> it's<00:01:15.010> three

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
it's great and some great EQ it's three

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.110 
it's great and some great EQ it's three
channels<00:01:15.610> I<00:01:16.479> use<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:17.050> clean<00:01:17.320> channel<00:01:17.740> on<00:01:18.700> just

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
channels I use the clean channel on just

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.270 
channels I use the clean channel on just
a<00:01:19.210> couple<00:01:19.330> of<00:01:19.570> tunes<00:01:19.750> it's<00:01:20.080> a<00:01:20.170> very<00:01:20.380> percussive

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
a couple of tunes it's a very percussive

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.120 
a couple of tunes it's a very percussive
clean<00:01:21.820> channel<00:01:22.300> so<00:01:22.450> it's<00:01:22.570> not<00:01:22.720> good<00:01:22.990> for<00:01:23.130> soft

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
clean channel so it's not good for soft

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.820 
clean channel so it's not good for soft
stuff<00:01:24.490> like<00:01:24.790> anything<00:01:25.150> jazzy<00:01:25.690> I<00:01:25.900> don't<00:01:26.200> and

stuff like anything jazzy I don't and
it's<00:01:26.950> not<00:01:27.130> made<00:01:27.370> for<00:01:27.580> anything<00:01:27.910> like<00:01:28.120> that<00:01:28.180> at

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
it's not made for anything like that at

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.000 
it's not made for anything like that at
all<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.660> couldn't<00:01:29.020> play<00:01:29.200> jazz<00:01:29.470> through<00:01:29.830> it<00:01:29.950> I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
all I couldn't play jazz through it I

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.500 
all I couldn't play jazz through it I
might<00:01:30.130> could<00:01:30.370> it<00:01:30.580> just<00:01:30.670> doesn't<00:01:31.060> have<00:01:31.480> the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
might could it just doesn't have the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.410 
might could it just doesn't have the
warmth<00:01:32.020> because<00:01:32.560> it's<00:01:33.100> very<00:01:33.280> percussive<00:01:33.580> but

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
warmth because it's very percussive but

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.820 
warmth because it's very percussive but
I<00:01:34.480> use<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.690> for<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.870> song<00:01:35.110> enemies<00:01:35.530> in<00:01:35.740> the

know<00:02:09.909> the<00:02:10.569> whammy<00:02:10.899> pedal<00:02:10.929> yeah<00:02:11.680> but<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.430> mxr

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
know the whammy pedal yeah but the mxr

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.839 
know the whammy pedal yeah but the mxr
is<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.870> know<00:02:13.989> just<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.620> big<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.700> base

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
is you know just this big in the base

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.259 
is you know just this big in the base
acapella<00:02:16.629> sounds<00:02:17.080> great<00:02:17.319> so<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:20.050> then<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:21.370> used

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
acapella sounds great so and then I used

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.000 
acapella sounds great so and then I used
the<00:02:22.389> rhythm<00:02:22.959> channel<00:02:23.379> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
the rhythm channel the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.670 
the rhythm channel the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the the gold channel gold light channel

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.910 
the the gold channel gold light channel
for<00:02:27.459> all<00:02:28.000> my<00:02:28.150> rhythm<00:02:28.390> stuff<00:02:28.629> and<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:28.959> have<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
for all my rhythm stuff and I have the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.150 
for all my rhythm stuff and I have the
gain<00:02:30.129> on<00:02:30.160> high<00:02:30.519> gain<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.810> vary<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
gain on high gain and I vary the the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.420 
gain on high gain and I vary the the
gain<00:02:34.140> according<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.349> room<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:36.310> know

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
gain according to the room you know

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.160 
gain according to the room you know
sometimes<00:02:36.940> they'll<00:02:37.090> back<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.450> gate<00:02:37.629> off<00:02:37.840> a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
sometimes they'll back the gate off a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.420 
sometimes they'll back the gate off a
little<00:02:38.860> bit<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:40.860> depends<00:02:41.860> if<00:02:41.920> I'm<00:02:42.040> using<00:02:42.220> my

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
little bit and depends if I'm using my

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.070 
little bit and depends if I'm using my
speaker<00:02:42.940> cabinets<00:02:43.330> at<00:02:43.450> home<00:02:43.599> I<00:02:43.750> have<00:02:43.870> two

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
speaker cabinets at home I have two

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.839 
speaker cabinets at home I have two
different<00:02:44.230> speaker<00:02:44.890> cabs<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:47.069> I<00:02:48.069> can<00:02:48.670> back

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
different speaker cabs and I can back

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.699 
different speaker cabs and I can back
the<00:02:49.000> gain<00:02:49.180> off<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.599> fare<00:02:49.810> Malik<00:02:50.170> but<00:02:50.349> over<00:02:50.530> here

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
the gain off of fare Malik but over here

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.729 
the gain off of fare Malik but over here
I'm<00:02:51.330> using<00:02:52.330> Europe<00:02:53.019> using<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.410> little<00:02:53.620> more

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
I'm using Europe using a little more

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.229 
I'm using Europe using a little more
saturated<00:02:53.980> sound<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> gain<00:02:54.940> is<00:02:55.030> pretty

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
saturated sound so the gain is pretty

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.020 
saturated sound so the gain is pretty
high<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:56.620> rhythm<00:02:57.160> channel<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.970> other

things I have on the board are Bob

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.610 
things I have on the board are Bob
turned<00:03:00.430> me<00:03:00.489> on<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.640> this<00:03:01.170> Eventide<00:03:02.170> time

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
turned me on to this Eventide time

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.620 
turned me on to this Eventide time
factor<00:03:03.220> which<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.579> a<00:03:03.610> MIDI<00:03:04.680> programmable<00:03:06.630> you

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
factor which is a MIDI programmable you

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.110 
factor which is a MIDI programmable you
know<00:03:07.750> delay<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.890> had<00:03:08.980> anything<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.430> do<00:03:10.090> with

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
know delay that had anything to do with

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.339 
know delay that had anything to do with
time<00:03:10.510> like<00:03:10.840> chorus<00:03:11.319> flange<00:03:12.480> delays<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.840> slap

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
time like chorus flange delays and slap

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.710 
time like chorus flange delays and slap
backs<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.890> stuff<00:03:15.040> like<00:03:15.160> that

backs and stuff like that

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.380 
backs and stuff like that
it's<00:03:17.620> got<00:03:17.769> some<00:03:17.980> amp<00:03:18.190> modeling<00:03:18.790> things<00:03:19.150> in<00:03:19.269> it

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
it's got some amp modeling things in it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.479 
it's got some amp modeling things in it
for<00:03:19.480> like<00:03:19.599> a<00:03:19.660> vintage<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.709> know<00:03:20.799> things<00:03:21.160> tape

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
for like a vintage you know things tape

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.809 
for like a vintage you know things tape
delay<00:03:21.849> and<00:03:22.120> stuff<00:03:22.299> like<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.980> I'm<00:03:23.980> putting<00:03:24.610> it

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
delay and stuff like that I'm putting it

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.250 
delay and stuff like that I'm putting it
in<00:03:24.849> front<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.269> amp<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.780> one<00:03:25.930> thing<00:03:26.140> I'm

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
in front of the amp and one thing I'm

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.210 
in front of the amp and one thing I'm
considering<00:03:26.890> doing<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:29.019> putting<00:03:29.829> it<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.100> the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
considering doing is putting it in the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.870 
considering doing is putting it in the
loop

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
loop

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.270 
loop
it<00:03:31.569> would<00:03:31.690> require<00:03:32.049> two<00:03:32.350> more<00:03:32.560> long<00:03:32.799> cables

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
it would require two more long cables

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.879 
it would require two more long cables
you<00:03:34.120> know<00:03:34.239> from<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.630> boards<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.139> head<00:03:35.350> but

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
you know from the boards of the head but

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.500 
you know from the boards of the head but
but<00:03:36.250> I'm<00:03:36.340> kind<00:03:36.549> of<00:03:36.609> thinking<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.299> might

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
but I'm kind of thinking that it might

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.289 
but I'm kind of thinking that it might
function<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:38.310> little<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.459> mean<00:03:39.489> it's<00:03:39.700> some

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
function a little I mean it's some

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.569 
function a little I mean it's some
nights<00:03:40.510> it's<00:03:40.690> messy<00:03:41.109> and<00:03:41.319> it's<00:03:41.859> hard<00:03:42.100> if<00:03:42.400> the

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
nights it's messy and it's hard if the

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.860 
nights it's messy and it's hard if the
room<00:03:42.819> sounds<00:03:43.480> not<00:03:43.660> great<00:03:43.959> it's<00:03:44.139> hard<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:45.190> to

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
room sounds not great it's hard to to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.920 
room sounds not great it's hard to to
get<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.109> clarity<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:48.160> I'm<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:49.450> I'm<00:03:49.540> that's

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
get the clarity and I'm so I'm that's

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.199 
get the clarity and I'm so I'm that's
something<00:03:50.230> when<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.410> get<00:03:50.620> home<00:03:50.859> from<00:03:51.130> this<00:03:51.970> tour

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
something when I get home from this tour

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.550 
something when I get home from this tour
I<00:03:52.269> think<00:03:52.870> I'm<00:03:52.959> gonna<00:03:53.109> talk<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.560> Bob<00:03:53.829> about<00:03:54.010> and

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
I think I'm gonna talk to Bob about and

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.170 
I think I'm gonna talk to Bob about and
but<00:03:56.560> but<00:03:56.709> for<00:03:56.859> now<00:03:57.010> I'm<00:03:57.220> putting<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.880> in<00:03:57.970> front

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
but but for now I'm putting it in front

00:03:58.180 --> 00:05:11.930 
but but for now I'm putting it in front
of<00:03:58.299> everything

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.000
