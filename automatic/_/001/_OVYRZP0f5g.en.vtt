a<00:00:21.090> full<00:00:21.330> stroke<00:00:21.689> alright<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.609> exercise

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
a full stroke alright so this exercise

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.890 
a full stroke alright so this exercise
is<00:00:24.600> based<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.140> 4/4<00:00:25.590> time<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:27.090> we're<00:00:27.539> doing

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
is based in 4/4 time and all we're doing

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.820 
is based in 4/4 time and all we're doing
is<00:00:28.109> playing<00:00:28.769> straight<00:00:29.429> triplets<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.830> 12

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
is playing straight triplets for 12

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.540 
is playing straight triplets for 12
measures<00:00:32.300> okay<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.200> when<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.520> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
measures okay and when you do this at a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.940 
measures okay and when you do this at a
slow<00:00:35.850> speed<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.420> get<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> ton<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.350> experience

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
slow speed you get a ton of experience

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.280 
slow speed you get a ton of experience
just<00:00:38.040> making<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.700> motion<00:00:38.910> over<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.930> over

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
just making this motion over and over

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.200 
just making this motion over and over
and<00:00:40.379> over<00:00:40.559> again<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.640> reason<00:00:41.910> we're

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
and over again and the reason we're

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.630 
and over again and the reason we're
doing<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.950> because<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.309> know<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.550> been

doing that is because you know it's been

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.580 
doing that is because you know it's been
quoted<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.059> saying<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.450> repetition<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
quoted as saying that repetition is the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.430 
quoted as saying that repetition is the
mother<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.550> learning<00:00:47.940> alright<00:00:48.300> there's<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
mother of learning alright there's a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.139

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
principles and those those concepts okay

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.590 
principles and those those concepts okay
so<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.490> want<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> make<00:02:02.880> sure<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
so you want to make sure you want to

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.899 
so you want to make sure you want to

avoid a couple things here you want to
avoid<00:02:06.320> very<00:02:07.320> dynamics<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:09.090> you're<00:02:09.420> going

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
avoid very dynamics so as you're going

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.300 
avoid very dynamics so as you're going
along

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310

than others and other note you know some

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.530 
than others and other note you know some
notes<00:02:20.650> softer<00:02:21.099> than<00:02:21.220> others<00:02:21.489> every<00:02:22.239> single

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
notes softer than others every single

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.780 
notes softer than others every single
note<00:02:22.720> should<00:02:22.930> sound<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.349> exact<00:02:23.709> same<00:02:23.920> volume

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.960 

okay

the other thing is you want to focus on

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.949 
the other thing is you want to focus on
the<00:02:33.099> smoothness<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.300> rhythm<00:02:34.599> yeah<00:02:34.900> you

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
the smoothness of the rhythm yeah you

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.140 
the smoothness of the rhythm yeah you
might<00:02:35.319> look<00:02:35.470> at<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.739> say<00:02:35.980> oh<00:02:36.190> man

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
might look at this and say oh man

might look at this and say oh man
those<00:02:37.390> are<00:02:37.630> just<00:02:37.840> straight<00:02:38.380> triplets<00:02:38.920> for<00:02:39.010> 12

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
those are just straight triplets for 12

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.160 
those are just straight triplets for 12
measures<00:02:39.849> this<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.630> most<00:02:40.840> boring

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
measures this is the most boring

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.050 
measures this is the most boring
exercise<00:02:41.739> I've<00:02:42.010> ever<00:02:42.370> seen<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.910> my<00:02:42.940> entire

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
exercise I've ever seen in my entire

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.710 
exercise I've ever seen in my entire
life

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720

fair<00:02:44.590> enough<00:02:45.010> I'm<00:02:45.130> not<00:02:45.370> gonna<00:02:45.549> argue<00:02:45.730> with<00:02:45.970> it

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
fair enough I'm not gonna argue with it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.259 
fair enough I'm not gonna argue with it
with<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.660> on<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:46.989> right<00:02:47.410> it's<00:02:47.920> not<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.730> super

with you on that right it's not a super
impressive<00:02:49.630> exercise<00:02:50.200> it's<00:02:50.769> not<00:02:51.010> something

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
impressive exercise it's not something

you're<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.569> best<00:02:55.780> drummer<00:02:56.019> in<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.200> world

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
you're the best drummer in the world

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.759 
you're the best drummer in the world
right<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.630> very<00:02:58.989> very<00:02:59.349> important

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
right but it's a very very important

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.380 
right but it's a very very important
exercise<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.489> that's<00:03:00.790> why<00:03:01.060> we're<00:03:01.209> spending

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
exercise and that's why we're spending

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.990 
exercise and that's why we're spending
time<00:03:01.599> on<00:03:01.810> ok<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:02.980> want<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.400> really<00:03:03.610> focus

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
time on ok so you want to really focus

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.300 
time on ok so you want to really focus
on<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.690> rhythm<00:03:04.900> yes<00:03:05.620> there<00:03:05.860> is<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.040> big

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
on the rhythm yes there is a big

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:20.180 
on the rhythm yes there is a big
difference<00:03:06.459> between<00:03:06.730> playing<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:12.690> this

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.360 

ok<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.880> want<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.209> go<00:03:22.359> for<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.750> first<00:03:22.959> one

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
ok you want to go for the first one

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.430 
ok you want to go for the first one
super<00:03:24.370> smooth<00:03:24.670> all<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.660> notes<00:03:25.900> are<00:03:26.049> equally

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
super smooth all the notes are equally

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.170 
super smooth all the notes are equally
spaced<00:03:26.739> apart<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:28.440> consistent<00:03:29.440> so<00:03:30.040> easy<00:03:30.549> so

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
spaced apart so consistent so easy so

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.420 
spaced apart so consistent so easy so
flowing<00:03:31.630> right<00:03:32.109> those<00:03:32.650> are<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.010> principles

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
flowing right those are the principles

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.890 
flowing right those are the principles
that<00:03:33.489> you<00:03:33.730> want<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:33.970> be<00:03:34.060> working<00:03:34.269> on<00:03:34.540> for<00:03:34.810> this

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
that you want to be working on for this

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.470 
that you want to be working on for this
exercise<00:03:35.319> ok<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.400> that's<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.209> in<00:03:37.359> a<00:03:37.450> nutshell

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
exercise ok so that's it in a nutshell

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.180 
exercise ok so that's it in a nutshell
that's<00:03:37.989> what<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.319> need<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.530> be<00:03:38.620> focusing<00:03:39.040> on

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
that's what you need to be focusing on

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.110 
that's what you need to be focusing on
and<00:03:40.000> striving<00:03:40.959> for<00:03:41.200> in<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.250> next<00:03:42.579> video<00:03:42.850> is

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
and striving for in the next video is

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.849 
and striving for in the next video is
actually<00:03:43.450> just<00:03:43.569> a<00:03:43.720> play<00:03:43.900> long<00:03:44.079> video<00:03:44.380> where

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
actually just a play long video where

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.650 
actually just a play long video where
I'm<00:03:45.010> gonna<00:03:45.220> play<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.579> exercise<00:03:46.060> with<00:03:46.480> you

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
I'm gonna play the exercise with you

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.099 
I'm gonna play the exercise with you
three<00:03:47.139> times<00:03:47.440> ok<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.389> very<00:03:49.389> slow<00:03:49.540> tempo<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:49.989> that

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
three times ok a very slow tempo so that

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.620 
three times ok a very slow tempo so that
you<00:03:50.230> can<00:03:50.350> play<00:03:50.500> along<00:03:50.739> listen<00:03:51.609> watch<00:03:52.299> and

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
you can play along listen watch and

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.680 
you can play along listen watch and
mimic<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:54.940> know<00:03:55.239> exactly

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
mimic that so that you know exactly

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.170 
mimic that so that you know exactly
what's<00:03:55.900> be<00:03:56.049> doing<00:03:56.319> for<00:03:57.250> future<00:03:57.760> reference

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
what's be doing for future reference

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.490 
what's be doing for future reference
when<00:03:58.389> you<00:03:58.480> start<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.780> speed<00:03:59.019> this<00:03:59.109> up<00:03:59.260> on<00:03:59.410> your

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
when you start to speed this up on your

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.009 
when you start to speed this up on your
own<00:03:59.560> ok<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.489> once<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.180> have<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.630> understand

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
own ok so once you have you understand

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.180 
own ok so once you have you understand
all<00:04:02.200> these<00:04:02.290> principles<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:02.799> things<00:04:02.920> if<00:04:03.100> you

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
all these principles and things if you

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.069 
all these principles and things if you
would<00:04:03.340> need<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.549> re-watch<00:04:03.819> this<00:04:04.180> video<00:04:04.359> to

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
would need to re-watch this video to

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.509 
would need to re-watch this video to
kind<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.560> grasp<00:04:05.829> what<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.069> said<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> little<00:04:06.400> bit

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
kind of grasp what I said a little bit
