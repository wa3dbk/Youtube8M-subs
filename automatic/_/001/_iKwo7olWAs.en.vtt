drawing<00:00:06.029> for<00:00:06.330> portraits<00:00:11.330> when<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.360> start<00:00:12.780> out

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
drawing for portraits when I start out

drawing for portraits when I start out
at<00:00:13.049> drawing<00:00:13.349> I'm<00:00:13.740> working<00:00:14.599> with<00:00:15.599> two<00:00:15.929> ways<00:00:16.230> of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
at drawing I'm working with two ways of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
at drawing I'm working with two ways of
thinking<00:00:16.710> two<00:00:17.340> methods<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.970> drawing<00:00:19.430> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
thinking two methods of drawing the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.590 
thinking two methods of drawing the
first<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.119> drawing<00:00:21.480> from<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> see

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
first one is drawing from what I see

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.189 
first one is drawing from what I see
which<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.930> basically<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.220> mechanical<00:00:27.199> process

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
which is basically a mechanical process

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.600 
which is basically a mechanical process
I'm<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.099> mechanical<00:00:29.910> eye<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:31.610> reproducing

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
I'm a mechanical eye that is reproducing

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.459 
I'm a mechanical eye that is reproducing
everything<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.090> see<00:00:33.329> without<00:00:33.600> judgment

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
everything I see without judgment

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.540 
everything I see without judgment
without<00:00:35.660> filtering<00:00:36.770> I'm<00:00:37.770> working<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.250> large

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
without filtering I'm working with large

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.130 
without filtering I'm working with large
abstract<00:00:39.030> shapes<00:00:39.540> trying<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> get<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
abstract shapes trying to get the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.400 
abstract shapes trying to get the
overall<00:00:40.440> gesture<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.340> positioning<00:00:42.329> down<00:00:42.510> now

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
overall gesture and positioning down now

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.580 
overall gesture and positioning down now
the<00:00:43.469> second<00:00:44.100> way<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> thinking<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.590> drawing

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the second way of thinking is drawing

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.740 
the second way of thinking is drawing
from<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> know<00:00:47.300> which<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.450> what<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> know

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
from what I know which is what I know

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.600 
from what I know which is what I know
about<00:00:49.020> anatomy<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> know<00:00:50.430> about

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
about anatomy it's what I know about

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.330 
about anatomy it's what I know about
proportion<00:00:51.680> when<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.070> somebody

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
proportion when you think of somebody

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.770 
proportion when you think of somebody
like<00:00:53.520> Michelangelo<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.449> could<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
like Michelangelo they could do a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.250 
like Michelangelo they could do a
drawing<00:00:55.309> without<00:00:56.309> consulting<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.239> model<00:00:57.600> such

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
drawing without consulting a model such

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.049 
drawing without consulting a model such
was<00:00:58.530> his<00:00:58.739> understanding<00:00:59.640> of<00:01:00.230> human<00:01:01.230> anatomy

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
was his understanding of human anatomy

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.270 
was his understanding of human anatomy
ultimately<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.210> rely<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.989> first<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.619> draw<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
ultimately I rely on the first I draw I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.090 
ultimately I rely on the first I draw I
try<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.610> draw<00:01:05.880> from<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.750> see<00:01:07.590> rather<00:01:07.890> than

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
try and draw from what I see rather than

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.640 
try and draw from what I see rather than
what<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:08.689> mechanical<00:01:09.689> reproduction<00:01:10.110> is

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
what I think mechanical reproduction is

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.810 
what I think mechanical reproduction is
is<00:01:10.950> ultimately<00:01:11.760> your<00:01:12.000> goal<00:01:13.340> one<00:01:14.340> place<00:01:14.580> where

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
is ultimately your goal one place where

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.350 
is ultimately your goal one place where
I<00:01:14.850> will<00:01:15.150> use<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:16.590> preconceived<00:01:17.360> knowledge

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
I will use this preconceived knowledge

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.929 
I will use this preconceived knowledge
drawing<00:01:18.720> from<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.080> know<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:20.549> I'm

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
drawing from what I know is what I'm

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.840 
drawing from what I know is what I'm
doing<00:01:21.090> right<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.530> have<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.830> rough<00:01:23.250> Canon<00:01:23.729> of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
doing right now have this rough Canon of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.539 
doing right now have this rough Canon of
proportions<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.659> apply<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.259> most<00:01:26.070> people

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
proportions that apply to most people

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.390 
proportions that apply to most people
where<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> eye<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.750> roughly<00:01:28.350> halfway<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
where the eye is roughly halfway on the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.950 
where the eye is roughly halfway on the
head<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> indicate<00:01:31.110> an<00:01:31.229> axis<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> eyes

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
head so I indicate an axis of the eyes

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
head so I indicate an axis of the eyes
notice<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.140> slight<00:01:34.470> offset<00:01:34.770> her<00:01:35.579> head<00:01:35.790> is

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
notice the slight offset her head is

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.179 
notice the slight offset her head is
cocked<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.329> little<00:01:36.570> bit<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:37.619> about<00:01:37.950> as

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
cocked a little bit but that's about as

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.160 
cocked a little bit but that's about as
far<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.880> rely<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.509> system<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
far as I rely on that system at the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.690 
far as I rely on that system at the
beginning<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> drawing<00:01:41.100> at<00:01:41.549> the

beginning again I try and work with

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.170 
beginning again I try and work with
large<00:01:43.200> abstract<00:01:43.860> shapes<00:01:44.189> which<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.090> this

this<00:04:37.919> space<00:04:38.160> down<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:38.760> was<00:04:39.480> talking<00:04:39.810> about

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
this space down I was talking about

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.650 
this space down I was talking about
halves<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.740> doubling<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.820> might<00:04:42.030> find<00:04:42.300> from

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
halves and doubling you might find from

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.070 
halves and doubling you might find from
the<00:04:42.750> edge<00:04:43.290> of<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.650> nose<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.210> edge<00:04:45.480> of<00:04:45.750> the

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
the edge of the nose to the edge of the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.350 
the edge of the nose to the edge of the
jaw<00:04:46.350> there's<00:04:47.190> some<00:04:47.460> shadow<00:04:47.760> shape<00:04:48.060> that<00:04:48.240> will

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
jaw there's some shadow shape that will

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.510 
jaw there's some shadow shape that will
come<00:04:48.570> in<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:48.960> break<00:04:49.230> that<00:04:49.440> up<00:04:49.470> maybe<00:04:49.950> close<00:04:50.340> to

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
come in and break that up maybe close to

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.640 
come in and break that up maybe close to
a<00:04:50.550> halfway<00:04:50.790> point<00:04:51.000> that<00:04:51.930> will<00:04:52.080> make<00:04:52.260> sense<00:04:52.500> out

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
a halfway point that will make sense out

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.800 
a halfway point that will make sense out
of<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.889> area<00:04:53.100> you'll<00:04:54.060> notice<00:04:54.330> when<00:04:54.480> I<00:04:54.510> make

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
of that area you'll notice when I make

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.280 
of that area you'll notice when I make
enough<00:04:55.230> passes<00:04:55.800> over<00:04:56.190> an<00:04:56.310> area<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.840> line<00:04:58.050> gets

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
enough passes over an area the line gets

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.040 
enough passes over an area the line gets
fuzzy<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:59.160> line<00:04:59.550> width<00:05:00.000> becomes<00:05:00.419> very<00:05:00.720> thick

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
fuzzy the line width becomes very thick

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.740 
fuzzy the line width becomes very thick
so<00:05:01.890> every<00:05:02.190> once<00:05:02.370> in<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.550> while<00:05:02.580> I'll<00:05:03.450> have<00:05:03.660> to

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
so every once in a while I'll have to

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.409 
so every once in a while I'll have to
take<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:03.990> out<00:05:04.230> erase<00:05:05.100> leave<00:05:05.669> sort<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.150> ghost

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
take it out erase leave sort of a ghost

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.960 
take it out erase leave sort of a ghost

it<00:05:09.150> more<00:05:09.330> specifically<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.080> I<00:05:10.110> call<00:05:10.290> these

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
it more specifically and I call these

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.130 
it more specifically and I call these
fuzzy<00:05:10.860> lines<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:12.090> ideal<00:05:12.450> is<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.660> want<00:05:12.960> the

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
fuzzy lines the ideal is you want the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.190 
fuzzy lines the ideal is you want the
one<00:05:13.440> correct<00:05:14.040> specific<00:05:14.760> line<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.050> never

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
one correct specific line and it never

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.060 
one correct specific line and it never
happens<00:05:16.620> on<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.800> first<00:05:17.010> try<00:05:18.650> now<00:05:19.650> in<00:05:19.800> certain

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
happens on the first try now in certain

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.730 
happens on the first try now in certain
places<00:05:20.280> my<00:05:20.970> shadow<00:05:21.390> lines<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:22.470> lines

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
places my shadow lines the lines

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.610 
places my shadow lines the lines
dividing<00:05:23.700> light<00:05:24.120> from<00:05:24.330> shadow<00:05:24.660> have<00:05:25.320> gotten

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
dividing light from shadow have gotten

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.219 
dividing light from shadow have gotten
confused<00:05:25.770> with<00:05:26.370> anatomical<00:05:27.270> markers<00:05:27.900> say<00:05:28.110> the

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
confused with anatomical markers say the

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.750 
confused with anatomical markers say the
eyelash<00:05:28.680> line<00:05:28.710> things<00:05:29.310> are<00:05:29.430> getting<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.669> little

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
eyelash line things are getting a little

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.450 
eyelash line things are getting a little
confusing<00:05:30.470> so<00:05:31.470> that's<00:05:31.680> when<00:05:31.830> I<00:05:31.860> come<00:05:32.100> in<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.370> I

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
confusing so that's when I come in and I

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.630 
confusing so that's when I come in and I
unify<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:34.770> shadow<00:05:35.040> area

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
unify the shadow area

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.480 
unify the shadow area
it<00:05:36.630> just<00:05:36.870> helps<00:05:37.110> recover<00:05:37.410> that<00:05:37.710> simple<00:05:38.160> design

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
it just helps recover that simple design

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.060 
it just helps recover that simple design
route<00:05:38.729> going<00:05:39.030> after

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
route going after

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.190 
route going after
okay<00:05:41.070> my<00:05:41.400> drawing<00:05:41.669> needs<00:05:41.910> further<00:05:42.240> work<00:05:42.570> but

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
okay my drawing needs further work but

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.170 
okay my drawing needs further work but
I'm<00:05:43.380> well<00:05:43.919> on<00:05:43.950> my<00:05:44.070> way<00:05:44.190> to<00:05:44.370> creating<00:05:44.820> a<00:05:44.880> sketch

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
I'm well on my way to creating a sketch

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.540 
I'm well on my way to creating a sketch
to<00:05:45.690> paint<00:05:45.870> from<00:05:45.990> later

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
to paint from later

00:05:47.550 --> 00:06:06.480 
to paint from later
