00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.170 

well<00:01:23.980> the<00:01:24.070> first<00:01:24.310> thing<00:01:24.400> you<00:01:24.610> have<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.760> look<00:01:24.970> at

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
well the first thing you have to look at

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.690 
well the first thing you have to look at
is<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.600> fact<00:01:25.870> that<00:01:26.050> unlike<00:01:26.440> it<00:01:26.740> all<00:01:26.860> pro<00:01:27.190> the

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
is the fact that unlike it all pro the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.300 
is the fact that unlike it all pro the
guard<00:01:28.420> here<00:01:28.690> I<00:01:29.530> think<00:01:29.980> it's<00:01:30.100> going<00:01:30.160> to<00:01:30.250> be

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
guard here I think it's going to be

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.240 
guard here I think it's going to be
Charlie<00:01:30.670> Johnson<00:01:31.050> oh<00:01:32.050> man<00:01:32.500> my<00:01:32.710> controllers

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
Charlie Johnson oh man my controllers

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.180 
Charlie Johnson oh man my controllers
killing<00:01:33.550> me<00:01:33.610> um<00:01:34.420> yeah<00:01:35.200> Charlie<00:01:35.650> Johnson<00:01:35.830> is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
killing me um yeah Charlie Johnson is

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.400 
killing me um yeah Charlie Johnson is
going<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.400> pull<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.000> when<00:01:37.330> he<00:01:37.450> pulls<00:01:37.810> it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
going to pull and when he pulls it

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.310 
going to pull and when he pulls it
leaves<00:01:38.650> a<00:01:38.920> big<00:01:39.100> gap<00:01:39.400> there<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:41.170> actually

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
leaves a big gap there and you actually

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.200 
leaves a big gap there and you actually
get<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.770> lot<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.160> linebackers<00:01:42.580> in<00:01:43.000> the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
get a lot of linebackers in the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.740 
get a lot of linebackers in the
backfield<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:45.150> we'll<00:01:46.150> break<00:01:46.360> this<00:01:46.510> out<00:01:46.720> a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
backfield and we'll break this out a

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.880 
backfield and we'll break this out a
little<00:01:46.900> further<00:01:47.140> there<00:01:47.350> we'll<00:01:47.560> just<00:01:47.740> do<00:01:47.860> it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
little further there we'll just do it

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.950 
little further there we'll just do it

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
see how my wide receiver well there's no

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.390 
see how my wide receiver well there's no
there's<00:03:26.260> no<00:03:26.320> blocking<00:03:26.890> for<00:03:27.100> my<00:03:27.190> wide<00:03:27.370> receiver

there's no blocking for my wide receiver

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.840 
there's no blocking for my wide receiver
at<00:03:27.940> all<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.330> for<00:03:28.450> some<00:03:28.660> reason<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.860> think<00:03:30.610> that

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
at all and for some reason I think that

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.990 
at all and for some reason I think that
must<00:03:31.030> be<00:03:31.150> some<00:03:31.329> re-roll<00:03:32.310> just<00:03:33.310> runs<00:03:33.730> along

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
must be some re-roll just runs along

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.879 
must be some re-roll just runs along
with<00:03:34.239> him<00:03:34.420> instead<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.900> staying<00:03:35.260> back<00:03:35.650> here

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
with him instead of staying back here

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:36.660 
with him instead of staying back here
where<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.100> play

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
where the play

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.190 
where the play
so<00:03:37.670> that's<00:03:37.819> a<00:03:37.909> little<00:03:38.120> that's<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.569> little<00:03:38.780> shaky

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
so that's a little that's a little shaky

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.649 
so that's a little that's a little shaky
and<00:03:39.409> finally<00:03:40.099> we'll<00:03:40.879> take<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.060> look<00:03:41.239> at<00:03:41.360> how<00:03:41.480> it

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
and finally we'll take a look at how it

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.600 
and finally we'll take a look at how it
read<00:03:41.870> covers<00:03:42.260> display<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:42.980> read<00:03:43.129> way<00:03:43.310> down<00:03:43.489> in

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
read covers display and read way down in

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.369 
read covers display and read way down in
the<00:03:43.670> box<00:03:43.849> so<00:03:44.269> he<00:03:44.480> should<00:03:45.019> have<00:03:45.110> been<00:03:45.170> all<00:03:45.349> over

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
the box so he should have been all over

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.229 
the box so he should have been all over
this<00:03:45.739> if<00:03:46.069> it's<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.310> pitch<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.939> you<00:03:47.810> can<00:03:47.959> see<00:03:48.260> he

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
this if it's a pitch and you can see he

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.580 
this if it's a pitch and you can see he
actually<00:03:50.239> backpedals<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.170> wrong<00:03:51.349> direction

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
actually backpedals the wrong direction

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.140 
actually backpedals the wrong direction
he<00:03:51.950> back<00:03:52.129> pedals<00:03:52.159> to<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.700> center<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.030> the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
he back pedals to the center of the

as if it's a pitch the only people that

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.069 
as if it's a pitch the only people that

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
wide receiver and I wonder if Ed Reed

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.310 
wide receiver and I wonder if Ed Reed
maybe<00:04:20.239> was<00:04:20.479> going<00:04:20.690> over<00:04:20.870> there<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.109> cover

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
maybe was going over there to cover

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.159 
maybe was going over there to cover
marvin<00:04:21.739> harrison<00:04:22.100> i'm<00:04:22.220> not<00:04:22.340> sure<00:04:22.610> but<00:04:22.660> he<00:04:23.660> has

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
marvin harrison i'm not sure but he has

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.890 
marvin harrison i'm not sure but he has
no<00:04:24.350> impact<00:04:24.650> on<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.979> play<00:04:25.160> at<00:04:25.340> all<00:04:25.490> so<00:04:25.900> it's

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
no impact on the play at all so it's

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.330 
no impact on the play at all so it's
pointless<00:04:27.139> but<00:04:27.560> we'll<00:04:27.710> watch<00:04:27.889> it<00:04:28.099> at<00:04:28.190> speed

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
pointless but we'll watch it at speed

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.430 
pointless but we'll watch it at speed
from<00:04:28.699> him<00:04:30.639> and<00:04:31.810> then<00:04:32.810> we'll<00:04:32.960> watch<00:04:33.139> it<00:04:33.320> at

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
from him and then we'll watch it at

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
from him and then we'll watch it at
speed<00:04:33.560> for<00:04:33.979> my<00:04:34.070> halfback<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:35.259> this<00:04:36.259> is<00:04:36.410> a

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
speed for my halfback and this is a

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.330 
speed for my halfback and this is a
pitch<00:04:37.460> in<00:04:37.789> man<00:04:38.419> 2009<00:04:39.139> to<00:04:39.349> compare<00:04:39.710> with<00:04:39.919> all

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
pitch in man 2009 to compare with all

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.920 
pitch in man 2009 to compare with all
pro<00:04:40.520> football<00:04:40.910> so<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:44.090> can<00:04:44.240> see<00:04:44.449> just<00:04:44.479> not<00:04:44.900> a

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
pro football so you can see just not a

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.650 
pro football so you can see just not a
lot<00:04:45.020> of<00:04:45.110> containment<00:04:45.849> kind<00:04:46.849> of<00:04:46.970> a<00:04:47.060> messy<00:04:47.389> play

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
lot of containment kind of a messy play

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.560 
lot of containment kind of a messy play
and<00:04:48.080> like<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.860> said<00:04:48.919> my<00:04:49.250> my<00:04:49.580> fullback<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:50.419> my

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
and like I said my my fullback and my

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.439 
and like I said my my fullback and my
wide<00:04:50.780> receiver<00:04:50.810> were<00:04:51.470> really<00:04:51.970> really<00:04:52.970> useless

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
wide receiver were really really useless

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.420 
wide receiver were really really useless
in<00:04:53.840> this<00:04:53.930> play<00:04:54.199> they<00:04:54.229> didn't<00:04:54.710> do<00:04:54.770> anything<00:04:55.010> to

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
in this play they didn't do anything to

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.029 
in this play they didn't do anything to
