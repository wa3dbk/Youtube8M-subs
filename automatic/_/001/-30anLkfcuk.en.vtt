with unique tips and a quiver the quiver

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.259 
with unique tips and a quiver the quiver
is<00:02:49.989> removable<00:02:50.680> from<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.010> figure<00:02:51.340> removing

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
is removable from the figure removing

her<00:02:52.390> ponytail<00:02:52.720> like<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.079> showed<00:02:53.230> earlier

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
her ponytail like I showed earlier

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.520 
her ponytail like I showed earlier
actually<00:02:54.130> helps<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.459> get<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.730> piece<00:02:54.940> off

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
actually helps to get the piece off

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.530 
actually helps to get the piece off
it's<00:02:56.530> made<00:02:56.769> of<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.980> soft<00:02:57.190> rubbery<00:02:57.760> plastic<00:02:58.030> but

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
it's made of a soft rubbery plastic but

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.330 
it's made of a soft rubbery plastic but
the<00:02:58.660> arrows<00:02:59.019> are<00:02:59.170> all<00:02:59.350> part<00:02:59.739> of<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.920> mold<00:03:00.130> and

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
the arrows are all part of the mold and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.090 
the arrows are all part of the mold and
they<00:03:00.760> are<00:03:00.880> non<00:03:01.150> removable<00:03:01.570> so<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.709> can't

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
they are non removable so this can't

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.890 
they are non removable so this can't
really<00:03:03.220> hold<00:03:03.579> any<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.940> those<00:03:04.150> extra<00:03:04.420> arrows

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.070 
now here's what's cool about our bow
unlike<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.280> DC<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.790> see<00:03:15.970> green<00:03:16.210> arrow<00:03:16.420> the

arrow on Artemis's bow is not glued in
place<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:21.700> can<00:03:21.850> actually<00:03:22.330> remove<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.840> arrow

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
place you can actually remove the arrow

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.440 
place you can actually remove the arrow
that<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.380> clipped<00:03:23.680> onto<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.160> bow<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.700> replace

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
that is clipped onto the bow and replace

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.620 
that is clipped onto the bow and replace
it<00:03:25.630> with<00:03:25.750> any<00:03:26.050> of<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.410> others<00:03:27.270> so<00:03:28.270> it<00:03:28.360> doesn't

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
it with any of the others so it doesn't

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.200 
it with any of the others so it doesn't
actually<00:03:28.960> fire<00:03:29.350> but<00:03:29.920> at<00:03:30.160> least<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.060> can

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
actually fire but at least you can

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.300 
actually fire but at least you can
actually<00:03:31.510> use<00:03:31.990> the<00:03:32.230> other<00:03:32.440> arrows<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.160> she

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
actually use the other arrows that she

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:44.970 
actually use the other arrows that she
includes<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:43.450> like<00:03:43.630> Robin<00:03:44.140> Artemis<00:03:44.710> comes

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
includes just like Robin Artemis comes

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.270 
includes just like Robin Artemis comes
with<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.160> huge<00:03:45.730> display<00:03:46.240> base<00:03:47.040> instead<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.190> a

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
with a huge display base instead of a

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.490 
with a huge display base instead of a
city<00:03:48.640> scene<00:03:48.970> this<00:03:49.150> one<00:03:49.360> features<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.840> target

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.600 
city scene this one features a target
for<00:03:50.680> Artemis<00:03:51.100> to<00:03:51.220> fire<00:03:51.490> her<00:03:51.700> arrows<00:03:52.120> into<00:03:53.610> this

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
for Artemis to fire her arrows into this

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.520 
for Artemis to fire her arrows into this
space<00:03:54.880> only<00:03:55.150> includes<00:03:55.570> one<00:03:55.900> peg<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:56.350> there's

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
space only includes one peg so there's

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.290 
space only includes one peg so there's
really<00:03:56.800> only<00:03:56.890> one<00:03:57.220> place<00:03:57.610> for<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:57.910> figure<00:03:58.180> to

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
really only one place for a figure to

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.320 
really only one place for a figure to
stand<00:03:59.160> there's<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.250> small<00:04:00.670> tube<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.150> can

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
stand there's a small tube that you can

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.580 
stand there's a small tube that you can
place<00:04:01.540> all<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.990> extra<00:04:02.350> arrows<00:04:02.650> in<00:04:04.590> there's

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
place all of the extra arrows in there's

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.860 
place all of the extra arrows in there's
also<00:04:05.800> this<00:04:06.100> small<00:04:06.820> clip<00:04:07.270> that<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.570> be

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
also this small clip that to be

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.660 
also this small clip that to be
perfectly<00:04:08.020> honest<00:04:08.590> I'm<00:04:08.710> not<00:04:08.740> exactly<00:04:09.430> sure

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
perfectly honest I'm not exactly sure

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.390 
perfectly honest I'm not exactly sure
what<00:04:09.700> it's<00:04:10.030> for<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.810> box<00:04:11.050> has<00:04:11.470> no<00:04:11.740> indication

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
what it's for the box has no indication

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.000 
what it's for the box has no indication
so<00:04:13.270> I<00:04:13.300> guess<00:04:13.510> this<00:04:13.720> could<00:04:13.750> also<00:04:14.410> hold<00:04:14.830> some

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
so I guess this could also hold some

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.250 
so I guess this could also hold some
arrows<00:04:15.340> or<00:04:15.610> maybe<00:04:16.209> it's<00:04:16.420> the<00:04:16.570> store<00:04:16.840> Artemis

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
arrows or maybe it's the store Artemis

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.380 
arrows or maybe it's the store Artemis
bow<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.890> guess<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.549> can<00:04:18.700> use<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:19.000> for<00:04:19.209> whatever

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
bow I guess you can use it for whatever

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:27.690 
bow I guess you can use it for whatever
you<00:04:19.630> want<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:26.620> cool<00:04:26.830> target<00:04:27.220> at<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.400> end<00:04:27.520> has

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
you want the cool target at the end has

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.520 
you want the cool target at the end has
two<00:04:27.970> places<00:04:28.390> that<00:04:28.600> you<00:04:28.780> can<00:04:28.930> actually<00:04:29.080> plug

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
two places that you can actually plug

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.770 
two places that you can actually plug
most<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:30.040> her<00:04:30.130> arrows<00:04:30.460> into<00:04:30.700> to<00:04:31.510> make<00:04:31.660> it

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
most of her arrows into to make it

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.540 
most of her arrows into to make it
appear<00:04:32.110> as<00:04:32.200> if<00:04:32.350> Artemis<00:04:32.740> has<00:04:32.890> struck<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.250> bull's

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.120 
eye the only arrow that does not fit in
these<00:04:36.940> holes<00:04:37.240> is<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.990> normal<00:04:38.470> arrow<00:04:38.680> that

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
these holes is the normal arrow that

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.410 

well<00:04:44.890> I<00:04:44.920> don't<00:04:45.190> think<00:04:45.250> this<00:04:45.430> is<00:04:45.580> quite<00:04:45.880> as<00:04:46.030> cool

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
well I don't think this is quite as cool

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.540 
well I don't think this is quite as cool
as<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.810> rooftop<00:04:47.320> base<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.800> came<00:04:47.980> with<00:04:48.130> Robin

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
as the rooftop base that came with Robin

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.610 
as the rooftop base that came with Robin
it's<00:04:49.090> still<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.360> pretty<00:04:49.810> neat<00:04:50.020> little<00:04:50.050> display

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620
