00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 We're fine, I'm a marine. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.519
 Do you have a more monoxide car today? 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.660
 I came to make a local flo 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.000
 reading of the month 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.809

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.550
 I already did that month a video of a box and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.939

 I'm not going to show you every day here. 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.250
 new because I already made a box 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.170
 and the readings of the month will be the thing 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.450
 world at the time and cement 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.190
 It was so always charges the same prices 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.960
 because I could read very few 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.059
 books but no more ado some is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.219
 for you the first books that have arrived 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.469
 For me, this week, this week has come. 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.100
 for me the three partnership books in the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.809
 concept that is the first and only one that I 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.300
 I really liked this cover and I liked the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.270
 premise also the list of the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 events that the author of ps I love you 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:04.920
 simply happens in other books and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.070
 only one year of the war so that I 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.170
 I found it cool to be the second to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.960
 anbid were not those three who arrived 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.259
 for me this week in concept and the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.360
 others is how much boxing I'm going to leave 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.610
 for you at your discretion to see the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.890
 first book was not a beautiful one in the month 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.710
 but it was completed in the month which was 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.810
 mechanical 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.869
 I read it took me about 26 days to read 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.210
 this book because I already spoke in another 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.850
 video but because we were changing 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.439
 Asked on the service, I was too little. 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:44.700
 time I did not even read it and 11 out of 5 and 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.670
 23 14 was right girlfriend this reading 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.470
 but so wonderful, I enjoyed having 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.720
 It took me a while to finish because I 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.630
 I remember a lot I'm gay a lot 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.659
 of the story and was a very good read 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.299
 fun and exciting 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.070
 without people can express because I 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.630
 I find it very difficult to understand the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.660
 what happened to the claire question 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.510
 in this technology because I really liked it 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.530
 even more deadly 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.560
 but there are those who have not read yet I suggest 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.450
 before you read yourself less deadly before 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.120
 get the elderly 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.590
 read the trilogy infernal pieces that you 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.780
 will win much more 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.760
 we read mechanical mechanical price that your 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.489
 after you pick up the city of 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.819
 sun the city of videos of the city jassim 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:39.000
 Finally, if you get the series that 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.680
 even portals and law because first it is 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.970
 that the story takes place before 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.269
 mortal instruments you are talking about 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.640
 here the world advances more deadly people 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.760
 I do not know how to explain the story much better. 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.310
 much better and out you understand 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.340
 several other things that full 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.859
 technology you will you will understand 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.620
 best instrument immortal surname 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.569
 characters the lineages everything that 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.940
 happened in the past you will understand 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.319
 here it will be much better for 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.989
 development of the story you 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.349
 lestrange first my opinion clear 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.079
 but if you want law in the order of law 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.480
 even the fourth book says even such letter 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.310
 praise then I continue 5th 6th that order 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.519
 Release the Order Read Order 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.560
 writing because nuno fifth book already 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.359
 will get a lot of attention from characters 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.569
 you will be lost 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.310
 then read the fourth book you 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.040
 read the infernal pieces 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.959
 then on the 11th to the 26th he prince 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.120
 mechanic is a bit faster than the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:45.209
 mechanic because I loved the 666 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:50.160
 madly and this market that is very 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.810
 very good and also follows the line of 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.090
 today's mechanic who is writing 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.090
 development the main character 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.500
 for me sincerely until this one I have 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.530
 envy of her I wanted to be like her 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.750
 I wanted her to know I think she 's 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.030
 the best character 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.019
 my favorite character in life is the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.750
 of this law 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:13.829
 she is a very well written character 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:18.840
 very well developed super our super 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:20.340
 strong, she's funny, she 's ours too. 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.979
 We can not describe this 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.740
 character is very in love and you? 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.610
 it is not vibrating to claire near her 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.220
 she is very spoiled she had a lot of little girl 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.630
 it is very small new near the forehead 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.380
 being that they have practically the same 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.740
 age 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.169
 I know the customs the time is is 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.789
 accurate in this maturity it is necessary to 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.020
 attention to maturity in this time 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.610
 want 1870 but even so I even held 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.520
 all the books that you have is the best 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.870
 character of life every day 26/5 eu 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:59.580
 I started a mechanical princess and I'm already in the 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.770
 page 317 I am the book has 430 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.639
 pages 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.740
 I do not know what to say very serious people 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.729
 perfect technology very very much 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.940
 same 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.639
 I loved the other mortals but what is 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.009
 being concerned here is very different 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.710
 that even the maturity of the piece 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.319
 hurt and will eat steal is the 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.659
 best character in life 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.449
 Do you know I have many literary loves? 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:33.120
 Of course I will not put that il is 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:35.520
 the better because it's not I think everyone 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.360
 my loves each has its share 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.479
 to make him love but the eular with certainty 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:47.900
 is a character that is marking a lot 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:51.810
 very much same same guy and same guy 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.690
 We will give each page it you 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.870
 It's more surprising that he talks about the stock and 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.319
 I also love the front and respect who 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.900
 There are people who have nothing against 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.319
 So much, I really love him too. 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.380
 my style of face my style of 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:13.979
 mechanical character needs a lot 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.750
 I'm good too, I'm loving, I do not know. 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.419
 to define which is the best of the three I 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.270
 I'm in real shock with 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.560
 this book here and I do not know how to 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.479
 best of the three I do not even know if I'm going 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.729
 get set I think I'll have q 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.370
 today to get a 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.650
 definition of which is the best 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.060
 sincerely because you can not define 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.820
 I think this is going to be what I 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.070
 but I'll score but it's also the third 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.090
 book the last book of the trilogy né 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.919
 but 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.240
 very perfect and this cover is very 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:45.330
 Wonderful 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.490
 I think she's the most beautiful of the trilogy of 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.080
 these people were my readings and 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.090
 The books that came to me, I hope. 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.040

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.440
 go up a little last week but 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.120
 I 'm not back here, I do not think you 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.240
 They noticed the disappearance but that's okay. 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.710
