 [Music] 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.730
 hello my friends from youtube today I come to you 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.680
 with a new video but with a new 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.650
 theme for the channel as the theme of 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.080
 theories or just this is going to do the same 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.120
 I'm going to do it just because I like it 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.720
 discuss these issues only heh heh heh heh 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.420
 je the new channel theme is mysteries 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.840
 unresolved would be and not very well known 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.750
 I suppose hehehe good without saying more 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.000
 well let's start this mystery if it's 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.630
 known but a hacker comes to the end 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.600
 of the complicated puzzle of picada 3.301 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.640
 I'm going to tell you a little about the story 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 Swedish specialist in crypto security 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.860
 he managed to decipher all the clues of 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.930
 an anonymous puzzle two years ago appeared 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.400
 an encrypted message on the internet that 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.220
 aimed to be looking for the 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.430
 smarter individuals it was called 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.259
 the puzzle has 3,301 the mission was 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.050
 decipher the hidden secret message 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.090
 in an image with numbers and signs a 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.160
 man came to the end but it was not 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.930
 simple task 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.060
 joel ericsson is one of those beings 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.950
 intelligent that he came across with the message 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.680
 secret hidden under many 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.420
 unfortunately I did not see the image until 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.460
 after some time that it was 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.560
 originally published and therefore 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.960
 I had to catch up confessed 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.409
 ericsson a fas collapse a division of 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.470
 fast company ericsson Swedish researcher 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.420
 of cripto security of 34 years thought to the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.000
 principle that it would be nice to do this 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.310
 puzzle I've always been interested in 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.979
 everything that can challenge me and I never 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.110
 I give up in the case of the cicada 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.380
 the puzzle turned out to be much more than 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.610
 that I thought it would be when I started if I did not 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.470
 it was easy 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.720
 ericsson had to tackle the enigma with 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.269
 Stephen's knowledge or spell a 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.069
 special branch of cryptography 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:12.260
 understanding of Mayan numerology and something 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.900
 similar to cyberpunk fiction themes 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.880
 the investigation was not carried out only in 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.099
 the digital plane since he had to follow 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.340
 physical tracks that were placed in 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.780
 fliers in 14 cities in the end if it had 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.760
 to go back to the web but at the most 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.799
 deep of it point in phases 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.870
 collapse the first thing he had to do 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.760
 ericsson was to apply software 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.130
 steganography on the original image 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.060
 of the cicada and thus extract a message 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.470
 encoded 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.510
 that each figure or letter is 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.510
 corresponded actually with a letter 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.819
 totally different deciphered said 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.220
 message that was really a look at him 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.410
 placed this rule in your search engine 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.750
 internet and got another image but 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.970
 this time a duck used the same 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.709
 tools and got a code of 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.530
 book that took you to an address in 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.720
 network and that contained Mayan numbers in 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.580
 reddit an anonymous user left another 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.620
 series of messages encrypted under 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.269
 simple comments with this one could 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.720
 decipher the book and previously 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.980
 found more images under codes 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.080
 found that they were a chain 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.000
 of numbers made a number of 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.450
 phone that redirected to a voicemail 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.970
 from texas very well you've done great 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.620
 there are three prime numbers associated the 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.230
 final image jpg original 3.301 is one 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.959
 of them you will have to find the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.000
 two others multiply these three numbers 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.880
 together and add a com to find the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.430
 next step good luck goodbye 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.380
 ericsson managed to do the calculations and 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.450
 came to the expected url where he 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.880
 I was waiting for another image of cicada and a 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.220
 countdown when the countdown 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.350
 finished the image of the cicada was 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.080
 replaced by strings of digits that 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.700
 they seemed to the GPS coordinates the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.500
 coordinates led to poles 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.650
 telephone numbers in countries around the world 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.710
 even in spain ' russia united states 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.260
 France Japan, Poland in Spain 'the 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.030
 track was placed in pomegranate the 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.040
 Swedish engineer had to resort to 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.200
 other people in other countries to 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.020
 to be able to access the images as it does not 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.970
 you could afford that trip on the poles 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.450
 phones found fliers with 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.100
 images of cicadas and qr codes 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.950
 I scan the codes that led him to 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.750
 more images with hidden texts at the end 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.580
 again resorted to information from 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.950
 network and that ended at a direction of the 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.100
 anonymous network of thor all this in less 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.470
 three weeks however he led a 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.590
 great disappointment when the site arrived 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.150
 cicada 3.301 had written a message 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.010
 in which he criticized that they had 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.740
 formed groups to solve an enigma 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.199
 designed for one 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.139
 that's where the riddle came from was very 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.939
 disappointing said eriksson still not 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.449
 It knows who is the person behind 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:57.209
 3.301 it seems that this year it has 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.309
 put in place another good riddle 

00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:02.069
 friends, I hope you liked the 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:04.020
 video like and subscribe if you liked it and 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.179
 do not forget to comment on the video that 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.189
 they thought and if they like the idea of 

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:10.289
 this new theme for the channel to me 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:13.169
 it seems very interesting a bit of 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.059
 mystery in the channel jejejeje good me 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.449
 chao dismissal 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.449
