and<00:01:37.700> change<00:01:37.939> out<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:38.299> master<00:01:38.479> for<00:01:38.810> repelling

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
and change out the master for repelling

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.649 
and change out the master for repelling
overall<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:39.920> they<00:01:40.310> make<00:01:40.579> it<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:41.029> that<00:01:41.179> maybe

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
overall and they make it so that maybe

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.319 
overall and they make it so that maybe
will<00:01:41.899> benefit<00:01:42.319> a<00:01:42.349> little<00:01:42.679> bit<00:01:42.770> more<00:01:43.039> from<00:01:43.490> seal
