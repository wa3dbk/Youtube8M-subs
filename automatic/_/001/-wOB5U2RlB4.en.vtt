00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:26.110 
this as main I think and yeah first
turns<00:04:23.890> it<00:04:24.890> definitely<00:04:25.190> is<00:04:25.340> really<00:04:25.760> dry<00:04:26.090> and

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
turns it definitely is really dry and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.810 
turns it definitely is really dry and
Scratchy<00:04:26.690> does<00:04:27.080> need<00:04:27.290> some<00:04:27.410> Lube<00:04:27.590> in<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:30.820> yeah

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
Scratchy does need some Lube in it yeah

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.990 
Scratchy does need some Lube in it yeah
but<00:04:32.030> does<00:04:32.270> turn<00:04:32.540> really<00:04:32.690> nice<00:04:33.700> it<00:04:34.700> just<00:04:34.850> feels

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
but does turn really nice it just feels

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000 
but does turn really nice it just feels
like<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.210> quicker<00:04:35.600> or<00:04:35.930> faster<00:04:36.470> version<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.860> the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
like a quicker or faster version of the
