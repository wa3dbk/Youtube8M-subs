00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
I decided to leave it out and just pin

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.250 
I decided to leave it out and just pin
it<00:03:36.849> because<00:03:37.849> my<00:03:38.120> hair<00:03:38.359> is<00:03:38.510> a<00:03:38.540> little<00:03:38.780> shorter

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
it because my hair is a little shorter

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.750 
it because my hair is a little shorter
since<00:03:39.470> it's<00:03:39.680> layered<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.250> wouldn't<00:03:40.519> fit<00:03:40.669> in

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
since it's layered it wouldn't fit in

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.520 
since it's layered it wouldn't fit in
the<00:03:40.819> braid<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.150> yeah<00:03:41.599> you<00:03:41.660> just<00:03:41.930> pin<00:03:42.169> it<00:03:42.200> and

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
the braid so yeah you just pin it and

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.770 
the braid so yeah you just pin it and
there<00:03:43.130> you<00:03:43.340> go<00:03:43.579> pull<00:03:44.030> out<00:03:44.180> some<00:03:44.389> pieces<00:03:44.690> of
