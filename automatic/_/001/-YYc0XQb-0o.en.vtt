00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
maintenance on the Nitro motors now it's

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.970 
maintenance on the Nitro motors now it's
actually<00:00:06.779> not<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.200> whole<00:00:07.470> lot<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.799> maintenance

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
actually not a whole lot of maintenance

tune on it one of the primary things
you're<00:00:12.179> gonna<00:00:12.330> want<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.599> do<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:13.410> keep<00:00:13.620> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
you're gonna want to do is keep the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.400 
you're gonna want to do is keep the
motor<00:00:13.920> clean<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:15.150> showed<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.809> detail<00:00:16.289> if

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
motor clean we showed you in detail if

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.260 
motor clean we showed you in detail if
you<00:00:16.500> look<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:16.800> motor<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:17.910> take<00:00:18.090> them<00:00:18.210> out

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
you look at motor you can take them out

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.910 
you look at motor you can take them out
these<00:00:18.480> things<00:00:18.660> will<00:00:18.779> get<00:00:18.930> really<00:00:19.230> dirty<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.710> lot

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
these things will get really dirty a lot

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.429 
these things will get really dirty a lot
of<00:00:20.039> dust<00:00:20.250> mud<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.080> typically

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
of dust mud and all but we typically

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.890 
of dust mud and all but we typically
will<00:00:22.650> take<00:00:22.710> compressed<00:00:23.369> air<00:00:23.609> 409<00:00:24.600> or

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
will take compressed air 409 or

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.589 
will take compressed air 409 or
sometimes<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.550> greaser<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.789> each<00:00:27.060> time<00:00:27.330> after

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
sometimes a greaser and each time after

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.990 
sometimes a greaser and each time after
you're<00:00:27.720> done<00:00:27.900> running<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:29.429> soak<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.820> down

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
you're done running it just soak it down

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.030 
you're done running it just soak it down
take<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> compressed<00:00:31.050> air<00:00:31.320> spray<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.890> off

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
take the compressed air spray it off

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.190 
take the compressed air spray it off
that<00:00:32.309> allows<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.969> cooling<00:00:33.329> surface<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.050> heat

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that allows the cooling surface the heat

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.930 
that allows the cooling surface the heat
sinks<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.590> everything<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.950> stay<00:00:35.190> open<00:00:35.399> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
sinks and everything to stay open it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.240 
sinks and everything to stay open it
provide<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:37.110> cooling<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.890> intended

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
provide the cooling that it was intended

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
provide the cooling that it was intended
for<00:00:38.520> there's<00:00:39.180> also<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.510> glow<00:00:39.809> plug<00:00:40.079> think<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.530> it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
for there's also a glow plug think of it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.020 
for there's also a glow plug think of it
like<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> spark<00:00:41.219> plug<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.489> glow<00:00:41.790> plugs

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
like a spark plug and glow plugs

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.369 
like a spark plug and glow plugs
different<00:00:42.360> than<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> spark<00:00:42.780> plug<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.020> in

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
different than the spark plug just in

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.319 
different than the spark plug just in
regards<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> diesel<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.030> light

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
regards so it's like a diesel you light

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.510 
regards so it's like a diesel you light
it<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> started<00:00:45.899> once<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.890> lit<00:00:47.250> then

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it to get it started once it's lit then

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.880 
it to get it started once it's lit then
it<00:00:47.640> stays<00:00:47.940> lit<00:00:48.329> blow<00:00:49.320> plugs<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:49.739> last

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it stays lit blow plugs will last

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.439 
it stays lit blow plugs will last
anywhere<00:00:50.280> I've<00:00:50.489> seen<00:00:50.700> them<00:00:50.789> last<00:00:50.879> from<00:00:51.149> five

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
anywhere I've seen them last from five

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.350 
anywhere I've seen them last from five
seconds<00:00:52.020> right<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.680> say<00:00:53.280> five<00:00:53.670> months<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
seconds right on up to say five months a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.790 
seconds right on up to say five months a
lot<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.750> depends<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> tune<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
lot of that depends on the tune of the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.490 
lot of that depends on the tune of the
motor<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:57.360> environment<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.109> run<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
motor the environment that you run it in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.810 
motor the environment that you run it in
so<00:00:58.770> from<00:00:58.949> time<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> time<00:00:59.309> you've<00:00:59.670> got<00:00:59.789> to

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so from time to time you've got to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.340 
so from time to time you've got to
change<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.270> your<00:01:00.390> glow<00:01:00.539> plugs<00:01:00.809> whenever<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
change out your glow plugs whenever the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.500 
change out your glow plugs whenever the
