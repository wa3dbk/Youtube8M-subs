00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
game depth for sure our death we seem to

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.410 
game depth for sure our death we seem to
be<00:00:16.350> roll<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.830> anywhere<00:00:17.460> between<00:00:17.670> 10<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.119> 12

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
be roll and anywhere between 10 and 12

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.170 
be roll and anywhere between 10 and 12
players<00:00:18.720> per<00:00:18.990> game<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.640> we<00:00:20.640> like<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.880> play

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
players per game and we like to play

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.700 
players per game and we like to play
full<00:00:21.449> court<00:00:21.480> defense<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.320> lot<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.560> ball

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
full court defense a lot of ball

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.500 
full court defense a lot of ball
pressure<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.580> takes<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.910> lot<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.150> energy

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
pressure and that takes a lot of energy

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.870 
pressure and that takes a lot of energy
so<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.960> need<00:00:25.140> our<00:00:25.439> depth<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.789> it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
so we need our depth to do that and it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.810 
so we need our depth to do that and it
just<00:00:27.090> seems<00:00:27.830> we<00:00:28.830> don't<00:00:28.859> rely<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.189> anybody<00:00:29.609> for

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
just seems we don't rely on anybody for

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.080 
just seems we don't rely on anybody for
scoring<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:31.170> seem<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.309> people<00:00:32.640> step<00:00:32.910> up
