she<00:00:18.630> invented<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.289> namely<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.520> French<00:00:20.789> sly<00:00:21.240> I

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
she invented it namely the French sly I

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.269 
she invented it namely the French sly I
like<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.769> very<00:00:22.800> much<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.180> have<00:00:25.279> well

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
like it very much because I have well

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.730 
like it very much because I have well
very<00:00:26.970> slippery<00:00:27.449> hair<00:00:28.230> long<00:00:28.830> hair<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.519> it's

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
very slippery hair long hair so it's

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.880 
very slippery hair long hair so it's
kind<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.830> hard<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> French<00:00:32.730> twist

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
kind of hard to do a French twist

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.130 
kind of hard to do a French twist
actually<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.820> never<00:00:36.149> able<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> French

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
actually I was never able to do a French

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.700 
actually I was never able to do a French
twist<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.649> always<00:00:38.010> had<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.750> huge<00:00:39.750> bulge<00:00:40.230> on

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
twist I always had this huge bulge on

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.400 
twist I always had this huge bulge on
the<00:00:40.890> top<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:41.430> head<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.200> very

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the top of my head so it was not very

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.940 
the top of my head so it was not very
elegant<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.550> think<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.710> main

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
elegant and I think that is the the main

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.680 
elegant and I think that is the the main
goal<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.489> French<00:00:47.730> twist<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> very

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
goal of a French twist to have a very

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.670 
goal of a French twist to have a very
elegant<00:00:48.930> updo<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> learned<00:00:51.239> something

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
elegant updo but now I learned something

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.630 
elegant updo but now I learned something
that<00:00:53.719> can<00:00:54.719> give<00:00:54.960> me<00:00:55.079> something<00:00:55.350> similar<00:00:56.309> may

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that can give me something similar may

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.450
