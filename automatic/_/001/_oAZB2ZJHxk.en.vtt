are<00:00:10.349> going<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.769> be<00:00:10.889> diving<00:00:11.519> into<00:00:12.179> scripts<00:00:12.750> and

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
are going to be diving into scripts and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.470 
are going to be diving into scripts and
arguments<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.340> stuff<00:00:14.700> like<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.120> we're

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
arguments and stuff like that so we're

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.180 
arguments and stuff like that so we're
going<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> be<00:00:15.750> making<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.139> basic<00:00:16.379> calculator<00:00:16.710> in

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
going to be making a basic calculator in

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.210 
going to be making a basic calculator in
here<00:00:17.369> okay<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:17.840> basically<00:00:18.840> last<00:00:19.439> row<00:00:19.770> we<00:00:20.010> went

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
here okay so basically last row we went

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.990 
here okay so basically last row we went
up<00:00:20.460> briefly<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.330> if<00:00:21.630> else<00:00:21.810> ladders<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
up briefly on if else ladders and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000 
up briefly on if else ladders and
variables<00:00:24.000> right<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.930> today<00:00:25.590> what<00:00:25.890> we're

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
variables right so today what we're

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.470 
variables right so today what we're
going<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.580> we're<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.970> dive<00:00:27.210> into

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
going to do is we're going to dive into

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.790 
going to do is we're going to dive into
a<00:00:27.660> little<00:00:28.260> bit<00:00:28.410> more<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:29.510> what<00:00:30.510> game<00:00:31.080> maker<00:00:31.349> has

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
a little bit more of what game maker has

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.209 
a little bit more of what game maker has
specifically<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.450> engine<00:00:33.960> instead<00:00:34.890> of

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
specifically for the engine instead of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.580 
specifically for the engine instead of
what<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.329> other<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.410> can

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
what you know other you can what you can

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.580 
what you know other you can what you can
use<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:37.950> other<00:00:38.190> languages<00:00:38.790> right<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> I'm

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
use with other languages right so I'm

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.080 
use with other languages right so I'm
going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.739> go<00:00:40.829> ahead<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.309> quickly<00:00:41.760> create<00:00:41.910> an

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
going to go ahead and quickly create an

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.410 
going to go ahead and quickly create an
object<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> create<00:00:43.559> event<00:00:44.420> actually

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
object and in the create event actually

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.160 
object and in the create event actually
note<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> draw<00:00:46.230> event<00:00:47.239> yeah<00:00:48.239> go<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
note in the draw event yeah go to the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.260 
note in the draw event yeah go to the
control<00:00:49.530> tab<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.070> right<00:00:50.399> click<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.820> execute

control tab and right click on execute

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.580 
control tab and right click on execute
code<00:00:51.980> here<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.930> with<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> draw<00:00:55.289> tab

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
code here we are so with the draw tab

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
code here we are so with the draw tab
with<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> draw<00:00:56.850> event<00:00:57.000> what<00:00:57.390> we're<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
with the draw event what we're going to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.479 
with the draw event what we're going to
do<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.140> we're<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.800> draw<00:00:59.010> some<00:00:59.280> text

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
do is we're just going to draw some text

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.010 
do is we're just going to draw some text
right<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> we're<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.390> make<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> basic

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
right and we're going to make a basic

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.139 
right and we're going to make a basic
calculator<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.100> what<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.000> say

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
calculator so what you can do is say

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.230 
calculator so what you can do is say
draw<00:01:03.420> text<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.309> again<00:01:05.309> down<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
draw text and again down here the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.050 
draw text and again down here the
arguments<00:01:06.780> below<00:01:07.250> show<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.850> need

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
arguments below show you what you need

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.580 
arguments below show you what you need
so<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.360> makes<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:09.750> simple<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
so it makes it very simple so I get to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.340 
so it makes it very simple so I get to
say<00:01:10.770> ten<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:11.970> else<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> say<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> hundred<00:01:12.780> one

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
say ten or else to say a hundred one

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.490 
say ten or else to say a hundred one
hundred<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> string<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.409> what<00:01:16.409> I'm

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
hundred and then the string and what I'm

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.700 
hundred and then the string and what I'm
gonna<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.640> am<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.710> instead

of just say you know have a string and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.030 
of just say you know have a string and
then<00:01:23.700> close<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.030> off<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:25.439> gonna<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
am going to create a variable var num1

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.389 
am going to create a variable var num1
and<00:01:46.549> var<00:01:47.549> num2<00:01:48.140> now<00:01:49.140> basically<00:01:49.470> what<00:01:50.040> happens

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
and var num2 now basically what happens

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.740 
and var num2 now basically what happens
is<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.549> might<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.850> saying<00:01:51.090> yourself<00:01:51.450> why<00:01:51.720> are

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
is you might be saying yourself why are

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.800 
is you might be saying yourself why are
you<00:01:51.990> putting<00:01:52.259> valor<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.979> front<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.640> num1<00:01:53.880> num2

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you putting valor in front of num1 num2

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.950 
you putting valor in front of num1 num2
and<00:01:54.900> you<00:01:55.440> know<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:56.400> not<00:01:57.150> just<00:01:57.360> having<00:01:57.690> it<00:01:57.930> be

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and you know just not just having it be

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.640 
and you know just not just having it be
like<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.260> well<00:01:58.950> basically<00:02:00.440> what<00:02:01.440> this

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
like that well basically what this

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.780 
like that well basically what this
allows<00:02:01.979> me<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.220> do<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.560> have<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.340> put<00:02:05.520> var

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
allows me to do is I have if you put var

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.029 
allows me to do is I have if you put var
from<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.479> makes<00:02:06.720> num1<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.409> temporary

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
from here this makes num1 a temporary

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.180 
from here this makes num1 a temporary
variable<00:02:08.789> which<00:02:09.330> means<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.810> after<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.860> done

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
variable which means it after it's done

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.530 
variable which means it after it's done
going<00:02:11.610> through<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.880> code<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.450> to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
going through the code it's going to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.930 
going through the code it's going to
delete<00:02:12.780> itself<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.860> could<00:02:14.040> say<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.489> equals

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
delete itself so I could say this equals

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.580 
delete itself so I could say this equals
the<00:02:15.120> argument<00:02:15.620> 0<00:02:17.360> okay<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:19.110> equals<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the argument 0 okay and this equals the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.059 
the argument 0 okay and this equals the
argument<00:02:19.739> 1<00:02:21.170> now<00:02:22.170> what<00:02:22.380> we're<00:02:22.530> doing<00:02:22.560> here<00:02:23.010> is

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
argument 1 now what we're doing here is

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.490 
argument 1 now what we're doing here is
we're<00:02:23.250> setting<00:02:23.459> up<00:02:23.640> parameters<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:25.290> like

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
we're setting up parameters so just like

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.690 
we're setting up parameters so just like
in<00:02:25.739> our<00:02:25.830> draw<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.370> here<00:02:27.320> we<00:02:28.320> have<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.250> if<00:02:29.489> we

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
in our draw in here we have if we if we

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.210 
in our draw in here we have if we if we
click<00:02:29.910> on<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.209> we<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.510> XY<00:02:30.930> string<00:02:31.530> those

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
click on this we have XY string those

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.729 
click on this we have XY string those
are<00:02:32.489> three<00:02:32.970> parameters<00:02:33.300> for<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.470> function

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
are three parameters for this function

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.890 
are three parameters for this function
that<00:02:35.160> game<00:02:35.459> maker<00:02:35.670> already<00:02:36.120> had<00:02:36.390> in<00:02:36.630> its

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
that game maker already had in its

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.590 
that game maker already had in its
engine<00:02:37.489> so<00:02:38.489> right<00:02:38.730> here<00:02:39.030> if<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.239> click<00:02:39.390> on

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
engine so right here if we click on

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.050 
engine so right here if we click on
scripts<00:02:40.010> we're<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.220> need<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.489> put<00:02:41.730> two

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
scripts we're going to need to put two

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.860 
scripts we're going to need to put two
numbers<00:02:42.540> into<00:02:42.930> there<00:02:43.110> okay<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.250> now<00:02:45.239> we<00:02:45.660> can

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
numbers into there okay and now we can

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.190 
numbers into there okay and now we can
use<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.200> return<00:02:46.350> statement<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.580> return<00:02:48.200> num1

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
use the return statement so return num1

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.900 
use the return statement so return num1
plus<00:02:49.860> num2<00:02:52.280> basically<00:02:53.280> what<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.760> doing

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
plus num2 basically what this is doing

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.160 
plus num2 basically what this is doing
is<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.900> taking<00:02:55.760> our<00:02:56.760> two<00:02:57.269> variables<00:02:57.810> num1

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
is this is taking our two variables num1

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.330 
is this is taking our two variables num1
num2<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:59.299> returning<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.799> adding<00:03:01.799> adding<00:03:02.100> them

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
num2 and returning it adding adding them

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.699 
num2 and returning it adding adding them
together<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:03.000> returning<00:03:03.450> them<00:03:03.720> back<00:03:04.410> to

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
together and returning them back to

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.890 
together and returning them back to
where<00:03:04.980> we<00:03:05.190> originally<00:03:05.220> called<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.420> math

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
where we originally called the math

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.729 
where we originally called the math
script<00:03:07.760> ok<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.390> if<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:09.720> go<00:03:10.079> back<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> draw

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
script ok so if we go back in the draw

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.720 
script ok so if we go back in the draw
here<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:12.170> say<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.440> put<00:03:15.230> let's<00:03:16.230> say<00:03:16.730> answer

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
here and say I put let's say answer

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:25.400 
here and say I put let's say answer
equals<00:03:18.540> math<00:03:20.239> 100<00:03:21.239> 100<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:23.600> instead<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.870> a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
equals math 100 100 and instead of a

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.160 
equals math 100 100 and instead of a
string<00:03:26.280> here<00:03:26.579> what<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:26.940> can<00:03:27.209> say<00:03:27.359> a<00:03:27.390> string<00:03:27.930> and

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
string here what I can say a string and

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.229 
string here what I can say a string and
I'll<00:03:28.410> get<00:03:28.620> into<00:03:28.769> why<00:03:29.010> I'm<00:03:29.160> saying<00:03:29.609> string

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
I'll get into why I'm saying string

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.530 
I'll get into why I'm saying string
answer

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
answer

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.399 
answer
all<00:03:33.049> right<00:03:33.290> so<00:03:33.799> now<00:03:33.920> if<00:03:34.099> I<00:03:34.219> put<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.549> in<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.730> room

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
all right so now if I put it in a room

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:41.429 
all right so now if I put it in a room
we<00:03:36.409> should<00:03:36.769> see<00:03:37.250> 200<00:03:38.060> up<00:03:38.239> here

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.490 

just<00:03:42.439> let<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.560> compile<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:44.750> as<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.049> can<00:03:45.140> see<00:03:45.349> we

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
just let it compile so as you can see we

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.640 
just let it compile so as you can see we
now<00:03:45.680> have<00:03:45.709> 200<00:03:46.640> right<00:03:46.819> here<00:03:47.140> so<00:03:48.140> this<00:03:48.290> is<00:03:48.349> I

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
now have 200 right here so this is I

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.229 
now have 200 right here so this is I
want<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.040> know<00:03:49.099> fast<00:03:49.430> here<00:03:49.609> but<00:03:49.790> this<00:03:49.909> is<00:03:50.090> the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
want to know fast here but this is the

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.149 
want to know fast here but this is the
introduction<00:03:50.659> to<00:03:50.900> scripts<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.409> return

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
introduction to scripts and return

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.589 
introduction to scripts and return
statements<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:52.730> all<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:52.939> because<00:03:53.120> it<00:03:53.239> is

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
statements and all that because it is

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.990 
statements and all that because it is
very<00:03:53.659> important<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:55.010> what<00:03:55.310> we're<00:03:55.459> doing<00:03:55.489> is

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
very important so what we're doing is

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.940 
very important so what we're doing is
we're<00:03:56.269> taking<00:03:56.480> or<00:03:57.260> creating<00:03:57.650> a<00:03:57.709> variable

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
we're taking or creating a variable

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.819 
we're taking or creating a variable
named<00:03:58.340> answer<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:59.030> we're<00:03:59.930> equaling<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.650> to

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
named answer and we're equaling it to

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.459 
named answer and we're equaling it to
math<00:04:01.129> 100<00:04:02.060> 100<00:04:02.689> right<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.079> those<00:04:03.200> are<00:04:03.349> our

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:03.469 
math 100 100 right and those are our

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:05.410 
math 100 100 right and those are our
parameters<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:04.639> we<00:04:04.730> walk<00:04:04.939> so<00:04:05.329> we're

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
parameters so if we walk so we're

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.000 
parameters so if we walk so we're
basically<00:04:05.629> saying<00:04:05.900> add<00:04:06.170> 100<00:04:06.889> 100<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:09.010> since

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
basically saying add 100 100 so since

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.140 
basically saying add 100 100 so since
we're<00:04:10.250> equaling<00:04:10.879> answer<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:12.409> this<00:04:13.150> basically

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
we're equaling answer to this basically

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.400 
we're equaling answer to this basically
when<00:04:14.540> we<00:04:14.840> return<00:04:15.379> num1<00:04:16.099> plus<00:04:16.609> num2<00:04:17.410> this

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
when we return num1 plus num2 this

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.640 
when we return num1 plus num2 this
method<00:04:18.979> takes<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.120> value<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.840> whatever<00:04:21.199> it

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
method takes the value of whatever it

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.159 
method takes the value of whatever it
returned<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.849> it<00:04:23.030> senses<00:04:23.330> 200<00:04:23.720> 200<00:04:24.080> that's

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
returned so it senses 200 200 that's

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.320 
returned so it senses 200 200 that's
like<00:04:24.380> saying<00:04:24.910> answer<00:04:25.910> equals<00:04:26.270> 200<00:04:28.150> okay

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
like saying answer equals 200 okay

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.870 
like saying answer equals 200 okay
so<00:04:30.020> we<00:04:30.500> can<00:04:30.680> take<00:04:30.830> answer<00:04:31.250> we<00:04:31.400> can<00:04:31.520> equal<00:04:31.759> that

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
so we can take answer we can equal that

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.270 
so we can take answer we can equal that
to<00:04:32.030> math<00:04:32.240> 100<00:04:32.750> 100<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.199> then<00:04:33.500> print<00:04:34.039> that<00:04:34.099> out

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
to math 100 100 and then print that out

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.120 
to math 100 100 and then print that out
in<00:04:34.580> there<00:04:34.880> we<00:04:35.360> can<00:04:35.539> also<00:04:35.780> instead<00:04:36.740> of<00:04:36.800> doing

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
in there we can also instead of doing

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.370 
in there we can also instead of doing
that<00:04:37.159> we<00:04:37.490> can<00:04:37.610> say<00:04:37.789> math<00:04:38.530> 100<00:04:40.180> 100<00:04:41.229> instead<00:04:42.229> of

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
that we can say math 100 100 instead of

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.450 
that we can say math 100 100 instead of
actually<00:04:42.889> calling<00:04:43.220> it<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.949> variable<00:04:45.949> itself

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
actually calling it to a variable itself

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.899 
actually calling it to a variable itself
we<00:04:47.270> can<00:04:47.389> easily<00:04:47.960> just<00:04:48.770> put<00:04:49.250> that<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:49.639> the

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
we can easily just put that in the

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.760 
we can easily just put that in the
actual<00:04:50.120> statement<00:04:50.840> itself<00:04:52.300> so<00:04:53.440> again<00:04:54.440> this

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
actual statement itself so again this

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.730 
actual statement itself so again this
just<00:04:55.070> proves<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.880> when<00:04:56.120> you<00:04:56.270> return<00:04:56.419> it<00:04:56.960> the

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
just proves that when you return it the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.390 
just proves that when you return it the
function<00:04:58.580> does<00:04:58.849> equal<00:04:59.330> what<00:04:59.599> it<00:04:59.720> returns<00:05:00.400> but

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
function does equal what it returns but

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.070 
function does equal what it returns but
the<00:05:01.610> programmers<00:05:02.300> don't<00:05:02.419> generally<00:05:02.870> like<00:05:03.050> to

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
the programmers don't generally like to

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.279 
the programmers don't generally like to
do<00:05:03.320> this<00:05:03.470> because<00:05:03.710> of<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.610> fact<00:05:04.849> that<00:05:05.289> you

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
do this because of the fact that you

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.620 
do this because of the fact that you
know<00:05:06.409> you<00:05:06.860> can't<00:05:07.190> reuse<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:08.060> if<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.300> want<00:05:08.539> it

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
know you can't reuse it if you want it

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.540 
know you can't reuse it if you want it
to<00:05:08.720> get<00:05:08.960> whatever<00:05:09.260> this<00:05:09.590> answer<00:05:09.979> was<00:05:10.130> again

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
to get whatever this answer was again

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.170 
to get whatever this answer was again
then<00:05:11.330> you're<00:05:11.750> going<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:11.990> need<00:05:12.199> to<00:05:13.000> call<00:05:14.000> this

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
then you're going to need to call this

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.210 
then you're going to need to call this
method<00:05:14.389> again<00:05:14.780> instead<00:05:15.320> instead<00:05:15.830> if<00:05:15.949> you<00:05:15.979> just

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
method again instead instead if you just

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.330 
method again instead instead if you just
put<00:05:16.430> it<00:05:16.520> right<00:05:16.669> into<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:17.090> variable<00:05:17.570> itself<00:05:18.340> like

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
put it right into a variable itself like

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.529 
put it right into a variable itself like
answer<00:05:20.440> then<00:05:21.669> you<00:05:22.669> can<00:05:22.820> use<00:05:23.000> it<00:05:23.150> over<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.479> over

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
answer then you can use it over and over

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.029 
answer then you can use it over and over
and<00:05:23.780> over<00:05:23.810> again<00:05:23.990> but<00:05:24.500> I<00:05:24.560> didn't<00:05:24.770> see<00:05:24.860> if<00:05:24.949> we

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
and over again but I didn't see if we

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.869 
and over again but I didn't see if we
just<00:05:25.220> have<00:05:25.400> answer<00:05:25.789> here<00:05:26.060> so<00:05:26.630> we<00:05:26.750> run<00:05:26.960> it

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:29.879 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:35.549 

like<00:05:30.879> a<00:05:31.029> pile<00:05:31.289> we<00:05:32.289> get<00:05:32.439> 200<00:05:32.859> so<00:05:34.349> usually<00:05:35.349> what

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:35.559 
like a pile we get 200 so usually what

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:37.079 
like a pile we get 200 so usually what
you're<00:05:35.679> getting<00:05:35.919> what's<00:05:36.489> going<00:05:36.639> to<00:05:36.669> happen<00:05:36.969> is

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089 
you're getting what's going to happen is

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.909 
you're getting what's going to happen is
this<00:05:37.449> is<00:05:37.509> going<00:05:37.659> to<00:05:37.839> be<00:05:37.899> an<00:05:37.959> integer<00:05:38.259> so<00:05:38.619> just

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
this is going to be an integer so just

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.809 
this is going to be an integer so just
to<00:05:39.009> make<00:05:39.129> sure<00:05:39.159> if<00:05:39.639> you<00:05:40.179> want<00:05:40.479> to<00:05:41.669> it's<00:05:42.669> called

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
to make sure if you want to it's called

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.019 
to make sure if you want to it's called
a<00:05:42.999> caste<00:05:43.299> system<00:05:43.709> so<00:05:44.709> if<00:05:45.009> you<00:05:45.159> wanted<00:05:45.489> say<00:05:45.849> this

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
a caste system so if you wanted say this

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:51.679 
a caste system so if you wanted say this
was<00:05:46.209> a<00:05:46.239> was<00:05:46.779> a<00:05:47.669> baleen<00:05:48.669> or<00:05:48.969> a<00:05:49.419> you<00:05:49.929> know<00:05:50.049> a

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 
was a was a baleen or a you know a

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.389 
was a was a baleen or a you know a
integer<00:05:52.689> or<00:05:52.719> something<00:05:53.079> like<00:05:53.199> that<00:05:53.409> so<00:05:53.949> if<00:05:54.249> we

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:54.399 
integer or something like that so if we

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:57.719 
integer or something like that so if we
had<00:05:56.129> actually<00:05:57.129> no<00:05:57.219> that's<00:05:57.369> a<00:05:57.459> bad<00:05:57.579> example

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
had actually no that's a bad example

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.359 
had actually no that's a bad example
sorry<00:05:58.629> about<00:05:58.779> that<00:05:58.809> uh<00:05:58.989> so<00:05:59.589> all<00:05:59.859> right<00:06:00.279> yeah

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:00.369 
sorry about that uh so all right yeah

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:01.229 
sorry about that uh so all right yeah
I'll<00:06:00.489> just<00:06:00.549> show<00:06:00.759> you<00:06:00.789> about<00:06:00.909> the<00:06:01.029> caste

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:01.239 
I'll just show you about the caste

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:03.329 
I'll just show you about the caste
system<00:06:01.329> so<00:06:01.809> basically<00:06:02.289> if<00:06:02.589> we<00:06:02.619> have<00:06:03.039> this

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:03.339 
system so basically if we have this

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:04.859 
system so basically if we have this
answer<00:06:03.699> here<00:06:03.819> it's<00:06:04.059> a<00:06:04.119> balloon<00:06:04.419> or<00:06:04.449> something

00:06:04.859 --> 00:06:04.869 
answer here it's a balloon or something

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:06.689 
answer here it's a balloon or something
we<00:06:04.989> want<00:06:05.199> to<00:06:05.289> cast<00:06:05.499> it<00:06:05.769> to<00:06:05.889> a<00:06:05.919> string<00:06:06.309> because

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
we want to cast it to a string because

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.219 
we want to cast it to a string because
because<00:06:07.389> if<00:06:07.509> we<00:06:07.629> look<00:06:07.809> in<00:06:07.929> this<00:06:08.019> parameter

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
because if we look in this parameter

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.259 
because if we look in this parameter
here<00:06:08.439> it<00:06:08.769> needs<00:06:09.189> a<00:06:09.369> string<00:06:09.939> so<00:06:10.689> a<00:06:10.719> cast<00:06:11.199> is<00:06:11.499> just

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:12.269 
here it needs a string so a cast is just

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:15.209 
here it needs a string so a cast is just
basically<00:06:13.269> you<00:06:14.019> say<00:06:14.319> what<00:06:14.559> type<00:06:14.769> you<00:06:14.979> want<00:06:15.129> to

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
basically you say what type you want to

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:17.249 
basically you say what type you want to
put<00:06:15.399> it<00:06:15.519> and<00:06:15.639> then<00:06:15.729> and<00:06:16.119> then<00:06:16.479> you<00:06:16.629> surround<00:06:17.049> it

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 
put it and then and then you surround it

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.599 
put it and then and then you surround it
with<00:06:17.879> the<00:06:18.879> parentheses<00:06:19.569> here<00:06:20.249> all<00:06:21.249> right

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:21.609 
with the parentheses here all right

00:06:21.609 --> 00:06:24.179 
with the parentheses here all right
usually<00:06:22.239> in<00:06:22.419> other<00:06:22.659> languages<00:06:23.349> a<00:06:23.529> caste<00:06:23.919> would

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:24.189 
usually in other languages a caste would

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:26.489 
usually in other languages a caste would
actually<00:06:24.639> work<00:06:24.789> the<00:06:25.029> opposite<00:06:25.449> so<00:06:26.229> you<00:06:26.289> would

00:06:26.489 --> 00:06:26.499 
actually work the opposite so you would

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:29.969 
actually work the opposite so you would
have<00:06:26.649> to<00:06:26.859> put<00:06:27.299> string<00:06:28.299> in<00:06:28.539> in<00:06:29.019> parentheses<00:06:29.769> and

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
have to put string in in parentheses and

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:32.909 
have to put string in in parentheses and
then<00:06:30.159> have<00:06:30.459> the<00:06:30.699> answer<00:06:31.319> next<00:06:32.319> to<00:06:32.409> it<00:06:32.529> but

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
then have the answer next to it but

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.919 
then have the answer next to it but
that's<00:06:33.189> not<00:06:33.489> how<00:06:33.669> game<00:06:33.909> maker<00:06:34.119> works<00:06:34.419> cuz<00:06:34.749> it

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:34.929 
that's not how game maker works cuz it

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:37.799 
that's not how game maker works cuz it
likes<00:06:35.079> to<00:06:35.169> be<00:06:35.259> different<00:06:36.179> all<00:06:37.179> right<00:06:37.239> so

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:37.809 
likes to be different all right so

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:39.629 
likes to be different all right so
that's<00:06:37.959> a<00:06:38.199> very<00:06:38.499> very<00:06:38.769> basic<00:06:38.979> calculator

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
that's a very very basic calculator

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.509 
that's a very very basic calculator
where<00:06:40.059> I'm<00:06:40.209> going<00:06:40.329> to<00:06:40.389> be<00:06:40.449> going<00:06:40.719> more<00:06:40.929> into

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:41.519 
where I'm going to be going more into

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:46.399 
where I'm going to be going more into
functions<00:06:42.519> next<00:06:43.179> tutorial<00:06:43.689> but<00:06:44.289> basically

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:46.409 
functions next tutorial but basically

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:49.709 
functions next tutorial but basically
this<00:06:47.409> is<00:06:47.619> the<00:06:47.769> basics<00:06:48.249> on<00:06:48.419> scripts<00:06:49.419> and<00:06:49.599> all

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:49.719 
this is the basics on scripts and all

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:52.709 
this is the basics on scripts and all
that<00:06:49.899> stuff<00:06:50.199> so<00:06:50.229> we<00:06:50.499> called<00:06:50.860> our<00:06:51.239> script<00:06:52.239> we've

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:52.719 
that stuff so we called our script we've

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:55.619 
that stuff so we called our script we've
added<00:06:52.989> this<00:06:53.229> so<00:06:53.439> instead<00:06:53.709> of<00:06:54.249> putting<00:06:54.999> 100

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:55.629 
added this so instead of putting 100

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:58.769 
added this so instead of putting 100
what<00:06:55.809> if<00:06:55.899> we<00:06:56.019> say<00:06:56.319> you<00:06:57.069> know<00:06:57.189> a<00:06:57.219> thousand<00:06:57.789> and

00:06:58.769 --> 00:06:58.779 
what if we say you know a thousand and

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:04.490 
what if we say you know a thousand and
we<00:06:58.869> run<00:06:59.079> it

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.680 

1100<00:07:05.500> okay<00:07:05.979> so<00:07:06.639> that's<00:07:06.789> basically<00:07:06.850> and<00:07:07.300> you

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
1100 okay so that's basically and you

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.140 
1100 okay so that's basically and you
can<00:07:07.900> really<00:07:08.139> do<00:07:08.500> this<00:07:08.530> with<00:07:09.280> anything<00:07:09.580> so<00:07:09.940> say

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
can really do this with anything so say

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.029 
can really do this with anything so say
you<00:07:10.210> wanted<00:07:10.449> to<00:07:10.570> subtract<00:07:11.139> you<00:07:11.680> would<00:07:11.830> put<00:07:11.949> the

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 
you wanted to subtract you would put the

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:13.590 
you wanted to subtract you would put the
minus<00:07:12.340> sign<00:07:12.370> say<00:07:13.030> you<00:07:13.090> wanted<00:07:13.330> to<00:07:13.419> multiply

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:13.600 
minus sign say you wanted to multiply

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.140 
minus sign say you wanted to multiply
you<00:07:14.470> would<00:07:14.620> press<00:07:14.830> shift<00:07:15.220> and<00:07:15.460> then<00:07:15.759> an<00:07:15.850> eight

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150 
you would press shift and then an eight

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.550 
you would press shift and then an eight
key<00:07:16.570> on<00:07:16.840> your<00:07:17.830> keyboard<00:07:18.370> and<00:07:18.820> that<00:07:19.690> is<00:07:20.229> the

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
key on your keyboard and that is the

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.650 
key on your keyboard and that is the
multiplication<00:07:21.340> symbol<00:07:21.550> it's<00:07:21.850> not<00:07:22.030> X<00:07:22.270> or

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660 
multiplication symbol it's not X or

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.930 
multiplication symbol it's not X or
anything<00:07:22.870> like<00:07:23.110> that<00:07:23.169> okay<00:07:23.550> or<00:07:24.550> if<00:07:24.699> you<00:07:24.789> want

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940 
anything like that okay or if you want

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.779 
anything like that okay or if you want
to<00:07:25.030> divide<00:07:25.330> you<00:07:25.539> put<00:07:25.810> the<00:07:25.900> forward<00:07:26.199> slash

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:26.789 
to divide you put the forward slash

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:29.760 
to divide you put the forward slash
alright<00:07:27.789> so<00:07:28.570> that's<00:07:28.780> that's<00:07:29.110> the<00:07:29.380> foil<00:07:29.680> for

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.770
