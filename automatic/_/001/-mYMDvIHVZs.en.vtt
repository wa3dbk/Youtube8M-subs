00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that mount the engine to the frame those

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.940 
that mount the engine to the frame those
three<00:01:05.670> bolts<00:01:05.970> need<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> come<00:01:06.420> off<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:07.590> twelve

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
three bolts need to come off to twelve

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.789 
three bolts need to come off to twelve
millimeter<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.729> fourteen<00:01:09.240> millimeter

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
millimeter and one fourteen millimeter

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.039 
millimeter and one fourteen millimeter
it's<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.920> nut<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.280> bolt<00:01:11.490> combination<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.479> each

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
it's a nut and bolt combination on each

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.580 
it's a nut and bolt combination on each
side<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.860> you've<00:01:14.340> gotta<00:01:14.490> take<00:01:14.729> those<00:01:15.000> off

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
side so you've gotta take those off

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.350 
side so you've gotta take those off
because<00:01:16.590> actually<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> piece<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.880> comes<00:01:18.150> on

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
because actually the piece that comes on

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.499 
because actually the piece that comes on
to<00:01:18.540> GV<00:01:19.400> replaces<00:01:20.400> these<00:01:20.610> two<00:01:20.909> pieces<00:01:21.210> um<00:01:22.070> and

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
to GV replaces these two pieces um and

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.330 
to GV replaces these two pieces um and
matches<00:01:24.509> right<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> frame<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.320> those<00:01:26.189> are

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
matches right to the frame so those are

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.940 
matches right to the frame so those are
front<00:01:26.640> bolts<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.030> that's<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> back<00:01:27.570> bolt<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
front bolts and that's the back bolt and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.560 
front bolts and that's the back bolt and
you'll<00:01:29.100> need<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.060> order<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.360> put

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you'll need to do this in order to put

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.920 
you'll need to do this in order to put
the<00:01:30.659> jeebies<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> main<00:01:31.729> structural

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
the jeebies on that's a main structural

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.690 
the jeebies on that's a main structural
support<00:01:33.930> piece<00:01:34.140> here's<00:01:34.829> another<00:01:35.100> piece<00:01:35.369> it's

support piece here's another piece it's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.810 
support piece here's another piece it's
the<00:01:35.759> lower<00:01:35.970> frame<00:01:36.560> bolt<00:01:37.560> these<00:01:38.340> actually<00:01:38.790> I

I've already mounted the right side of
the<00:02:33.720> GV<00:02:34.170> crash<00:02:34.379> bar<00:02:34.709> two<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.459> front<00:02:35.640> bolts

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
the GV crash bar two to the front bolts

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.699 
the GV crash bar two to the front bolts
they're<00:02:36.360> actually<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.080> amount<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.379> just<00:02:37.560> put

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
they're actually the amount to just put

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.130 
they're actually the amount to just put
the<00:02:37.769> bolt<00:02:37.950> through<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.549> hold<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.910> up<00:02:39.140> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
the bolt through just to hold it up and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.630 
the bolt through just to hold it up and
I'm<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.470> letting<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.950> lay<00:02:41.099> there<00:02:41.340> I'm<00:02:41.489> not

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
I'm just letting it lay there I'm not

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.759 
I'm just letting it lay there I'm not
tightening<00:02:42.030> everything<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:43.019> think<00:02:43.650> it's

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
tightening everything I think it's

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.170 
tightening everything I think it's
better<00:02:43.920> if<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.220> take<00:02:44.549> all<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> bolts

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
better if you just take all the bolts

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.199 
better if you just take all the bolts
off<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:45.780> put<00:02:46.079> it<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.319> there<00:02:46.349> loosely<00:02:47.209> and

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
off and just put it up there loosely and

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.180 
off and just put it up there loosely and
then<00:02:48.450> tighten<00:02:48.840> all<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:48.959> bolts<00:02:49.200> once<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.069> get

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
then tighten all the bolts once you get

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.490 
then tighten all the bolts once you get
everything<00:02:50.400> together<00:02:50.640> now<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.230> comes

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
point of the GV right side crash bar so

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.479 
point of the GV right side crash bar so
I<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.629> put<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.019> through<00:03:13.290> now<00:03:14.040> once<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.340> get

I just put that through now once you get
both<00:03:14.670> sides<00:03:14.879> on<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.540> course<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.079> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
both sides on of course this is the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.420

center<00:03:16.440> piece<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.680> got<00:03:16.799> little<00:03:17.010> bushings

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
center piece you got little bushings

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.530 
center piece you got little bushings
there<00:03:17.609> I<00:03:17.639> guess<00:03:17.880> there<00:03:18.030> were<00:03:18.120> some<00:03:18.299> issues

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.830 
bolts and it pulls the front pieces
together<00:03:40.799> once<00:03:41.760> again<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:42.000> did<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.359> loosely

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
together once again I did this loosely

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.059 
together once again I did this loosely
to<00:03:42.930> make<00:03:43.079> sure<00:03:43.230> everything<00:03:43.590> else<00:03:43.680> would<00:03:43.889> match

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
to make sure everything else would match

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.089 
to make sure everything else would match
up<00:03:44.180> now<00:03:45.180> here<00:03:45.750> in<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.079> back<00:03:46.290> part<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.919> told

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
up now here in the back part and I told

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.890 
up now here in the back part and I told
you<00:03:47.220> before<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.549> had<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.819> top<00:03:48.030> gun<00:03:48.299> chain<00:03:48.630> guard

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
you before I had the top gun chain guard

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.250 
you before I had the top gun chain guard
there

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
there

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.470 
there
well<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.739> comes<00:03:50.489> with<00:03:50.609> a<00:03:50.669> washer<00:03:50.849> I've<00:03:51.180> decided

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
well I comes with a washer I've decided

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.420 
well I comes with a washer I've decided
not<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.780> use<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.169> washer<00:03:52.650> because<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.160> top

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
not to use the washer because the top

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.759 
not to use the washer because the top
gun<00:03:53.669> piece<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.180> bigger<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:55.440> should<00:03:55.650> give

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
gun piece is bigger and that should give

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.470 
gun piece is bigger and that should give
you<00:03:55.889> enough<00:03:56.130> spacing<00:03:56.669> I<00:03:56.760> thought<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.239> it

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
you enough spacing I thought and it

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.539 
you enough spacing I thought and it
actually<00:03:57.660> ended<00:03:57.989> up<00:03:58.049> being<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.410> case<00:03:58.739> once<00:03:59.430> I

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
actually ended up being the case once I

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.920 
actually ended up being the case once I
tighten<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.940> bolts<00:04:00.239> up<00:04:00.389> so<00:04:00.599> there<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:00.750> have<00:04:00.810> a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
tighten the bolts up so there I have a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.089 
tighten the bolts up so there I have a
day<00:04:01.079> of<00:04:01.200> loosely<00:04:01.410> with<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.709> watch<00:04:01.829> without

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
day of loosely with the watch without

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.190 
day of loosely with the watch without
the<00:04:02.340> washer<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.299> using<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.660> top<00:04:03.900> gun

the washer and just using the top gun

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.240 
the washer and just using the top gun
brace<00:04:04.680> as<00:04:05.069> my<00:04:05.910> point<00:04:06.329> connect<00:04:06.810> there<00:04:07.169> now<00:04:07.980> here

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
brace as my point connect there now here

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.860 
brace as my point connect there now here
we<00:04:08.370> are<00:04:08.400> I'm<00:04:08.760> showing<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.239> crossmember

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
we are I'm showing you the crossmember

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.500 
we are I'm showing you the crossmember
the<00:04:10.560> crossmember<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.669> goes<00:04:11.910> up<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.480> down

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
the crossmember it goes up and down

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.789 
the crossmember it goes up and down
that's<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.560> piece<00:04:13.799> there<00:04:14.099> um<00:04:15.289> if<00:04:16.289> there's

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
that's the piece there um if there's

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.140 
that's the piece there um if there's
only<00:04:16.950> there's<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.430> couple<00:04:17.669> ways<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:17.849> can<00:04:17.940> do<00:04:18.120> it

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
only there's a couple ways you can do it

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.789 
only there's a couple ways you can do it
but<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.599> know<00:04:18.750> if<00:04:18.989> once<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.289> put<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:19.650> is

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
but you know if once you put it in is

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.500 
but you know if once you put it in is
pretty<00:04:20.160> intuitive<00:04:20.489> as<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:20.910> can<00:04:21.060> see<00:04:21.180> it's<00:04:21.329> up

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
pretty intuitive as you can see it's up

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.230 
pretty intuitive as you can see it's up
and<00:04:21.719> down<00:04:21.900> based<00:04:22.680> on<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.070> right<00:04:23.250> there<00:04:23.550> just

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
and down based on the right there just

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.969 
and down based on the right there just
trying<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.599> show<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:24.840> how<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.289> fits<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.710> there

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
trying to show you how it fits in there

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.010 
trying to show you how it fits in there
at<00:04:26.190> best

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
at best

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.760 
at best
then<00:04:28.020> what<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.290> did<00:04:28.380> was<00:04:28.590> once<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.340> got<00:04:29.490> that<00:04:29.670> in<00:04:29.880> I

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
then what I did was once I got that in I

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.280 
then what I did was once I got that in I
aligned<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.190> made<00:04:32.430> sure<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.640> was<00:04:32.880> right

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
aligned it and made sure it was right

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.990 
aligned it and made sure it was right
and<00:04:34.290> then<00:04:34.440> of<00:04:34.560> course<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:35.130> got<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.400> hex<00:04:35.700> bolt

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
and then of course I got the hex bolt

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.640 
and then of course I got the hex bolt
out<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.510> comes<00:04:36.720> with<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.960> kit<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:37.320> mean<00:04:37.500> all

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
out that comes with the kit I mean all

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.560 
out that comes with the kit I mean all
these<00:04:37.800> bolts<00:04:38.010> come<00:04:38.220> with<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.430> kit<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:39.450> hex

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
these bolts come with the kit the hex

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.300 
these bolts come with the kit the hex
bolt<00:04:39.750> that<00:04:39.870> came<00:04:39.990> with<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.200> kit<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.560> just<00:04:40.650> put

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
bolt that came with the kit and just put

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.610 
bolt that came with the kit and just put
it<00:04:41.430> in<00:04:41.550> there<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.090> it<00:04:42.540> is<00:04:42.570> self<00:04:43.080> threading<00:04:43.530> on

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
it in there and it is self threading on

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.320 
it in there and it is self threading on
the<00:04:43.710> reverse<00:04:43.980> side<00:04:44.160> there's<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.460> nut<00:04:44.670> welded<00:04:45.090> to

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
the reverse side there's a nut welded to

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.710 
the reverse side there's a nut welded to
the<00:04:45.360> bottom<00:04:45.840> of<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.650> crossmember<00:04:47.250> there<00:04:47.720> and

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
the bottom of the crossmember there and

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.020 
the bottom of the crossmember there and
it<00:04:48.870> sets<00:04:49.080> right<00:04:49.230> up<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:49.920> is<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.250> six

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
it sets right up that is a six

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.300 
it sets right up that is a six
millimeter<00:04:51.410> allen<00:04:52.410> wrench<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.980> works<00:04:53.160> on

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
millimeter allen wrench that works on

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.160 
millimeter allen wrench that works on
that<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.120> can<00:04:54.300> see<00:04:54.330> I'm<00:04:54.570> just<00:04:54.810> showing<00:04:55.050> you

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
that so you can see I'm just showing you

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.290 
that so you can see I'm just showing you
how<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.350> how<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.950> fits<00:04:56.700> and<00:04:57.000> everything

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
how it how it fits and everything

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.050 
how it how it fits and everything
matches<00:04:58.110> up<00:04:58.290> there<00:04:58.560> and<00:04:59.040> marries<00:04:59.520> up<00:04:59.730> and<00:04:59.910> just

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
matches up there and marries up and just

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.390 
matches up there and marries up and just
you<00:05:00.240> know<00:05:00.300> just<00:05:00.390> put<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.750> together<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:02.160> there

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
you know just put it together and there

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.670 
you know just put it together and there
you<00:05:02.430> go<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:02.970> there<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:03.870> is<00:05:04.050> everything's

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
you go and there it is everything's

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.800 
you go and there it is everything's
pretty<00:05:04.890> much<00:05:05.010> loose<00:05:05.400> at<00:05:05.550> this<00:05:05.700> point<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.300> made

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
pretty much loose at this point I made

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.690 
pretty much loose at this point I made
sure<00:05:06.990> everything<00:05:07.200> fit<00:05:07.680> nothing<00:05:07.950> was<00:05:08.220> touching

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
sure everything fit nothing was touching

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.160 
sure everything fit nothing was touching
and<00:05:08.880> then<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.030> went<00:05:09.300> through<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:09.780> I<00:05:10.020> guess

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
and then I went through and I guess

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.900 
and then I went through and I guess
maybe<00:05:10.410> around<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.980> bike<00:05:11.130> maybe<00:05:11.370> two<00:05:11.610> or<00:05:11.730> three

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
maybe around the bike maybe two or three

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.240 
maybe around the bike maybe two or three
times<00:05:12.090> just<00:05:12.870> tightening<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.830> little<00:05:14.130> by

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
times just tightening it little by

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
you can see the two pieces that come

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.840 
you can see the two pieces that come
across<00:06:20.610> in<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:21.180> front<00:06:21.830> of<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:23.040> GV<00:06:23.400> system

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
across in the front of the GV system

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.510 
across in the front of the GV system
that<00:06:24.510> gives<00:06:24.840> you<00:06:24.960> some<00:06:25.220> strength<00:06:26.220> there

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
across the sides of the member that

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.660 
across the sides of the member that
actually<00:06:29.370> attached<00:06:30.150> to<00:06:30.480> there<00:06:30.630> down<00:06:30.840> to<00:06:31.670> where

actually attached to there down to where

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.750 
actually attached to there down to where
the<00:06:32.850> engine<00:06:33.390> is<00:06:33.740> connected<00:06:34.740> and<00:06:35.190> secured<00:06:35.640> to

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
the frame and now we'll go over to the

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.310 
the frame and now we'll go over to the
left<00:06:39.360> side

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
left side

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.420 
left side

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
again okay guys so here's the left side

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.100 
again okay guys so here's the left side
of<00:06:44.700> the<00:06:45.330> bike<00:06:45.480> again<00:06:45.780> once<00:06:46.020> again

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
of the bike again once again

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.410 
of the bike again once again
everything's<00:06:46.620> complete<00:06:47.070> and<00:06:47.310> tight<00:06:47.550> as<00:06:47.820> you

everything's complete and tight as you

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.870 
everything's complete and tight as you
can<00:06:48.450> see<00:06:48.660> if<00:06:48.780> it's<00:06:49.050> really<00:06:49.440> close<00:06:49.830> to<00:06:49.890> the<00:06:50.340> left

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
can see if it's really close to the left

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.000 
can see if it's really close to the left
side<00:06:51.060> fairing<00:06:51.570> they're<00:06:51.800> covering<00:06:52.800> the

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
side fairing they're covering the

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.340 
side fairing they're covering the
radiator<00:06:53.480> here<00:06:54.480> we<00:06:54.570> are<00:06:54.600> on<00:06:54.780> the<00:06:54.870> right<00:06:55.020> side

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
radiator here we are on the right side

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.780 
radiator here we are on the right side
of<00:06:55.500> course<00:06:55.680> there's<00:06:55.830> no<00:06:55.920> radiator<00:06:56.280> and<00:06:56.460> said

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:56.790 
of course there's no radiator and said

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.060 
of course there's no radiator and said
but<00:06:57.120> of<00:06:57.210> course<00:06:57.450> it<00:06:57.660> fits<00:06:57.840> well<00:06:58.140> and<00:06:58.440> hangs

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
but of course it fits well and hangs

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.550 
but of course it fits well and hangs
pretty<00:06:59.400> close<00:06:59.610> and<00:06:59.850> tight<00:07:00.350> once<00:07:01.350> again<00:07:01.530> I

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
pretty close and tight once again I

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.870 
pretty close and tight once again I
didn't<00:07:01.860> have<00:07:01.950> any<00:07:02.070> problems<00:07:02.490> with<00:07:02.640> it<00:07:02.670> the

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
didn't have any problems with it the

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.700 
didn't have any problems with it the
only<00:07:03.090> issue<00:07:03.300> I<00:07:03.450> had<00:07:03.720> of<00:07:04.110> course<00:07:04.410> was<00:07:04.590> the

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
only issue I had of course was the

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.700 
only issue I had of course was the
finish<00:07:05.070> on<00:07:05.670> the<00:07:05.970> crinkling<00:07:06.450> there<00:07:06.710> but

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710 
finish on the crinkling there but

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.430 
finish on the crinkling there but

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
excited about it can't wait to go out
