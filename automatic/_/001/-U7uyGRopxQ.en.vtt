when<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.740> run<00:00:07.859> around<00:00:08.010> town<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.520> see<00:00:08.639> these

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
when you run around town you see these

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.240 
when you run around town you see these
cars<00:00:09.090> with<00:00:09.629> these<00:00:09.900> really<00:00:10.080> massive<00:00:10.590> fart<00:00:10.949> cans

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
cars with these really massive fart cans

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.980 
cars with these really massive fart cans
on<00:00:11.430> the<00:00:11.490> back<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.940> them<00:00:12.119> and<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.449> exhaust<00:00:12.779> is

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
on the back of them and the exhaust is

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.930 
on the back of them and the exhaust is
this<00:00:13.170> huge<00:00:13.889> diameter<00:00:14.459> and<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.609> ask<00:00:14.789> yourself

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
this huge diameter and you ask yourself

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000 
this huge diameter and you ask yourself
you<00:00:15.240> know<00:00:15.359> that<00:00:15.389> little<00:00:16.109> engine<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:16.710> need

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
you know that little engine really need

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.400 
you know that little engine really need
all<00:00:17.189> that<00:00:17.340> exhaust<00:00:17.760> diameter<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.930> really<00:00:19.290> make

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
all that exhaust diameter so really make

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.800 
all that exhaust diameter so really make
that<00:00:19.590> big<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> difference<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.160> power<00:00:20.810> luckily

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
that big a difference in power luckily

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.750 
that big a difference in power luckily
we've<00:00:21.960> got<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.200> dyno<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:23.100> know<00:00:23.190> we<00:00:23.610> could

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
we've got a dyno you know we could

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.150 
we've got a dyno you know we could
actually<00:00:23.910> see<00:00:24.240> does<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.539> make<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.690> difference

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
actually see does it make a difference

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.240 
actually see does it make a difference
find<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:26.310> today<00:00:30.650> we've<00:00:31.650> got<00:00:31.770> a<00:00:31.830> straight

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
find out today we've got a straight

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.099 
find out today we've got a straight
through<00:00:32.550> three<00:00:32.879> inch<00:00:33.090> vibrant<00:00:33.690> muffler<00:00:33.960> here

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:34.109 
through three inch vibrant muffler here

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.180 
through three inch vibrant muffler here
and<00:00:34.199> the<00:00:34.260> great<00:00:34.409> thing<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.679> the<00:00:34.890> vibram

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and the great thing about the vibram

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.639 
and the great thing about the vibram
muffler<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.969> you've<00:00:36.239> got<00:00:36.449> a<00:00:36.749> resonator<00:00:37.499> you

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
muffler is you've got a resonator you

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.410 
muffler is you've got a resonator you
can<00:00:37.800> take<00:00:37.949> in<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.249> out<00:00:38.339> of<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:38.609> right<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
can take in and out of here right and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.439 
can take in and out of here right and
you<00:00:39.870> would<00:00:39.960> think<00:00:40.519> this<00:00:41.519> resonator<00:00:41.999> zone<00:00:42.239> is

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
you would think this resonator zone is

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:43.910 
you would think this resonator zone is
two<00:00:42.749> and<00:00:42.839> a<00:00:42.899> half<00:00:43.019> inch<00:00:43.260> that's<00:00:43.469> pretty<00:00:43.739> damn

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
two and a half inch that's pretty damn

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.700 
two and a half inch that's pretty damn
big<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.309> begin<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.629> 2-liter<00:00:46.140> turbo

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
big to begin with and on a 2-liter turbo

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.229 
big to begin with and on a 2-liter turbo
car<00:00:46.920> isn't<00:00:47.069> really<00:00:47.339> going<00:00:47.429> to<00:00:47.489> make<00:00:47.639> that<00:00:47.819> big

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
car isn't really going to make that big

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.969 
car isn't really going to make that big
a<00:00:48.269> difference

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:49.979 
a difference

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:51.379 
a difference
we'll<00:00:50.249> find<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.579> we'll<00:00:50.760> put<00:00:50.909> on<00:00:50.999> the<00:00:51.089> dyno<00:00:51.269> and

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:51.389 
we'll find out we'll put on the dyno and

00:00:51.389 --> 00:01:01.869 
we'll find out we'll put on the dyno and
find<00:00:51.659> out

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.770 

if<00:01:02.359> you<00:01:02.480> look<00:01:02.629> at<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.809> first<00:01:02.989> run<00:01:03.519> for<00:01:04.519> making

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
if you look at the first run for making

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.300 
if you look at the first run for making
270<00:01:05.780> horsepower<00:01:06.439> here

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
270 horsepower here

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.310 
270 horsepower here
all<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.360> way<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.479> redline<00:01:08.720> we're<00:01:09.020> not<00:01:09.110> making

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
all the way to redline we're not making

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.730 
all the way to redline we're not making
a<00:01:09.380> whole<00:01:09.439> lot<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.650> boost<00:01:09.920> running<00:01:10.820> about<00:01:11.740> 1314

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
a whole lot of boost running about 1314

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.160 
a whole lot of boost running about 1314
pounds<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.280> boost<00:01:13.400> on<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.299> car<00:01:14.509> right<00:01:14.720> now<00:01:14.869> and

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
pounds of boost on the car right now and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.770 
pounds of boost on the car right now and
this<00:01:15.920> is<00:01:16.040> without<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.280> restrictor<00:01:16.909> torques

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
this is without the restrictor torques

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.139 
this is without the restrictor torques
maxing<00:01:18.500> out<00:01:18.649> at<00:01:19.750> 210<00:01:21.670> so<00:01:22.670> we're<00:01:22.820> not<00:01:22.909> changing

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
maxing out at 210 so we're not changing

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.460 
maxing out at 210 so we're not changing
anything<00:01:23.390> on<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.780> car<00:01:23.930> we're<00:01:24.049> just<00:01:24.200> changing

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
anything on the car we're just changing

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.950 
anything on the car we're just changing
one<00:01:24.770> variable<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.430> that's<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:26.420> resonator

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
one variable and that's that resonator

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.200 
one variable and that's that resonator
and<00:01:27.530> seeing<00:01:27.860> what<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.490> differences<00:01:28.909> in<00:01:29.060> power

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
and seeing what the differences in power

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.300 
and seeing what the differences in power
that<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:29.600> going<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:29.750> make<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.130> we're

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
that it's going to make so now we're

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.310 
that it's going to make so now we're
putting<00:01:31.430> this<00:01:31.640> resonator<00:01:32.149> in<00:01:32.330> place<00:01:32.570> and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
putting this resonator in place and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.930 
putting this resonator in place and
let's<00:01:33.740> see<00:01:33.860> what<00:01:34.069> big<00:01:34.369> of<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.520> difference<00:01:34.640> it

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
let's see what big of a difference it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.730 
let's see what big of a difference it
makes<00:01:35.119> only<00:01:35.479> two<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:35.899> half<00:01:36.050> inch<00:01:36.289> I<00:01:36.470> mean<00:01:36.619> it

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
makes only two and a half inch I mean it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.740 
makes only two and a half inch I mean it
should<00:01:37.490> be<00:01:37.580> enough<00:01:37.819> to<00:01:37.909> carry<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.179> lot<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.450> power

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
should be enough to carry a lot of power

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:52.910 
should be enough to carry a lot of power
we'll<00:01:39.289> see

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.109 

you<00:01:53.920> can<00:01:54.070> see<00:01:54.189> that<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.430> clear<00:01:54.670> leaders

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
you can see that the clear leaders

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.789 
you can see that the clear leaders
difference<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.840> it's<00:01:55.930> all<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.469> way<00:01:56.560> across

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
difference and it's all the way across

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:57.480 
difference and it's all the way across
the<00:01:57.100> board

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
the board

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.139 
the board
I<00:01:57.579> mean<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:58.420> boost<00:01:58.689> is<00:01:58.990> significantly<00:01:59.649> lower

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
I mean the boost is significantly lower

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.469 
I mean the boost is significantly lower
here<00:02:01.149> where<00:02:01.689> we've<00:02:01.840> got<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.110> restrictor<00:02:02.590> or

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
here where we've got the restrictor or

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.020 
here where we've got the restrictor or
resonator<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.470> exhaust<00:02:05.909> pretty<00:02:06.909> much

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
resonator and the exhaust pretty much

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.210 
resonator and the exhaust pretty much
across<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.329> board<00:02:07.659> for<00:02:07.840> horsepower<00:02:08.349> and<00:02:08.619> it's

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
across the board for horsepower and it's

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.190 
across the board for horsepower and it's
relatively<00:02:09.640> across<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.119> board<00:02:10.330> for<00:02:10.959> torque

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
relatively across the board for torque

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.640 
relatively across the board for torque
also<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.280> know<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:12.880> mean<00:02:12.970> if<00:02:13.209> it's<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:14.500> got

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
also so you know I mean if it's it's got

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.960 
also so you know I mean if it's it's got
a<00:02:14.680> bigger<00:02:14.920> exhaust<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.550> probably<00:02:15.819> going<00:02:15.910> to

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
a bigger exhaust it's probably going to

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.270 
a bigger exhaust it's probably going to
make<00:02:16.090> more<00:02:16.300> power<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.319> magnitude<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.099> what's

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
make more power the magnitude is what's

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.070 
make more power the magnitude is what's
going<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.459> be<00:02:18.580> different<00:02:19.000> whether<00:02:19.840> you're

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
going to be different whether you're

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.020 
going to be different whether you're
dealing<00:02:20.260> with<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.620> naturally<00:02:20.950> aspirated<00:02:21.030> car

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
dealing with the naturally aspirated car

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.000 
dealing with the naturally aspirated car
or<00:02:22.239> turbo<00:02:22.540> car<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:22.989> obviously<00:02:23.410> on<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.650> turbo

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
or turbo car but obviously on a turbo

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.180 
or turbo car but obviously on a turbo
car<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.489> makes<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.239> big<00:02:25.959> difference<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.620> this

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
car it makes a big difference and this

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.860 
car it makes a big difference and this
is<00:02:27.310> with<00:02:27.459> all<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.790> exhaust<00:02:28.030> going<00:02:28.660> through

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
is with all the exhaust going through

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.750 
is with all the exhaust going through
the<00:02:28.959> catalytic<00:02:29.380> converter<00:02:29.560> even<00:02:30.370> those<00:02:30.489> three

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
the catalytic converter even those three

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.710 
the catalytic converter even those three
inch<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.120> free-flowing

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
inch and free-flowing

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.420

all<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.349> way<00:02:32.440> through<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.799> muffler<00:02:33.099> what

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
all the way through that muffler what

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.759 
all the way through that muffler what
we're<00:02:33.549> gonna<00:02:33.640> do<00:02:33.819> next<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.620> understand<00:02:35.620> the

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
we're gonna do next is understand the

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.860 
we're gonna do next is understand the
effect<00:02:36.099> of<00:02:36.250> whether<00:02:36.700> or<00:02:36.849> not<00:02:36.940> having<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.360> cat<00:02:37.630> is

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
effect of whether or not having a cat is

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.960 
effect of whether or not having a cat is
a<00:02:37.900> good<00:02:38.140> thing<00:02:38.319> for<00:02:38.680> having<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.190> wastegate

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
a good thing for having a wastegate

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.900 
a good thing for having a wastegate
vented<00:02:40.780> back<00:02:41.230> into<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.680> exhaust<00:02:41.950> or<00:02:42.549> straight

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
vented back into the exhaust or straight

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.160 
vented back into the exhaust or straight
out<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.209> atmosphere<00:02:43.599> is<00:02:43.660> going<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.840> make<00:02:43.959> much

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
out the atmosphere is going to make much

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.750 
out the atmosphere is going to make much
more<00:02:44.349> power<00:02:44.560> will<00:02:45.099> be<00:02:45.220> interesting<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.549> see

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
more power will be interesting to see

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.930 
more power will be interesting to see
what<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:45.940> difference<00:02:46.239> is<00:02:46.480> empowered
