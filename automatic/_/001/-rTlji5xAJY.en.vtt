00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
always do double are you make a large

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:41.720 
always do double are you make a large
quantity<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.559> make<00:00:40.769> it<00:00:40.890> makes<00:00:41.250> sense<00:00:41.460> doesn't

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
quantity I make it makes sense doesn't

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.979 
quantity I make it makes sense doesn't
it<00:00:41.940> because<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.329> you're<00:00:42.449> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.870> go

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it because if you're going to have to go

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.299 
it because if you're going to have to go
through<00:00:43.019> the<00:00:43.350> whole<00:00:43.440> process<00:00:43.679> that's<00:00:44.160> right

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
through the whole process that's right

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.220 
through the whole process that's right
it<00:00:44.489> doesn't<00:00:44.850> take<00:00:44.969> any<00:00:45.210> more<00:00:45.420> time<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:46.079> do

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it doesn't take any more time to do

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
it doesn't take any more time to do
double<00:00:46.559> yeah<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.429> stored

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
double yeah and it can be stored

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180
