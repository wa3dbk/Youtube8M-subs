like I said he got a somehow got
transported<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.770> future

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.800 

so<00:03:44.659> now<00:03:44.780> they<00:03:45.019> have<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.560> new<00:03:45.620> goal<00:03:46.370> try<00:03:46.879> to<00:03:47.629> try

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
so now they have a new goal try to try

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.369 
so now they have a new goal try to try
to<00:03:47.870> find<00:03:49.330> whatever<00:03:50.330> kind<00:03:50.659> of<00:03:50.780> equipment

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
remains of the teleportation of ice

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.680 
remains of the teleportation of ice
hopefully<00:03:55.580> they<00:03:55.700> can<00:03:55.849> fix<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.120> up<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.450> send

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
hopefully they can fix it up and send
