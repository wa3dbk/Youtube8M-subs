this<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.680> uh<00:02:13.710> I<00:02:14.100> think<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> fifty<00:02:15.000> dollar

extra<00:02:15.420> charge<00:02:15.780> but<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.710> makes<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.070> scissor<00:02:17.310> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
extra charge but it makes the scissor a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.850 
extra charge but it makes the scissor a
