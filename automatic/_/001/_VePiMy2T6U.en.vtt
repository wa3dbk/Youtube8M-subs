you<00:01:05.659> know<00:01:05.720> now<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:06.770> way<00:01:06.920> they're<00:01:07.100> actually

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
you know now this way they're actually

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.180 
you know now this way they're actually
going<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.550> defend<00:01:07.880> aspire<00:01:08.780> in<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.590> earlier

rounds<00:01:10.250> both<00:01:10.790> teams<00:01:11.030> were<00:01:11.210> just<00:01:11.390> getting

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
rounds both teams were just getting

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.930 
rounds both teams were just getting
totally<00:01:11.750> wiped<00:01:12.140> at<00:01:12.350> mid<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:12.860> there's<00:01:13.640> no<00:01:13.790> way

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
totally wiped at mid and there's no way

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.460 
totally wiped at mid and there's no way
you<00:01:14.000> can<00:01:14.330> defend<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.720> second<00:01:15.050> point<00:01:15.170> when<00:01:15.409> you

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
you can defend the second point when you

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.530 
you can defend the second point when you
get<00:01:15.619> wiped<00:01:15.800> like<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:16.270> that's<00:01:17.270> really<00:01:17.509> a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
get wiped like that that's really a

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.210 
get wiped like that that's really a
crucial<00:01:17.899> part<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.140> this<00:01:18.229> game<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:18.680> knowing

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
crucial part of this game is knowing

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.160 
crucial part of this game is knowing
when<00:01:19.430> you're<00:01:20.000> just<00:01:20.240> too<00:01:20.450> weak<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:20.840> just<00:01:21.020> have

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
when you're just too weak and just have

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.710 
when you're just too weak and just have
to<00:01:21.350> fall<00:01:21.530> back<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:22.630> complexity<00:01:23.630> is

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
to fall back and complexity is

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.830 
to fall back and complexity is
particularly<00:01:24.380> good<00:01:24.649> about<00:01:24.920> that<00:01:25.750> some<00:01:26.750> of

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
particularly good about that some of

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.680 
particularly good about that some of

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.090 
their matches from ESEA invite
particularly<00:01:29.690> my<00:01:30.350> memory<00:01:30.619> of<00:01:30.710> them<00:01:30.860> playing

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
particularly my memory of them playing

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.460 
particularly my memory of them playing
on<00:01:31.220> follower<00:01:31.700> versus<00:01:32.570> mob<00:01:32.780> gaming<00:01:33.229> when<00:01:33.350> they

on follower versus mob gaming when they

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.900 
on follower versus mob gaming when they
were<00:01:33.560> still<00:01:33.770> in<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.890> league<00:01:34.070> they<00:01:34.670> probably

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
were still in the league they probably

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.880 
were still in the league they probably
lost<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.360> mid<00:01:35.539> fight<00:01:35.780> four<00:01:36.350> or<00:01:36.470> five<00:01:36.649> times

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
lost the mid fight four or five times

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.430 
lost the mid fight four or five times
but<00:01:37.340> just<00:01:37.520> every<00:01:37.820> round<00:01:38.030> work<00:01:38.840> their<00:01:39.050> way<00:01:39.200> back

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
but just every round work their way back

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
little bit early when they were trying

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.380 
little bit early when they were trying
to<00:02:03.380> defend<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.890> spire<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:04.460> think<00:02:04.579> plexi<00:02:05.180> got

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
to defend the spire so I think plexi got

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.749 
to defend the spire so I think plexi got
taken<00:02:05.630> from<00:02:05.869> surprise<00:02:06.430> light<00:02:07.430> coming<00:02:07.729> through

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
taken from surprise light coming through

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.330 
taken from surprise light coming through
the<00:02:07.850> valley<00:02:08.119> like<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.950> carnage<00:02:09.950> going<00:02:10.190> down

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
the valley like that carnage going down

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.250 
the valley like that carnage going down
again<00:02:10.610> but<00:02:10.790> he<00:02:10.850> takes<00:02:11.030> out<00:02:11.239> black<00:02:11.480> star<00:02:11.780> it's<00:02:12.200> a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
again but he takes out black star it's a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.030 
again but he takes out black star it's a
fair<00:02:12.470> trade<00:02:12.500> for<00:02:12.980> complexity<00:02:14.860> now<00:02:15.860> they're

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
fair trade for complexity now they're

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.600 
fair trade for complexity now they're
just<00:02:16.070> going<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.400> set<00:02:16.610> their<00:02:16.790> set<00:02:17.600> their<00:02:17.750> way<00:02:17.870> up

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
just going to set their set their way up

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.250 
just going to set their set their way up
got<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> slight<00:02:20.060> uber<00:02:20.450> advantage<00:02:20.989> over

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
got a slight uber advantage over

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.110 
got a slight uber advantage over
complexity<00:02:22.190> but<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.519> about<00:02:22.700> ten<00:02:22.970> percent

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
complexity but it's about ten percent

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.710 
complexity but it's about ten percent
which<00:02:23.570> is<00:02:23.750> really<00:02:24.019> nothing<00:02:25.120> but<00:02:26.120> again<00:02:26.690> just

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
which is really nothing but again just

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.780 
which is really nothing but again just
being<00:02:27.079> nice<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.260> cautious<00:02:27.709> with<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.100> taking

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
being nice and cautious with it taking

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:39.530 
being nice and cautious with it taking
the<00:02:28.880> time<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.269> get<00:02:29.420> into<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:31.360> house

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.030 

now<00:02:40.540> setting<00:02:40.840> up<00:02:40.900> upper<00:02:41.260> lobby<00:02:41.440> here<00:02:41.740> they<00:02:41.890> got

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
now setting up upper lobby here they got

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.770 
now setting up upper lobby here they got
hoover<00:02:42.370> but<00:02:42.640> complexity<00:02:43.600> does<00:02:43.750> as<00:02:43.930> well<00:02:48.780> again

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
hoover but complexity does as well again

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.120 
hoover but complexity does as well again
just<00:02:49.960> get<00:02:50.170> everybody<00:02:50.470> buffed<00:02:50.890> up

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
just get everybody buffed up

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.160 
just get everybody buffed up
