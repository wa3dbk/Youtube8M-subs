00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 fossil curiosities along the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.140
 history some findings were very 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.970
 so common that their fossils fill 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.700
 shelves in thousands of museums around 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.160
 of the world while others were 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.560
 almost unique and rare discoveries that 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.840
 they left us a few point remains 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 now we will detail quickly just 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 some curious cases about fossils 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.470
 found iguanodÃ³n morning if 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 let's go back in time and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.300
 we will travel to europe it is very likely that 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.130
 we would meet with one a herd of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 iguanodon or possibly also 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.920
 auroux planteos and both species were 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.960
 really common in this place in the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.270
 last century they came to find 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.140
 nothing more nor less than 38 copies 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.629
 of iguanodon in 1878 in the mine

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.930
 depth of 322 meters however the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.270
 that had been a genre exclusively 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.579
 European began to be identified in 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.340
 everyone with material from 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.890
 Africa finding teeth in tunisia and in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.020
 other parts of the sahara desert 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.750
 also in Mongolian

 North Dakota from South Dakota the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.560
 iguanodon the cota itself went away 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.200
 subsequently reassigned to the genre of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.850
 many adventurers and scientists that go 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.890
 on expeditions to the gobi desert in 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.159
 Mongolia in search of new findings 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.469
 rare although you hear incredible many 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.869
 sometimes they despise the fossil remains of 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.670
 the proto cedatos this since it 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.709
 they are scattered all over the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.229
 desert even the experts 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.420
 Americans call them sheep of 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.689
 cretaceous for being such a dinosaur 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.509
 common in 1922 a scientific expedition 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.090
 that was looking for human ancestors in 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.860
 the gobi desert of mongolia 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.090
 headed by the explorer 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.270
 american roy chapman andrews 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.799
 found the first remains was the

 group photographer 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.140
 jb shackleford the one who got 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.679
 find the abundant giants of the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.239
 big sauropods the camarasaurus 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.670
 camarasaurus and diplodocus were 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.970
 possibly the most common 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.099
 they have been discovered in utah utah great 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.940
 amounts of fossil remains of all 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.130
 these dinosaurs since 1979 have been 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.440
 found more than 10 skeletons of ones 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.390
 Auroux being complete or almost 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.390
 complete what makes it one of the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.580
 best known sauropod lived in what 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.370
 that today is asia and it got to measure up to 12 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.920
 meters long 5 tall and despite 8 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.440
 tons was small compared to the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.380
 sauropods that appeared later as 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.269
 the rare fish brachiosaurus the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.239
 baryonyx is one of the most important findings 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:51.920
 rare to the present have been found 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.989
 very few remains in 1983 a hunter of 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.480
 fossil amateur william walker 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.299
 he found a huge claw that jutted out 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.519
 from a clay well in surrey with the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.890
 help from other people proceeded to 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.590
 extract the rest of the specimen that 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.660
 I found practically intact the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.120
 skeleton was given to undertake 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.190
 the excavation of alan j charlie and angel 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.270
 makes doctors from the museum of 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.190
 london's natural history 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.760
 they published their description of 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.650
 type specimen in 1986 and they gave him the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.440
 name of baryonyx walker and the new one 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.330
 species in honor of walker recovered 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.090
 around 70 percent of the 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.010
 skeleton included the skull others 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.410
 remains have been found in Spain ' 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.670
 Niger and Portugal but none has been 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.790
 complete remains 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.890
 the solitary 6 not saurus only 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.440
 have found three fossil remains of 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.350
 this dinosaur leaving very few clues 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.850
 how the type species could live 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.400
 sure sauro salinenses was described in 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.710
 1979 by the doctor apele of the three 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.770
 specimens that are known among them 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.930
 the or the type and a 100 80 that consist 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.360
 in a jaw member pelvis 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.700
 posterior scapula cora coidh is a 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.590
 incomplete previous member and vertebrae 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.360
 you also know new ones that were 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.310
 recovered should affect this is already 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.490
 vita n mongolia and in training and 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.560
 base band of the Chinese inner Mongolia 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.900
 This dinosaur was 7 meters long 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.239
 and had a small head in relation to 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.930
 their size their front legs were 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.300
 short 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.350
 in three fingers with sharp claws and
