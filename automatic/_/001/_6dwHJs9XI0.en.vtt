 delivery of free games for pc in this 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.090
 occasion is presented the gta san andreas 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.220
 and good to say about the gta san andreas 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.140
 a game that surely most of 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.990
 you will know if you do not 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.089
 you will have heard about it and it is about 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.179
 one of the greatest classics the 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:24.390
 playstation video games the ipc of the 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:26.999
 not a few years ago and I think that 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.579
 yes famous because of its originality the 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.279
 freedom that he also had the tricks 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.620
 that made the game have many 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.990
 more possibilities and good the truth that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.240
 it's a forado and I'm not going to teach you 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.920
 I can climb 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.630
 well the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.470
 go to the description appears in the 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.810
 video and enter the link that is left or 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.820
 will take them to force again since the 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.240
 game is the file that contains the 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.030
 game weighs half a giga and well 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.080
 it allowed me to step on in order to finish it 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.330
 then read here where you can 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.210
 download if you do not have an account 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.620
 do quickly and if not and if the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.089
 you have already made it, you simply see 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.089
 here where you can download free 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.920
 and then choose the destination I'm going to 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.820
 choose the desktop and keep it 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.360
 well here it puts me that it's going to take about 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.640
 20 minutes 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.710
 if I'm good I cut the video and we continue 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.710
 when when it has been downloaded 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.140
 well then once with the file 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.510
 downloaded this will appear and you will vote 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.770
 right click and extract here to 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.000
 unzip the file 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.439
 well the file weighs about 500 megabytes 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.670
 it seems but then when really 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.880
 have the game installed will occupy 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.289
 do not follow 4 gigas approximately 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 it's good to keep it in mind for the subject 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.799
 of computer space and all that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.560
 because I did not catch you by surprise 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.390
 say well once extracted you can already 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.420
 throw the compressed file that no longer 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.149
 it's worth nothing and open the folder that 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.899
 llama san andreas the first of all 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.149
 so 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.759
 executes and sixth the point excel the only 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.500
 what inside 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.730
 good and this with this what are you going to 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.560
 do is start the installation of the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.210
 I play as I told you because it takes 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.550
 a while and 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.560
 and it occupies then that look here puts it 4 with 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.670
 7 gigas 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.970
 good for it here in exploring good 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.410
 you give to extract without more and you wait for 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.410
 let this be done 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.640
 well as before this will take a 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.209
 ratillo so when I finish what 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.209
 continue with the video 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.160
 Well, once you have finished 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.760
 create all the files and all the 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.650
 folders and select these 2 good 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.420
 be kid and this folder the one that 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.060
 called patch to keep I do not know what not 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.790
 I know how many and the gta san andreas you be 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.620
 Files are worth the two of us 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.800
 we drag inside the folder that 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.040
 well the other folder does not 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.600
 Now what you do is give double 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.400
 click on the file that is called 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.260
 patch to save games and listen 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.700
 the radio and good as the name says is 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.640
 for that not so you can save the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.180
 games and everything double click 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.480
 good and then to see here where he puts 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.280
 parco flee that would be like destiny 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.750
 where you have the folder in this case I 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.050
 I have a desk because the desk 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.850
 san andreas and accept 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.580
 do not give him to install 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.750
 even so since you give wii for all 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.750
 as if to everything 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.950
 and this once I have done that to you already 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.480
 you will have the gta san andreas installed in 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.210
 the computer correctly you can already 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.320
 play good before you can teach 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.840
 I'm going to make a couple of 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.150
 recommendations first of all the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.560
 This folder that weighs you 4 with 7 GB 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.020
 like leaving a desk is not 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.630
 very good idea if they are recommended 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.790
 open start and write here where you put 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.290
 the app percentage data search 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.900
 percentage liza intro and you take the 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.840
 folder then with all the others 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.030
 well once here because you can open it 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.359
 and look for the file called gta 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.940
 bar low that exe point and then you give it 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.280
 right button and create shortcut 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.710
 then you get the direct access 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.140
 have you been to the desktop and you can be 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.409
 the folder and well this would be the game 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.990
 I also know the name and you put 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:40.170
 andreas for example 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.030
 and then once once you have it 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.760
 I'm going to show you how the game is saved 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.770
 that has no option to save good 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.640
 so you do not have a program, I'm going to 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.930
 teach how to do 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.930
 The first you have the game 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:01.770
 Well wait a bit to load you 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.770
 the issue this before starting the game 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.210
 well, it really does not take long 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.060
 start I had it in play 2 and has 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.090
 delayed more the truth 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.630
 You see here to start new game 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.630
 departure 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.159
 OK 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.479
 now just start you are going to put the 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.659
 first good mission puts them in a 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:32.990
 video I do not know what law escapes and what mitis 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:34.370
 or the left whatever it is then the 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.419
 controls I will leave them to you that 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.969
 the Uncover the truth not 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.500
 It has a lot of mystery to be able to get on the 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:43.620
 bike goes up with the f 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.310
 and vice to good follow the route that I 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.310
 I will continue not 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.790
 you have to go to the house that you 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.790
 appears on the map 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:02.300
 would this be worth to buy it now or 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.610
 I want you to buy it is for 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.930
 so you can keep at it worth 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.729
 Since you do not have money, I'm going to tell you 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.259
 quick trick to have a lot of 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:13.639
 money would be to write that and that already 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.190
 I'm going to put it on the screen so that 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.720
 do not have a problem, well, as you see 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.090
 the money has raised me and now you put 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.180
 above the logo this weird and hence 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.150
 The father did not catch the 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.550
 tabulator forgiveness the one on top of 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.670
 the uppercase the key s 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.670
 and good exposes purchased property 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:38.240
 and then you can enter inside 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.240
 your house 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:46.180
 and look for the floppy s to save the 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:48.849
 starting simply you give him and good of 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.569
 merged to save 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:54.089
 about writing you give to accept and already 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:56.439
 you are already your saved game 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:58.209
 Well, that was everything, I hope that 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:00.849
 I have served you and you enjoy the 

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:02.800
 game that the truth that is very good and 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:06.240
