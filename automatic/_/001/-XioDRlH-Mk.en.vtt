00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.600
 what trans people cost is because I know 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.040
 very good today see gÃ¼icho 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.720
 welcome to this new video in the 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.550
 which we are going to analyze the trailer that 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.779
 came out recently from black ops 2 what 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.920
 posted on the Facebook page by 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.450
 that's important for me to follow in 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.740
 facebook to keep them 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.630
 informed good try to keep them 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.990
 informed out there so we 're not going to 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.520
 start 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.900
 analyzing the trailer I will be going 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.609
 in moments in which I mean 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.990
 something I will explain more or less 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.460
 good giving my point of view about what 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.390
 what's happening then well let's go 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.460
 there 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.800
 well then what we started with is 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.809
 with a place with a name and with a 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.750
 date the place says bolt the name 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.120
 says sergeant frank goode his sms we do not 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.020
 I have not quite sure what that means and 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.570
 the date that is very important 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.730
 June, but from 2025, that is, all this 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.620
 game is developed in the future 13 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.210
 years after the current year in which 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.579
 we are this is good that a 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.659
 image which I do not know very well that is 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.920
 try to put a little more brightness 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.030
 but likewise I do not distinguish anything 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.980
 leave me in the comments you 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.380
 they distinguish something like we follow 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.600
 here comes out wood comes out hand with his 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.770
 tattoo is saying something that good 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.120
 well, that other life dedicated to what he 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.700
 it says well that someone is not going to 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.930
 worry a lot about what you are saying 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.050
 so here is the symbol of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.490
 treyarch these there well here you see a 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.050
 helicopter like that is landing in 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.120
 this building here you see the guys 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.820
 controlling the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.990
 so here here high this tank will 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.090
 they are putting a lot of emphasis on the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.410
 trailer so pay attention to what 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.130
 what's going to happen next with the third one in 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.360
 dry tank et is this plane too 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.460
 it's okay to pay a little attention 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.220
 see how it is because later it will 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.810
 be something interesting about this I know 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.580
 how are they destroying buildings these 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.840
 drones and here you see the first are like 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.520
 that is something of perspective in first 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.220
 person who are jet why we're going to 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.810
 have the ability to control 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.370
 jets or good I do not know if these in jet 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.170
 look like it's something like a robot a 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.490
 good jet here is that we are going to have in the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.570
 opportunity to control this because 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.250
 well this is in the first person and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.110
 Also , if you are here right now 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.000
 the left says press elevate to 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.620
 follow or press lv to continue 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.240
 all good to follow the squadron 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.620
 to follow everyone then we go to 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.420
 be able to control this I'm not too sure 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.649
 that it's me I think that's going to be something 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.210
 as well as a robot or a robot 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.560
 flying or something like that but I do not know 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.020
 we'll see later, let's continue with the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.880
 trailer that's a lot of technology like that 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.580
 like that holograms looks like in 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.020
 x-ray these robots the tanks other 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.060
 once the drones 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.980
 you still see everything the whole city is 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.020
 you see lots of airplanes there 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.700
 a lot of tanks and a lot of this 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.520
 robot will then if there will be 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.950
 lots of technology then here high 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.810
 this plane had come out in a picture of 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.950
 call of duty dotcom that many believe 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.210
 that he was a child he lived he can see that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.700
 it's not a level and because you see that it's a 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.530
 plane which can maneuver a lot myself 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.000
 I think making a plane on second attack 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.980
 something reaper type but a little more 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.110
 direct more aggressive I do not know here what 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.790
 we can see more closely is not it is not a 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.010
 wine is such a simple plane but good 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.300
 we will see later that it is here we continue 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.680
 You can see the poster to the right that 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.330
 says the angels that is all this 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.330
 war is developed in the angels 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.250
 california we follow 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.170
 although you see that these see you screaming 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.240
 the police here you see another jet very 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.950
 interesting this image looks like a jet it 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.750
 see in perspective first person what 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.820
 which makes me believe that we are going to have the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.040
 good ability the possibility saying 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.870
 again to control jets this 7 is very 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.910
 similar to one of banfield or good to 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.680
 they took field then I think call of 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.370
 Duty but on the many ideas we are going to 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.890
 can have greater greater this good 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.870
 more game mode one more model this 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.790
 wider then very interesting 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.960
 these looks like it's like he 's 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.000
 attacking here I know that I am in the 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.530
 helicopter caisse from the perspective 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.030
 perspective from the front this 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.530
 pistolita this pistolita that do a lot 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.600
 approach that in the trailer looks like that 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.100
 it is close, it is the same pistol to me 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.980
 seem to my opinion, say that 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.540
 they think it's on the cover of black 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.860
 ops is the gun that the wey is 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.350
 stopping everyone seems like this gun 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.810
 is going to have an important role in this 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.910
 game another good we'll see the same here 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.650
 in this bato that is the only human to 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.180
 what that emphasis on the trailer I think 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.770
 that is going to be the protagonist my theory 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.330
 is that son of wood is his son of mason 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.650
 or something like that but well I say 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.950
 that has a lot of relationship with some of 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.390
 the two 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.390
 you have to be the glass covering 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.490
 keep boots saying things and I think that 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.240
 this is the protagonist again as 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.240
 which is on the top 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.060
 you still see a lot of destruction the 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.440
 vato running helicopters here high 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.389
 it seems that this is how the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.370
 control screen of some kind of 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.449
 plane I say that something like this is done 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.190
 a previous style something like that 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.020
 it's going to be something that we 're going to 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.789
 can control and then what can we 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.560
 again the tank with legs buoys the 30 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.240
 that with that enemy's legs why 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.919
 because you see that he is always attacking 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.750
 also here you can also see how 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.169
 that a jet from a totally perspective 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.479
 different not controlled but different 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.860
 then we are going to follow him to see here something 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.620
 very interesting that I know of the drones 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.060
 here this is seen the little horses and 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.529
 you see a first person perspective 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.509
 controlling a little horse then 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:57.060
 we will also be able to ride caballitos 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.520
 We will be able to be this do not know how 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.710
 says in Spanish but mounts horses is 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.180
 from here here high you can see also another 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.189
 time a screen like that of control of 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.680
 shots of some plane that shoots and at 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.680
 final if you are aware says x 47 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.729
 or something like this pegasus 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.740
 so good here you can see a little 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.710
 more closely that says x 47 pegasus kill 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.379
 55 it was very strange to me that this came out 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.819
 so I came for this x 47 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.129
 pegasus because good to be left without 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.919
 important contract and the surprise comes 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.449
 that this little plane was this teddy bear or 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.430
 something like something similar obviously not 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.099
 it's exactly the same but the 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.509
 same here it's very similar I tell you it's not 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.240
 totally the same but it is very very 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.220
 seemed then let's continue 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.130
 it's the same plus planes plus drones the 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.860
 protagonist and the future is black 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.810
 whites 2 la la la la la 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.330
 and if that was the whole trailer a trailer 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.729
 quite interesting a trailer that 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.319
 who is telling us is telling us 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.090
 attacking to say to my opinion that each 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.400
 adult was going to be totally innovative 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.650
 both not in graphics obviously therefore 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.060
 but so much in technology you should never 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.740
 have sweet carlos so technological 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.470
 I'm disappearing almost almost a halo 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.590
 not so much is not so advanced but it is 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.229
 a very innovative idea in the saga 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.000
 of call of duty then to me by 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.169
 I 'm very interested in the first time 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.280
 game I say to myself before I see this 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:18.750
 trailer interested me in the least 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.250
 this the campaign or good the campaign without 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.199
 more than anything I do not care much but 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.150
 seeing this, seeing that the environment has 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.800
 developed in a very technological year 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.840
 in a year of which the war depends 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.360
 totally the technology then this 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.780
 call of duty this is thrilling me 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.539
 A lot is the first time I tell you that 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.069
 I'm waiting so much in call of duty 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.300
 so then let's hope everything is 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:40.680
 as they put it in the trailer because 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.449
 normally in the trailers they put them 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.490
 things in a way that are not 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.870
 in the black ops trailer the campaign 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.400
 I saw chingÃ³n system so that in the end 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.050
