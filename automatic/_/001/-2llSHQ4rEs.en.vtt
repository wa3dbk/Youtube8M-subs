00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
website link will be most likely in the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.660 
website link will be most likely in the
description<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.119> download<00:00:27.390> dump<00:00:27.960> jar<00:00:28.800> now<00:00:29.490> as

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
description and download dump jar now as

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.980 
description and download dump jar now as
you<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:29.880> see<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> title<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.810> for

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
you can see in the title this is for

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.500 
you can see in the title this is for
both<00:00:31.109> Mac<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.470> PC<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.969> reason<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.420> this

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
both Mac and PC the reason for this

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.310 
both Mac and PC the reason for this
being<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.989> because<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> dot<00:00:34.680> jar<00:00:35.040> file<00:00:36.320> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
being is because it's a dot jar file and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410 
being is because it's a dot jar file and
yep<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.860> download<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.670> I've<00:00:39.000> already<00:00:39.149> got<00:00:39.360> it

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
yep so download that I've already got it

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.209 
yep so download that I've already got it
downloaded<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.110> basically<00:00:40.469> how<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.920> works

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
downloaded and basically how this works

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.000 
downloaded and basically how this works
is<00:00:41.579> because<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> Mac<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.469> go<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
is because I'm on a Mac or go to the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
is because I'm on a Mac or go to the
roaming<00:00:44.370> folder<00:00:46.340> minecraft<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.510> see

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
roaming folder minecraft and you see

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.869 
roaming folder minecraft and you see
you've<00:00:48.780> got<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.020> last<00:00:49.350> login<00:00:49.680> file<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.700> it's

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you've got this last login file but it's

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.279 
you've got this last login file but it's
gibberish<00:00:51.300> when<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.690> try<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.989> open<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.260> with

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
gibberish when you try and open it with

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.340 
gibberish when you try and open it with
TextEdit<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.149> things<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:55.079> see

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
TextEdit or things like that now see

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.080 
TextEdit or things like that now see
this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.860> want<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.430> move<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.940> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
this is what you want so move that to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.979 
this is what you want so move that to
trash<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.730> basically<00:00:59.910> does<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.629> it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
trash so what this basically does is it

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.270 
trash so what this basically does is it
decrypt<00:01:01.949> D<00:01:02.850> ciphers<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.899> UM<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:07.020> file<00:01:07.290> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
decrypt D ciphers the UM the file so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.000 
decrypt D ciphers the UM the file so
that<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.729> um<00:01:09.170> um<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:10.799> your

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that you can um um see what your

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.130 
that you can um um see what your
password<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.570> need<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
password is now what you need for this

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.640
