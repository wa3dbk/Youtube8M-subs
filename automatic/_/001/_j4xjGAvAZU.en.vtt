real quick of change of subject you see

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.670 
real quick of change of subject you see
where<00:03:33.299> my<00:03:33.390> elbows<00:03:33.510> not<00:03:33.870> fully<00:03:34.110> extending

where my elbows not fully extending
that's<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.130> problem<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.670> have<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.030> have<00:03:36.239> to

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
that's the problem that I have I have to

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.789 
that's the problem that I have I have to
have<00:03:36.510> another<00:03:36.690> surgery<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.200> correct<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.590> but

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
have another surgery to correct that but

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.280 
have another surgery to correct that but
look<00:03:37.980> at<00:03:38.100> my<00:03:38.250> lat<00:03:38.519> how<00:03:39.060> I'm<00:03:39.209> fully<00:03:39.540> extending
