whatever you call it and next to her and
I'm<00:00:43.440> actually<00:00:43.620> gonna<00:00:43.920> predict<00:00:44.399> his<00:00:44.579> switch

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
I'm actually gonna predict his switch

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.760 
I'm actually gonna predict his switch
how<00:00:45.090> that's<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.629> gonna<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.649> air

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
how that's what I'm gonna go for the air

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.920 
how that's what I'm gonna go for the air
/<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.789> doesn't<00:00:48.149> quite<00:00:48.239> kill<00:00:48.600> him<00:00:48.719> which<00:00:48.809> is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
/ and it doesn't quite kill him which is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.270 
/ and it doesn't quite kill him which is
unfortunate<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.770> thought<00:00:49.980> he's<00:00:50.160> gonna

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
unfortunate because I thought he's gonna

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.369 
unfortunate because I thought he's gonna
switch<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.300> he<00:00:51.449> does<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.809> he<00:00:51.960> goes<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
switch out but he does and he goes for a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.080 
switch out but he does and he goes for a
nice<00:00:52.590> meme<00:00:52.860> though<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.250> thought<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> had<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
nice meme though I thought I had the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.850 
nice meme though I thought I had the
focus<00:00:54.449> sash<00:00:54.629> but<00:00:54.930> luckily<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.189 
focus sash but luckily I do have the
leftovers<00:00:56.430> meaning<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.030> after<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> few<00:00:57.840> turns

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
leftovers meaning that after a few turns

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
leftovers meaning that after a few turns
I<00:00:58.410> will<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.680> able<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.039> switch<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.520> with<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
I will be able to switch in with the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.360 
I will be able to switch in with the
rocks<00:01:00.059> next<00:01:00.359> turn<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.870> mean<00:01:01.320> next<00:01:01.649> time<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.190> want

to<00:01:02.550> switch<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.750> gonna<00:01:03.840> go<00:01:03.960> for

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
to switch it in so I'm just gonna go for

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.260

thunder wave
and<00:02:02.439> is<00:02:02.770> actually<00:02:03.010> good<00:02:03.400> information<00:02:03.970> for<00:02:04.000> me

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
and is actually good information for me

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.850 
and is actually good information for me
I<00:02:04.330> mean<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.659> don't<00:02:04.990> have<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.200> heel<00:02:05.409> belt<00:02:05.680> but

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
I mean I don't have the heel belt but

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.040 
I mean I don't have the heel belt but
like<00:02:06.070> toxic<00:02:06.820> would<00:02:07.090> have<00:02:07.210> been<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.659> lot<00:02:07.840> worse

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
like toxic would have been a lot worse

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.260 
like toxic would have been a lot worse
in<00:02:08.530> my<00:02:08.679> opinion<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.610> he's<00:02:09.850> going<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.000> go<00:02:10.119> for

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
in my opinion so he's going to go for

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.820 
in my opinion so he's going to go for
the<00:02:10.300> wish<00:02:10.450> i'm<00:02:10.600> going<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.810> get<00:02:10.929> paralyzed<00:02:11.500> but

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
the wish i'm going to get paralyzed but

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.070 
the wish i'm going to get paralyzed but
it's<00:02:12.459> completely<00:02:12.970> irrelevant<00:02:13.209> because<00:02:13.660> i<00:02:13.900> can

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
it's completely irrelevant because i can

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.100 
it's completely irrelevant because i can
go<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.370> heel<00:02:15.580> bell<00:02:15.790> next<00:02:16.120> turn<00:02:16.300> I'm<00:02:16.540> just

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
go for the heel bell next turn I'm just

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.930 
go for the heel bell next turn I'm just
actually<00:02:17.290> gonna<00:02:17.590> go<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.950> toxic<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:18.700> this

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
actually gonna go for the toxic on this

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.150 
actually gonna go for the toxic on this
switch<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.810> was<00:02:19.989> kind<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.350> thinking<00:02:20.440> about<00:02:20.890> this

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
switch I was kind of thinking about this

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.040 
switch I was kind of thinking about this
way<00:02:21.370> yeah<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.180> was<00:02:22.239> predicting<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.780> switch

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
way yeah so I was predicting a switch

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.410 
way yeah so I was predicting a switch
one<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.920> toxic<00:02:24.430> got<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.819> toxic<00:02:25.239> in<00:02:25.330> the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
one for the toxic got the toxic in the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.410 
one for the toxic got the toxic in the
road<00:02:25.540> I'm<00:02:25.690> f<00:02:25.930> he<00:02:26.590> gets<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.920> wish<00:02:27.130> but<00:02:27.940> it's<00:02:28.150> so

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
road I'm f he gets the wish but it's so

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.170 
road I'm f he gets the wish but it's so
alright<00:02:28.840> since<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.230> got<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.410> toxic<00:02:29.890> on<00:02:30.040> him

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
alright since I got a toxic on him

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.520 
alright since I got a toxic on him
doesn't<00:02:31.180> really<00:02:31.390> matter<00:02:31.690> it's<00:02:32.260> going<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.470> go

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
doesn't really matter it's going to go

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.620 
doesn't really matter it's going to go
for<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.739> t-bolt<00:02:33.280> now<00:02:33.459> as<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:34.060> said<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.450> am

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.240 
kind of stuff oh no no I actually
predicted<00:02:52.840> switch<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:53.500> that's<00:02:53.830> why<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.040> went

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
predicted switch so that's why I went

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.430 
predicted switch so that's why I went
for<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.459> toxic<00:02:54.970> but<00:02:55.690> that's<00:02:55.840> alright<00:02:55.989> even<00:02:56.290> if

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
for the toxic but that's alright even if

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.410 
for the toxic but that's alright even if
he<00:02:56.590> hits<00:02:56.799> another<00:02:56.920> or<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> blizzard<00:02:57.880> I'm<00:02:58.150> still

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
talker obviously so yeah if it was like

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.900 
talker obviously so yeah if it was like
a<00:03:11.230> substitute<00:03:11.769> boosting<00:03:12.220> said<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.579> would<00:03:12.730> have

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
a substitute boosting said it would have

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.300 
a substitute boosting said it would have
like<00:03:13.180> paint<00:03:13.540> split<00:03:13.780> maybe<00:03:14.019> but<00:03:14.709> he<00:03:15.010> goes<00:03:15.190> to

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
like paint split maybe but he goes to

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.910 
like paint split maybe but he goes to
the<00:03:15.340> sleep<00:03:15.670> talk<00:03:15.910> against<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.870> rest<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.410> before

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
the sleep talk against the rest I before

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.400 
the sleep talk against the rest I before
the<00:03:18.010> toxic<00:03:18.430> predict<00:03:18.730> new<00:03:18.910> switch<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:19.540> besides

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
the toxic predict new switch so besides

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.900 
the toxic predict new switch so besides
the<00:03:20.500> wish<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:20.980> term<00:03:21.220> was<00:03:21.400> completely

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
the wish this term was completely

now just uh you know pulling out those

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.390 
now just uh you know pulling out those
double<00:06:08.139> switches<00:06:08.770> and<00:06:08.949> stuff<00:06:09.220> because

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
double switches and stuff because

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.690 
double switches and stuff because
predicting<00:06:10.360> thingies

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
predicting thingies

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.030 
predicting thingies
Oh<00:06:11.760> yet<00:06:12.720> here<00:06:12.930> are<00:06:13.050> predicts<00:06:13.470> which<00:06:13.650> again<00:06:13.890> and

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
Oh yet here are predicts which again and

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.350 
Oh yet here are predicts which again and
just<00:06:14.160> go<00:06:14.340> for<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.520> focus<00:06:14.880> punch<00:06:15.090> and<00:06:15.300> the

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
just go for the focus punch and the

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.820 
just go for the focus punch and the
focus<00:06:15.570> punch<00:06:15.810> is<00:06:15.990> going<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:16.170> annihilate<00:06:16.410> the

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
focus punch is going to annihilate the

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.840 
away but I'm telling him on the stream
pretty<00:06:42.720> much<00:06:42.930> that<00:06:43.170> just<00:06:43.430> let's<00:06:44.430> not<00:06:44.580> waste

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
pretty much that just let's not waste

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.530 
pretty much that just let's not waste
our<00:06:45.090> time<00:06:46.080> because<00:06:46.650> pretty<00:06:47.550> much<00:06:47.700> it<00:06:48.000> is<00:06:48.120> over

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
our time because pretty much it is over

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.350 
our time because pretty much it is over
I<00:06:48.930> can<00:06:49.590> switch<00:06:50.040> in<00:06:50.280> around<00:06:50.700> I<00:06:50.880> predict<00:06:51.240> the

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
I can switch in around I predict the

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.420 
I can switch in around I predict the
thunder<00:06:51.690> wave<00:06:51.810> and<00:06:52.170> I<00:06:52.620> just<00:06:52.800> switched<00:06:53.010> into<00:06:53.250> my

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
thunder wave and I just switched into my

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.940 
thunder wave and I just switched into my
stand<00:06:53.700> /<00:06:53.940> so<00:06:54.210> it's<00:06:54.810> quite<00:06:54.960> not<00:06:55.440> difficult<00:06:55.680> to

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
stand / so it's quite not difficult to
