00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.530
 Very rich drink and very easy to make 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.840
 They are some 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:21.410
 with michel as this for when they meet 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.770
 with her friends so they already have a 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.170
 option is very easy we're just going to 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.960
 need for ice 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.329
 Chamoy powder 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.109
 gummies 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:44.200
 of sugar and gummies enchiladas chamo el 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:45.750
 liquid sauce english lemons 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.710
 Salt 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.590
 a pinch of salt and beer from his 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.920
 election that the first thing we're going to 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.120
 do is going to be in a little dish we are going to 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.650
 prepare a mixture 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.920
 d 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.870
 I call and dust 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.000
 with so very liquid 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.000
 let's go putting it on a bit 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.400
 because it has to be like a 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.400
 tablet 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.780
 If they see it very hard then we put a 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.120
 little bit more than chamoy and I on the contrary 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.270
 If they see it too thin, we'll put it on 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.030
 chilito truth the joke is that they 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.470
 it remains as well as a consistency one like 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.250
 Pill type not good now what 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.590
 we are going to do is that in a glass in a 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.850
 mud what you are going to serve 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.860
 we go 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.700
 to fill our jar a little 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.209
 with the mixture we made 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.209
 A) Yes 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.670
 If you want, they can also happen here 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.000
 by the chamoy or powder 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.830
 to know them richer still 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.250
 ok since we have this step now with the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.430
 mix that we made we are going to put here 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.430
 in 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.940
 two 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.980
 but as we see like this we are going to put 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:04.370
 some gummies enchiladas I chose some 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.370
 some damn 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.930
 let's put a little lemon 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:14.209
 I'm using nothing more than half a lemon 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.470
 but you already put the amount that 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.010
 you want health 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.010
 Y 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:28.450
 we are going to put a little piece of start 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:32.230
 And this is everyone's taste 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:37.300
 we are also going to put 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:40.100
 a few drops of English sauce 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.910
 or juice maggie what you guys 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.720
 like it but if you do not like this, I do not know 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.300
 they put and it does not change the taste at all and 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.300
 we are also going to put 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.300
 michelito 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:01.060
 so that it is very rich 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:05.110
 and now if the good comes, we're going to 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.560
 put a beer that you more 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.310
 like it a little bit so you do not 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.310
 we are going to throw 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.980
 The truth is that if I invite you to do 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.830
 there it is delicious 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.330
 when they have an appointment meeting with their 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.330
 friends or so 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.880
 this wealth 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:40.449
 and now yes 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:44.770
 we mix it a little bit 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:48.620
 if they have pots or something, then it's better 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:54.410
 so they can be coming 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:56.830
 and as a final decoration we are going to put 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.960
 its 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.770
 gummy 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.020
 and that's all for today I hope that you 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:10.500

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:13.740
