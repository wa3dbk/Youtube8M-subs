review<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.209> guess<00:02:45.480> on<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.049> wore<00:02:46.590> these<00:02:46.709> once

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
review I guess on it I wore these once

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.949 
review I guess on it I wore these once
in<00:02:47.130> store<00:02:47.430> try<00:02:47.819> them<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.510> really<00:02:48.780> liked

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
in store try them on and I really liked

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.030 
in store try them on and I really liked
how<00:02:49.049> they<00:02:49.170> felt<00:02:49.380> they<00:02:49.500> actually<00:02:49.739> felt<00:02:49.920> more

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
how they felt they actually felt more

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.740 
how they felt they actually felt more
comfortable<00:02:50.190> than<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> Kobe<00:02:51.060> nines<00:02:51.239> so

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
comfortable than the Kobe nines so

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.030 
comfortable than the Kobe nines so
that's<00:02:51.870> why<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.019> copped<00:02:52.319> these<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:52.799> copped

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that's why I copped these and I copped

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.319 
that's why I copped these and I copped
the<00:02:53.130> Kobe<00:02:53.340> nines<00:02:53.549> because<00:02:53.790> they<00:02:53.849> were<00:02:53.940> both

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
the Kobe nines because they were both

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.670 
the Kobe nines because they were both
really<00:02:54.569> nice-looking<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:55.349> these<00:02:55.530> are<00:02:55.650> a

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
really nice-looking this these are a

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.380 
really nice-looking this these are a
little<00:02:55.980> bit<00:02:56.069> more<00:02:56.190> comfortable<00:02:56.549> but<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.209> think

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
little bit more comfortable but I think

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.380 
little bit more comfortable but I think
the<00:02:57.450> kobe<00:02:57.750> nines<00:02:57.900> look<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.349> little<00:02:58.500> better<00:02:58.680> but

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
the kobe nines look a little better but

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.580 
the kobe nines look a little better but
let's<00:03:00.390> go<00:03:00.569> ahead<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.840> do<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.079> foot<00:03:01.260> review
