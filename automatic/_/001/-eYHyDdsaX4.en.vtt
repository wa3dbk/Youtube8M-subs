00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990

comfortable<00:01:10.470> angle<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.040> hold<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> brush<00:01:11.520> at

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.050 

so<00:01:21.230> I<00:01:21.290> can<00:01:21.440> swap<00:01:21.710> hands<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.430> angle<00:01:22.820> just

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
so I can swap hands and the angle just

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.760 
so I can swap hands and the angle just
fits<00:01:23.630> perfectly<00:01:23.870> still<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:30.290> bus<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:30.620> all

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
fits perfectly still the bus is all

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.440 
fits perfectly still the bus is all
synthetic<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.580> it<00:01:31.670> works<00:01:31.850> perfectly<00:01:32.060> with

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
synthetic so it works perfectly with

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.260 
there's no product left on my brush I'm
going<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.590> go<00:04:30.710> back<00:04:30.919> in<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.220> just<00:04:31.370> tidy<00:04:31.700> it<00:04:32.090> up

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
going to go back in and just tidy it up

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.710 
going to go back in and just tidy it up
to<00:04:32.510> check<00:04:32.750> there's<00:04:33.050> no<00:04:33.200> sharp<00:04:33.710> lines<00:04:34.010> there

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.600 

now<00:04:38.720> contouring<00:04:39.260> isn't<00:04:39.650> just<00:04:39.890> about<00:04:40.070> dark

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
now contouring isn't just about dark

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.550 
now contouring isn't just about dark
colors<00:04:40.940> it's<00:04:41.090> about<00:04:41.270> light<00:04:41.660> colors<00:04:42.050> as<00:04:42.200> well

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
colors it's about light colors as well

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.350 
colors it's about light colors as well
it's<00:04:42.800> about<00:04:43.100> reflecting<00:04:43.729> light<00:04:43.970> from<00:04:44.210> the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
it's about reflecting light from the

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.630 
it's about reflecting light from the
face<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:44.870> showing<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.740> beautiful<00:04:46.040> contours

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
face and showing the beautiful contours

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.360 
face and showing the beautiful contours
of<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:46.970> face<00:04:47.150> or<00:04:47.390> enhancing<00:04:47.960> them<00:04:48.169> or<00:04:48.370> making

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
of the face or enhancing them or making

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.760 
of the face or enhancing them or making
out<00:04:49.460> as<00:04:49.640> if<00:04:49.790> you've<00:04:49.970> got<00:04:50.150> them<00:04:50.300> when<00:04:50.479> you<00:04:50.570> don't

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
out as if you've got them when you don't

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.290 
out as if you've got them when you don't
now<00:04:51.770> I'm<00:04:52.070> using<00:04:52.400> cream<00:04:52.700> products<00:04:53.090> these

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
now I'm using cream products these

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.909 
now I'm using cream products these
brushes<00:04:53.570> work<00:04:53.870> perfectly<00:04:54.440> with<00:04:54.650> powder

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
brushes work perfectly with powder

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.710 
brushes work perfectly with powder
products<00:04:55.370> as<00:04:55.460> well<00:04:55.610> and<00:04:56.180> then<00:04:56.360> going<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.570> take

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
products as well and then going to take

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.630 
products as well and then going to take
a<00:04:56.870> slightly<00:04:57.440> lighter<00:04:57.710> cream<00:04:58.130> highlighter<00:04:59.050> and

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
a slightly lighter cream highlighter and

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.159 
a slightly lighter cream highlighter and
I'm<00:05:01.640> going<00:05:01.850> to<00:05:01.880> take<00:05:02.060> that<00:05:02.240> on<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.390> top<00:05:02.810> of<00:05:02.840> my

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
I'm going to take that on the top of my

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:10.000 
I'm going to take that on the top of my
cheekbone

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.950 

so<00:05:10.610> it's<00:05:10.760> just<00:05:10.970> going<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.270> reflect<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.780> light

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
so it's just going to reflect the light

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.860 
so it's just going to reflect the light
as<00:05:12.140> I<00:05:12.260> turn<00:05:15.670> it's<00:05:16.670> very<00:05:16.970> pretty<00:05:17.270> just<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.690> put

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
as I turn it's very pretty just to put

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.340 
as I turn it's very pretty just to put
here<00:05:18.050> as<00:05:18.170> well<00:05:18.730> just<00:05:19.730> kind<00:05:20.570> of<00:05:20.750> just<00:05:21.020> off<00:05:21.170> the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
here as well just kind of just off the

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.120 
here as well just kind of just off the
temples<00:05:23.200> anywhere<00:05:24.200> the<00:05:24.470> Sun<00:05:24.710> will<00:05:24.830> kind<00:05:25.040> of

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
temples anywhere the Sun will kind of

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.850 
temples anywhere the Sun will kind of
reflect<00:05:25.430> on<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.670> face<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.560> I've<00:05:27.560> used<00:05:27.740> the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
reflect on the face and I've used the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.010 
reflect on the face and I've used the
same<00:05:28.100> brush<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.520> whole<00:05:28.670> way<00:05:28.880> through<00:05:29.210> the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
same brush the whole way through the

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.480 
same brush the whole way through the
foundation<00:05:30.710> for<00:05:31.400> contour<00:05:31.910> and<00:05:33.490> for

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
foundation for contour and for

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.940 
foundation for contour and for
highlighter<00:05:34.880> so<00:05:35.750> it<00:05:35.870> just<00:05:36.260> reflects<00:05:36.770> the

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
highlighter so it just reflects the

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.970 
highlighter so it just reflects the
light<00:05:37.070> beautifully<00:05:37.870> so<00:05:38.870> there<00:05:39.170> is<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.680> new

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
light beautifully so there is the new

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.070 
light beautifully so there is the new
