00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
playing in the wind it can be very

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
playing in the wind it can be very
dangerous<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> start<00:00:59.879> pushing<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
dangerous you know you start pushing the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.090 
dangerous you know you start pushing the
ball<00:01:00.420> around<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:00.899> bit<00:01:01.079> or<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.379> start

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.009 
ball around a little bit or you start
playing<00:01:02.250> passive<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.480> i<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.809> ball

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
playing passive and i think this ball

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570 
playing passive and i think this ball
reacts<00:01:04.320> quite<00:01:04.589> funny<00:01:04.860> off<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> racket<00:01:05.519> when

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
reacts quite funny off the racket when

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.210 
reacts quite funny off the racket when
you<00:01:05.700> hit<00:01:05.970> too<00:01:06.210> much<00:01:06.360> topspin<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:08.100> can

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
you hit too much topspin and you can

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.100 
you hit too much topspin and you can
shank<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> very<00:01:08.820> quickly<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.750> ball<00:01:09.900> just

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
shank it very quickly or the ball just

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.050 
shank it very quickly or the ball just
you<00:01:10.830> know<00:01:10.920> flies<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.490> your<00:01:11.610> racket<00:01:11.939> so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.910 
this much with Thomas also you've both
played<00:01:29.700> each<00:01:29.790> other<00:01:29.909> many<00:01:30.600> times<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.829> we

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
played each other many times here we

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.289 
played each other many times here we
played<00:01:32.100> each<00:01:32.220> other<00:01:32.340> many<00:01:32.579> times<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.180> from

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
played each other many times and from

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.399 
played each other many times and from
what<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.420> heard<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> day

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
what I heard it's going to be a day

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.810 
what I heard it's going to be a day
session<00:01:34.860> match<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.220> condition<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
session match the condition is going to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.480 
session match the condition is going to
be<00:01:35.909> pretty<00:01:36.060> fast<00:01:36.770> it's<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.369> know

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
be pretty fast it's going to be you know

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.880 
be pretty fast it's going to be you know
quick<00:01:38.820> points<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.900> assume<00:01:40.290> because<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.770> both

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
quick points I assume because we both

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.760 
quick points I assume because we both
like<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.490> hug<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> baseline<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.590> use

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
like to hug the baseline but you can use

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.490 
like to hug the baseline but you can use
slice<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.430> spin<00:01:44.970> quite<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> bit<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.409> going

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
slice and spin quite a bit so it's going

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.260 
slice and spin quite a bit so it's going
to<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.619> interesting<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.009> see<00:01:47.310> how<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:48.149> going

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
to be interesting to see how it's going

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.490 
to be interesting to see how it's going
to<00:01:48.299> play<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:48.990> think<00:01:49.170> we've<00:01:49.290> played

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
to play out I don't think we've played

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.740 
to play out I don't think we've played
here<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> past<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.250> Indian<00:01:50.460> Wells<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
here in the past in Indian Wells so I

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.319 
here in the past in Indian Wells so I
know<00:01:52.560> he's<00:01:52.710> got<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> very<00:01:53.310> good<00:01:53.850> start<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
know he's got a very good start to the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.420 
know he's got a very good start to the
season<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.750> got<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> new<00:01:55.049> team<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.560> by<00:01:56.250> his

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
season it's got a new team and by his

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.679 
season it's got a new team and by his
side<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.060> sure<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.360> going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.600> an

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
side so I'm sure it's going to be an

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.979 
side so I'm sure it's going to be an
interesting<00:01:57.840> matchup<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.409> both<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.710> us<00:01:58.799> now
