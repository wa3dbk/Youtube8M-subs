trying to get these uh platforming
challenges<00:02:36.040> out<00:02:36.549> of<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.700> way<00:02:43.290> it's<00:02:44.290> also<00:02:44.409> need

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
challenges out of the way it's also need

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.899

since uh there's still some obstacles

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.819 
since uh there's still some obstacles
that<00:02:48.790> are<00:02:48.849> in<00:02:49.470> unleash<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.620> are<00:02:50.739> not

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
that are in unleash that are not

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.750 
that are in unleash that are not
converted<00:02:51.220> over<00:02:51.310> two<00:02:51.489> generations<00:02:55.349> whoa

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
converted over two generations whoa

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:09.930 
converted over two generations whoa
almost<00:03:01.019> let's<00:03:02.019> try<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.290> again<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:08.940> bought

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
almost let's try that again I bought

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.509 
almost let's try that again I bought
some<00:03:10.389> of<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.950> downloadable<00:03:11.950> content<00:03:12.310> for

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
some of the downloadable content for

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.750 
some of the downloadable content for
your<00:03:12.639> unleash<00:03:13.389> back<00:03:13.659> in<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.870> day<00:03:14.400> but<00:03:15.400> I

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
your unleash back in the day but I

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.860 
your unleash back in the day but I
didn't<00:03:15.939> really<00:03:16.180> care<00:03:16.329> for<00:03:16.389> it<00:03:16.599> that<00:03:16.720> much

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
didn't really care for it that much

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.330 
didn't really care for it that much
because<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.230> lot<00:03:17.409> of<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:17.829> just<00:03:17.859> this<00:03:18.099> weird

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
because a lot of it is just this weird

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.729 
because a lot of it is just this weird
heart<00:03:18.730> boat<00:03:18.909> stuff<00:03:19.239> where<00:03:19.599> you<00:03:20.170> know<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.560> game

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
heart boat stuff where you know the game

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.699 
heart boat stuff where you know the game
asks<00:03:21.040> for<00:03:21.159> some<00:03:21.340> real<00:03:21.639> precision<00:03:22.060> platforming

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
asks for some real precision platforming

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.220 
asks for some real precision platforming
and<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:25.000> don't<00:03:25.480> have<00:03:25.629> a<00:03:25.659> whole<00:03:25.840> lot<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.989> fun

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
and I don't have a whole lot of fun

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.500 
and I don't have a whole lot of fun
playing<00:03:26.530> these<00:03:27.040> kind<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.340> games<00:03:27.519> with<00:03:28.329> that

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
playing these kind of games with that

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.899 
playing these kind of games with that
kind<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.900> uh<00:03:28.959> you<00:03:29.950> know<00:03:30.040> having<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.430> do<00:03:30.670> some

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
kind of uh you know having to do some

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.520 
kind of uh you know having to do some
perilous<00:03:33.150> platforming<00:03:34.150> action<00:03:34.530> although

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
perilous platforming action although

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.860 
perilous platforming action although
this<00:03:35.650> part<00:03:35.889> here<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.099> not<00:03:36.250> too<00:03:36.400> bad<00:03:36.870> the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
this part here is not too bad the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
this part here is not too bad the
framerate<00:03:38.169> boost<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:38.680> definitely<00:03:39.519> welcome

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.530 

I<00:03:51.340> think<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.430> shouldn't<00:03:52.670> have<00:03:52.819> any<00:03:53.000> trouble<00:03:53.090> for

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
I think I shouldn't have any trouble for

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.949 
I think I shouldn't have any trouble for
the<00:03:53.630> rest<00:03:53.660> of<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.050> level<00:03:55.780> except<00:03:56.780> for<00:03:56.900> this

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
the rest of the level except for this

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:07.280 
the rest of the level except for this
part<00:03:57.700> yeah<00:03:58.700> okay<00:03:59.540> who<00:03:59.800> made<00:04:00.800> it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.630 

so<00:04:08.290> if<00:04:08.350> I<00:04:08.410> recall<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.770> lot<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.130> generation

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
so if I recall a lot of the generation

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.810 
so if I recall a lot of the generation
I'm<00:04:10.180> sorry<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.570> unleash<00:04:10.840> DLC<00:04:11.290> likes<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.820> have

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
I'm sorry the unleash DLC likes to have

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.650 
I'm sorry the unleash DLC likes to have
these<00:04:12.970> flat<00:04:13.300> faced<00:04:14.460> challenges<00:04:15.660> where

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
these flat faced challenges where

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.510 
these flat faced challenges where
basically<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.350> let<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.590> level<00:04:18.070> layout<00:04:18.310> will

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
basically the let the level layout will

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.160 
basically the let the level layout will
change<00:04:18.850> or<00:04:19.180> at<00:04:19.239> least<00:04:19.390> these<00:04:19.510> objects<00:04:20.020> will

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
change or at least these objects will

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.390 
change or at least these objects will
change<00:04:20.470> based<00:04:21.040> on<00:04:21.250> where<00:04:21.520> you<00:04:21.670> are<00:04:23.250> like<00:04:24.250> we'll

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
change based on where you are like we'll

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.650 
change based on where you are like we'll
just<00:04:24.580> hit<00:04:24.670> like<00:04:24.820> certain<00:04:25.120> triggers<00:04:25.420> I'll

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
just hit like certain triggers I'll

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.350 
just hit like certain triggers I'll
trigger<00:04:25.870> different<00:04:26.080> laps<00:04:26.410> or<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:27.100> will<00:04:27.250> just

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
trigger different laps or it will just

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.110 
trigger different laps or it will just
activate<00:04:28.360> different<00:04:28.510> objects<00:04:29.140> so<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:30.370> like

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
activate different objects so for like

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.300 
activate different objects so for like
this<00:04:31.450> win<00:04:32.170> belle-isle<00:04:32.560> stage

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
this win belle-isle stage

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.880 
this win belle-isle stage
it<00:04:34.210> makes<00:04:35.020> us<00:04:35.200> go<00:04:35.380> through<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.650> level

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
it makes us go through the level

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.590 
it makes us go through the level
backwards<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:37.030> we<00:04:37.150> have<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.330> go<00:04:37.450> through

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
backwards and we have to go through

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.870 
backwards and we have to go through
forwards<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:39.840> now<00:04:40.840> there's<00:04:41.020> just<00:04:41.260> more

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
forwards and now there's just more

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.240 
forwards and now there's just more
enemies<00:04:42.880> more<00:04:43.300> boosters<00:04:44.050> more<00:04:44.530> orb

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
enemies more boosters more orb

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.370 
enemies more boosters more orb
everything<00:04:45.760> that<00:04:46.120> we<00:04:46.240> have<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.420> deal<00:04:46.600> with

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.830 

see<00:05:58.069> all<00:05:58.490> right

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.879 

not<00:06:02.410> too<00:06:02.620> bad<00:06:06.630> but<00:06:07.630> uh<00:06:07.690> that's<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:08.260> only<00:06:08.590> stage

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
not too bad but uh that's the only stage

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.100 
not too bad but uh that's the only stage
that's<00:06:09.190> in<00:06:09.370> this<00:06:09.490> demo<00:06:09.910> everything<00:06:10.720> else<00:06:10.930> is

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
that's in this demo everything else is

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.600 
that's in this demo everything else is
kind<00:06:11.320> of<00:06:11.380> blocked<00:06:11.620> off<00:06:11.860> unfortunately<00:06:14.550> but<00:06:15.550> uh

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
kind of blocked off unfortunately but uh

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.690 
kind of blocked off unfortunately but uh
as<00:06:16.120> you<00:06:16.419> can<00:06:16.510> plainly<00:06:16.870> see<00:06:17.020> it's<00:06:17.500> got<00:06:17.860> it<00:06:18.340> still

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
as you can plainly see it's got it still

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.760 
as you can plainly see it's got it still
like<00:06:19.000> the<00:06:19.270> same<00:06:19.450> overall<00:06:19.780> from<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:20.200> Unleashed

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
like the same overall from the Unleashed

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.010 
like the same overall from the Unleashed
project<00:06:21.280> DLC<00:06:22.530> and<00:06:23.760> it<00:06:24.760> also<00:06:24.910> rates<00:06:25.270> each<00:06:25.690> stage

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
project DLC and it also rates each stage

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.550 
project DLC and it also rates each stage
based<00:06:26.410> on<00:06:26.620> computer<00:06:27.250> performance<00:06:28.470> and<00:06:29.470> I

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
based on computer performance and I

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.270 
based on computer performance and I
think<00:06:29.590> it<00:06:30.190> shows<00:06:30.790> this<00:06:31.620> logo<00:06:32.620> for<00:06:32.980> the<00:06:33.100> level

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
think it shows this logo for the level

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.219 
think it shows this logo for the level
here<00:06:33.550> only<00:06:33.730> because<00:06:34.090> the<00:06:34.479> safe<00:06:34.690> fall<00:06:34.930> that<00:06:35.110> I'm

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
here only because the safe fall that I'm

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.370 
here only because the safe fall that I'm
using<00:06:35.380> I'm<00:06:35.800> not<00:06:36.010> using<00:06:36.280> a<00:06:37.169> redirected<00:06:38.169> save

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
using I'm not using a redirected save

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.860 
using I'm not using a redirected save
file<00:06:38.590> so<00:06:38.830> I<00:06:38.860> can<00:06:38.979> keep<00:06:39.100> my<00:06:39.250> skills<00:06:41.669> all<00:06:42.669> right

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
file so I can keep my skills all right

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.780 
file so I can keep my skills all right
what's<00:06:43.870> that<00:06:44.050> for<00:06:44.290> this<00:06:44.889> mod<00:06:45.250> let's<00:06:45.490> see<00:06:45.669> if<00:06:45.729> we

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
what's that for this mod let's see if we

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.470 
what's that for this mod let's see if we
can<00:06:45.940> move<00:06:46.030> on<00:06:46.240> to<00:06:46.389> another<00:06:46.510> one<00:06:46.960> here
