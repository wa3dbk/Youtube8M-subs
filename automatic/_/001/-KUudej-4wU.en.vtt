00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.320
 If they are in their houses, the petals of the flowers have as their mission 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.020
 main is to attract insects comments on hold 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.609
 to facilitate pollination 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:12.650
 the insects 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.280
 they find easy food and well marked 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.280
 in exchange for a transport service of genetic material 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.710
 while feeding on the flower's background 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.140
 butterflies and bees cristina on your body and your extremities with stamens 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.860
 loaded with ponent that involuntarily transfer to other flowers and their continuous 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.980
 travel in search of food 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.310
 this symbiosis between the sector and the plant benefits both species and is 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.240
 known as pollination 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.170
 the pollinating insects however not only feed on palermo their 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.170
 transforming vocation that investigates horn 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.579
 that allows the ingestion of all kinds of liquids 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.879
 like the mineral salts that appear in the soil of a humid zone of the forest 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.210
 the striking colors that many of these insects 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.190
 end camouflage with the flowers the clues 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.600
 and confuse their enemies in this way 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.509
 with an explosion of colors 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.759
 although sometimes it can even be complicated to overcome 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.880
 delia character 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.680
 and where the insect starts 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.310
 There are several groups of insects adapted to suck the nectar from 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.970
 flowers but they are surely the butterflies known to science as 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.100
 lepidoptera 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.880
 those that have reached the greatest diversity of species the highest degree of 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.759
 adaptation an existing boom bum boom more than 100 thousand species of butterflies 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.020
 so we can ensure 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.490
 that almost one out of every ten species on the planet is a dismissal but none of 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.929
 those thousands of ballot boxes that are minority in classify in the subgroup of 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.110
 fishing but yes and are the ones with the most colorful colors 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.390
 although there are always exceptions 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.110
 like the leaf butterfly that at rest perfectly remembers the design of a 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.919
 Dry leave 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:15.069
 fixing butterflies with flowers 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.699
 that it is very difficult to feed these insects in captivity 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.340
 the solution naturally 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.830
 and if you want feeders in the form of artificial flowers in whose center 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.689
 found on the line
