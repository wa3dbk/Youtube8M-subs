00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 and good morning to you all 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.460
 how are you for me this is the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.230
 full form we find ourselves on the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.330
 techno chain of tests to discover 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.880
 presented as well as bullets and the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.880
 5h v3 headset produced by steelseries 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.180
 we end up with one helmet at a time 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.890
 sober and very gamer colors with 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.430
 his very particular style in several 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.260
 parts 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.820
 we do not have this one time 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.010
 and even hoops this is what will 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.599
 stand out from competitors I'm not 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.219
 not embarrassed personally to wear it 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.050
 in the street what makes him a strength 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.329
 compared to some other helmets that 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.890
 we will only use at home the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.629
 design is fine but if we walk 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.160
 by hearing the people next to you 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.899
 immediately becomes my class and well 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.340
 know that after using a 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.410
 day in the street the verdict is 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 rather very good it produces an effect of 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.890
 noise reduction once the foams 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.899
 very nice laid on your ears I 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.180
 you guarantee that the outside noise is 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.860
 greatly diminished this helmet is so 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
 accompanied by several adapters and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.030
 an extension we will have the possibility of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.670
 connect it directly to your smartphone 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.899
 his pc or his mac 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.630
 for once we do not find a 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.909
 micro detachable but retractable which 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.710
 is a great idea and yes he is very 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.900
 discreet so nobody will perceive it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.040
 as long as you do not go out I think 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.780
 all the same that the life of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.759
 this one is shorter than a microphone 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.710
 detachable since the coming and going risk 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.330
 to damage it over time I 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.939
 wanted to do a little test of the one 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.259
 so here it goes 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.759
 here I am currently 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.220
 dictate a little sentence completely 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.170
 stupid for you to have an idea of ​​the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.030
 the quality of the steelseries headset microphone 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.009
 5h v3 question power I find it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.170
 correct but without the volume would have 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.909
 could be a little raise little point 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.680
 also weak that I noticed everything 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.869
 right away he does not bend what is a 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.390
 bit annoying if you are traveling a lot it 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.740
 will surely wander in your bag 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.720
 side materials and well he is in 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.030
 plastic I think they really 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.619
 put the price in sound quality as well 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.399
 that noise reduction that is right 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.469
 fantastic 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.060
 so we come to the question that you 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.990
 you surely ask but after all this 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.850
 what did you say 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.490
 how much is he worth if he is the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.899
 price rises to 79 euros 99 which is 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.439
 reasonable enough for quality 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.869
 obtained 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.760
 I think I quoted everything or at least the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.080
 main do not hesitate if a question 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.970
 trots you ask me in 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.980
 comments do not forget you 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.989
