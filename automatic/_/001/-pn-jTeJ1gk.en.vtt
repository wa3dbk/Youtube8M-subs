00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello everyone is always good 77 i 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.410
 welcome to this 51st episode 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.670
 of the ample road to glory how many are the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.250
 51 and a lot the team is always 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.109
 this and on episode is very important 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.359
 because we have two facts and that is in 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.939
 these two games we're going to do 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.740
 we could go mathematically into 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.420
 division after him I remember that number 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.789
 anyway, why are we looking at the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.529
 team because at team canteen convinces 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.660
 just that if you have any 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.340
 change you'd like to make me do it 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.399
 to know below in the comments 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.680
 and then I will see do not know above all 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.629
 the s and diego costa are continues that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.640
 a lot don't convince me anyway 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.660
 you let me know they were comments 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.489
 then I will see 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 anyway we are saying we are in gigi 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.270
 points we have to get to 16 so two 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.969
 victories we still have four games 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.100
 left we must make it go ahead 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.039
 because I don't want to do what someone does 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.570
 maybe there can not go 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.750
 forward and stop the series 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.780
 I want to continue then I'll see if 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.939
 stop her later anyway not now 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.220
 and let's have his team but why 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.110
 charge so much is already launching 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.310
 now even before the beginning of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.490
 match that of his team to mom 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.610
 mine but they start looking at you and everything 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.490
 slowed fixing this taut with mom 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.140
 what happens anyway we get to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.810
 as much as 200 250 I like to have the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.390
 next episode of the super succeed a 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.180
 talking about the route to glory is small 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.369
 ames and there is the barbel that go only three 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.210
 speed north against roberto carlos 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.850
 which inspires the barbel ibarbo roberto 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.829
 carlos stops him inside me 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.920
 home to him is something he costs her 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.490
 great parade 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.450
 no no in some meetings you do 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.250
 anticipate and reached limits of idiots 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.869
 they do anticipate the 4 from creed 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.030
 lewandowski for the meeting here all 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.909
 pay just go I read what is withheld 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.610
 madridiste 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:15.010
 what still the parade then remains 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:19.840
 also mark the evenings I do here 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.390
 sanchez or even spa the square exterior 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.010
 runs square runs cuadrado corre 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.280
 quadratino rappa giu 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:33.610
 and a good chance is finally a penalty 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.310
 we don't waste the track here 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.430
 the risk was the first grip but it was too much 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.019
 strong pull of gomez 11 your own name 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.709
 on 3ds 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:51.370
 if there is a game cost I can roll 1 e 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:54.370
 2 1 in a minute overturned 44th that 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:00.340
 It happens happens 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:03.879
 no no no true no not me 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.780
 the true message yes yes ok ok victory 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.489
 our go very good 13 points la 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.530
 aforementioned good that it is anger reassembled like this 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.889
 the rented person and now we have 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.590
 three games to make the three points to the 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.900
 training does not change I am not much 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.840
 tired we go to do a second is 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.519
 true that second we see his hybrid 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.079
 ok above all we are careful 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.430
 attack but the whole offensive phase 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.430
 because it is very strong 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.970
 and oh well spirit via then robben eye 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:45.730
 still robben robero big backplane 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.220
 I still answer with my brother for the 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.630
 head and after a while guitars stop 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.760
 it was a cross shot but we didn't get it 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.760
 bigger, however, a corner was diverted 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.980
 here are four in the century as it goes o 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.069
 at least we try in the area but it goes to 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.410
 closing was a good chance and vague 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:13.319
 because he was not above the tracks first 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:15.670
 the park no no film with football 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.200
 forty-fifth be it 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.340
 the einstein asp own 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.030
 forty-fifth is always marked 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.580
 when 5 but absurd eh yes we have enamel 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.669
 salad can't say anything wrong 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.919
 of defense and starting with the second 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.850
 time 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.540
 pity about that goal but still missing 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.540
 much 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.870
 i suggest day if i have them but why if 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:48.490
 all on help david sterritt states 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.530
 terex tevez selex tevez 2 to 0 to 41 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.260
 great but because they were all on one 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.450
 euro player behind came in for 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.040
 square that with jordi alba cuadrado 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.950
 still square head already promised 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.639
 diverted walker that always there ready to 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.910
 pull crossbar walker and crossing 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.580
 from the square push by a little bit of 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.669
 time we have it square when trying 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.910
 to pass however the useless tie 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:22.660
 because now we have to win the point 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:26.350
 rigor so from the beautiful rigor 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:30.460
 since nothing is obviously put us go 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.380
 go go mames from like before like before 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.840
 a good bit weaker the shot anyway 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.520
 a goal at least is a goal 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.710
 we can still hope for a draw 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.830
 how second, however, it is practically 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:46.120
 useless because only victory is needed 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:49.169
 good st 10 good song to be good to him 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.169
 stable good together with the cross 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:55.180
 the second is at this point I know that 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.660
 I can say that in truth many 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.270
 painting of a game by historical sub 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.640
 at least for the draw away 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.060
 the opponent and ends here 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:11.390
 hard for him however three woodwinds two games 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.070
 it's so much bad luck for those two 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.860
 for those two sticks taken that which 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:19.060
 that crossbar, however, we only needed 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.440
 win then do nothing and then 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.890
 shame about the last game a bit of 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.260
 less and bitter in the mouth because we could 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:29.540
 do much more for we still have two 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.210
 games we have to win only one ed 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.590
 ios I know what we do not succeed if it is 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.260
 just the opposite of what I have 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.960
 said before, however, the memory 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.670
 yet to advise me how to improve 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.950
 school can buy someone else 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.110
 I don't know that I don't have 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.540
 lots of credits are known of the alleged 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:52.030
 metric written to my channel and comments 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.030
 from bob 7 it all jumps up to all
