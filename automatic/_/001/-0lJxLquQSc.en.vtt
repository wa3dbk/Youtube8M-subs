00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.450 
before I think the most important thing
is<00:01:38.119> is<00:01:38.329> that<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.600> can't<00:01:38.810> get<00:01:38.929> to<00:01:39.310> carry<00:01:40.310> your

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
is is that you can't get to carry your

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.370 
is is that you can't get to carry your
you<00:01:40.759> don't<00:01:41.270> get<00:01:41.390> too<00:01:41.539> despondent<00:01:41.929> you<00:01:42.259> know<00:01:42.349> a
