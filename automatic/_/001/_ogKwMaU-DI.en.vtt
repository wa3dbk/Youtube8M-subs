00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.800
 my name is raphael game 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.570
 here at the meeting for 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.570
 visiting a friend who lives here 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.740
 it was to contact a local here who 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.509
 had three beautiful spots 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.490
 we're here on the nasty cap it's up to 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.430
 celebrate a nice inc kevin had job there 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.299
 down it's not long since I 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.830
 started to stagnate 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.000
 it's been a month and a half 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.080
 started a little by chance you could 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.970
 it's funny I tend exam revisions 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.569
 I decided it went well I 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.760
 designed and well hung 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.739
 activeeon decided to go on a line 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.359
 which was a bit short but suddenly 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.650
 she is a little bit closer 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.909
 water and so we can take the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.730
 waves actually lie to you in the mouth 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.890
 when we really walk 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.220
 no we bosse box as soon as we have a small 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.530
 little 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.610
 nor special enough after mentally because 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.160
 that there are really big waves 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.570
 you will do this without occasionally 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.550
 lauve hit the rock and then we 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.960
 socoa even downright vegetables they 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.350
 found at the level of the face it is 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.350
 pretty amazing 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.319
 is not it trivial as usual line 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.159
 on that distance it's easy to 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.159
 to walk there there was still 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.980
 visual a lot of things 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.920
 revault here it's amazing 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.470
 is one that has the potential 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.180
 hallucinating every taste to leave 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.860
 we keep smells from the exhibitions 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.860
 possible it's really beautiful 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.070
 the 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.330
 most of the time we are cantoning lines 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.710
 houdaille lines we do not have much 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.270
 either I am a small camera 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.460
 compact and it allows to have images 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.020
 well in small memories but that 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.430
 lacks a bit of dynamism and it allows 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.570
 not to see every angle that allows 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.790
 not to see the emptiness it allows no 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.990
 see depth finally the vision of 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.220
 space is really better made by 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.410
 a drone in fact makes it the thing to his 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.670
 it's beautiful and then it works 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.620
 really particularly well with this 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.420
 sport there 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.340
 especially since the cameras on board 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.690
 are pretty beautiful but but the throne 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.690
 it's still the must in matters 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.810
 at
