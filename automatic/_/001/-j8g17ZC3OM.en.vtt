installed on the tank themselves these
are<00:00:13.220> the<00:00:13.490> hydric<00:00:14.180> or<00:00:14.860> gorillas<00:00:15.860> the<00:00:16.760> one<00:00:16.910> on

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
are the hydric or gorillas the one on

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.230 
are the hydric or gorillas the one on
here<00:00:17.240> on<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:17.599> left<00:00:17.840> is<00:00:18.170> a<00:00:18.439> 1,500<00:00:19.369> gallons<00:00:19.820> per

here on the left is a 1,500 gallons per
hour<00:00:20.300> unit<00:00:20.929> and<00:00:21.519> this<00:00:22.519> one<00:00:22.730> right<00:00:22.849> here<00:00:22.909> is<00:00:23.269> an

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
hour unit and this one right here is an

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.749 
hour unit and this one right here is an
eleven<00:00:23.900> hundred<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:24.349> fifty<00:00:24.800> gallons<00:00:25.550> per

eleven hundred and fifty gallons per
hour<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.509> after<00:00:26.839> adding<00:00:27.439> these<00:00:28.159> two<00:00:28.550> new<00:00:28.730> power

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
hour so after adding these two new power

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.509 
hour so after adding these two new power
heads<00:00:29.359> I<00:00:30.050> can<00:00:30.439> tell<00:00:30.649> you<00:00:30.710> that<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.949> water<00:00:31.249> flow

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
heads I can tell you that the water flow

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:32.979 
heads I can tell you that the water flow
of<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.729> tank<00:00:31.970> has<00:00:32.149> increased<00:00:32.750> significantly

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
of the tank has increased significantly

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.259 
of the tank has increased significantly
I'm<00:00:33.980> seeing<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:34.370> lot<00:00:34.399> of<00:00:34.579> small<00:00:34.910> particles

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
I'm seeing a lot of small particles

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.959 
I'm seeing a lot of small particles
moving<00:00:35.809> around<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:36.469> sort<00:00:36.680> of<00:00:36.769> allowing<00:00:37.730> me<00:00:37.850> to

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
moving around and sort of allowing me to

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.569 
moving around and sort of allowing me to
see<00:00:38.149> where<00:00:38.539> the<00:00:38.780> flow<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:39.079> headed<00:00:39.680> for<00:00:40.489> the

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
see where the flow is headed for the

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.910 
see where the flow is headed for the
tank<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.359> at<00:00:41.600> this<00:00:41.719> point<00:00:41.989> we've<00:00:42.530> been<00:00:42.679> about

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
tank so at this point we've been about

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.970 
tank so at this point we've been about
four<00:00:43.609> weeks<00:00:43.750> cycling<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.870> tank<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.379> all<00:00:45.890> of

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
four weeks cycling the tank and all of

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.279 
four weeks cycling the tank and all of
my<00:00:46.039> water<00:00:46.399> tests<00:00:46.760> have<00:00:46.850> come<00:00:47.030> back<00:00:47.089> perfect<00:00:47.719> so

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
my water tests have come back perfect so

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.829 
my water tests have come back perfect so
the<00:00:48.649> next<00:00:48.800> step<00:00:48.949> is<00:00:49.070> for<00:00:49.219> us<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.550> actually

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
the next step is for us to actually

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.119 
the next step is for us to actually
start<00:00:50.839> putting<00:00:51.199> some<00:00:51.320> inhabitants<00:00:51.679> in<00:00:52.100> the

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
start putting some inhabitants in the

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.880 
start putting some inhabitants in the
tank<00:00:52.989> just<00:00:53.989> a<00:00:54.079> quick<00:00:54.289> word<00:00:54.469> about<00:00:54.589> these

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
tank just a quick word about these

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.610 
tank just a quick word about these
guerrillas<00:00:55.429> they<00:00:56.059> work<00:00:56.300> very<00:00:56.510> well<00:00:56.899> very

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
guerrillas they work very well very

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.700 
guerrillas they work very well very
silent<00:00:58.219> machines<00:00:58.609> I<00:00:59.359> don't<00:00:59.839> hear<00:01:00.109> them<00:01:00.350> at<00:01:00.559> all

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
silent machines I don't hear them at all

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.279 
silent machines I don't hear them at all
they<00:01:01.039> really<00:01:01.789> like<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.390> magnetic<00:01:02.989> grip

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
they really like the magnetic grip

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.830 
they really like the magnetic grip
that's<00:01:03.499> on<00:01:03.679> the<00:01:03.800> back<00:01:04.010> side<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.339> them<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.059> holds

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
that's on the back side of them so holds

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.050 
that's on the back side of them so holds
them<00:01:06.020> in<00:01:06.050> place<00:01:06.230> perfectly<00:01:06.980> they're<00:01:07.610> pretty

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
them in place perfectly they're pretty

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.210 
them in place perfectly they're pretty
good-sized<00:01:08.510> they're<00:01:08.870> not<00:01:09.080> huge<00:01:09.710> for<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.010> tank

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
good-sized they're not huge for the tank

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.980 
good-sized they're not huge for the tank
but<00:01:10.400> they're<00:01:10.550> not<00:01:10.670> small<00:01:10.970> either<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.540> the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
but they're not small either and the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.860 
but they're not small either and the
flow<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:12.440> is<00:01:13.040> very<00:01:13.370> reasonable<00:01:13.690> intent<00:01:14.690> at

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
flow is is very reasonable intent at

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.600 
flow is is very reasonable intent at
this<00:01:15.020> point<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:15.800> my<00:01:15.920> hope<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.460> is

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
this point so my hope is that this is

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.370 
this point so my hope is that this is
going<00:01:16.730> to<00:01:16.790> even<00:01:17.000> help<00:01:17.150> speed<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.960> tank<00:01:18.200> I

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
going to even help speed the tank I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.840 
going to even help speed the tank I
believe<00:01:18.650> it<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.800> little<00:01:18.920> more<00:01:19.130> in<00:01:19.340> terms<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.670> its

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
believe it a little more in terms of its

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.180 
believe it a little more in terms of its
cycling<00:01:20.300> process<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.440> let<00:01:21.860> me<00:01:21.890> give<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:22.130> a

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
cycling process so let me give you a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.060 
cycling process so let me give you a
close-up<00:01:22.430> view<00:01:22.790> of<00:01:22.820> these<00:01:23.560> power<00:01:24.560> heads<00:01:24.830> and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
close-up view of these power heads and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.550 
close-up view of these power heads and
you<00:01:25.760> can<00:01:25.910> see<00:01:26.060> exactly<00:01:26.390> for<00:01:26.690> yourself<00:01:27.050> what

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
you can see exactly for yourself what

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.490 
you can see exactly for yourself what
they<00:01:27.680> look<00:01:27.830> like<00:01:28.540> ok<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:29.960> here<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.350> our

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
they look like ok and so here is our

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.280 
they look like ok and so here is our
close-up<00:01:31.190> view<00:01:31.430> of<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.940> Hydra<00:01:32.660> core<00:01:32.900> core

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
close-up view of the Hydra core core

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.740 
close-up view of the Hydra core core
illas<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.860> as<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:34.670> can<00:01:34.850> see<00:01:34.880> i'm<00:01:35.450> going<00:01:35.630> to

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
illas and as you can see i'm going to

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.750 
illas and as you can see i'm going to
move<00:01:35.960> off<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.470> side<00:01:36.680> here<00:01:36.980> you<00:01:37.430> can<00:01:37.610> see

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
move off to the side here you can see

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.820 
move off to the side here you can see
that<00:01:37.940> on<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.210> back<00:01:38.420> side<00:01:38.690> here<00:01:38.750> there<00:01:39.620> is

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
that on the back side here there is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.850 
that on the back side here there is
actually<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.880> magnet<00:01:41.870> on<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.110> outside<00:01:42.620> of<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
actually a magnet on the outside of the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.400 
actually a magnet on the outside of the
tank<00:01:43.040> holding<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:44.120> unit<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.660> place<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.230> there

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
tank holding the unit in place and there

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.650 
tank holding the unit in place and there
is<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> small<00:01:45.830> suction<00:01:46.160> cup<00:01:46.550> on<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:46.940> side<00:01:47.180> but

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
is a small suction cup on this side but

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.450 
is a small suction cup on this side but
the<00:01:47.780> magnet<00:01:48.140> just<00:01:48.290> adds<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.680> little<00:01:48.830> bit<00:01:48.980> more

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
the magnet just adds a little bit more

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.420 
the magnet just adds a little bit more
stability<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.410> tank<00:01:51.680> itself<00:01:51.860> in

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
stability to the to the tank itself in

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
holding it into position these were

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.570 
holding it into position these were

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
quite easy to set up I wash them

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.190 
quite easy to set up I wash them
thoroughly<00:01:58.850> before<00:01:59.300> I<00:01:59.480> put<00:01:59.720> them<00:01:59.870> into<00:02:00.020> my

thoroughly before I put them into my
tank<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.190> that<00:02:01.220> it<00:02:01.550> would<00:02:01.760> not<00:02:02.690> create<00:02:03.140> any

tank itself so and here is my other one
and<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.599> see<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.640> back<00:02:14.640> up<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.970> little

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and so you can see as I back up a little

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.309 
and so you can see as I back up a little
bit<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.280> current<00:02:17.610> arrangement<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.599> one

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
bit that the current arrangement is one

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.259 
bit that the current arrangement is one
to<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> left<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.610> one<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.030> right

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
pointing directly at each other now at

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.119 
pointing directly at each other now at
this<00:02:24.060> point<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.629> not<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.230> these<00:02:25.530> connected

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
this point I do not have these connected

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.970 
this point I do not have these connected
to<00:02:26.310> any<00:02:26.610> type<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.879> a<00:02:27.090> controller<00:02:27.769> there's<00:02:28.769> been

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
to any type of a controller there's been

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.559 
to any type of a controller there's been
some<00:02:29.190> reports<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.819> they<00:02:29.970> make<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> slight

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
some reports that they make a slight

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.130 
some reports that they make a slight
clicking<00:02:31.110> when<00:02:31.769> they<00:02:32.129> move<00:02:32.400> on<00:02:32.730> off<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.810> can

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
clicking when they move on off and I can

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.140 
clicking when they move on off and I can
certainly<00:02:34.440> verify<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.160> i<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.819> switched

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
certainly verify that i have switched

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.270 
certainly verify that i have switched
the<00:02:36.269> power<00:02:36.510> off<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.470> tank<00:02:37.709> itself<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the power off to the tank itself and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.400 
the power off to the tank itself and
switched<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.640> back<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.360> indeed<00:02:40.170> i<00:02:40.230> have

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
switched it back on and indeed i have

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.520 
switched it back on and indeed i have
heard<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:40.920> small<00:02:41.220> clicking<00:02:41.760> sound<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:43.110> i<00:02:43.380> am

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
heard a small clicking sound so if i am

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.440 
heard a small clicking sound so if i am
going<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.799> connect<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.160> controller<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.030> my

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
going to connect the controller to it my

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.410 
going to connect the controller to it my
sense<00:02:45.780> would<00:02:45.959> be<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.709> i<00:02:46.739> wouldn't<00:02:47.069> be

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
sense would be that i wouldn't be

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.970 
sense would be that i wouldn't be
reversing<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.510> switching<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.989> flow<00:02:49.200> every

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
reversing and switching the flow every

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.640 
reversing and switching the flow every
five<00:02:50.220> seconds<00:02:50.760> or<00:02:50.910> 10<00:02:50.970> seconds<00:02:51.780> or<00:02:51.870> or<00:02:52.319> one

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
five seconds or 10 seconds or or one

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.640 
five seconds or 10 seconds or or one
minute<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.310> i<00:02:53.579> might<00:02:53.880> wait<00:02:54.150> an<00:02:54.390> hour<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.930> or

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
minute that i might wait an hour and or

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.240 
minute that i might wait an hour and or
two<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.090> change<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.660> flow<00:02:58.410> rate<00:02:58.440> or

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
two and to change the flow rate or

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.930 
two and to change the flow rate or
reverse<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.880> flow<00:03:00.380> just<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.579> prevent

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
reverse the flow just to just to prevent

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.580 
reverse the flow just to just to prevent
that<00:03:03.120> clicking<00:03:03.569> from<00:03:03.720> bothering<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.379> fish

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
that clicking from bothering the fish

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.350 
that clicking from bothering the fish
that<00:03:04.860> are<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.190> tank<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.549> it<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:05.910> regular

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
that are in the tank on it on a regular

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.640 
that are in the tank on it on a regular
basis<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.500> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
basis and so that is the this is the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.740 
basis and so that is the this is the
last<00:03:10.920> stage<00:03:11.250> here<00:03:11.609> really<00:03:11.910> before<00:03:12.060> i<00:03:12.269> begin<00:03:12.690> to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
last stage here really before i begin to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.559 
last stage here really before i begin to
put<00:03:13.079> some<00:03:14.269> salt<00:03:15.269> water<00:03:15.560> crabs<00:03:16.560> or<00:03:17.120> snails<00:03:18.120> or

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
put some salt water crabs or snails or

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.780 
put some salt water crabs or snails or
even<00:03:19.049> some<00:03:19.230> fish<00:03:19.410> into<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.709> tank<00:03:19.829> one<00:03:20.639> of<00:03:20.700> the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
even some fish into the tank one of the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.979 
even some fish into the tank one of the
things<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:20.970> i<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.329> tell<00:03:21.569> you<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.810> i

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
things that i can tell you is that i

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.660 
things that i can tell you is that i
have<00:03:22.170> both<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.500> them<00:03:22.739> pointing<00:03:23.220> at<00:03:23.340> each<00:03:23.370> other

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
have both of them pointing at each other

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.580 
have both of them pointing at each other
and<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.239> looks<00:03:24.450> like<00:03:24.540> right<00:03:24.870> where<00:03:25.079> they<00:03:25.319> meet

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
and it looks like right where they meet

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.890 
and it looks like right where they meet
about<00:03:25.920> here<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.489> middle<00:03:26.670> if<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.750> look

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
about here in the middle if you look

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.170 
about here in the middle if you look
down<00:03:28.139> here<00:03:28.200> i<00:03:28.799> don't<00:03:29.609> know<00:03:29.670> if<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.880> can<00:03:30.030> make

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
down here i don't know if you can make

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.610 
down here i don't know if you can make
it<00:03:30.239> or<00:03:30.420> not<00:03:30.569> but<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:31.049> see<00:03:31.200> there's<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
it or not but you can see there's a

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.309 
it or not but you can see there's a
little<00:03:31.980> crater<00:03:32.579> that<00:03:32.940> has<00:03:33.120> been<00:03:33.329> formed<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.230> it

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
little crater that has been formed so it

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.970 
little crater that has been formed so it
looks<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.889> flow<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.370> hitting<00:03:35.790> each<00:03:36.450> of

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
looks like the flow is hitting each of

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.470 
looks like the flow is hitting each of
impacting<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.130> then<00:03:38.220> being<00:03:38.459> thrust<00:03:38.819> straight

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
impacting and then being thrust straight

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.080 
impacting and then being thrust straight
down<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.650> i<00:03:40.980> may<00:03:41.190> need<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.459> do<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.609> little<00:03:41.880> bit<00:03:42.060> of

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
down so i may need to do a little bit of
