yes actually
maybe<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:34.650> can<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> full<00:02:35.100> broadcast<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:35.880> it

physical<00:02:38.460> harm<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> bridge<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.960> doesn't

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
physical harm to a bridge it doesn't

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.040 
physical harm to a bridge it doesn't
look<00:02:40.320> like<00:02:40.430> serious<00:02:41.430> yeah<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.690> looks<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:42.930> a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
look like serious yeah that looks like a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.580 
look like serious yeah that looks like a
bad<00:02:43.170> call

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
bad call

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.220 
bad call
let's<00:02:43.860> go<00:02:43.980> next<00:02:44.220> one<00:02:44.630> this<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.810> what<00:02:45.960> perhaps

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
let's go next one this is what perhaps

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.110 
let's go next one this is what perhaps
the<00:02:46.410> most<00:02:46.560> recent<00:02:47.040> inclusion<00:02:47.550> here<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:47.910> have<00:02:48.090> a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the most recent inclusion here we have a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.930 
the most recent inclusion here we have a
Jedi<00:02:48.690> helmet<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.070> basically<00:02:50.430> those<00:02:50.670> are

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
Jedi helmet and so basically those are

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.140 
Jedi helmet and so basically those are
used<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.690> coils<00:02:52.230> there<00:02:52.500> are<00:02:52.800> used<00:02:53.070> as<00:02:53.400> they

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
used the coils there are used as they

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.140 
used the coils there are used as they
pick<00:02:54.690> up<00:02:54.840> MRI<00:02:55.200> signals<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.130> help<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.640> amplify

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
pick up MRI signals and help to amplify

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.430 
pick up MRI signals and help to amplify
them<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.510> reason<00:02:57.780> they're<00:02:57.870> called<00:02:58.110> Jedi

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
them and the reason they're called Jedi

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.440 
them and the reason they're called Jedi
helmets<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.880> children<00:03:00.090> you

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
helmets is so that children you

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.760 
helmets is so that children you
obviously<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.140> different<00:03:01.440> sizes

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
obviously see that different sizes

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.960 
obviously see that different sizes
they're<00:03:01.890> there<00:03:02.010> for<00:03:02.160> adults<00:03:02.459> but<00:03:02.550> also<00:03:02.700> for

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
they're there for adults but also for

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.490 
they're there for adults but also for
children<00:03:03.270> children<00:03:03.870> would<00:03:03.990> feel<00:03:04.140> much<00:03:04.290> more

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
children children would feel much more

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.110 
children children would feel much more
comfortable<00:03:04.650> putting<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.370> something<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:05.970> you

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
comfortable putting on something if you

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.000 
comfortable putting on something if you
phrase<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:06.810> being<00:03:07.050> like<00:03:07.140> from<00:03:07.620> Star<00:03:07.980> Wars

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
phrase it as being like from Star Wars

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.340 
phrase it as being like from Star Wars
and<00:03:08.490> so<00:03:09.060> these<00:03:09.209> do<00:03:09.450> look<00:03:09.480> odd<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.170> they<00:03:10.290> do

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
and so these do look odd but they do

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.949 
and so these do look odd but they do
serve<00:03:10.740> a<00:03:10.770> current<00:03:11.280> medical<00:03:11.880> purpose<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.540> they

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
serve a current medical purpose and they

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.540 
serve a current medical purpose and they
were<00:03:13.050> called<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.770> aid<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.340> making

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550

mountings<00:03:21.980> yeah<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.730> looks<00:03:24.030> pretty<00:03:24.120> sweet

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
mountings yeah that looks pretty sweet

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.090 
mountings yeah that looks pretty sweet
it<00:03:24.810> looks<00:03:25.080> like<00:03:25.230> something<00:03:25.560> out<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.890> horror

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
obviously and I'm sure it was used for

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.440 
obviously and I'm sure it was used for
like<00:03:37.890> helping<00:03:38.220> knit<00:03:38.459> bone<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:38.970> stuff<00:03:39.180> right

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
like helping knit bone and stuff right

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.110 
like helping knit bone and stuff right
bones<00:03:39.780> but<00:03:40.050> I<00:03:40.769> like<00:03:41.250> also<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.760> I'm

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
bones but I like also that I'm

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.210 
bones but I like also that I'm
interested<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.989> sort<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.410> exoskeleton

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
interested in sort of exoskeleton

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.009 
interested in sort of exoskeleton
developing<00:03:45.000> those<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:45.480> was<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> very<00:03:45.900> early

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
developing those this was a very early

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.350 
developing those this was a very early
attempt<00:03:46.650> at<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.800> and<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.040> admire<00:03:47.370> their<00:03:48.330> work

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
attempt at it and I admire their work

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.030 
attempt at it and I admire their work
that's<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.170> oh<00:03:49.260> we<00:03:49.410> have<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.590> disturbing<00:03:49.950> I'm

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
that's it oh we have the disturbing I'm

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.630 
that's it oh we have the disturbing I'm
oh<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.400> uh<00:03:50.730> this<00:03:51.360> model<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.050> from<00:03:52.590> from<00:03:53.430> the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
oh so uh this model I is from from the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.820 
oh so uh this model I is from from the
the<00:03:53.940> 19th<00:03:54.480> century<00:03:54.870> but<00:03:55.410> what's<00:03:55.620> interesting

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
the 19th century but what's interesting

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.320 
the 19th century but what's interesting
about<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:56.220> can't<00:03:56.400> see<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.640> detail<00:03:57.060> there

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
about is you can't see the detail there

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.210 
about is you can't see the detail there
but<00:03:57.390> that's<00:03:57.750> obviously<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.500> outside<00:03:59.010> is

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
but that's obviously the outside is

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.310 
but that's obviously the outside is
painted<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.760> look<00:03:59.940> like<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.330> face<00:04:00.690> but<00:04:01.200> the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
painted to look like a face but the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.290 
painted to look like a face but the
inside<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.769> made<00:04:01.800> of<00:04:02.100> multiple<00:04:02.310> layers<00:04:02.790> of

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
inside is made of multiple layers of

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.210 
inside is made of multiple layers of
glass<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:04.230> actually<00:04:04.709> supposed<00:04:05.040> to

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
glass and it is actually supposed to

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.070 
glass and it is actually supposed to
fairly<00:04:05.670> accurately<00:04:06.150> model<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.600> various

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
fairly accurately model the various

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.140 
fairly accurately model the various
anatomical<00:04:07.380> parts<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.220> eye<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.640> so<00:04:09.030> it's

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
anatomical parts of the eye and so it's

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.550 
anatomical parts of the eye and so it's
used<00:04:09.330> for<00:04:09.420> medical<00:04:09.690> study<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.200> learning

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
used for medical study and learning

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.410 
used for medical study and learning
about<00:04:10.739> how<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:10.920> eye<00:04:11.040> operates<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.299> it

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
about how the eye operates and so it

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.300 
about how the eye operates and so it
looks<00:04:12.630> old-timey<00:04:13.500> but<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.769> was<00:04:13.920> actually

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
looks old-timey but it was actually

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.340 
looks old-timey but it was actually
quite<00:04:14.430> sophisticated<00:04:14.700> for<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.600> era<00:04:15.780> right

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
quite sophisticated for that era right

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.050 
quite sophisticated for that era right
so<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:17.010> all<00:04:17.160> really<00:04:17.370> interesting<00:04:17.880> but<00:04:18.030> I

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
so is all really interesting but I

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.000 
so is all really interesting but I
wonder<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.870> know<00:04:19.200> looking<00:04:19.440> at<00:04:19.560> our<00:04:19.650> medical

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
wonder you know looking at our medical

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.800 
wonder you know looking at our medical
instruments<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.400> we<00:04:20.489> use<00:04:20.519> today<00:04:20.820> which<00:04:21.570> one

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
instruments that we use today which one

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.000 
instruments that we use today which one
and<00:04:22.020> you<00:04:22.229> know<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.350> couple<00:04:22.590> hundred<00:04:22.919> years

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
and you know a couple hundred years

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.409 
and you know a couple hundred years
we're<00:04:23.190> gonna<00:04:23.310> look<00:04:23.490> back<00:04:23.729> how<00:04:24.150> so<00:04:24.510> inhumane

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
we're gonna look back how so inhumane

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.589 
we're gonna look back how so inhumane
yeah<00:04:26.319> yeah<00:04:26.860> so<00:04:27.069> both<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.819> also<00:04:28.270> like

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
they're gonna look back on the things

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.619 
they're gonna look back on the things
that<00:04:30.099> we<00:04:30.340> currently<00:04:30.580> either<00:04:30.969> have<00:04:31.210> no<00:04:31.360> cure

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629 
that we currently either have no cure

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.239 
that we currently either have no cure
for<00:04:31.689> or<00:04:32.080> may<00:04:32.229> have<00:04:32.319> relatively

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:33.249 
for or may have relatively

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:34.920 
for or may have relatively
unsophisticated<00:04:33.610> cures<00:04:34.270> for<00:04:34.479> like

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
unsophisticated cures for like

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.360 
unsophisticated cures for like
eventually<00:04:35.439> when<00:04:35.590> we're<00:04:35.740> doing<00:04:36.069> you<00:04:36.249> know

is<00:04:44.139> going<00:04:44.259> to<00:04:44.379> look<00:04:44.499> barbaric<00:04:44.889> I'm<00:04:44.979> sure<00:04:45.099> at

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
is going to look barbaric I'm sure at

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:47.249 
is going to look barbaric I'm sure at
some<00:04:45.249> point<00:04:45.430> casts<00:04:46.180> external<00:04:46.930> casts<00:04:47.199> are

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
some point casts external casts are

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:48.390 
some point casts external casts are
gonna<00:04:47.349> look<00:04:47.499> barbaric<00:04:47.919> right<00:04:48.129> because<00:04:48.249> they

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
gonna look barbaric right because they

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.040 
gonna look barbaric right because they

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.089 
centuries but I like to look back on
stuff<00:04:52.870> like<00:04:52.960> this<00:04:53.080> because<00:04:53.499> as<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:54.009> were

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
stuff like this because as you were

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.959 
saying it shows how far we've come and
also<00:04:56.620> how<00:04:56.889> far<00:04:57.099> we<00:04:57.249> still<00:04:57.279> have<00:04:57.520> to<00:04:57.669> go<00:04:57.939> in

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:57.969
