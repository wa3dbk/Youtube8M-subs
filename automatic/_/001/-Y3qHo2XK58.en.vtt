00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
of plastic then you're going to cool

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.379 
of plastic then you're going to cool
this<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.389> you'll<00:01:43.840> pop<00:01:44.170> them<00:01:44.469> out<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.850> like<00:01:46.179> I

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
this and you'll pop them out just like I

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.410 
this and you'll pop them out just like I
have<00:01:46.749> here<00:01:47.409> just<00:01:47.590> like<00:01:48.579> you<00:01:48.759> see<00:01:48.909> right<00:01:48.939> here

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
have here just like you see right here

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.499 
have here just like you see right here
okay<00:01:50.319> so<00:01:50.499> you'll<00:01:51.100> wind<00:01:51.340> up<00:01:51.490> with<00:01:51.579> all<00:01:51.939> kinds<00:01:51.969> of

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
okay so you'll wind up with all kinds of

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.219 
okay so you'll wind up with all kinds of
little<00:01:52.840> circle<00:01:53.409> centers<00:01:53.770> just<00:01:54.100> like<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.490> one

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
little circle centers just like this one

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.020 
little circle centers just like this one
your<00:01:56.229> next<00:01:56.560> step<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.009> create<00:01:57.369> your<00:01:57.549> backing

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
your next step is to create your backing

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.330 
your next step is to create your backing
layer<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:59.020> so<00:01:59.649> what<00:01:59.799> you're<00:01:59.859> going<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.069> do<00:02:00.189> is

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
layer and so what you're going to do is

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.529 
layer and so what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:00.429> going<00:02:00.459> to<00:02:00.609> cut<00:02:00.909> two<00:02:01.179> strips<00:02:01.240> of

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
you're going to cut two strips of

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.699 
you're going to cut two strips of
friendly<00:02:01.840> plastic<00:02:02.259> in<00:02:02.380> half<00:02:02.619> just<00:02:02.889> like<00:02:03.009> this

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
friendly plastic in half just like this

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:10.529 
friendly plastic in half just like this
lay<00:02:05.709> them<00:02:05.950> back-to-back<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:09.119> then<00:02:10.119> place

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
lay them back-to-back and then place

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.340 
lay them back-to-back and then place
this<00:02:10.899> on<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.560> griddle<00:02:12.390> until<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.480> melts<00:02:13.810> I

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.070 

have<00:02:17.350> my<00:02:17.560> background<00:02:17.860> cut<00:02:18.370> out<00:02:18.640> now<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.300> I've

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.690 
have my background cut out now and I've
done<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.380> same<00:02:20.680> technique<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.459> did

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
done the same technique that I did

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.910 
done the same technique that I did
earlier<00:02:22.209> with<00:02:22.450> cutting<00:02:22.780> out<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.230> circles<00:02:23.650> and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
earlier with cutting out the circles and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.380 
earlier with cutting out the circles and
I<00:02:24.040> popped<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.459> few<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.760> them<00:02:24.880> out<00:02:24.970> course<00:02:25.240> this

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
I popped a few of them out course this

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.020 
I popped a few of them out course this
is<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> center<00:02:25.990> one<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.860> will<00:02:27.310> leave<00:02:27.550> blank

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
is the center one that will leave blank

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.120 
is the center one that will leave blank
anyway<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.750> pop<00:02:28.990> these<00:02:29.200> two<00:02:29.470> out<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.890> show

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
anyway but I pop these two out to show

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.800 
anyway but I pop these two out to show
you<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.940> we're<00:02:31.060> going<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.270> take<00:02:31.569> those

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
you that we're going to take those

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.690 
you that we're going to take those
little<00:02:32.020> cent<00:02:32.440> circles<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.310> created

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
little cent circles that we created

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.310 
little cent circles that we created
earlier<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.330> we're<00:02:34.450> going<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.810> drop<00:02:35.050> them

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
earlier and we're going to drop them

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.729 
earlier and we're going to drop them
back<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.550> creates<00:02:36.970> kind<00:02:37.120> of

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
back in this creates kind of

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.809 
back in this creates kind of
an<00:02:37.859> embedded<00:02:38.670> look<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.859> change<00:02:41.579> the

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
an embedded look and you can change the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.149 
an embedded look and you can change the
color<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.659> dots<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.620> you're<00:02:43.769> going<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:43.980> do

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
color of the dots and you're going to do

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.289 
color of the dots and you're going to do
that<00:02:44.280> completely<00:02:45.109> to<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.230> rest<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.739> your<00:02:47.579> back

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.869 
I want to show you one that I just
finished<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:13.349> very<00:03:13.590> similar<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.819> only

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
finished it's very similar the only

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.360 
finished it's very similar the only
thing<00:03:15.659> that's<00:03:16.169> different<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.709> use<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:17.010> exact

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
thing that's different I use the exact

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.449 
thing that's different I use the exact
same<00:03:17.400> technique<00:03:18.109> except<00:03:19.109> this<00:03:19.379> time<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.950> used

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
same technique except this time I used

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.089 
same technique except this time I used
one<00:03:21.419> of<00:03:21.450> my<00:03:21.569> striped<00:03:22.139> oh<00:03:24.230> my<00:03:25.230> striped<00:03:25.560> strips<00:03:25.950> I

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
one of my striped oh my striped strips I

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.649 
one of my striped oh my striped strips I
created<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.579> with<00:03:26.760> lots<00:03:26.879> of<00:03:27.090> little<00:03:27.329> tiny

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
created this with lots of little tiny

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.449 
created this with lots of little tiny
stripes<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.349> then<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.530> cut<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.889> circles<00:03:29.310> out

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
stripes and then I cut the circles out

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.399 
stripes and then I cut the circles out
from<00:03:29.669> here<00:03:29.909> so<00:03:30.359> it's<00:03:30.540> got<00:03:30.689> a<00:03:30.719> little<00:03:31.049> bit<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.319> a

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
from here so it's got a little bit of a

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.890 
from here so it's got a little bit of a
different<00:03:31.889> pattern<00:03:32.510> when<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.719> is

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
different pattern when this is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.530 
different pattern when this is
completely<00:03:34.590> cooled<00:03:35.069> you'll<00:03:35.760> want<00:03:35.939> to<00:03:36.030> cover
