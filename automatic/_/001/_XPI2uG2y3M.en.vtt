say identifying economic and and you can

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.120 
say identifying economic and and you can
now<00:02:06.899> let<00:02:07.500> go

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
now let go

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.670 
now let go
so<00:02:10.130> now<00:02:10.310> on<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:11.420> red<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:11.989> software<00:02:12.470> is

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
so now on the red so software is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.160 
so now on the red so software is
uploading<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.910> jailbreak<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.780> your<00:02:14.900> advice

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
uploading the jailbreak to your advice

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.229 
uploading the jailbreak to your advice
so<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.709> will<00:02:15.860> just<00:02:16.130> take<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.640> couple<00:02:16.970> of

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
so this will just take a couple of

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:34.000 
so this will just take a couple of
