00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
actually did this for a week and I saw

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.300 
actually did this for a week and I saw
immediate<00:01:47.780> results<00:01:48.290> look<00:01:48.680> at<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.920> photos

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
immediate results look at the photos

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.440 
immediate results look at the photos
tada

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
tada

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.240 
tada
I<00:01:50.479> started<00:01:51.200> this<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.530> moment<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:51.890> got<00:01:52.040> back

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
I started this the moment I got back

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.399 
I started this the moment I got back
from<00:01:52.369> Hawaii<00:01:52.580> because<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.240> ate<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:53.810> much<00:01:54.080> there

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
from Hawaii because I ate so much there

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.109 
from Hawaii because I ate so much there
and<00:01:54.560> this<00:01:54.799> is<00:01:54.920> why<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:55.100> look<00:01:55.369> like<00:01:55.549> seven<00:01:55.970> days

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
and this is why I look like seven days

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.300 
and this is why I look like seven days
