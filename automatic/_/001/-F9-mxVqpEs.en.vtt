00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.870
 video recording example on nexus 6 4 k 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.910
 13 megapixel camera 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:16.289
 there is an optical stabilization module 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.779
 sony mx200 4 cameras are basically the same 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:26.539
 worth and no one plus one there is not 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.539
 optical stabilization focus 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.550
 working wouldn't say good 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.390
 focus not caught 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.809
 so now it seems caught 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:08.200
 but as for the video, I can say that 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.540
 There are problems with autofocus they are and 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.540
 on the picture 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.590
 if we talk about the video trick walks 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.830
 if we talk about the photo 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.979
 a lot of pictures are not blurred 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.780
 focus and somehow strange that the corners 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.780
 smears that half frame 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:09.989
 Well, you can see how the focus back and forth fidgets 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:12.660
 for the video it is certainly not very let's 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.319
 let's take a look at how stabilization 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.480
 works here it feels it given 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.080
 the fact that 4k video is included if we turn 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.060
 full hd 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.060
 I think another fin picture will be 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.130
 then sex is clearly a problem 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.890
 your focus
