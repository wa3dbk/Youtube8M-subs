gradually<00:01:42.640> add<00:01:42.850> more<00:01:43.150> clone<00:01:43.420> FX<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.380> model

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
gradually add more clone FX to the model

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.120 
gradually add more clone FX to the model
to<00:01:45.220> build<00:01:45.460> up<00:01:45.610> extra<00:01:45.939> thickness<00:01:46.770> take<00:01:47.770> care

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
to build up extra thickness take care

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.190 
to build up extra thickness take care
when<00:01:48.280> you're<00:01:48.460> working<00:01:48.610> with<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.149> spatula<00:01:49.390> not

to poke through and damage the clay

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.380 
to poke through and damage the clay
model<00:01:53.009> use<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.250> pencil<00:01:54.490> outline<00:01:54.789> that<00:01:55.180> you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
model use the pencil outline that you

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.590 
model use the pencil outline that you
drew<00:01:55.659> earlier<00:01:56.080> as<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.350> guide<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.850> help<00:01:57.880> maintain

the thickness of the coating eventually

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.940 
the thickness of the coating eventually
you'll<00:02:01.659> notice<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.380> clone<00:02:02.619> effects

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
you'll notice that the clone effects

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.340 
you'll notice that the clone effects
stuff<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.429> thicken<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.869> will<00:02:05.020> start<00:02:05.259> to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
stuff to thicken and it will start to

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.350 
stuff to thicken and it will start to
support<00:02:05.830> its<00:02:05.920> own<00:02:06.070> way<00:02:06.340> this<00:02:06.970> will<00:02:07.179> make<00:02:07.210> it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
support its own way this will make it

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.630 
support its own way this will make it
easier<00:02:07.600> for<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.560> build<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.160> uniform

the cast this will help you both in

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.640 
the cast this will help you both in
adding<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.120> plastic<00:02:40.540> case<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.049> if<00:02:41.500> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
adding the plastic case and if the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.789 
adding the plastic case and if the
molding<00:02:42.040> forecast<00:02:42.400> later<00:02:42.700> on<00:02:46.590> next<00:02:47.590> we'll<00:02:47.769> add

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
molding forecast later on next we'll add

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.099 
molding forecast later on next we'll add
some<00:02:47.980> small<00:02:48.579> rubber<00:02:48.850> cubes<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.720> outside

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
some small rubber cubes to the outside

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.500 
some small rubber cubes to the outside
of<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.380> silicon<00:02:50.829> mold<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:52.120> will<00:02:52.329> help

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
of the silicon mold this will help

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.990 
of the silicon mold this will help
register<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.470> skin<00:02:53.859> to<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.220> plaster<00:02:54.730> case

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
register the skin to the plaster case

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.170 
register the skin to the plaster case
and<00:02:55.600> also<00:02:56.049> make<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.470> Norwegian<00:02:56.980> fit<00:02:57.220> I'm

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
and also make it a Norwegian fit I'm

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.870 
and also make it a Norwegian fit I'm
using<00:02:58.450> some<00:02:58.840> recycled<00:02:59.200> EBA<00:02:59.680> phone<00:03:00.070> but<00:03:00.850> you

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
using some recycled EBA phone but you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.789 
using some recycled EBA phone but you
can<00:03:01.120> use<00:03:01.209> other<00:03:01.359> things<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.230> cutting<00:03:02.560> up<00:03:02.680> an

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
can use other things so I cutting up an

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.610 
can use other things so I cutting up an
old<00:03:02.950> thought<00:03:03.570> 1.5<00:03:04.570> centimeter<00:03:05.109> cubes<00:03:05.470> are

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
old thought 1.5 centimeter cubes are

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.710 
old thought 1.5 centimeter cubes are
about<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:05.950> right<00:03:06.130> size<00:03:06.420> once<00:03:07.420> you've<00:03:07.570> got

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
about the right size once you've got

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.240 
about the right size once you've got
them<00:03:07.840> stuck<00:03:08.109> to<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> surface

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.179 

scoop<00:03:13.250> up<00:03:13.459> some<00:03:13.489> excess<00:03:14.060> clone<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.599> eggs<00:03:14.780> and

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
scoop up some excess clone and eggs and

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.339 
scoop up some excess clone and eggs and
smear<00:03:16.189> it<00:03:16.310> over<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.760> rubber<00:03:16.970> cubes<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:18.170> that

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
smear it over the rubber cubes so that

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.830 
smear it over the rubber cubes so that
the<00:03:18.439> sharp<00:03:18.709> edges<00:03:18.920> become<00:03:19.459> soft<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.030> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
the sharp edges become soft and the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.119 
the sharp edges become soft and the
other<00:03:20.959> comes<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:23.019> do<00:03:24.019> a<00:03:24.049> final<00:03:24.379> cleanup<00:03:24.799> and

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
other comes to do a final cleanup and

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.440 
other comes to do a final cleanup and
then<00:03:26.120> leave<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.510> mole<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.930> set<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.209> next

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
then leave the mole to set in the next

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.930 
then leave the mole to set in the next
video<00:03:29.720> tutorial<00:03:30.409> will<00:03:30.980> cast<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.430> plastic

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
video tutorial will cast the plastic

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.769 
video tutorial will cast the plastic
case<00:03:32.180> directly<00:03:32.450> over<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.049> clone<00:03:33.379> index
