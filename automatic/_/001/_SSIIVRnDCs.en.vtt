disappeared<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.909> 5.0<00:01:36.900> our<00:01:37.350> auto

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
disappeared you can see in 5.0 our auto

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.120 
disappeared you can see in 5.0 our auto
rotate<00:01:38.430> animation<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.119> non-existent<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.979> if

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
rotate animation is non-existent but if

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.300 
rotate animation is non-existent but if
we<00:01:41.280> take<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> look<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.030> android<00:01:42.600> 5.1<00:01:43.200> our<00:01:44.040> little

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
we take a look in android 5.1 our little

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.510 
we take a look in android 5.1 our little
animation<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.939> back<00:01:45.180> which<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.990> much<00:01:46.170> nicer

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
animation is back which is much nicer

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.950 
animation is back which is much nicer
same<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:47.670> goes<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.210> flashlight<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
same thing goes for the flashlight and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.609 
same thing goes for the flashlight and
so<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:50.130> very<00:01:51.119> subtle<00:01:51.479> animations<00:01:52.110> but

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
so on very very subtle animations but

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.530 
so on very very subtle animations but
they're<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.399> nice<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.880> obviously

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
they're kind of nice and obviously

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.679 
they're kind of nice and obviously
different<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.770> on/off<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:57.030> Android

different to the just on/off in Android

the<00:02:12.390> homescreen<00:02:12.720> which<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.140> kind<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.500> nice<00:02:13.680> as

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the homescreen which is kind of nice as

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.060 
the homescreen which is kind of nice as
well<00:02:14.850> now<00:02:15.480> one<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> other<00:02:16.800> differences

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
well now one of the other differences

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.700 
well now one of the other differences
which<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.940> kind<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.180> cool<00:02:18.360> screen<00:02:19.020> pinning<00:02:19.380> so

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
which is kind of cool screen pinning so

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.710 
which is kind of cool screen pinning so
you'll<00:02:20.010> remember<00:02:20.310> screen<00:02:21.060> pinning<00:02:21.360> lets<00:02:21.570> you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
you'll remember screen pinning lets you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.140 
you'll remember screen pinning lets you
pin<00:02:22.020> an<00:02:22.230> app<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.010> your<00:02:23.400> home<00:02:23.700> screen<00:02:23.970> so

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
pin an app to the to your home screen so

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.580 
pin an app to the to your home screen so
you<00:02:24.210> know<00:02:24.360> one<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.660> back<00:02:24.870> out<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.290> go<00:02:25.410> into

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
you know one can back out and go into

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.920 
you know one can back out and go into
other<00:02:26.190> apps<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.820> don't<00:02:27.000> want<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.360> so

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
other apps that you don't want it to so

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.150 
other apps that you don't want it to so
this<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.170> what<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.410> looks<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.860> Android

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
this is what it looks like on Android

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.380 
this is what it looks like on Android
5.0<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.210> we<00:02:30.780> go<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.250> let's<00:02:32.250> go<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.520> here<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.330> you

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
5.0 if we go to let's go to here so you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.140 
5.0 if we go to let's go to here so you
can't<00:02:33.660> read<00:02:33.840> my<00:02:33.990> emails<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.910> will<00:02:36.030> go<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
can't read my emails so you will go to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.670 
can't read my emails so you will go to
the<00:02:36.330> clock<00:02:37.280> let's<00:02:38.280> find<00:02:38.610> one<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:40.110> we<00:02:40.260> can<00:02:40.470> pin

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the clock let's find one that we can pin

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.240 
the clock let's find one that we can pin
there<00:02:40.890> we<00:02:40.950> go

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
there we go

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.570 
there we go
okay<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.360> now<00:02:42.630> on<00:02:42.900> android<00:02:43.140> 5.1<00:02:43.740> when<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.100> pin

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
okay so now on android 5.1 when you pin

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.920 
okay so now on android 5.1 when you pin
the<00:02:44.730> screen<00:02:45.000> you'll<00:02:45.209> actually<00:02:45.360> get<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.660> much

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
the screen you'll actually get a much

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.480 
the screen you'll actually get a much
nicer<00:02:46.200> description<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.950> what's<00:02:47.130> happening

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
nicer description of what's happening

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.220 
nicer description of what's happening
and<00:02:47.700> how<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.940> get<00:02:48.150> out<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:48.870> obviously

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
and how to get out of it so obviously

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.530 
and how to get out of it so obviously
you<00:02:49.380> press<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.740> back<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.160> recent<00:02:50.790> buttons<00:02:51.090> to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
you press the back and recent buttons to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.470 
you press the back and recent buttons to
unpin<00:02:52.020> an<00:02:52.290> app<00:02:52.610> but<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.910> loves<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.300> guess<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
unpin an app but it loves I guess a

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.150 
unpin an app but it loves I guess a
little<00:02:54.750> bit<00:02:54.989> vague<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.410> not<00:02:55.590> everybody<00:02:55.980> was<00:02:56.100> a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
little bit vague and not everybody was a

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.590 
little bit vague and not everybody was a
fan<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.610> now<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.820> Android<00:02:57.150> team<00:02:57.390> has

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
fan so now the Android team has

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.110 
fan so now the Android team has
introduced<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.320> slightly<00:02:58.500> better<00:02:59.120> instruction

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
introduced a slightly better instruction

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.770 
introduced a slightly better instruction
on<00:03:00.420> how<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:01.100> use<00:03:02.100> screen<00:03:02.910> pinning<00:03:03.180> even<00:03:03.690> though

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
on how to use screen pinning even though

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.300 
on how to use screen pinning even though
I<00:03:03.810> don't<00:03:04.020> seem<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.320> able<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.560> use<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.890> okay

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
I don't seem to be able to use it okay

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.020 
I don't seem to be able to use it okay
just<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:06.120> demonstration<00:03:07.190> okay<00:03:08.190> now<00:03:08.790> another

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
just a demonstration okay now another

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.590 
just a demonstration okay now another
thing<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:10.320> volume<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.970> take<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> look<00:03:12.390> on

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
thing is the volume to take a look on

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.840 
thing is the volume to take a look on
the<00:03:12.840> right<00:03:13.380> let's<00:03:13.770> just<00:03:14.130> get<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.520> back<00:03:14.700> -<00:03:16.850> there

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
the right let's just get it back - there

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.080 
the right let's just get it back - there
we<00:03:17.940> go

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
we go

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.640 
we go
screen<00:03:18.480> printing<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:18.810> action<00:03:19.140> okay<00:03:20.120> now

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
screen printing in action okay now

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.050 
screen printing in action okay now
volume<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.190> we've<00:03:23.370> got<00:03:23.519> our<00:03:23.610> little<00:03:23.760> volume

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
volume so we've got our little volume

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.850 
volume so we've got our little volume
widget<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.720> see<00:03:25.080> on<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.410> left<00:03:25.620> it's

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
widget you can see on the left it's
