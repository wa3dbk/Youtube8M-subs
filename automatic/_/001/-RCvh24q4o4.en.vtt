00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.370
 cyberport presents the macbook 12 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.170
 inch of apple with the new macbook has 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.660
 Apple its fans and critics 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.309
 equally confused it is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.949
 in this notebook to one 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.650
 modification of the macbook air or is it 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.600
 but a completely own product is fact 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.220
 anyway that apple advertises his 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.000
 to be ahead of the competition 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.230
 If that's true , we'll show you now 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.570
 first the technical data 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.280
 the macbook is in the closed state 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.820
 only 13 inches high and 28 inches wide 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.790
 19 7 cm deep at a total weight 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.789
 of lean 0 92 kilograms 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.379
 the ips display is 12 inches tall and 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.320
 offers us a resolution of 2,300 4 x 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.059
 1440 pixels inside our test 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.760
 Model works an intel core 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.449
 Processor with two cores and each 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.340
 up to 1.3 ghz base clock 8 gb 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.549
 RAM come supportive 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.930
 add application data to 256 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.400
 gigabyte flash memory space 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.250
 optional are possible with 512 gb 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.650
 a height of 13 centimeters and a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.600
 weight of 920 grams you can do this 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.060
 Already almost as a tablet through 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.250
 In any case, it proves to be 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.630
 as a very light and space saving 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.659
 This product is very good for the mobile 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.189
 beyond that is created 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.720
 scores apple naturally with his 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.180
 unbeatable quality 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.950
 The housing is made of aluminum and 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.140
 the processing quality is up 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.780
 highest level no sharp edges 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.909
 no unclean processed components 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.640
 also in terms of design is apple 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.399
 faithful to his elegant line 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.990
 there are macbook air and macbook pro 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.870
 the new macbook but not only in 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.600
 silver but also in gold &amp; space co 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:59.190
 we are excited we come to 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.700
 display the resolution of 2,300 4 x 1440 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.480
 Pixels makes for a very sharp picture 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.820
 in addition are also the color and 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.399
 Contrast values â€‹â€‹at a peak level 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.220
 thanks to ips points the panel also with 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.780
 a very good viewing angle stability 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.790
 therefore, the macbook is not suitable 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.530
 to work normally but also around 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.820
 pictures and movies in very high 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.120
 quality to look at 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.130
 the maximum brightness of around 370 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.840
 candela per square meter is good 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.560
 suitable for direct sunlight 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.350
 outshine 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.510
 Thumb up at keyboard and trackpad 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.090
 There is some innovation 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.860
 the novel forest-hard argument 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.250
 does not cause clicks 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.720
 more 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.330
 instead you only get one 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.590
 further, vibrating feedback 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.450
 It offers it besides the usual 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.730
 Multi-touch gestures still impression 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.950
 Sensitive control what the keyboard 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.660
 So the manufacturer of 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.460
 the conventional shear mechanics 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.900
 adopted and the so-called 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.790
 butterfly switches installed 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.620
 this is the key to one 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.680
 more stable and react faster 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.000
 on the other hand, the use feeling is very 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.800
 Unusually, we want to finish 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.209
 still highlight the keyboard light 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.060
 The through the light sensor 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.840
 current lighting conditions adjusts thumb 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.220
 high in terms of performance has us 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.739
 apple a double-edged sword 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.900
 At first we hold that 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.790
 in the housing of our model an intel 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.540
 core processor was installed 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.970
 where the two cores 13 to 2.9 ghz in 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.650
 turbo boost files gives a plus point 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.270
 it for that because of the low 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.760
 Performance no fan can be installed 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.550
 the macbook has to be practical 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.350
 not a bit negative about yourself 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.720
 rate is, however, that the low 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.510
 performance is certainly felt 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.610
 the perfectly tuned software before 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.410
 all who edit pictures and videos 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.850
 wants to cut is noticeable 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.830
 delay must count 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.200
 at the predecessor is more at this point 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.280
 the macbook would have been in it, though 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.990
 just for surfing and for 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.510
 Office applications is needed 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.270
 We have no problems whatsoever 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.970
 due to the high price 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.980
 satisfying some criticism crops apple 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.190
 even for the lacking 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.260
 connection options 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.750
 because only one audio was installed 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.270
 socket and a usb connection 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.400
 Apple does not do more with the latter 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.200
 but a step into the future because 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.000
 You can use the device c port to get the device 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.130
 charge as well as data with one 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.269
 speed of up to 5 gigabits per 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.310
 seconds 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.160
 However, his data on an external 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.170
 memory to transfer or vga and hdmi 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.240
 you have to use the connections 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.830
 to shelve one or the other there 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.440
 there are hardly any devices on the market 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.030
 have a usb 3.1 connection to offer 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.100
 at the wireless connection 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.700
 possibilities apple does not, however, 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.919
 saved up 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.050
 wlan with lg speed as well 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.790
 Bluetooth 4.0 is the responsibility of the user 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.900
 disposal 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.810
 in summary a satisfying one 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.180
 Result in the battery life gives itself 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.460
 Apple in his notes always honestly so 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.750
 also with this macbook loud manufacturer 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.150
 creates the device at normal 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.870
 internet use via wlan about nine 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.550
 hours 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.350
 this result we can only 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.820
 confirm at slightly reduced 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.930
 brightness even creates ten 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.160
 hours 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.590
 a very good result our conclusion that 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.470
 Macbook 12 inch convinces us in matters 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.300
 design battery life and display where 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.740
 Unfortunately, we made a marked reduction in the 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 had to determine performance 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.370
 In addition, the notebook brings 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.979
 some innovations with it 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.169
 are quite forward-looking if that 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.120
 thus far ahead of competition 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.430
 But we would like to doubt that 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.750
 the always crisp price can us 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.900
 not completely convincing 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.220
 Finally, we give four out of five 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.220
 cyber stars
