00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
now if you turn the meter on it goes

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.400 
now if you turn the meter on it goes
from<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.550> self-check<00:00:55.149> and<00:00:55.449> just<00:00:55.749> does<00:00:55.929> that<00:00:56.140> oh

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
from a self-check and just does that oh

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.860 
from a self-check and just does that oh
let's<00:00:57.339> put<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:57.640> up<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.120> mobile<00:00:58.539> phone

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
let's put it up to the mobile phone

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.510 
let's put it up to the mobile phone
there<00:00:59.620> we<00:00:59.710> go<00:00:59.829> and<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:01.329> get<00:01:03.210> reading<00:01:04.440> just

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
there we go and we get reading just

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.970 
there we go and we get reading just
around<00:01:06.540> put<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.630> on<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.780> back<00:01:07.960> of<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.230> to<00:01:08.830> get

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
around put it on the back of it to get

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.130 
around put it on the back of it to get
it<00:01:09.190> there<00:01:09.430> but<00:01:09.909> it's<00:01:10.060> intermittent<00:01:10.540> it's<00:01:10.990> on

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
it there but it's intermittent it's on

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.840 
it there but it's intermittent it's on
and<00:01:11.320> off<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:12.430> going<00:01:12.759> up<00:01:12.850> on<00:01:13.479> and<00:01:13.659> off<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:14.079> see

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and off it's going up on and off you see

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.100 
and off it's going up on and off you see
not<00:01:15.850> brilliant<00:01:16.329> so<00:01:16.509> I'm<00:01:16.570> gonna<00:01:16.750> leave<00:01:16.990> the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
not brilliant so I'm gonna leave the

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.190 
not brilliant so I'm gonna leave the
sensor<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:18.729> underneath<00:01:19.710> my<00:01:20.710> nokia<00:01:21.130> n95<00:01:22.200> back

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
think that will conclude the mobile home

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.510 
think that will conclude the mobile home
test<00:04:20.540> from<00:04:20.690> our<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.410> there<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.709> evidence<00:04:22.190> says

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
test from our so there is evidence says

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.450 
test from our so there is evidence says
that<00:04:23.150> there<00:04:23.360> is<00:04:23.510> a<00:04:24.130> electric<00:04:25.130> magnetic

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
that there is a electric magnetic

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.390 
that there is a electric magnetic
radiation<00:04:25.850> coming<00:04:26.480> off<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:27.080> phone<00:04:27.400> doesn't

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
radiation coming off the phone doesn't

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.730 
radiation coming off the phone doesn't
seem<00:04:28.610> as<00:04:28.760> bad<00:04:28.790> as<00:04:29.180> what<00:04:29.330> you<00:04:30.050> know<00:04:30.170> some<00:04:30.470> people
