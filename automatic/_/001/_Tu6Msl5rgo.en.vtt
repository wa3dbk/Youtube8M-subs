00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
announced too was that I guess it looks

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.190 
announced too was that I guess it looks
like<00:01:59.009> because<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.880> gameplay<00:02:00.630> footage<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.049> all

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
like because the gameplay footage is all

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.740 
like because the gameplay footage is all
is<00:02:01.590> all<00:02:02.040> real<00:02:02.219> video<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.880> guess<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.479> can't

really<00:02:04.020> customize<00:02:04.200> your<00:02:04.530> character<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.189> I

think that's going to disappoint a lot
of<00:02:06.450> people<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:07.020> character

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
of people because character

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.109 
of people because character
customization<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.520> something<00:02:08.789> we've<00:02:08.910> known

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119

no songs have gone leaked so far but

no songs have gone leaked so far but
they've<00:03:11.190> said<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.550> it's<00:03:11.640> gonna<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:11.909> pretty

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
they've said that it's gonna be pretty

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.940 
they've said that it's gonna be pretty
top<00:03:12.569> tier<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:13.200> gonna<00:03:13.379> feature<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.709> lot<00:03:13.860> of

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
top tier and it's gonna feature a lot of

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.259 
top tier and it's gonna feature a lot of
artists<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:14.310> haven't<00:03:14.519> seen<00:03:14.640> before<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:15.030> rock

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
artists we haven't seen before in rock

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.270 
artists we haven't seen before in rock
band<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.810> now<00:03:16.290> be<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:16.830> also<00:03:16.950> think<00:03:17.190> it's

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
band and now be and I also think it's

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.979 
band and now be and I also think it's
gonna<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.489> more<00:03:17.610> focus<00:03:18.000> because<00:03:18.330> keyboards

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
gonna be more focus because keyboards

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.680 
gonna be more focus because keyboards
are<00:03:19.080> not<00:03:19.230> being<00:03:19.409> supported<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:19.920> rock<00:03:20.040> band<00:03:20.250> 4

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
are not being supported in rock band 4

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.640 
are not being supported in rock band 4
they're<00:03:21.690> going<00:03:21.870> back<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.409> core

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
they're going back to the core

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.320 
they're going back to the core
experience<00:03:23.069> just<00:03:23.610> featuring<00:03:24.060> four

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
experience just featuring four

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.820 
experience just featuring four
instruments<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:24.989> seems<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.290> harmonies<00:03:25.680> are

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
instruments it seems like harmonies are

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.509 
instruments it seems like harmonies are
up<00:03:25.920> in<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.129> air

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
up in the air

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.220 
up in the air
I'm<00:03:26.670> guessing<00:03:27.360> armies<00:03:27.659> may<00:03:27.780> not<00:03:27.959> be<00:03:28.110> included

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
I'm guessing armies may not be included

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.110 
I'm guessing armies may not be included
from<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.920> information<00:03:29.220> we've<00:03:29.459> seen<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:29.849> far

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
from the information we've seen so far

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.750 
from the information we've seen so far
but<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.900> think<00:03:30.989> they<00:03:31.379> that<00:03:32.040> allows<00:03:32.280> our<00:03:32.430> monix

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
but I think they that allows our monix

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.369 
but I think they that allows our monix
to<00:03:32.819> be<00:03:32.909> more<00:03:33.060> focused<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.540> just<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:34.290> know

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
to be more focused on just you know

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.259 
to be more focused on just you know
catering<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.129> a<00:03:35.159> certain<00:03:35.489> genre<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.060> rock

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
catering to a certain genre of rock

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.940 
catering to a certain genre of rock
rather<00:03:36.569> than<00:03:36.810> seeing<00:03:37.019> bands<00:03:37.230> we<00:03:37.530> saw<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.769> rock

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
rather than seeing bands we saw in rock

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.100 
rather than seeing bands we saw in rock
band<00:03:38.159> 3<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.700> look<00:03:38.940> seeing<00:03:39.810> artists<00:03:40.019> like

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
band 3 like look seeing artists like

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.910 
band 3 like look seeing artists like

Lady gaga
Elton<00:03:41.220> John<00:03:41.250> or<00:03:41.519> Billy<00:03:41.940> Joel<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.540> don't<00:03:42.690> think

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
Elton John or Billy Joel I don't think

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.240 
Elton John or Billy Joel I don't think
some<00:03:43.110> of<00:03:43.140> those<00:03:43.290> artists<00:03:43.530> will<00:03:43.650> return

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
some of those artists will return

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.070 
some of those artists will return
whereas<00:03:44.879> Guitar<00:03:45.239> Hero<00:03:45.420> has<00:03:45.510> been<00:03:45.599> pretty<00:03:45.810> open

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
whereas Guitar Hero has been pretty open

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.240 
whereas Guitar Hero has been pretty open
with<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.290> artists<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.650> are<00:03:46.799> going<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.129> be

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
with the artists that are going to be

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.680 
with the artists that are going to be
into<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.519> game<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.299> gonna<00:03:48.390> be<00:03:48.510> pretty

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
into the game so it's gonna be pretty

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.059 
into the game so it's gonna be pretty
eclectic<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:49.409> going<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.620> be<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:49.739> lot

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
eclectic and it's going to be a lot

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.850 
eclectic and it's going to be a lot
different<00:03:50.549> than<00:03:50.580> what<00:03:50.819> we<00:03:51.030> saw<00:03:51.299> in<00:03:51.569> past<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.290> get

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
different than what we saw in past I get

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.440 
different than what we saw in past I get
to<00:03:52.950> our<00:03:53.040> hero<00:03:53.280> games<00:03:53.580> which<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.120> think<00:03:54.330> may

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
to our hero games which I think may

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.990 
to our hero games which I think may
upset<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:54.959> fact<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.319> lot<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.590> people<00:03:55.909> some<00:03:56.909> of

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
upset in fact a lot of people some of

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.300 
upset in fact a lot of people some of
the<00:03:57.060> artists<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:57.390> were<00:03:57.540> announced<00:03:57.780> today

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
the artists that were announced today

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.619 
the artists that were announced today
included<00:03:59.310> people<00:03:59.489> like<00:03:59.640> Skrillex<00:04:00.239> which<00:04:00.510> I

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
included people like Skrillex which I

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.509 
included people like Skrillex which I
think<00:04:00.810> isn't<00:04:00.930> rather<00:04:01.170> interesting<00:04:01.830> addition

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
think isn't rather interesting addition

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.580 
think isn't rather interesting addition

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
gameplay experience which is something I

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.519 
gameplay experience which is something I
think<00:05:34.430> is<00:05:34.699> a<00:05:34.729> start<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.870> a<00:05:36.020> drastic

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:36.529 
think is a start and a drastic

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.100 
think is a start and a drastic
difference<00:05:36.889> between<00:05:37.219> both<00:05:37.520> franchises<00:05:38.360> I<00:05:38.479> the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
difference between both franchises I the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.480 
difference between both franchises I the
thing<00:05:39.289> I<00:05:39.349> fear<00:05:39.529> with<00:05:39.650> Guitar<00:05:39.979> Hero<00:05:40.219> is<00:05:40.340> that

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
thing I fear with Guitar Hero is that

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.159 
thing I fear with Guitar Hero is that
the<00:05:40.639> gameplay<00:05:40.969> is<00:05:41.029> going<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.360> get<00:05:41.479> stale<00:05:41.779> and

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
the gameplay is going to get stale and

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.260 
the gameplay is going to get stale and
