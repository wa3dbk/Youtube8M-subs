00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.569
 conform to valves dominance quite simple the previous episode that 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.069
 was the first of the saga 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:29.980
 a piloted by codemasters 11 he laid the groundwork now factors one goes in 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.659
 to find shit bag anyway we hope and then improve with the 

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.800
 narration and without false notes and the gameplay 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.280
 at the gameplay level in actually reworking the suspensions and 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.400
 rework influenza we find a car that is well camped on its 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.600
 wheels and with one of the best lateral madian moves 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.260
 also at the content level a little better when we will obviously have everything 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.020
 the current season but also to find 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.350
 additional elements but this Picard who will enter 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.670
 we also have the improvements such nonsense all the assets the elements 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.300
 play 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.240
 media points 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.650
 and then that stuff 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.990
 overall we can say that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.120
 the episode of evolution to have if the storm to these green shutters for the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.330
 fountain at the turn on the part is over acquiesced anyway 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.880
 disappointing in the previous episode baget on the graphic part six 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.340
 carrots always up to date 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.310
 for that he will not have a problem 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.520
 besides to have what it takes is really a very very good with 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.310
 him with the chopsticks competition 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.590
 and the time this time in fact we can play online at 16 with more 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.450
 the old continent 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.640
 directed by the ia so here is really an episode that will allow 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.290
 but I was a lot of little things in celebration that was missing in the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.540
 previous that would have laid the groundwork 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.950
 for his first race first people discovery anyway 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.159
 we find her to find a joker are still very much at the premiere in 2010 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.100
 that's normal 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.250
 in any case what is the additional content 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.390
 it will go 60 35 euros of play
