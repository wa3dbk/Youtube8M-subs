number<00:00:22.610> one<00:00:22.730> you're<00:00:23.390> going<00:00:23.509> to<00:00:23.570> have<00:00:23.630> to<00:00:23.810> deal

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
number one you're going to have to deal

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.530 
number one you're going to have to deal
with<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.649> car<00:00:25.009> engine<00:00:25.460> noise<00:00:25.669> because<00:00:26.390> when

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
with the car engine noise because when

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.970 
with the car engine noise because when
you<00:00:26.630> cut<00:00:26.809> the<00:00:26.899> dialogue<00:00:27.290> back<00:00:27.469> and<00:00:27.500> forth

you cut the dialogue back and forth

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.799 
you cut the dialogue back and forth
obviously<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.520> noise<00:00:28.730> of<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.239> engine<00:00:29.570> is<00:00:29.660> not

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:29.809 
obviously the noise of the engine is not

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:31.510 
obviously the noise of the engine is not
going<00:00:29.930> to<00:00:29.989> be<00:00:30.079> consistent<00:00:30.410> so<00:00:31.160> that's<00:00:31.369> when

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
going to be consistent so that's when

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.220 
going to be consistent so that's when
you're<00:00:31.640> going<00:00:31.759> to<00:00:31.849> notice<00:00:31.969> it<00:00:32.270> now<00:00:32.750> you<00:00:32.809> have<00:00:33.110> a

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
you're going to notice it now you have a

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.010 
you're going to notice it now you have a
few<00:00:33.469> options<00:00:33.500> if<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.040> have<00:00:34.070> a<00:00:34.280> decent<00:00:34.550> budget

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
few options if you have a decent budget

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.180 
few options if you have a decent budget
normally<00:00:36.020> what<00:00:36.200> they<00:00:36.230> do<00:00:36.379> is<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.860> car<00:00:37.070> is

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
normally what they do is the car is

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.010 
normally what they do is the car is
being<00:00:37.399> pulled<00:00:37.730> by<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:37.940> car<00:00:38.239> in<00:00:38.270> front<00:00:38.660> of<00:00:38.750> it<00:00:38.840> so

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
being pulled by a car in front of it so

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.439 
being pulled by a car in front of it so
the<00:00:39.410> car<00:00:39.620> where<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:40.489> actors<00:00:40.789> are<00:00:40.879> inside<00:00:41.269> is

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
the car where the actors are inside is

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.270 
the car where the actors are inside is
actually<00:00:41.570> not<00:00:41.899> running<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.530> that<00:00:42.829> reduces<00:00:43.219> a

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
actually not running and that reduces a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.340 
actually not running and that reduces a
lot<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.579> unwanted<00:00:44.210> sound<00:00:44.539> however<00:00:44.989> you're

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
lot of unwanted sound however you're

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.020 
lot of unwanted sound however you're
still<00:00:45.530> going<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.769> have<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.190> car<00:00:46.429> in<00:00:46.670> front<00:00:46.850> of

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
still going to have the car in front of

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.000 
still going to have the car in front of
you<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:48.170> know<00:00:48.379> you're<00:00:48.739> going<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:48.920> have

watch movies all that dialogue inside of

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:54.790 
watch movies all that dialogue inside of
cars<00:00:53.449> unless<00:00:54.109> it's<00:00:54.319> done<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.559> soundstage

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800

cars unless it's done on a soundstage
where<00:00:55.190> they<00:00:55.460> can<00:00:55.640> control<00:00:55.999> the<00:00:56.390> environment

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
where they can control the environment

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.630 
where they can control the environment
including<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.559> sound<00:00:57.769> obviously<00:00:58.249> that

including the sound obviously that

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.040 
including the sound obviously that
dialogue<00:00:59.059> is<00:00:59.210> most<00:00:59.390> likely<00:00:59.749> going<00:00:59.899> to<00:00:59.989> be

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050

camera to move obviously now ideally if
you<00:01:34.909> have<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.210> GoPro<00:01:35.899> camera<00:01:35.930> that<00:01:36.649> would<00:01:36.799> be

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
you have a GoPro camera that would be

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.499 
you have a GoPro camera that would be
amazing<00:01:37.219> because<00:01:37.490> they're<00:01:37.850> small<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.210> you

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
amazing because they're small and you

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.480 
amazing because they're small and you
can<00:01:38.689> put<00:01:38.990> them<00:01:39.079> in<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.200> lot<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.380> places<00:01:39.710> now<00:01:40.430> I

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
can put them in a lot of places now I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.330 
can put them in a lot of places now I
don't<00:01:40.640> have<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.329> use<00:01:41.509> my<00:01:41.689> t3<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.340> normally

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
don't have it so I use my t3 I normally

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.980 
don't have it so I use my t3 I normally
I<00:01:43.369> use<00:01:43.549> a<00:01:43.579> battery<00:01:43.820> pack<00:01:44.119> with<00:01:44.329> my<00:01:44.479> t3<00:01:44.960> I

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
I use a battery pack with my t3 I

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.050 
I use a battery pack with my t3 I
however<00:01:45.350> in<00:01:45.680> this<00:01:45.859> case<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:46.399> removed<00:01:46.850> it

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
however in this case I removed it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.700 
however in this case I removed it
because<00:01:47.509> it's<00:01:47.840> an<00:01:47.960> additional<00:01:48.289> weight<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:48.649> I

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
because it's an additional weight that I

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.700 
because it's an additional weight that I
don't<00:01:48.920> need<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:49.689> use<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:50.869> standard<00:01:51.259> lens<00:01:51.439> scape

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
don't need I use the standard lens scape

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.440 
don't need I use the standard lens scape
that<00:01:51.890> came<00:01:52.070> with<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.369> camera<00:01:52.549> which<00:01:52.939> is<00:01:53.060> an<00:01:53.149> 18

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
that came with the camera which is an 18

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.349 
that came with the camera which is an 18
to<00:01:53.600> 55<00:01:54.109> millons<00:01:54.770> I<00:01:55.039> assumed<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.490> out<00:01:55.579> to<00:01:55.759> 18<00:01:55.939> mil

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
to 55 millons I assumed it out to 18 mil

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.810 
to 55 millons I assumed it out to 18 mil
and<00:01:56.539> I<00:01:56.840> was<00:01:56.990> able<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.259> capture<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:58.189> entire<00:01:58.280> car

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
and I was able to capture the entire car

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.060 
and I was able to capture the entire car
for<00:01:59.600> sound<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.929> use<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.170> same<00:02:00.380> audio<00:02:00.679> recorder

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
for sound I use the same audio recorder

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.679 
for sound I use the same audio recorder
that<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.340> used<00:02:01.579> for<00:02:01.850> most<00:02:02.030> of<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.270> film<00:02:02.509> and

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
that I used for most of the film and

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.889 
that I used for most of the film and
most<00:02:02.960> of<00:02:03.109> my<00:02:03.229> projects<00:02:03.950> which<00:02:04.579> is<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.939> h4<00:02:05.479> zoom

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
most of my projects which is the h4 zoom

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.260 
most of my projects which is the h4 zoom
and<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.710> placed<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.100> slightly<00:02:07.369> below<00:02:07.670> frame<00:02:08.060> so

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
and I placed a slightly below frame so

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.749 
and I placed a slightly below frame so
you<00:02:08.330> can<00:02:08.509> capture<00:02:08.690> both<00:02:09.140> actors<00:02:09.679> also<00:02:10.130> by

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
you can capture both actors also by

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.880 
you can capture both actors also by
doing<00:02:10.820> it<00:02:11.210> this<00:02:11.390> way<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.870> are<00:02:12.080> capturing<00:02:12.710> the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
doing it this way you are capturing the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.530 
doing it this way you are capturing the
engine<00:02:13.220> noise<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:13.970> because<00:02:14.330> you're<00:02:14.450> not

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
engine noise but because you're not

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.540 
engine noise but because you're not
cutting<00:02:14.810> away<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.620> actually<00:02:16.069> becomes<00:02:16.400> a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
cutting away it actually becomes a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.369 
cutting away it actually becomes a
natural<00:02:16.760> engine<00:02:17.420> noise<00:02:17.599> that<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:17.959> would<00:02:18.110> have

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
natural engine noise that you would have

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.140 
natural engine noise that you would have
in<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.680> scene<00:02:18.890> anyway<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:19.849> way<00:02:20.000> you're

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
in a scene anyway this way you're

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.790 
in a scene anyway this way you're
getting<00:02:20.390> everything<00:02:20.629> at<00:02:20.870> once<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.409> it<00:02:21.500> sound

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
getting everything at once and it sound

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.010 
getting everything at once and it sound
good<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.190> sounds<00:02:22.430> very<00:02:22.550> natural<00:02:23.210> it's<00:02:23.780> also<00:02:23.900> a

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
good it sounds very natural it's also a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.140 
good it sounds very natural it's also a
very<00:02:24.140> quick<00:02:24.500> way<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.710> doing<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.430> my<00:02:25.580> case<00:02:25.850> it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
very quick way of doing it in my case it

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.600 
very quick way of doing it in my case it
was<00:02:26.210> just<00:02:26.360> me<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.720> my<00:02:26.870> producer<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.560> set<00:02:28.100> for

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
was just me and my producer on set for

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.190 
was just me and my producer on set for
that<00:02:28.730> scene<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.270> we<00:02:29.690> were<00:02:29.780> hiding<00:02:30.050> in<00:02:30.140> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
that scene and we were hiding in the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.020 
that scene and we were hiding in the
backseat<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.740> you<00:02:30.830> couldn't<00:02:31.070> see<00:02:31.310> us<00:02:31.340> so<00:02:31.970> this

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
backseat so you couldn't see us so this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.160 
backseat so you couldn't see us so this
is<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.240> very<00:02:32.390> quick<00:02:32.570> way<00:02:32.630> of<00:02:32.750> doing<00:02:32.870> these

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
is a very quick way of doing these

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.930 
is a very quick way of doing these
things<00:02:33.230> if<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:33.740> just<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.520> really<00:02:34.730> don't

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
things if it's just you you really don't

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.150 
things if it's just you you really don't
need<00:02:35.060> anyone<00:02:35.450> else<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:36.530> only<00:02:36.740> thing<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.010> did

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
need anyone else the only thing I did

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.770 
need anyone else the only thing I did
later<00:02:37.340> on<00:02:37.580> with<00:02:37.760> some<00:02:37.790> color<00:02:38.120> correction<00:02:38.660> and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
later on with some color correction and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.390 
later on with some color correction and
I<00:02:38.990> added<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.290> song<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.770> was<00:02:39.830> playing<00:02:40.070> on<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
I added a song that was playing on the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.640 
I added a song that was playing on the
radio<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.000> car<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.750> everything<00:02:42.110> else<00:02:42.290> was

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
radio in the car but everything else was

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.830 
radio in the car but everything else was
recorded<00:02:43.190> on<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.520> day<00:02:43.670> if<00:02:44.330> you<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.600> very

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
recorded on the day if you have very

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.600 
recorded on the day if you have very
long<00:02:45.170> scene<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.710> car<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.160> might<00:02:46.400> not<00:02:46.430> work

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
long scene in a car this might not work

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.520 
long scene in a car this might not work
for<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.390> just<00:02:47.540> depends<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:47.990> how<00:02:48.140> long<00:02:48.350> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
for you it just depends on how long the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.500 
for you it just depends on how long the
scene<00:02:48.740> is<00:02:49.010> but<00:02:49.490> my<00:02:49.640> scene<00:02:49.910> was<00:02:50.060> relatively

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
scene is but my scene was relatively

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.930 
scene is but my scene was relatively
short<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.260> worked<00:02:51.470> perfectly<00:02:51.980> stay<00:02:52.760> tuned

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
short and it worked perfectly stay tuned
