spring<00:01:46.980> powered<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.460> has<00:01:47.580> nothing<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.910> do<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
spring powered it has nothing to do the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.020 
spring powered it has nothing to do the
arms<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.750> got<00:01:48.930> our<00:01:49.050> lowest<00:01:49.500> shot<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.950> sit<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
arms we got our lowest shot here sit and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.360 
arms we got our lowest shot here sit and
smack<00:01:51.390> dab<00:01:51.600> between<00:01:52.190> 32<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:53.660> 33<00:01:54.660> feet<00:01:55.370> we'll

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
smack dab between 32 and 33 feet we'll

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.320 
smack dab between 32 and 33 feet we'll
work<00:01:56.520> our<00:01:56.729> way<00:01:56.760> up

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
work our way up

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.450 
work our way up
slight<00:01:58.020> breeze<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.800> you<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.040> see<00:01:59.100> all<00:01:59.370> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
slight breeze but as you can see all the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.090 
slight breeze but as you can see all the
shots<00:01:59.670> went<00:02:00.030> pretty<00:02:00.330> much<00:02:00.570> down<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> tape<00:02:01.229> so

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
shots went pretty much down the tape so

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.560 
shots went pretty much down the tape so
the<00:02:02.400> breeze<00:02:02.610> isn't<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.120> doing<00:02:03.390> anything

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
the breeze isn't really doing anything

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.990 
the breeze isn't really doing anything
