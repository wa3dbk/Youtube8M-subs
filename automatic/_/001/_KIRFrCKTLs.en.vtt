00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.740
 halli hello my name is human and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.980
 today show you two again 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.920
 features so wet and strato in the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.850
 or how to speak that somehow eyes 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.039
 no idea 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.840
 ok it is so I am here 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.890
 now from the entrance of stockholm or 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.890
 no idea how to pronounce it 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.070
 stand close to the wall and take 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.070
 Motivate your dark 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.500
 so i take my polycom server now 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:59.210
 because mostly elixir of the giant growth 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.809
 not enough then you imagine 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.850
 very close to the corner I said 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.310
 mostly on this alpine trachtler 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.509
 and just use the spacebar that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.509
 they can escape through the wall 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.850
 so now we are in springs annas 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.240
 or what is left of it 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.240
 has remained 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:20.560
 So now I show I think of the state 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:27.720
 So how do you get outside the indie 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:29.590
 come now you just have to try 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.450
 to jump here 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:37.990
 it might take a little longer but yes it does 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:42.660
 worth it if you are on the tip 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.220
 and what new exploring choose so 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.950
 can they just try to 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.750
 along the wall go very close all the way 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.820
 very tight because otherwise you are back 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.820
 out of the indie outside yes 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.270
 here could have seen blizzard 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.900
 probably no more desire to continue to 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.749
 work 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.060
 You can not do any better 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:29.050
 resent and they have 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.349
 probably thought who would 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:40.360
 the fact that you are there get there 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:40.360
 outside of never who else am I others 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.700
 so people that's it for today i hope 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.740

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.900
