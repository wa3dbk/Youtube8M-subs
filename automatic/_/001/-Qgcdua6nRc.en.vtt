00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.500
 The Good Shepherd 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.960
 and 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.750
 I thank you very much for the water that 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.170
 generously you have offered me the water is 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.500
 a gift from god is not mine I wish you a 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.140
 good trip and may the Lord accompany you 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.029
 I will go up to the slopes so that 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.029
 sheep do not lack food 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.400
 what a good person is the shepherd Look 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.200
 how love leads his sheep how 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.800
 Be careful not to let the 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.640
 flock 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.210
 listening 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.430
 before I asked myself is that who is God 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.160
 and how is your relationship with man 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.950
 God is the good shepherd who loves a lot 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.950
 his sheep that helps them and defends them 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.339
 father I'm sleepy when we go to 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.650
 rest soon my son now you have to 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:10.200
 fix this door well so that 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.200
 Night do not enter the beasts and hurt 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.140
 Look how affectionate he is that you want him 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.450
 cherish is true like all sheep 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.940
 this little lamb, although he has recently 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.250
 born knows very well who loves him and 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.420
 who comes to kill him or only 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.420
 to annoy you 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.340
 here now they will not be able to enter nor the 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.130
 fox nor the wolf and the night will pass to 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.630
 completely quiet but if they come 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.670
 the thieves who will defend the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.770
 sheep if you are asleep 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.869
 the sheep will know that they are not their 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.869
 pastor their masters but they are evildoers 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.160
 here is the answer to your question 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.010
 the dog and the sheep will recognize 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.730
 immediately the voice the appearance and the smell of 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.730
 the strangers 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.140
 animals and shepherds are like an army 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.210
 who defends himself from those who have bad 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.730
 intentions we the shepherds 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.590
 we are willing to do everything to defend 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.770
 to the sheep you have understood 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.350
 perfectly my son I love my 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.180
 sheep and I will defend them with all 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.700
 means they know and trust me 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.920
 teacher I do not find anything particular 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.049
 in this you have told me what 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.060
 logical encounter it is natural that the 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.380
 shepherd loves his sheep you said 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.460
 all right 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.130
 all the shepherds love their sheep 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.900
 what you have not come to understand is that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.230
 I am also the good shepherd 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.970
 all men are my sheep and I 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.970
 I am willing to give my life for them 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.330
 come soft and your star be careful 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.330
 do not run so much that you can hurt yourself 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.980
 all the sheep recognize all you 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.470
 continue like this is if some do not 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.500
 would recognize would be a sheep of another 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.840
 flock 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.590
 I know them all and they 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.930
 they know me if I'm like the good 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.610
 pastor and the same as he loves his 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.340
 sheep and is willing to give his life 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.760
 for them I love all men without 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.060
 exclude anyone 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.120
 there are many men who do not recognize me 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.569
 maybe they will never recognize me but I 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.120
 I will love you despite everything we already know that 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:48.209

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.209
