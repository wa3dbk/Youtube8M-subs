00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
gonna go through that hole back through

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:28.120 
gonna go through that hole back through
the<00:01:14.820> weft<00:01:14.970> once<00:01:18.590> twice<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:21.200> then<00:01:22.200> three<00:01:22.560> times

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.179

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
okay now you're gonna go back through

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.870 
okay now you're gonna go back through
the<00:01:31.640> weft<00:01:32.829> so<00:01:33.829> that<00:01:33.979> your<00:01:34.100> underneath<00:01:34.640> your

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
the weft so that your underneath your

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.940 
the weft so that your underneath your
clip<00:01:37.000> you're<00:01:38.000> going<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.270> put<00:01:38.479> your<00:01:38.570> clip<00:01:38.950> in

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
clip you're going to put your clip in

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.069 
clip you're going to put your clip in
place<00:01:40.090> they'll<00:01:41.090> hold<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.390> slightly<00:01:41.780> off<00:01:41.899> the

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
place they'll hold it slightly off the

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.480 
place they'll hold it slightly off the
weft<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:42.850> go<00:01:43.850> just<00:01:44.270> above<00:01:44.509> that<00:01:44.750> hole<00:01:45.490> through

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
weft and go just above that hole through

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.919 
weft and go just above that hole through
the<00:01:46.579> weft

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.330 

and<00:01:50.929> what<00:01:51.259> that's<00:01:51.439> going<00:01:51.679> to<00:01:51.740> do<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.159> it's

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
and what that's going to do is it's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.940 
and what that's going to do is it's
going<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.640> allow<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.299> to<00:01:53.750> get<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.500> thread

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
going to allow you to get that thread

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.620 
going to allow you to get that thread
over<00:01:55.429> to<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.670> other<00:01:55.759> side<00:01:56.060> but<00:01:56.390> you're<00:01:56.539> gonna

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
over to the other side but you're gonna

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.370 
over to the other side but you're gonna
hide<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.140> underneath<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.890> clip<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:59.380> then

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
hide it underneath that clip so then

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.020 
hide it underneath that clip so then
you're<00:02:00.530> gonna<00:02:00.619> go<00:02:00.799> actually<00:02:01.130> through<00:02:01.849> that

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
you're gonna go actually through that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.249 
you're gonna go actually through that
hole<00:02:02.330> once

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.759 

twice<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:10.239> you're<00:02:11.019> probably<00:02:11.319> already

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
twice and you're probably already

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:19.589 
twice and you're probably already
guessing<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:13.319> three<00:02:14.319> times<00:02:18.209> now<00:02:19.209> we're<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
guessing it three times now we're on the

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.690 
guessing it three times now we're on the
front<00:02:19.810> side<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.019> our<00:02:20.200> West<00:02:20.379> we<00:02:20.799> need<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:21.159> go

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
front side of our West we need to go

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.250 
front side of our West we need to go
underneath<00:02:22.299> our<00:02:22.629> clip<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:24.450> tie<00:02:25.450> our<00:02:25.480> knots<00:02:28.260> so

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
underneath our clip and tie our knots so

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.160 
underneath our clip and tie our knots so
I<00:02:29.319> just<00:02:29.440> flipped<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.860> up<00:02:29.950> out<00:02:30.099> of<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.280> way<00:02:31.170> so

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
I just flipped it up out of the way so

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.559 
I just flipped it up out of the way so
we're<00:02:32.290> gonna<00:02:32.379> go<00:02:32.590> through<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:32.950> left<00:02:33.430> once

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.800 

around<00:02:37.569> our<00:02:37.750> thread<00:02:37.989> twice<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:40.599> we're<00:02:40.690> going

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
around our thread twice and we're going

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.509 
around our thread twice and we're going
to<00:02:40.870> repeat<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:42.030> through<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> left<00:02:46.859> and<00:02:47.859> to

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
to repeat that through the left and to

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.949 
to repeat that through the left and to
make<00:02:48.670> our<00:02:48.819> knot<00:02:49.000> we're<00:02:49.269> gonna<00:02:49.359> go<00:02:49.540> around<00:02:49.840> our

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
make our knot we're gonna go around our

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.949 
make our knot we're gonna go around our
thread<00:02:50.200> once<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.980> twice<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.760> then<00:02:52.569> pull<00:02:52.599> it

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
thread once and twice and then pull it
