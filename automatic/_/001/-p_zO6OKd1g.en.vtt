nothing<00:04:12.950> fancy<00:04:13.160> but<00:04:13.640> our<00:04:14.300> kitchen<00:04:14.810> just

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
nothing fancy but our kitchen just

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.900 
nothing fancy but our kitchen just
happens<00:04:15.350> to<00:04:15.440> have<00:04:15.470> lots<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.890> red<00:04:16.100> in<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:16.340> so

happens to have lots of red in it so

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.909 
happens to have lots of red in it so
that<00:04:17.060> was<00:04:17.239> really<00:04:17.269> exciting<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:18.200> I've<00:04:18.769> never

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919

that was really exciting and I've never
seen<00:04:19.160> this<00:04:19.280> before<00:04:19.340> but<00:04:19.790> I<00:04:19.850> think<00:04:20.000> it's<00:04:20.090> going

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
seen this before but I think it's going

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.130 
seen this before but I think it's going
to<00:04:20.239> come<00:04:20.390> in<00:04:20.540> handy<00:04:20.570> as<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.500> loop<00:04:21.829> on<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:23.140> than

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
to come in handy as a loop on it than

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.580 
to come in handy as a loop on it than
that<00:04:24.169> so<00:04:25.040> you<00:04:25.100> can<00:04:25.190> hang<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:26.020> so<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.050> got<00:04:27.260> five<00:04:27.560> of

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
pretending my couch was there but I

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.450
