00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
breathing with our saxophone it's really

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.470 
breathing with our saxophone it's really
important<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.700> do<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.090> right<00:00:12.420> way

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
don't really think enough about so just

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.170 
don't really think enough about so just
a<00:00:16.859> couple<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.190> quick<00:00:17.369> things<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.880> think<00:00:18.029> about

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
a couple of quick things to think about

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.660 
a couple of quick things to think about
when<00:00:18.480> you're<00:00:18.600> practicing<00:00:18.810> today<00:00:19.520> first<00:00:20.520> of

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
when you're practicing today first of

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.790 
when you're practicing today first of
all<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.960> understand<00:00:22.470> about<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.710> way

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
all you can understand about the way

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.230 
all you can understand about the way
your<00:00:22.949> lungs<00:00:23.100> work<00:00:23.400> he<00:00:23.640> probably<00:00:23.820> knows<00:00:24.000> we're

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
your lungs work he probably knows we're

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.150 
your lungs work he probably knows we're
already<00:00:24.630> right<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.560> when<00:00:25.740> we're<00:00:25.890> breathing

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
already right but when we're breathing

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.310 
already right but when we're breathing
in<00:00:26.550> pulling<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.449> air<00:00:27.570> down<00:00:27.810> into<00:00:27.840> our<00:00:28.140> lungs

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
in pulling the air down into our lungs

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
in pulling the air down into our lungs
using<00:00:28.650> our<00:00:28.769> diaphragm<00:00:29.189> muscle<00:00:29.670> across<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
using our diaphragm muscle across the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.780 
using our diaphragm muscle across the
bottom<00:00:30.179> here<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:32.040> need<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> try<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.579> think

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
bottom here so we need to try and think

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.940 
bottom here so we need to try and think
about<00:00:33.059> using<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.480> lung<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.230> way<00:00:34.440> try<00:00:34.890> and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
about using a lung in that way try and

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.130 
about using a lung in that way try and
visualize<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.730> put<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.030> your<00:00:36.149> mind<00:00:36.329> so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
visualize it in you put in your mind so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.380 
visualize it in you put in your mind so
when<00:00:37.350> your<00:00:37.469> plane<00:00:37.770> you're<00:00:38.250> breathing<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.879> but

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
when your plane you're breathing in but

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.209 
when your plane you're breathing in but
rather<00:00:39.660> than<00:00:39.780> thinking<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.170> shoulders<00:00:41.100> up

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
rather than thinking about shoulders up

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.410 
rather than thinking about shoulders up
and<00:00:41.309> down<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.820> which<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> lot

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and down like this which is what a lot

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.810 
and down like this which is what a lot
of<00:00:42.540> us<00:00:42.690> tend<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.520> want<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> think<00:00:44.760> about

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
of us tend to do I want to think about

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.639 
of us tend to do I want to think about
breathing<00:00:45.120> very<00:00:45.510> deeply<00:00:45.629> breathing<00:00:46.350> right

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
breathing very deeply breathing right

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.350 
breathing very deeply breathing right
down<00:00:46.710> into<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:47.640> should<00:00:47.910> happen<00:00:48.059> is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
down into here and what should happen is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
down into here and what should happen is
the<00:00:48.960> middle<00:00:49.379> round<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.710> middle<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.070> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the middle round your middle here that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.279 
the middle round your middle here that
should<00:00:50.489> expand<00:00:50.940> okay<00:00:51.420> we're<00:00:51.719> pulling<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.140> air

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
should expand okay we're pulling the air

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.729 
should expand okay we're pulling the air
in<00:00:53.629> right<00:00:54.629> into<00:00:54.809> our<00:00:54.930> lungs<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.260> filling<00:00:55.530> our

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
in right into our lungs are filling our

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.380 
in right into our lungs are filling our
lungs<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.160> all<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.670> way<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> bottom<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
lungs up all the way to the bottom and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.569 
lungs up all the way to the bottom and
then<00:00:58.170> when<00:00:58.320> we're<00:00:58.500> breathing<00:00:58.859> out<00:00:59.190> we're

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
then when we're breathing out we're

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.189 
then when we're breathing out we're
thinking<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.000> pushing<00:01:00.420> from<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> bottom

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
thinking about pushing from the bottom

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.290 
thinking about pushing from the bottom
all<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.620> way<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.770> okay<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.940> we're<00:01:03.059> tightening

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
all the way out okay so we're tightening

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
all the way out okay so we're tightening
up<00:01:03.660> our<00:01:03.809> muscles<00:01:04.170> around<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> middle<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
up our muscles around the middle here to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.690 
up our muscles around the middle here to
push<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.939> air<00:01:06.210> out<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.490> big

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
push that air out so when we take a big

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.370 
push that air out so when we take a big
deep<00:01:08.820> breath<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> saxophone<00:01:09.659> bother

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
deep breath on the saxophone bother

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.370 
deep breath on the saxophone bother
thinking<00:01:11.479> like<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.840> shallow<00:01:13.110> breath

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
thinking like a little shallow breath

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.320 
thinking like a little shallow breath
here<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:14.280> about<00:01:14.750> pull<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> area<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
here think about pull the area here and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.030 
here think about pull the area here and
push<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.509> out<00:01:18.630> from<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.830> you're

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
push it out from there if you're

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.670 
push it out from there if you're
constantly<00:01:20.460> pushing<00:01:21.119> from<00:01:21.509> down<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:22.229> or

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
constantly pushing from down here or

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.350 
constantly pushing from down here or
across<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.250> middle<00:01:23.520> pushing<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> air<00:01:24.330> out

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
across your middle pushing the air out

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.600 
across your middle pushing the air out
you'll<00:01:25.320> you'll<00:01:25.799> develop<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.189> lot<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.430> air

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
you'll you'll develop a lot more air

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.640 
you'll you'll develop a lot more air
pressure<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:27.509> what<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.780> call<00:01:27.810> air<00:01:28.140> support

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
pressure or what we call air support

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.620 
pressure or what we call air support
when<00:01:29.280> you're<00:01:29.430> playing<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.939> that's<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
when you're playing and that's going to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.310 
when you're playing and that's going to
give<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> sound<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.579> much<00:01:32.579> bigger<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
give you a sound of much bigger with a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.550 
give you a sound of much bigger with a
breadth<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.299> tone<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:37.140> going<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> make<00:01:37.439> it
