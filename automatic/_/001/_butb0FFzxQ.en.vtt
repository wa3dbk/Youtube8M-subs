 then once installed we open 35 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.160
 we connect the device and the 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.579
 device information 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:51.300

 down 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:05.040
 to the right in an icon 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.530
 I do not know what the 35 is and then 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.470
 let's measure it 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.410
 then when clicking 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.470

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.690
 and so you can to whom all the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.390
 applications that want music 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.890
 so 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.740
 more load quickly 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.730
 in a matter of seconds he will install 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.790
 25 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:38.340
 on the devices ready then here 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.340
 once I install pp 25 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.470
 as you see it here 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.450
 we open 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.030
 very easy it is very intuitive despite 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.420
 Being in another language is very easy to 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.759
 use 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.100
 then here the first thing that shows are 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.710
 the most relevant apply the latest 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.280
 that have been uploaded to the application as 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.070
 such for download 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.110
 so good here is divided into four 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.560
 parts is the first one that is the menu 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.140
 we go to the second the second is the 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.630
 part of search so the search part 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.000
 of the application then let's search 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.430
 do not realize that he had every phase 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.430
 eat then pass 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.320
 is so let's say it is then 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.440
 we go in there and in this part of blue of 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.150
 down we touch it and the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.459
 download from this one 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.579
 here, it is quickly downloading and 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:43.019
 of interventions your little buttons this 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.260
 here is to pause the download of the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.530
 application 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.620
 this day here is to eliminate then 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.599
 they see that this one here is for 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.299
 remove only this and this from above 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.900
 big is red is to eliminate all 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.900
 those that are there 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.590
 and we play the blue again 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.319
 and if I play this blue here again or 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.349
 the one on top the big one turns to 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.410
 resume all downloads that have 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.230
 pause in the moment ready then let's 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.900
 go with the download of this 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.180
 Once the download is complete, it tells me 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.409
 that if you would like to install there are fast 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.240
 carmen to install until then 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:30.580
 automatically leaves efe 25 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:35.050
 already install it ready 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.740
 good as you see there happened ps a mistake 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.740
 very famous 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:47.000
 It is one of the most common mistakes that 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.510
 is that the person who raised the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.960
 application 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.440
 not your side well 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.590
 your other problem another inconvenience and the 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.170
 another problem is that at the moment of 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.080
 open it she talks but asks for the air and 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.050
 the password of the person 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.530
 rolled over then are procedures that 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.069
 they were badly made then 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.480
 most applications in 25 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.060
 they work well 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.910
 but there are some that put a problem 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.110
 so 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.110
 you have to look 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:30.669
 at the time of installation 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:33.540
 well that's it was basically and ready 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.360
 here in this section of 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:40.020
 you are in this third part of the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.380
 section here is the section of 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.600
 downloads and when he is loading the one 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.200
 is finishing the download here in this 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.440
 another part already appears as the application 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.360
 such discharge then 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.940
 to install the cloud manually 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.300
 so if we do not touch this other 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.820
 site and already says install and to the caesar him 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.689
 you bring automatically and process the 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.469
 installation 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:12.069
 there we have that so if the 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:16.110
 application or if it presents problems and 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.110
 has put on basically
