actually wasn't going to get an activity
gym<00:00:23.580> just<00:00:23.850> because<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.660> would<00:00:24.779> take<00:00:24.960> up<00:00:25.109> more

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
gym just because that would take up more

space and I figured he'd grow out of it
quickly<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.970> got<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.539> Chrissie<00:00:30.779> and
