00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 yesterday friends these neo devil to the body 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.929
 she is for a new video 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.580
 on gta 5 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.990
 so today tell you about my 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.740
 new project so it's more of a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.450
 new upholstery 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.710
 so if you are a former subscriber 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.450
 really you know a lot of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.889
 7000 subscribers approximately knew more 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.849
 know the videos I made 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.369
 I did not do much 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.260
 I did it I do not know maybe three 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.460
 four videos on this series and 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
 frankly she had worked very well 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.660
 but for lack of time unfortunately 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.220
 I had to stop this series so 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.300
 yes I'm really going to repaint it here 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.130
 it's a series that was very good 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.510
 market and especially I want you had 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.320
 really bars had boosted 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.700
 really huge 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.260
 and so basically now I'm you 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.000
 explain the principle of this series 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.399
 how to participate all that I'm going 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.930
 so you all explain the challenge to the wind 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.129
 come because it's already 30 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.920
 second as I speak I have you nothing 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.629
 explained the challenge or rather the series 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.280
 so if you want you know them 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.500
 challenges that turned on youtube before 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.960
 it was fashion and challenge eating a 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.879
 tablespoon of flour eat a 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.980
 raw egg these are all challenges like that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.719
 Well this is it except that here 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.609
 it's against a subscriber it's against you 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.320
 so actually if you want you 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.090
 so go challenge to any game 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.739
 I will change all purchases of 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.390
 videos i will try to change or 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.770
 here we are going to see after the game it's not 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.110
 the most important this video is the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.400
 challenge and it's that I win because I 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.890
 take and eat some disgusting stuff 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.320
 every day so basically we'll get 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.090
 challenge on a mini game on pc on ps4 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.040
 or we will arrange 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.420
 challenge know the little game will not last 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.650
 a long time we will do kind in three 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.720
 rounds where something like that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.369
 and whoever loses between me and the good 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.060
 and so is going to have to make the challenge so to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.490
 the webcam 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.810
 so these funds are there 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.000
 can be really a very good series 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 after you tire his stories also of 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.350
 hit me bars too with you 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.810
 that's it gives a little more than two 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.250
 conditions to the series of challenges all 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.680
 just because that's if I'm doing 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.240
 challenges and I do them alone it's 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.610
 less funny than if I do them with you 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.869
 it gives more suspense to this video 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.090
 and I think it's really cool 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.399
 so here are the opinions so to participate 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.600
 it's very simple simply 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.130
 go put a little message on this 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.630
 truck like I told you 'you 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.799
 add me on my skype subscribers so 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.710
 in the description it is written 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.390
 just added it's neovia gaming 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.409
 on the other hand take the good because there 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.140
 in 2 there is a fake 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.880
 there is mine there are two 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.350
 and so mine his subscriber accounts you 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.580
 see we are on the lookout milk accounts 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.709
 subscribers so that's good 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.180
 you added me his I accept all the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.709
 world and you put a little message 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.970
 so I come for the challenge like this 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.250
 moment I know the people who 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.450
 want to do the challenge or not and after 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.130
 that's when I have a little bit of time 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.709
 what I call you on skype and there we 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.320
 will be the little challenge so after 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.600
 to participate it will be a drinking mug 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.690
 a problem since that's the goal it was 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.600
 the challenge but of good quality so having 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.459
 a good voice cam pretty visible a 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.930
 good webcam a good mic and then 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.970
 simply for the mini games are 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.190
 will arrange on the will on pc or be 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.410
 on ps4 and I can not others because 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.880
 that I do not have other consoles so 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.510
 so here are those who do not want 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.280
 participate 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.780
 I really invite you to give me 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.130
 challenges in the description like that I 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.950
 could realize it for the next 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.989
 video with subscribers so if there are any 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.269
 subscribers who come to see me before this 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.190
 evening and I propose you the beginning of 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.660
 this series tonight at otherwise bah here 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.580
 tomorrow or after tomorrow, but I 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.900
 structure this week so here I am 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.310
 really invites you to put a small lake 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.010
 for this series so really that you 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.510
 please and bam and with that you like it not 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.940
 as surely I will know your opinion 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.989
 quite simply 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.220
 so here are the friends I leave you 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.780
 on the end of this video and I'm 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.030
 leave a small excerpt from a video that 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.860
 I had already realized there is still a 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.920
 little time ago six months ago when 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.880
 even of the challenge precisely in question so 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.989
 it's to show you a little bit of 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.640
 what will it look like but well 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.989
 obviously the quality will be increased 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.090
 because in six months I have 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.530
 improved video 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.750
 so here is not very happy with the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.410
 video quality because like I say that 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.760
 will improve 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.170
 so here are the friends I tell you to the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.620
 next for another video go 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.610

 gently as it's really the 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.750
 first video we will attack the big ones 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.640

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.370
