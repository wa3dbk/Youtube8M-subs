00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.270
 we find the note is also seen 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.500
 in the spring of 2006 water sector by the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.469
 major public channels of the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.280
 olympiakos proton movers 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.840
 experts and black comics fans who 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.930
 goes out 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.640
 a simple balloon to warm up max 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.770
 it's a little balloon with a rebound 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.189
 just in front of me and my foot remains 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.349
 stuck in the ground and my leg is going 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.599
 turn but not my ankle there is a 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.010
 ligament on the side of the foot that was 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.050
 torn happily not totally 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.059
 because otherwise we should have done a 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.809
 operation there I would have been unavailable to 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.940
 about three months 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.870
 on the way I had in my misfortune 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.650
 I was lucky 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.960
 and that's why we have to 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.490
 we had to go back little by little to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.710
 remarking that we said mobilized the foot 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.680
 also a certain moment and then resumes 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.850
 to resume the race slowly and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.920
 do them exercises to not lose 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.300
 too many muscles and now here 's 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.260
 see the age for one of the trainings the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.000
 guardian it's weird because I was 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.020
 I was not hurt during almost 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.900
 four and a half years 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.510
 and then in three months I was two 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.710
 injured once so it's weird it's 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.810
 difficult as far but so 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.630
 now here I hope I see the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.840
 end of the tunnel and the end of the tunnel that 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.080
 it'll be better now for me 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.650
 youth juries ump or too much for 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.330
 mac os x trail ploteau appart a good 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.570
 job not to make glass built 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.010
 like tony audax training camp so that 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.320
 no one from China 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.360
 you have always tried to go back to his 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.890
 best level and 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.540
 you have to work twice as much as 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.760
 the others to return what is 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.110
 normal and that's what also is 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.790
 difficult since here you were a good 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.560
 level and then you say here is now 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.240
 I have to do everything to get back to 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.450
 this level and it is to exceed 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.760
 so it's often alone, too, in 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.250
 the room so it's not easy but it 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.650
 is also part of mid-career August a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.690
 less good times less good times 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.060
 you have to know how to live with that so you 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.880
 know when it's this business that have 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.590
 ideas of where do you go to see these 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:12.760
 managing times you have to know the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:15.880
 manage and all of the highlights like 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.459
 the others they ignore I was gone 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.050
 post in and physical coach it's better 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.700
 it's difficult at first you're hurt 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.680
 always do some workouts in the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.460
 room and it's not all the time fun 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.560
 but now here 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.000
 we associate that with the field and that's 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.760
 more enjoyable here we can work 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.900
 harder also has more energy 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.940
 here I think we have we are still 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.550
 well framed kun is always with me 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.310
 so go on we laugh too we laugh 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.090
 good for since that's not it not 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.300
 the end of the world 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.920
 I think of my ti maticki again 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.440
 more serious injury than mine 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.850
 so I assume that in life 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.220
 but here is always better than oneself 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.000
 but always worse so go 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.200
 do not go too far 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.270
 for things that happen 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.920
 we must try to retain the positive and 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.130
 I can not wait to find the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.500
 ground 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.230
 it's really missing I really 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.810
 hungry to start it's important too 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.310
 after an injury here to catch up 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.990
 hunger and wanting to do the right ones 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.860
 benefits 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.960
 now go to the nearby 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.310
 to start 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.440
 to play matches I think in 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.380
 a week should be ready for 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.570
 replay to replay a match the match 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.630
 against the psg will arrive too early to 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.430
 me but I hope the match against 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.630
 genk here I 'll be I 'll be able there 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.630
 at 100% to play this match there
