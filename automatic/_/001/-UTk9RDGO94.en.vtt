00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.530 
easing stuff so I really took my time I
wasn't<00:01:54.570> any<00:01:55.229> hurrying<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.610> any<00:01:56.729> reason<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.509> I

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
wasn't any hurrying for any reason so I

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.889 
wasn't any hurrying for any reason so I
just<00:01:57.780> took<00:01:57.960> my<00:01:58.200> time<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.439> about<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> year<00:01:59.899> about

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
just took my time and about a year about

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.620 
just took my time and about a year about
a<00:02:00.960> past<00:02:01.259> year<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.460> started<00:02:03.149> feeling<00:02:03.270> oh

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
a past year I think I started feeling oh

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.420 
a past year I think I started feeling oh
I<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.619> again<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.219> got

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
I think I can do this again so I got

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.359 
I think I can do this again so I got
back<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.640> guys<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:07.619> know<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:08.009> didn't

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
back on guys and you know it didn't

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.230 
back on guys and you know it didn't
affect<00:02:08.700> me<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.539> any<00:02:09.840> way

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
affect me in any way

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.020 
affect me in any way
about<00:02:10.570> my<00:02:10.810> skating<00:02:11.290> career<00:02:11.440> just<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.610> didn't

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
about my skating career just it didn't

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.600 
about my skating career just it didn't
and<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.720> think<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:14.800> because<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.280> was<00:02:15.430> always

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and I think it's because I was always

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.360 
and I think it's because I was always
positive<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.410> know<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.830> think<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.220> best

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
positive and you know I think the best

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.300 
positive and you know I think the best
part<00:02:18.640> was<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:19.030> didn't<00:02:19.390> rush<00:02:19.660> at<00:02:20.110> all<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.740> just
