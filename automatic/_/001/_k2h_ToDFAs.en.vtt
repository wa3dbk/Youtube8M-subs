00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.690
 I would like to say more children's words 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.580
 yesterday's fights between the attacker say 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.820
 genius artyukhin them Dynamo defender 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.349
 I didn't eat swaras now called dynamo 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.199
 it turns out and soiree is still in 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.320
 clinic and is currently being decided need 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.730
 you have to do an eye surgery 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.500
 or it can be avoided 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.650
 these are serious consequences 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.460
 Intsindent connected with 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.869
 The fight that started Yevgeny Artyukhin 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.170
 Now the opinion of the fans was divided 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.670
 many believe that melas lara himself 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.640
 blame for this fight as 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.160
 provoked tutelage really the very 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.570
 match start defender dynamo 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.809
 I am even ready to admit that on orders 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.239
 coaches played against artyukhin 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.059
 as tough as possible but in general itâ€™s all that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.090
 he did was within the rule or 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.210
 at least within the game what 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.210
 called playing hockey up hard yes 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.840
 somewhere on the verge of a foul somewhere offensive but not 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.750
 moreover what happened at the end 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.119
 the first period when hockey ended 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.460
 the fight began in the framework of the game is no longer 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.580
 fit let's remember that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.100
 did artyukhin after colliding with 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.049
 power with headlamp Dynamo defender 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.659
 turned his back began to move off 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.970
 from side to the middle of the site well 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.079
 intending to continue the game first 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.549
 traffic marketing knocks off his helmet 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.700
 released the sweater gate second 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.060
 harlequin movements grabs the defender for 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.939
 the gate keeping the distance and starts 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.780
 right arm to load him blows well 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.710
 Accordingly , this particular eye led 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.290
 to trauma here in my opinion what more 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.450
 total artyukhin in this situation violated and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.990
 sports before society and human 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.719
 regulations 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.369
 this is the most sudden attack from 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:05.549
 backs if he offered this fight 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.340
 face to face and la boil 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.140
 it is clear that even then financially 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.380
 defender special chance 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.260
 against huge and naturally strong 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.069
 Artyukhin would not be but then he could 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.069
 to protect 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.970
 he might like to do this often and play 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.110
 they don't want to fight 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.880
 hook on an opponent's sweater 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.090
 try to pull him over his head 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.780
 or just like that u bend over your elbows 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.230
 to fall down the enemy behind you then 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.830
 you interfered with the judge would immediately have them separated but 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.430
 was helpless here on this powerful 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.560
 the hand that held it from behind was loose 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.209
 got them kicked food sure stunned already 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.060
 from the first word 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.290
 understands what is happening at all why 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.670
 the judge did not intervene 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.670
 I immediately thought that while the players 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.110
 fighting stands skating 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.269
 nothing serious happen between them 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.730
 can not be seen from the judges already formed 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.390
 such a stereotype 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.430
 but artyukhin dissuade me in this 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.540
 situations when attacking from the back and 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.180
 when a player 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.120
 from the blow in general, even back can not 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.690
 fall because he is backwards in his arms 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.049
 forward it to fall as it may be difficult 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.720
 get seriously injured and probably for 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.180
 This is Eugene, although I'm sure that you can 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.570
 now and repent of what he did 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.450
 such consequences should get 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:40.680
 serious disqualification now by the way 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.079
 sits sdk din sent to a cafe 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.739
 a letter where it requires a few now 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:51.709
 just decides the fate of Artyukhin in this 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.709
