00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.600
 Make your toaster a little more geek, 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.240
 by toasting with the logo of your favorite superheroes or any other drawing of your choice. 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.340
 Here are the tools you will need: 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.740
 a saw 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.740
 a set of small files 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.000
 scissors 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.620
 aluminum plate as thin as possible 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.300
 the drawing you want to make 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.600
 two small pieces of cardboard 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.780
 a permanent marker 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.200
 adhesive tape 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200
 vice 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.200
 and a drill. 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.280
 Start by cutting out the drawing you want to make. 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.460
 Tape it on the aluminum plate, and draw the contours of the symbol. 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.000
 Drill the center of your drawing to remove the larger one. 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.080
 Use the two pieces of cardboard as two slices of bread and put your aluminum plate in the center. 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.240
 Tighten everything in your vise. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.720
 Then cut more closely to your drawing, to have less to file later. 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.360
 Remains more than file close to finalize the piece. 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.400
 When your piece is finished, wash it well and file the corners well. 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.720
 That's it, your room is over, just toast. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.600
 Take white bread slices, the more white they are and the better. 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.280
 Put the symbol on the bread. 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.520
 I chose Batman and Superman. 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.960
 Flip the toaster on the side, so that the drawing will stay in its place. 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.880
 Above all, clean the toaster before making the toasts. 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.240
 Take the bread and start the toaster. 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.440
 When your toasts are ready, remove them gently as the aluminum and toast should be hot. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.360
 That's the result. 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.560
 Beautiful toasts with your favorite designs. Surprise your guests with your original toasts.
