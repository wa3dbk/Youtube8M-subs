Yoshimura is taking the time to address
this<00:00:48.519> problem<00:00:48.760> right<00:00:49.690> before<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:50.469> became<00:00:50.800> huge

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
this problem right before it became huge

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.729 
this problem right before it became huge
and<00:00:51.659> I<00:00:52.659> think<00:00:52.899> it's<00:00:53.019> going<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.260> turn<00:00:53.409> out<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.559> be

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
and I think it's going to turn out to be

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.189 
and I think it's going to turn out to be
a<00:00:53.769> very<00:00:53.979> wise<00:00:54.249> decision<00:00:54.280> on<00:00:55.059> their<00:00:55.269> behalf<00:00:55.569> as

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
a very wise decision on their behalf as

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.689 
a very wise decision on their behalf as
time<00:00:56.620> wears<00:00:56.889> on<00:00:57.269> what<00:00:58.269> separates<00:00:59.069> the<00:01:00.069> EPA

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
time wears on what separates the EPA

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.660 
time wears on what separates the EPA

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.660 
on the camera but I was able to see it
it<00:02:18.630> looked<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:19.680> were<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> couple<00:02:20.280> of

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
it looked like there were a couple of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.750 
it looked like there were a couple of
tap<00:02:21.210> welds<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.870> hold<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.650> screw<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.460> place

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
tap welds that hold that screw in place

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.690 
tap welds that hold that screw in place
so<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.480> cannot<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:25.170> removed<00:02:25.790> thus<00:02:27.020> making<00:02:28.020> this

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
so it cannot be removed thus making this

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.950 
so it cannot be removed thus making this
insert<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:30.000> permanent<00:02:30.840> part<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:32.280> canister

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
insert a permanent part of the canister

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.140 
insert a permanent part of the canister
this<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.170> primarily<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.800> slip<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.400> line<00:02:35.700> with

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
this is primarily a slip on line with

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.550 
this is primarily a slip on line with
the<00:02:36.300> exception<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.810> currently<00:02:37.200> one

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
the exception of currently one

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.070 
the exception of currently one
motorcycle<00:02:38.340> which<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.360> believe<00:02:39.570> it's<00:02:39.990> a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
motorcycle which is I believe it's a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.780 
motorcycle which is I believe it's a
Honda<00:02:41.120> cbr1000rr<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:44.280> get<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.460> full

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
Honda cbr1000rr that you get a full

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.750 
Honda cbr1000rr that you get a full
system<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.990> has<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> catalyst<00:02:46.980> built<00:02:47.250> into<00:02:47.610> it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
system that has a catalyst built into it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.990 
system that has a catalyst built into it
as<00:02:48.120> well<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.660> having<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.709> low<00:02:50.040> volume<00:02:50.610> insert

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
as well as having that low volume insert

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.320 
as well as having that low volume insert
in<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.750> canister<00:02:52.140> right<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.670> rest<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.180> is

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
in the canister right the rest of it is

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.150 
in the canister right the rest of it is
a<00:02:54.360> slip-on<00:02:54.840> system<00:02:55.290> because<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.620> order<00:02:55.830> for<00:02:56.100> it

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
a slip-on system because in order for it

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.460 
a slip-on system because in order for it

to be compliant the catalyst has to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.340 
to be compliant the catalyst has to
remain<00:02:58.740> in<00:02:58.950> place<00:02:59.250> as<00:02:59.910> well<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.690> catalyst<00:03:01.170> has

point<00:03:11.910> mincer<00:03:12.330> you'll<00:03:12.990> typically<00:03:13.410> lose<00:03:14.070> a

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
point mincer you'll typically lose a

point mincer you'll typically lose a
little<00:03:14.459> weight<00:03:14.660> gain<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.690> little<00:03:15.840> performance

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
little weight gain a little performance

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.949 
little weight gain a little performance
and<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.370> certainly<00:03:17.730> looks<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.209> whole<00:03:18.540> heck<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.780> a

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
and it certainly looks a whole heck of a

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.660 
and it certainly looks a whole heck of a
lot<00:03:19.080> cooler<00:03:19.350> all<00:03:19.950> right<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.130> might<00:03:20.280> not<00:03:20.519> get

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
lot cooler all right you might not get

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.880 
lot cooler all right you might not get
all<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.030> same<00:03:21.269> performance<00:03:22.050> benefits<00:03:22.769> that

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
all the same performance benefits that

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.910 
all the same performance benefits that
you<00:03:23.010> would<00:03:23.220> with<00:03:23.400> an<00:03:23.550> open<00:03:24.090> exhaust<00:03:24.870> which<00:03:25.739> I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
you would with an open exhaust which I

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.490 
you would with an open exhaust which I
suppose<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.340> pretty<00:03:27.120> reasonable<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:28.380> be

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
suppose is pretty reasonable and to be

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.440 
suppose is pretty reasonable and to be
expected<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.220> good<00:03:29.400> news<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.790> these<00:03:30.060> modern

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
expected the good news is these modern

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.110 
expected the good news is these modern
bikes<00:03:30.690> are<00:03:31.320> also<00:03:31.769> done<00:03:31.950> fast<00:03:32.280> right<00:03:32.640> from<00:03:32.850> Jump

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
bikes are also done fast right from Jump

Street<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.950> think<00:03:34.950> you'll<00:03:35.070> still<00:03:35.280> be<00:03:35.400> okay

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
