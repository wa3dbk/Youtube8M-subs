00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.009

 i play the whole pieces off and then number of pc is different can make that 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.220
 is what I am going to see today in this we start today with how that and this is 

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:29.989
 there pay 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.339
 we go first 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.590
 in the supercup on it is making sure fun that standard is forthcoming 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.940
 we effectively make this first pulse weekly, they become critical agency 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.830
 we now have standard childhood years, you can see it on the completely anp it 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.340
 the center of the country must switch off and then switch off 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.810
 they start years now with saving this position have done that have yes 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.620
 done so mississipi desk 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.440
 what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to start a festival 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.650
 because we still have to do some comments in the game 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.050
 we just did it is sad enough so we can head in 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.210
 principle also turn it on again that usually takes time therefore know 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.380
 that has at the same time 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.310
 so you see quite fast meat that in defense and normal but and now 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 It went fairly quickly and it now they were explained 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.090
 117 is starting up 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.610
 i say i have a contract zeeuwse village now it brings 8 that all comes 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.690
 shortly 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.490
 that's where it finally works and we go there it turned out to be a Sterren.nl or 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.980
 you can the child total point nl 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.900
 what I have now is so patient 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.710
 so of course I go through portal 2 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.920
 huppakee 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.240
 and now we are in c 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.610
 and what still needs to happen the fight had to first put the rigby over the whole 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.880
 turn off pieces and what we do through slash 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.440
 kgm 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.300
 3 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.850
 jdh vereeck 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.680
 maaseik lowest 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.200
 tuber ball 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.319
 thanks to the lowest week and now I anticipate 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.459
 whatever your turning point about the global world is your activity 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.469
 so now no one can plysje ticks anyway however property state it 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:18.489
 delta 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.939
 and what I can do now they can do the summer schedule 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.269
 say it above this one 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.709
 many of these measures are in place so I will now show that 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:35.749
 here we have, for example, your smelling example and which is special through an api 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:36.489
 made 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.579
 in addition to spam 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.239
 and here you can not fight at this moment, here is also never fought 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.550
 that is going to change tonight, of course, we are going to change now, look like you 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.000
 choose tip about mid-afternoon so don't follow outside the walls too 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.069
 can become 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.899
 and on the other hand, it is also moving up 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.389
 consider the mosquito or I here 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:05.399
 what i am going to do now she tous les lecce playing toddlers i have her one 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:09.070
 vertical eventually made both underground 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.690
 assessed as the editors 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.380
 I can now also be fought that is a disadvantage but that does take care of it 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.489
 that it all 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.669
 completely arranged 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:23.150
 and then we are the selection but now very small you know and we have to 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:26.149
 just do that we do the afternoon answers rkc 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.689
 reading is what you know 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.889
 experience only after market value of 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.199
 the abbreviation that can also use this and what we have to do 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:42.809
 shamfoeter ensure that we do this one that is allowed, we do that through 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:48.809
 through slash click here to process arena that afterwards 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:55.930
 if i'm a boyfriend your doorstep then you see they are the brentjens audience 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.069
 have a global arena we have the spam 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.039
 but I always hope that is a very general and 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:06.769
 a little bit is actually on top of everything 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.319
 They have to make sure that almost around for Feyenoord play one 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.339
 the priority is that it still has considerable hordes of lean 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:19.620
 and yet doing it at noon was only short fuse 6 for arjen robben 2 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.259
 the agenda what matters 10 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.590
 and the first quarter of media set 10 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.559
 so all participants follow this 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:34.370
 they go for it but given that global is global and not children 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.639
 has martin damen 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.490
 didn't make much difference for now 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.309
 so now have taken care of it 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:46.909
 that we in this mobile in this agenda can put those muscles and then also one 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.209
 role want to know how this works then you can of course there tonight 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:52.270
 tonight enough people will piss 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.330
 animals the area that him 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.940
 she understands fun and it's room for it 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.110
 and so my body was viewing days 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.569
 I will worry that it will be released later 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.339
 and then you can join 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:08.759
 what I want to show now so obagi there can be someone have a shirt 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.669
 being able to live shows that it actually works 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.990
 because your lyrics and the sutter come so I can not neatly 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.039
 the last one was founded by sppo dirk 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.039
 7 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.109
 street standing at home so do not expect to load a spider moosdijk 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:32.539
 salary no i am not saying 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.539
 solaris after a series 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.029
 keisuke i have before 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.439

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:44.240
 well that is what happened the team has stepped also he says smaers 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.310
 it did it now i'm going to the population and that's 7 we 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.289

 I'm 47 8 coming soon 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.050
 In addition, we are a lot of car portals so we are curious if there are people 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.150
 are those who can make plug-ins what he likes about less and style and 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.350
 we can exploit they would like an exchange server that can all be done later 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:19.729
 of course in the reactions afterwards place the cocaine back right like you 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:20.969
 things from afab 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.579
 we give reactions from other people if you are you like me then I can 

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:28.270
 namely see Father 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.330
 I will do this for you during a short revival and I hope you will soon 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.500

 6 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:58.529
 so
