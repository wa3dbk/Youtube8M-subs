00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
took a grinder to the housing in the met

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:11.020 
took a grinder to the housing in the met
there's<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.410> magnet<00:01:03.830> right<00:01:03.980> there<00:01:08.530> okay<00:01:10.030> as

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
there's the magnet right there okay as

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.780 
there's the magnet right there okay as
you<00:01:11.270> can<00:01:11.420> see<00:01:14.290> that<00:01:15.290> center<00:01:15.710> part<00:01:15.950> has<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.640> be

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
you can see that center part has to be

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.100 
you can see that center part has to be
just<00:01:17.510> a<00:01:17.630> little<00:01:17.900> bit<00:01:18.050> higher<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.520> this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
just a little bit higher so that this

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.110 
just a little bit higher so that this
still<00:01:21.110> rotates<00:01:21.890> back<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.490> forth<00:01:22.729> with<00:01:23.030> the

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
still rotates back and forth with the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.840 
still rotates back and forth with the
advanced<00:01:23.420> mechanism<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.770> those<00:01:25.160> notches<00:01:25.430> are

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
advanced mechanism and those notches are

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.719 
advanced mechanism and those notches are
gonna<00:01:26.000> I'm<00:01:26.450> gonna<00:01:26.600> have<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.870> notch<00:01:27.050> it's<00:01:27.350> not

center before we pull the other points
off<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:12.150> ignition<00:02:12.540> module<00:02:13.200> over<00:02:13.440> here

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
off and this ignition module over here

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.970 
off and this ignition module over here
is<00:02:13.950> four<00:02:14.190> cylinders<00:02:14.640> one<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.060> two<00:02:15.770> which<00:02:16.770> will

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
is four cylinders one and two which will

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.370 
is four cylinders one and two which will
be<00:02:17.100> for<00:02:17.430> ours<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.090> we'll<00:02:18.240> pull<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.630> emitted

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
be for ours and we'll pull this emitted

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.040 
be for ours and we'll pull this emitted
ignition<00:02:19.980> module<00:02:20.400> off<00:02:20.610> save<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.720> for<00:02:21.900> later

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
ignition module off save it for later

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.690 
ignition module off save it for later
this<00:02:22.710> one<00:02:22.950> right<00:02:23.130> here<00:02:23.610> has<00:02:23.910> plus<00:02:24.810> or<00:02:25.430> minus<00:02:26.430> I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
this one right here has plus or minus I

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.080 
this one right here has plus or minus I
think<00:02:27.060> five<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.420> ten<00:02:27.660> degrees<00:02:27.950> adjustable<00:02:29.090> for

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
think five to ten degrees adjustable for

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.660 
think five to ten degrees adjustable for
timing<00:02:30.600> with<00:02:31.170> those<00:02:31.350> two<00:02:31.680> screws<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:34.670> but

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
timing with those two screws and but

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.949 
timing with those two screws and but
we're<00:02:35.820> going<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.000> lock<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.330> down<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.870> then

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
we're going to lock it down and then

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.190 
we're going to lock it down and then
plug<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.410> up<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.770> see<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:38.160> happens
