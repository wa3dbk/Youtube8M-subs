ok<00:00:10.720> here's<00:00:11.110> another<00:00:11.200> drill<00:00:11.740> more<00:00:12.160> of<00:00:12.280> a<00:00:12.370> new

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
ok here's another drill more of a new

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.070 
ok here's another drill more of a new
school<00:00:12.880> drill<00:00:13.150> because<00:00:13.330> we're<00:00:13.600> going<00:00:13.720> to<00:00:13.780> link

school drill because we're going to link
the<00:00:14.920> the<00:00:15.790> new<00:00:15.970> school<00:00:16.299> positions<00:00:16.810> once<00:00:17.470> again

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
the the new school positions once again

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.989 
the the new school positions once again
the<00:00:17.949> purpose<00:00:18.160> of<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.520> drills<00:00:18.850> are

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:18.999 
the purpose of the drills are

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.480 
the purpose of the drills are
multifaceted<00:00:19.869> has<00:00:20.320> lost<00:00:20.560> lots<00:00:21.009> of<00:00:21.130> drills<00:00:21.400> you

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
multifaceted has lost lots of drills you

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.429 
multifaceted has lost lots of drills you
can<00:00:21.580> do<00:00:21.820> but<00:00:22.359> the<00:00:22.480> most<00:00:22.599> important<00:00:23.169> thing<00:00:23.199> that

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
can do but the most important thing that

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.499 
can do but the most important thing that
you're<00:00:23.560> learning<00:00:23.679> is<00:00:24.039> the<00:00:24.460> balance<00:00:24.939> and<00:00:25.119> then

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
you're learning is the balance and then

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.779 
you're learning is the balance and then
the<00:00:25.689> control<00:00:26.019> but<00:00:26.679> for<00:00:26.829> our<00:00:26.859> purposes<00:00:27.609> for

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
the control but for our purposes for

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.909 
the control but for our purposes for
self-defense<00:00:28.359> purposes<00:00:28.570> not<00:00:29.499> only<00:00:29.739> do<00:00:29.859> you

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
self-defense purposes not only do you

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.380 
self-defense purposes not only do you
want<00:00:30.099> to<00:00:30.159> develop<00:00:30.249> those<00:00:30.579> attributes<00:00:31.239> the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
want to develop those attributes the

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.180 
want to develop those attributes the
same<00:00:31.599> as<00:00:31.749> you<00:00:31.869> were<00:00:31.989> doing<00:00:32.230> it<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:32.470> then<00:00:33.070> they

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
same as you were doing it and then they

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.740 
same as you were doing it and then they
match<00:00:33.370> our<00:00:33.640> sport<00:00:33.880> mesh<00:00:34.030> but<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.329> also<00:00:34.540> want

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
match our sport mesh but you also want

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.900 
match our sport mesh but you also want
to<00:00:34.989> start<00:00:35.199> thinking<00:00:35.590> for<00:00:35.800> lack<00:00:36.670> of<00:00:36.699> a<00:00:36.879> better

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
to start thinking for lack of a better

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.029 
to start thinking for lack of a better
term<00:00:37.149> three<00:00:37.660> dimensionally<00:00:38.379> okay<00:00:38.770> in

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
term three dimensionally okay in

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.920 
term three dimensionally okay in
jiu-jitsu<00:00:39.670> especially<00:00:40.239> tournaments<00:00:40.660> we<00:00:40.750> kind

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
jiu-jitsu especially tournaments we kind

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.119 
jiu-jitsu especially tournaments we kind
of<00:00:40.960> think<00:00:41.140> one-dimensional<00:00:41.890> where<00:00:41.980> we're

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
of think one-dimensional where we're

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.189 
of think one-dimensional where we're
constantly<00:00:42.280> imploding<00:00:43.239> you<00:00:43.930> know<00:00:44.050> we're

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
constantly imploding you know we're

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.259 
constantly imploding you know we're
getting<00:00:44.309> tighter<00:00:45.309> and<00:00:45.399> tighter<00:00:45.550> into<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.120> guy

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
getting tighter and tighter into the guy

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:47.700 
getting tighter and tighter into the guy
because<00:00:46.809> those<00:00:46.960> are<00:00:47.079> the<00:00:47.109> points<00:00:47.469> are<00:00:47.620> and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
because those are the points are and

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.410 
because those are the points are and
stuff<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.039> self-defense<00:00:48.699> sometimes<00:00:49.300> the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
stuff and self-defense sometimes the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.819 
stuff and self-defense sometimes the
techniques<00:00:49.809> are<00:00:49.960> identical<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:50.649> way<00:00:50.769> you

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
techniques are identical to the way you

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.160 
techniques are identical to the way you
train<00:00:51.129> them<00:00:51.309> makes<00:00:51.519> up<00:00:51.670> our<00:00:52.059> service<00:00:52.510> but<00:00:53.050> you

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
train them makes up our service but you

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.240 
train them makes up our service but you
want<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.440> start<00:00:53.590> thinking<00:00:53.829> three

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
want to start thinking three

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.369 
want to start thinking three
dimensionally<00:00:54.789> more<00:00:55.420> like<00:00:55.539> an<00:00:55.660> MMA<00:00:55.989> match<00:00:56.199> in

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
dimensionally more like an MMA match in

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.720 
dimensionally more like an MMA match in
that<00:00:56.500> sense<00:00:56.739> except<00:00:57.010> you're<00:00:57.129> not<00:00:57.190> waiting<00:00:57.460> for

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
that sense except you're not waiting for

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.790 
that sense except you're not waiting for
the<00:00:57.789> referee<00:00:58.120> to<00:00:58.149> do<00:00:58.359> it<00:00:58.510> at<00:00:58.660> one<00:00:59.260> you<00:00:59.649> know<00:00:59.739> you

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
the referee to do it at one you know you

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.259 
the referee to do it at one you know you
made<00:01:00.039> you<00:01:00.160> think<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:00.399> yani<00:01:00.640> may<00:01:00.820> control<00:01:01.120> them

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
made you think I yani may control them

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.549 
made you think I yani may control them
that<00:01:01.359> you<00:01:01.420> may<00:01:01.539> make<00:01:01.719> space<00:01:01.929> and<00:01:02.140> get<00:01:02.230> up<00:01:02.350> again

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
that you may make space and get up again

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.290 
that you may make space and get up again
so<00:01:02.980> this<00:01:03.160> drill<00:01:03.429> is<00:01:03.640> good<00:01:04.030> for<00:01:04.210> those

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
so this drill is good for those

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.880 
so this drill is good for those
situations<00:01:04.900> just<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.230> see<00:01:05.410> how<00:01:05.560> we<00:01:05.620> keep

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
situations just to see how we keep

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.700 
situations just to see how we keep
transitioning<00:01:06.610> from<00:01:06.820> farther<00:01:07.630> away<00:01:07.750> closer

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
transitioning from farther away closer

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.039 
transitioning from farther away closer
closer<00:01:09.189> than<00:01:09.729> reverse<00:01:10.420> it<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.659> go<00:01:10.780> farther

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
closer than reverse it and go farther

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.200 
closer than reverse it and go farther
for<00:01:11.380> other<00:01:11.530> way<00:01:11.650> real<00:01:12.040> simple<00:01:12.250> so<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:12.909> start

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
for other way real simple so I start

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.270 
for other way real simple so I start
from<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.420> near<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:13.750> for<00:01:13.960> example<00:01:14.049> we<00:01:14.860> already

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
from the near I for example we already

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.730 
from the near I for example we already
looked<00:01:15.549> at<00:01:15.850> how<00:01:16.119> we<00:01:16.180> made<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.450> transition<00:01:17.049> to

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
looked at how we made a transition to

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.100 
looked at how we made a transition to
the<00:01:17.890> mild<00:01:18.159> here<00:01:18.579> and<00:01:18.820> then<00:01:19.540> we<00:01:19.780> can<00:01:19.810> make<00:01:20.079> a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
the mild here and then we can make a

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.340 
the mild here and then we can make a
transition<00:01:20.680> into<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.750> know<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.869> rush<00:01:23.170> around

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
transition into you know a rush around

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.920 
transition into you know a rush around
here<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.189> then<00:01:24.340> we<00:01:24.460> made<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.640> transition<00:01:25.180> into

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
here and then we made a transition into

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.740 
here and then we made a transition into
the<00:01:26.259> Mongolian<00:01:27.009> mound<00:01:27.220> out<00:01:27.430> here<00:01:27.600> we're<00:01:28.600> going

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
the Mongolian mound out here we're going

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.480 
the Mongolian mound out here we're going
to<00:01:28.840> make<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:28.990> transition<00:01:29.409> off<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.950> one<00:01:30.159> side<00:01:30.189> of

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
to make a transition off to one side of

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.850 
to make a transition off to one side of
the<00:01:30.790> other<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.420> there's<00:01:31.869> different<00:01:32.200> attacks

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
the other and there's different attacks

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.889 
the other and there's different attacks
that<00:01:33.070> make<00:01:33.250> septus<00:01:33.700> but<00:01:34.329> the<00:01:34.450> thing<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.689> want

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
that make septus but the thing I want

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.700 
that make septus but the thing I want
you<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.049> think<00:01:35.140> what<00:01:35.350> is<00:01:35.619> simply<00:01:36.100> kicking<00:01:37.000> off

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you to think what is simply kicking off

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.200 
you to think what is simply kicking off
getting<00:01:38.710> back<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.189> side<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:39.790> then<00:01:40.090> you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
getting back to the side and then you

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.959 
getting back to the side and then you
can<00:01:40.299> go<00:01:40.329> back<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.710> ride<00:01:42.189> on<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.700> other

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
can go back to you ride on the other

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.539 
can go back to you ride on the other
side<00:01:43.420> ok<00:01:44.409> so<00:01:44.469> I'm<00:01:44.649> going<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.860> ride<00:01:45.040> on<00:01:45.070> his<00:01:45.310> head

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549
