00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.099
 holding together we have here today 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.200
 you little things only for hands-on 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.839
 namely the lenovo thinkpad usb 3.0 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.750
 docking station so speak one 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:19.510
 docking station for rural relevantes 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.590
 the just usb 3.0 have connection before 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.110
 we start with it 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.000
 in short something on our own behalf because of us 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.980
 test camera of course straight 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.020
 like to know about you after the video 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.780
 have seen how it is the picture quality 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.960
 The sound quality is just natural here 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.879
 as a spectator through as well as in the set 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.929
 should decide with and can if the 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.149
 camera that really what my 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:43.600
 we do not betray only once because from 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.329
 in 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.260
 but as I said then I was 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.989
 just your opinion in the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.010
 comments to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.589
 we come to the docking station 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.569
 We are here directly with us 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.710
 a little installation poster so 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:02.289
 speak who briefly described what everything 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.180
 Of course, it's like that as well 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.619
 you infect what the connections are 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.899
 but watch rest but a driver cd 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.180
 with it also a handbook with 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.189
 have on it 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.270
 usb 3.0 cable of course this 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:22.439
 suitable for that here is mostly 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.439
 yes, too short 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.770
 So should reach our desk 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.290
 just to be tilted 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.700
 could almost have to deal with one 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.700
 cable can be bought 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.330
 that is really very small here now 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.400
 and cute 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:00.770
 In the end we only have here 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:03.899
 that's about 40 watts of course that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.180
 power cable to that but also 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.950
 neighbors to infect is also possible 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.250
 that instead of cable from lena fits too 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.250
 each other 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.770
 then we have a small adapter 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.330
 from dvi to vga connection belly to 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.350
 example with the x6 cover and we have 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.790
 no connection 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.470
 next to it also needs this adapter 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.459
 in addition to docking station then 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.459
 Of course, once that lures itself 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.070
 piano front with it all 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.690
 looks a bit pretty 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.959
 we we have in front of course it 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.340
 once call headset connection 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.130
 we have twice usb 3 0 front 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.450
 otherwise above once off off switch 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.880
 and on the back has a lot 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.549
 connections for a network connection 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.900
 because as I said the x1 for example 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.790
 does not have its own network connection 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.810
 can then just synonymous via usb 3.0 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.000
 be infected 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.340
 we have again three usb 3.0 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.270
 connections but every amount of usb is so 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.880
 there is no problem there 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.840
 Input from the notebook from where you can 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.280
 A strictly power supply connection to 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.050
 good last twice dvi 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.480
 Here you can see quite well 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.600
 we once dvi in dvi discusses 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.860
 has been integrated v digital and analog 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.360
 get supported 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.790
 then you should go to the extra 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.610
 pins i tell and we have one 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.180
 or a DVI-D terminal of the in Heine 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.900
 digital signal delivers so much to the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.620
 connect and doping in itself if that 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.320
 Of course a little bit, too 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.190
 to test more closely 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.390
 We have of course an even 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.510
 So lock kensington lock tightly 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.070
 Of course, this is also possible, of course 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.900
 try how it really works 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.540
 a hd monitor might be contagious 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.400
 still a usb 3.0 drive usb 3.0 makes 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.860
 because it could be a little bit 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.350
 scarce are a usb-3 0-port her the 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.650
 to serve entire connections 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:11.600
 that's quite a lot or religious 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.600
 task of school
