00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
September 2014 that's kind of what my

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.500 
September 2014 that's kind of what my
ideal<00:01:52.740> thought<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.460> they're<00:01:53.970> doing<00:01:54.180> this

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
ideal thought is that they're doing this

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.960 
ideal thought is that they're doing this
scavenger<00:01:55.200> hunt<00:01:55.710> again<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.369> I'm<00:01:56.729> assuming

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
scavenger hunt again and I'm assuming

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.969 
scavenger hunt again and I'm assuming
the<00:01:57.240> person<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> finds<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.260> of<00:01:58.409> them<00:01:58.560> first

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the person that finds all of them first

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
the person that finds all of them first
we'll<00:01:59.640> probably<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.270> awarded<00:02:00.840> some<00:02:01.170> type<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
we'll probably be awarded some type of

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.060
