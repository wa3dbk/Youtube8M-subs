this vehicle you'll definitely notice
that<00:00:37.739> there's<00:00:38.010> definitely<00:00:38.520> some<00:00:38.820> bias

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
that there's definitely some bias

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.959

network<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:17.459> but<00:04:18.359> all<00:04:18.659> in<00:04:18.959> all<00:04:19.049> pretty<00:04:19.109> good

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
network so but all in all pretty good

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.379 
network so but all in all pretty good
build<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:19.949> far<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.489> know<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.669> have<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> plastic

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
build so far you know you have a plastic

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.560 
build so far you know you have a plastic
chassis<00:04:21.840> kind<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.650> tub<00:04:22.889> chassis<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:24.270> top

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
chassis kind of a tub chassis this top

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.540 
chassis kind of a tub chassis this top
brace<00:04:24.810> here<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.139> actually<00:04:25.680> some<00:04:26.460> sort<00:04:26.849> of

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
brace here is actually some sort of

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.499 
brace here is actually some sort of
reinforced<00:04:28.740> carbon<00:04:30.030> without<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.150> carbon

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
reinforced carbon without the carbon

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.320 
reinforced carbon without the carbon
look<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.409> does<00:04:32.590> have<00:04:32.770> layers<00:04:33.099> and<00:04:33.490> it's

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
look so it does have layers and it's

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.360 
look so it does have layers and it's
definitely<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.810> different<00:04:35.169> feel<00:04:35.470> from<00:04:36.220> the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
definitely a different feel from the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.820 
definitely a different feel from the
plastic<00:04:36.849> so<00:04:37.060> nice<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:38.050> see<00:04:38.199> that<00:04:38.379> slight

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
plastic so nice to see that slight

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.029 
plastic so nice to see that slight
upgrade<00:04:39.310> all<00:04:40.300> of<00:04:40.389> the<00:04:40.659> metal<00:04:40.900> parts<00:04:41.050> great<00:04:41.500> you

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
upgrade all of the metal parts great you

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.450 
upgrade all of the metal parts great you
have<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.550> repositioning<00:04:43.389> of<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:44.770> front<00:04:45.280> and

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
have the repositioning of the front and

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.800 
have the repositioning of the front and
rear<00:04:45.580> diff<00:04:45.849> right<00:04:46.060> there<00:04:46.300> with<00:04:46.539> many

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
rear diff right there with many

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.899 
rear diff right there with many
different<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:49.090> know<00:04:49.210> positions<00:04:50.220> as<00:04:51.220> far<00:04:51.400> as

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
different you know positions as far as

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.550 
different you know positions as far as
the<00:04:52.240> counter-steer<00:04:53.050> now<00:04:53.259> you're<00:04:53.440> gonna

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
the counter-steer now you're gonna

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.219 
the counter-steer now you're gonna
notice<00:04:53.830> a<00:04:54.190> very<00:04:54.729> small<00:04:55.210> gear<00:04:55.479> in<00:04:55.599> the<00:04:55.690> rear<00:04:55.900> and

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
notice a very small gear in the rear and

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.010 
notice a very small gear in the rear and
then<00:04:57.009> when<00:04:57.099> we<00:04:57.220> go<00:04:57.340> up<00:04:57.370> front<00:04:57.759> here<00:04:58.120> you'll<00:04:58.840> see

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
then when we go up front here you'll see

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.689 
then when we go up front here you'll see
a<00:04:59.050> very<00:04:59.289> large<00:04:59.590> gear<00:05:00.009> on<00:05:00.099> that<00:05:00.159> front<00:05:00.550> there

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
a very large gear on that front there

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.820 
a very large gear on that front there
and<00:05:00.849> kind<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.090> have<00:05:01.180> my<00:05:01.360> belt<00:05:02.110> blocking<00:05:02.710> that

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
and kind of have my belt blocking that

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.700 
and kind of have my belt blocking that
right<00:05:03.069> now<00:05:03.250> but<00:05:03.550> you'll<00:05:03.729> see<00:05:04.000> that<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:04.710> you'll

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
right now but you'll see that so you'll

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.559 
right now but you'll see that so you'll
see<00:05:05.919> as<00:05:06.159> we<00:05:06.370> start<00:05:06.699> getting<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.330> same

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
see as we start getting the same

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.140 
see as we start getting the same
together<00:05:07.930> you'll<00:05:08.139> see<00:05:08.319> definitely<00:05:09.150> different

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
together you'll see definitely different

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.480 
together you'll see definitely different
gearing<00:05:10.690> especially<00:05:11.680> if<00:05:11.740> you've<00:05:11.919> owned<00:05:12.190> a

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
gearing especially if you've owned a

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.809 
gearing especially if you've owned a
sprint<00:05:12.969> to<00:05:13.030> in<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.389> past<00:05:14.039> sprint<00:05:15.039> to<00:05:15.190> uses<00:05:15.639> the

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
sprint to in the past sprint to uses the

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.510 
sprint to in the past sprint to uses the
same<00:05:16.090> size<00:05:16.479> front<00:05:17.050> and<00:05:17.229> rear<00:05:17.469> diff<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:18.009> then

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
same size front and rear diff and then

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.869 
same size front and rear diff and then
also<00:05:18.699> the<00:05:19.030> same<00:05:19.270> size<00:05:19.599> for<00:05:20.050> these<00:05:20.259> Center

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
also the same size for these Center

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:24.300 
also the same size for these Center
front<00:05:21.879> and<00:05:22.060> rear<00:05:22.300> pulleys<00:05:22.750> so<00:05:23.039> with<00:05:24.039> this

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
front and rear pulleys so with this

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.520 
front and rear pulleys so with this
secured<00:05:25.300> you're<00:05:25.599> gonna<00:05:25.719> actually<00:05:25.900> use<00:05:26.229> all

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
secured you're gonna actually use all

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.029 
secured you're gonna actually use all
different<00:05:27.039> sorts<00:05:27.669> of<00:05:28.259> pulleys<00:05:29.259> to<00:05:29.289> obtain

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
different sorts of pulleys to obtain

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.339 
different sorts of pulleys to obtain
that<00:05:30.069> countersteer<00:05:30.940> so<00:05:31.240> well<00:05:31.960> that's<00:05:32.139> it

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
that countersteer so well that's it
