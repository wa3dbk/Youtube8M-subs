00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 a tutorial this time is the extreme 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.270
 place where the functions are as usual 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.010
 again at the end of the video now 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.110
 I first show how to install 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.269
 Here are all the things again 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.009
 the ex baywatch but that can also shows 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.570
 right then if you can just open 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.590
 Check the link again 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.350
 I will of course in the description 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.539
 so here is the download left 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.420
 could him for ra so for winrar and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.609
 zip archive or here of course the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.890
 old version 1.2 if you are now 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.980
 Watch the video where it already is 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.510
 a newer minecraft that a point 4.2 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.180
 it should probably be here 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.379
 be here diamond download x-ray mod 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.690
 go to download if you have winrar 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.760
 or zip that you know i would like me 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.649
 even then get here advertising 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.149
 skip and then download you guys 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.789
 but I have that already 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.719
 namely downloaded here 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:57.180
 Of course , then he is also percent off 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.309
 about ten percent so he gives the 1 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.949
 then you go in the points meet 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.710
 folder of course here since your roaming 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.380
 put it in the puck minecraft folder in 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.979
 thief inside the minecraft opens 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.630
 you of course with winrar archive 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.520
 and cleared meters forward that's it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.430
 most important and if the tenant in folder 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.049
 still in there is then even possible 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.180
 no mods you are so removed now 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.240
 is the way then you go down to the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.049
 All the glass files open this extremely 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.400
 Watts makes power with control or power 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.409
 the whole manual I do with 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.829
 Control and moves with Baumann 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.670
 I hate that and pull the whole 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.159
 files okay and then you can 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.600
 close all here so then you open 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.220
 execute minecraft 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.470
 I will not do that again now 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.689
 I think that's just better that way 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.950
 log in if you are premium 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.340
 minecraft has it's also, of course, 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.420
 without premium minecraft so she was always 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.820
 a good thing 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.380
 then you just go to your world like that 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.509
 and now I will show you what the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.300
 mod so it may be short at the beginning 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.550
 So I want to lay something first 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.330
 show that you can go up to c here 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.099
 you can see the data here xyz that's it 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.110
 whole simplified and would have the whole thing 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.120
 not always like that but you can 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.819
 you can do it all with c 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.700
 do so then there's even older that was 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.319
 very quickly that was my fixation 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.810
 We can all doctors under the earth 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.450
 see here coal we find currently 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.760
 quite easily here for example behind 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.459
 Coal diamonds are there for sure 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.410
 somewhere clearly they have since 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.319
 downstairs if the whole thing matters 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.140
 of course that looks like that again 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.330
 there is still he there I have no idea 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.920
 what brings apparently one sees it 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.440
 allegedly you see that 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.250
 redstone but I am very much 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.720
 I see all the zombies and the ones here 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.610
 lava yes you have to do that yourself 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.379
 if you want to know now but it is 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.500
 is this good or if you know 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:17.129
 this is where zombies is bombing 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.810
 also good so then there is still waiting 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:27.450
 that does not have to matter now 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:28.920
 then there was exactly that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.260
 Everything is here actually 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.110
 dark but on l you can do everything 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.970
 make the hotel stand for light 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.159
 but the zombies will be anyway 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.170
 even if it is bright here now 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.090
 under the earth is now I have 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.599
 somehow such a small bug is also 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.069
 no matter 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.629
 In any case, you can here with the 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.569
 turn on and turn off that too 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.580
 judge relatively cool with f you can 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.830
 Doing fly when your mucous membrane 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.090
 had somehow in it 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.610
 yes , I do not really know what 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.290
 that means with f with fly that knows 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.349
 I really do not have you there yourself 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.330
 let's see and yes I would but this 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.189
 Do not use extreme place on servers 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.760
 because you will be banned anyway 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.890
 because 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.430
 you should that then the fun of course 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.439
 everything would be banned if we the way 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.870
 export and the admins resp 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.549
 without that out from there is the 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.900
 not smart if you if you anyway 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.609
 do not bother on server then you can 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.740
 also in the singleplayer play and you there 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.360
 These things decided and in the year I 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.860
 personally, this murder does not like it that way 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.410
 I like to play minecraft as well 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.820
 you should play time as it is there and 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.539
 Well, everyone has to do that for themselves 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.949
 knowledge 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.780
 that's easy to do anyway 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.289
 install and also easy to handle 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.090
 to have 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.380
 and yes I hope I had again 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.639
 liked this video 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.430
 yes, that was it already 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.120
 and then I say goodbye and see you 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.120
 next time
