 lock screen togo so by default it's 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.490
 like that finally we 'll go see this 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.560
 that it defaults to the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.420
 lockscreen of his device then the order 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.700

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.670
 the flash lite back we see it very 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.990
 well then to change its modes 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.240
 activation there you just have to 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.650
 go down like these watts and you 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.870
 can decide which ones you want 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.880
 now you want to put blue everything 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.220
 a little bit higher and where is it rendered 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.920
 blow them before the mode 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.870

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.350
 this then if you who decide the 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.010
 position as soon as she wanted to priority 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.560
 unfortunately we can not go anymore 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.479
 far it's really just the 5 and we 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.549
 prefers the most now we'll see him 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.860
 in the settings here if we turn off the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.479
 scr togo then help to togo 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.279
 that's what allowed us to think 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.060
 from left to right we can not go anymore 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:15.190
 from left to right is mesnac 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.230
 this you go down like this and you 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.970
 have this little menu there that gives you the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.110
 same options 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.030
 then we want to reactivate I like 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.709
 better have kids scripters in the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.180
 job done to go it's up to you 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.530
 option that wanted to put me I 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.200
 advise to leave default and 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.849
 works this basket youth maicon you 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.450
 can see here that it's 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.310
 small icons 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.980
 so if you want big ones if you 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.720
 just disable this little this option 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.519
 there you will see that you will have 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.890
 bigger icons personally 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.510
 I prefer small icons that's fine 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.700
 better with the diva lets do we go on the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.140
 morning then the keeptouch boarding but 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.269
 you put it in black it's you who 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.310
 decide the support let them 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.569
 directly on your lockscreen otherwise 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.610
 that's all for the application 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.650
 then for the lock screen application 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.790
 togo I will give total of 5 stars 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.380
 so why five stars because 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.150
 personally love twin 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.950
 towers is really useful for those 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.599
 as I said at the beginning who pointed 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.400
 the swing explains first want these 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.709
 options there then it's really 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.819
 options we should have 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.410
 originally on our lock screen 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.709
 hold that we want to disable the wi fi 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.150
 activated do not disturb mode if you do not 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.799
 not go into the settings the activity 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.480
 istres of rates for nothing we just want 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.829
 activated from the south because we need it 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.390
 so I think I read put five 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.380
 star you public cat how many 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.090

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.410
 your star rating 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.690
 otherwise it's all for the application for 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.859
 your idevice six points at most then 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.209
