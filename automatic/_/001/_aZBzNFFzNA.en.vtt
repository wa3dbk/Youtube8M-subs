00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 very good guys and girls welcome 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.460
 just here saying after freddy 4 of 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.980
 final event or something like that is a night game 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 1 demo is a game that only 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.880
 It caught the attention since it is a bit 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.470
 the truth is terrifying and since we see 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.690
 there are several versions of all 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 animatronics as if it were health or 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.189
 bonnie or something like bonn hallucination and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.529
 in short those three fingers all we saw and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.029
 it looks like everything in black or if it gives 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.910
 fear then let's give even a gay to 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.769
 play this game although pressures 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.590
 personally to continue because 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.440
 we are in freddie fast see ok 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.090
 the same is worth it we will see difficult 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.360
 try this game that called me the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.660
 attention 12 in the morning 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.579
 ok this is a demo is not the version 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.579
 complete or it is already 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.030
 look 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:01.149
 another fax this looks to load something like that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.489
 basic mode battery mode mode mode 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.750
 electronic energy defense the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.460
 system I have the fixed system that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.980
 fax or mike bÃ¡rtok yes although I 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.170
 I think it's a mask something like that 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:19.250
 ok it's a square mask 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.290
 and this activate the cameras not if they are 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.180
 the cameras I think what you did here 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.060
 I'm in a room like this 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.330
 outside a window here are the cameras 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.409
 12 in the morning I have a battery 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.310
 OK 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.100
 oh my god 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.399
 look at the hallway that we have with a 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.399
 small step 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.280
 It's worth gas although this is the battery where 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.630
 it's over this one I do not know 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.610
 is where the mask ends, not the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.070
 the cameras and the battery that I have 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.480
 that recharge something like that I think I can not 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.890
 I can not because I can not 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.890
 why can not i can it's being recharged 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 botafoc 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:14.390
 it's me or something if it's left that I do not know 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.080
 let's monitor here 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.080
 generator 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.940
 everything is fine, it does not tell me error 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.940
 activate or deactivate what the fuck I am 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.790
 there it is 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.770
 because I do not see any animatronic for 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.170
 here to look what looks at it I look at it a mike 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.849

 already comes here so fast 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.190

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.720
 months until you recharge all the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.400

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.390

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.390
