another<00:00:01.110> reason<00:00:01.439> why<00:00:01.860> you<00:00:02.370> may<00:00:02.639> not<00:00:02.820> need<00:00:03.270> the

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
another reason why you may not need the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.019 
another reason why you may not need the
most<00:00:04.140> megapixels<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.040> you<00:00:05.130> can<00:00:05.279> buy<00:00:05.460> is

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
most megapixels that you can buy is

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.610 
most megapixels that you can buy is
because<00:00:06.390> shooting<00:00:06.779> an<00:00:06.870> image<00:00:07.170> at<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.379> higher

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
because shooting an image at a higher

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.230 
because shooting an image at a higher
resolution<00:00:07.919> actually<00:00:08.670> takes<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.940> lot<00:00:09.210> more

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
resolution actually takes a lot more

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.530 
resolution actually takes a lot more
space<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:09.990> your<00:00:10.050> memory<00:00:10.440> card<00:00:10.700> so<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:12.059> great

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
space on your memory card so a great

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.999 
space on your memory card so a great
thing<00:00:12.780> about<00:00:13.019> these<00:00:13.440> compact<00:00:13.889> digital

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
thing about these compact digital

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.890 
thing about these compact digital
cameras<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.940> don't<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.719> always

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
cameras is you don't have to always

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.290 
cameras is you don't have to always
shoot<00:00:16.440> at<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.859> high<00:00:17.070> end<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.850> resolution

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
shoot at the high end of the resolution

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.380 
shoot at the high end of the resolution
on<00:00:18.690> my<00:00:19.289> camera<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:20.160> actually<00:00:20.730> choose<00:00:21.029> if

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
on my camera you can actually choose if

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.920 
on my camera you can actually choose if
you<00:00:21.449> want<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.080> large<00:00:22.529> medium<00:00:23.220> or<00:00:23.400> small<00:00:23.930> size

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
you want a large medium or small size

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.290 
you want a large medium or small size
camera<00:00:25.380> which<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:26.369> size<00:00:26.609> image<00:00:27.060> which<00:00:27.269> is

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
camera which is but size image which is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.990 
camera which is but size image which is
the<00:00:27.539> number<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.779> pixels<00:00:28.519> and<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.820> also

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the number of pixels and you can also

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.690 
the number of pixels and you can also
decide<00:00:30.480> if<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.810> want<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.349> very<00:00:31.740> super

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
decide if you want it to be very super

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.979 
decide if you want it to be very super
super<00:00:33.090> fine<00:00:33.680> normal<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:35.059> just<00:00:36.059> fine<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.930> you

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
super fine normal or just fine so you

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.610 
super fine normal or just fine so you
can<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> choose<00:00:37.710> how<00:00:38.510> how<00:00:39.510> visible<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
can kind of choose how how visible the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.110 
can kind of choose how how visible the
pixels<00:00:41.070> are<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.180> image<00:00:43.879> every<00:00:44.879> time<00:00:45.030> you

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
pixels are in the image every time you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
pixels are in the image every time you
shoot<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.360> picture<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.079> decide<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.860> change

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
shoot a picture you can decide to change

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
shoot a picture you can decide to change
that<00:00:47.489> resolution<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.660> if<00:00:48.750> you're<00:00:48.840> just

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that resolution so if you're just

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.360 
that resolution so if you're just
shooting<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.379> bunch<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.649> snapshots<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
shooting a bunch of snapshots that you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.160 
shooting a bunch of snapshots that you
know<00:00:50.760> won't<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.210> bigger<00:00:51.390> than<00:00:51.480> four<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:51.899> six

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
know won't be bigger than four by six

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.660 
know won't be bigger than four by six
you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.920> ahead<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.129> shoot<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you can go ahead and shoot it in the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.150 
you can go ahead and shoot it in the
medium<00:00:54.110> normal<00:00:55.110> size<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.649> you're<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
medium normal size and you're going to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.119 
medium normal size and you're going to
still<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> great<00:00:56.879> print<00:00:57.680> or<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> know

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
still get a great print or if you know

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.260 
still get a great print or if you know
you're<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.609> shooting<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.000> bunch<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you're going to be shooting a bunch of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
you're going to be shooting a bunch of
pictures<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.719> are<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.620> used

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
pictures that are just going to be used

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.100 
pictures that are just going to be used
on<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> web<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.449> scale

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
on the web you know that you can scale

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.230 
on the web you know that you can scale
it<00:01:04.140> down<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.860> shoot<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> much<00:01:05.939> lower

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it down and shoot a much lower

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.690 
it down and shoot a much lower
resolution<00:01:06.930> image<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.530> means<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:08.130> your<00:01:08.430> one

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700

that<00:01:29.939> images<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.509> compressed<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.560> most

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that images are compressed it's the most

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.600 
that images are compressed it's the most
widely<00:01:32.220> used<00:01:32.250> method<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.390> compression<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
widely used method of compression and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.010 
widely used method of compression and
one<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> things<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> side

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
one of the things that it's a side

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.069 
one of the things that it's a side
effect<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.820> if<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.060> save<00:01:39.659> your<00:01:39.930> image

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
effect of it is if you save your image

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.770 
effect of it is if you save your image
multiple<00:01:40.770> times<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> actually<00:01:42.479> start<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
multiple times you can actually start to
