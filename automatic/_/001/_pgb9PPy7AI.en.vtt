00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:09.380
 Hello, I continue the theme of Mars 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:14.960
 Odessa tell as you see 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:18.270
 spring has come winter is over and 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.350
 serious frost problems especially 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.270
 diesel engines, they are already left behind 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:32.070
 here but we still face such 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:34.380
 which problem 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.739
 always present because we always 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.970
 make an asteroid of these cars cars 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.340
 independent bus car 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.960
 imported 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.559
 since we know that not all of these 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.210
 cars have mechanical fuel 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.239
 pumps 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:59.730
 Here is such not everywhere she there is 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.220
 electronic there is something fuel injection there 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.070
 present which goes 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.860
 helper does it all but I am you 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.789
 I want to talk about something else 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.800
 I want to tell you about something else 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:16.080
 there is such a device that us 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.979
 helps out like winter moms winter weather 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.450
 frosty conditions and also when replacing 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.450
 fuel filter so as not to spoil me 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.009
 we donâ€™t ruin the battery for us starks 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.310
 so that the brushes do not burn 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.979
 Bendix did not fly that is when large 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.250
 load and did not cut my battery 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:45.540
 here is such a device I will give you today 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.820
 show, I want to show you this 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.850
 such a pear 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.880
 this pear is meant for such for 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.979
 diesel cars whatever car 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.369
 whether it is mercedes whether it is opel whether 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.790
 this 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.670
 bmw whether it be grand cherokee there 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.939
 or well, I speak figuratively in general all those 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.239
 cars which stand 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.110
 diesel units and which do not have 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:15.810
 fuel pump means it's a pear 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:21.870
 here she is such a small 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.560
 I'm here on the yoke and attached two 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.830
 nipple 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.270
 I bought for disassembly 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.220
 tubes fuel tubes that go for 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.680
 lye which is recovered from 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.230
 us on mercedes when you push this 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.810
 latch you pull the tube that is 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.390
 is there dad and mom 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.930
 that is, here are those for the slits for 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.020
 why in order to painlessly quickly 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.180
 put this device here 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.700
 here you can also ride it in the winter I 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.790
 I went on it winter ends I 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.470
 rented off there is no fuel here 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:05.850
 Wrong to put it because you 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:10.290
 you put it to the wire pipeline 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:14.190
 the fuel wire that goes to 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:19.590
 feed not back to feed but here 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:25.860
 these connectors they will they be installed 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:29.220
 so different sides on the arrows here 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.989
 indicated fuel supply which goes to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.120
 fuel filter and then further in 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.769
 fuel equipment and turns in 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.709
 an assembly like this you already 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.780
 You have already installed this device 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.650
 you can't go wrong, that is, it is clear to you 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.950
 would you want to say when the fuel 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.530
 gets into this pear she is already back not 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.850
 goes to the tank does not pour out it remains 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.739
 here and when the engine is running 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.830
 fuel supply even if you 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.810
 somewhere let air somewhere in you 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.290
 somewhere fuel leaks out 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:16.350
 the hardware is not working well this is not 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:19.680
 there is not there is a problem this is a bomb 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.340
 you pear it will help you 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.850
 in operation I'll tell you later on 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.229
 example of my car, I will disconnect 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.960
 upload you see how it goes 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.220
 diesel distribution that is like fuel 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.220
 gets and how will she be 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.730
 how will she go to the fuel filter from 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.800
 fuel filter it will jump out 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:50.270
 outward outward that is show principle 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:53.360
 Circle Fuel Works Like You Have It 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.170
 working in the car here and on visual 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.250
 For example, I will connect the car you 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:05.720
 You will see that this machine works, that is 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:08.030
 you can ride it 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.730
 ride if nice is beautiful now 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.420
 there is no winter weather and I do not need to think 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:17.590
 so I can download this diesel tank 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:21.670
 hear how it works that is work 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.350
 perfectly fail no 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.440
 if you need to get it we will get it 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:31.100
 write to me, I posted to you near the video 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.610
 I'll tell you all this on your own 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:38.060
 how this system works 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:42.890
 nothing complicated there is everything conveniently available 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:46.520
 quick and easy so wait for my 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:49.220
 next video and thank you so much 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.490
 for the attention that you look me not 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.800
 easier to show it to you on video than me 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:59.030
 I will explain it to you for a long time, that is, and 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.710
 you will be this available here but I'm glad 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:07.780
 see you and thank you very much for your attention 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.780
