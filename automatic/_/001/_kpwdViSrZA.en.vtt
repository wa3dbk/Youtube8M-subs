00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
okay we are preparing to launch 200

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.530 
okay we are preparing to launch 200
paper<00:00:06.089> planes<00:00:06.450> from<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.779> edge<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.230> space<00:00:08.540> we

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
paper planes from the edge of space we

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.730 
paper planes from the edge of space we
are<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.230> barn

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
are in a barn

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.459 
are in a barn
in<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.340> town<00:00:11.580> called<00:00:11.820> Wolfsburg<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.840> Germany

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
in a town called Wolfsburg in Germany

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.589 
in a town called Wolfsburg in Germany
and<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:14.190> are<00:00:14.280> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.460> do<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.730> by<00:00:14.969> launching

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
and we are going to do this by launching

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.019 
and we are going to do this by launching
a<00:00:15.750> weather<00:00:16.139> balloon<00:00:16.350> full<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.859> helium<00:00:17.010> all<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
a weather balloon full of helium all the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.980 
a weather balloon full of helium all the
way<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> very<00:00:18.539> top<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> atmosphere

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
way up to the very top of the atmosphere

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.830 
way up to the very top of the atmosphere
about<00:00:19.380> 20<00:00:19.740> miles<00:00:19.890> up<00:00:20.130> at<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> edge<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.460> space

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
about 20 miles up at the edge of space

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.090 
about 20 miles up at the edge of space
whereupon<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.289> going<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.529> release<00:00:22.800> these

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
whereupon it is going to release these

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:32.510 
whereupon it is going to release these
200<00:00:23.609> plates<00:00:29.750> good<00:00:30.750> job<00:00:31.109> all<00:00:31.890> right<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.340> is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
200 plates good job all right so this is

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.850 
200 plates good job all right so this is
one<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> planes<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:34.079> putting<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> memory

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
one of the planes we're putting a memory

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.650 
one of the planes we're putting a memory
card<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.280> each<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.550> these<00:00:35.670> planes<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.450> then

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
card on each of these planes and then

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.880 
card on each of these planes and then
it's<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.989> prove<00:00:37.140> how<00:00:37.320> durable<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.860> are

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it's going to prove how durable they are

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.380 
it's going to prove how durable they are
cos<00:00:38.129> hopefully<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> cars<00:00:38.700> will<00:00:38.850> survive<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
cos hopefully the cars will survive the

00:01:46.579 --> 00:02:15.050 

yet<00:01:47.579> we've<00:01:47.759> got<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.969> burst<00:01:48.179> we're<00:01:48.509> coming<00:01:48.719> down

we're watching it now as its traveling
over<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> lake<00:02:17.800> but<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.280> predictor<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.760> fairly
