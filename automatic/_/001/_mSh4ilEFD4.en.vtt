probably<00:00:03.750> one<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.020> quickest<00:00:04.410> unboxings

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
probably one of the quickest unboxings

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.190 
probably one of the quickest unboxings
we've<00:00:05.460> ever<00:00:05.759> done<00:00:06.060> here<00:00:06.720> with<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.049> new

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
we've ever done here with the new

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.890 
we've ever done here with the new
12-inch<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:08.010> macbook<00:00:08.580> now<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.480> Space

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
12-inch a macbook now this is the Space

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.530 
12-inch a macbook now this is the Space
Gray<00:00:10.290> version<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.250> macbook<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.910> we're

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
Gray version of the macbook and we're

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.700 
Gray version of the macbook and we're
going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> definitely<00:00:12.960> take<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.290> look<00:00:13.590> at

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
going to definitely take a look at

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.200 
going to definitely take a look at
what's<00:00:13.920> inside<00:00:14.160> but<00:00:14.580> there's<00:00:14.759> really<00:00:15.000> not

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
what's inside but there's really not

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.970 
what's inside but there's really not
going<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> be<00:00:15.509> too<00:00:15.690> much<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.170> let's<00:00:16.830> go<00:00:16.949> ahead

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
going to be too much so let's go ahead

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.450 
going to be too much so let's go ahead
and<00:00:17.130> open<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.580> top<00:00:17.820> portion<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.449> box<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
and open the top portion of this box and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.160 
and open the top portion of this box and
here<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.640> our<00:00:20.820> space<00:00:21.240> grade<00:00:21.630> MacBook<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
here is our space grade MacBook and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.929 
here is our space grade MacBook and
we'll<00:00:22.410> take<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.619> look<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.100> more<00:00:23.279> depth

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
we'll take a look at that in more depth

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.640 
we'll take a look at that in more depth
later<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:24.570> pretty<00:00:25.260> much<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.500> have

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
later on but pretty much you have

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.900 
later on but pretty much you have
nothing<00:00:25.980> else<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.279> mean<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
nothing else I mean you have the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.529 
nothing else I mean you have the
instruction<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.930> cable<00:00:28.830> work<00:00:28.980> over<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.580> so

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
instruction and cable work over here so

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.319 
instruction and cable work over here so
quick<00:00:30.900> start<00:00:31.230> guide<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.210> probably<00:00:33.210> some

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
quick start guide and probably some

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.990 
quick start guide and probably some
apple<00:00:33.660> stickers<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.620> usual<00:00:34.950> stuff<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.880> have

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
apple stickers the usual stuff you have

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.600 
apple stickers the usual stuff you have
a<00:00:36.030> very<00:00:36.360> small<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:37.190> charger<00:00:38.190> over<00:00:38.430> here

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
a very small little charger over here

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.400 
a very small little charger over here
looks<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.210> charger<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.960> would<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.230> off

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
looks like the charger you would get off

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.020 
looks like the charger you would get off
of<00:00:40.590> an<00:00:40.710> iPad<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.790> see<00:00:41.820> it's

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
of an iPad and as you can see it's

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.610 
of an iPad and as you can see it's
really<00:00:42.420> small<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.690> has<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.989> USB<00:00:43.230> type-c

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
really small and has a USB type-c

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.520 
really small and has a USB type-c
connection<00:00:44.370> right<00:00:44.520> there<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:46.350> not

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
connection right there so it's not

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.830 
connection right there so it's not
exactly<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> same<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.760> an<00:00:47.910> ipad<00:00:48.239> charger<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
exactly the same as an ipad charger and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.020 
exactly the same as an ipad charger and
speaking<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.129> our<00:00:50.309> USB<00:00:50.610> type-c

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
speaking of that here is our USB type-c

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.420 
speaking of that here is our USB type-c
cable<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.860> pretty<00:00:53.039> much<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> only

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
cable and this is pretty much the only

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.610 
cable and this is pretty much the only
connection<00:00:54.329> interface<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
connection interface you have in the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.500 
connection interface you have in the
whole<00:00:55.739> computer<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.879> kind<00:00:57.420> of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
whole computer so that's a kind of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.209 
whole computer so that's a kind of
interesting<00:00:58.079> direction<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.829> Apple<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
interesting direction that Apple is

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.459 
interesting direction that Apple is
going<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> very<00:01:00.690> thick<00:01:01.050> cable

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
going to it's a it's a very thick cable

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.840 
going to it's a it's a very thick cable
which<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.800> nice<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.309> definitely<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
which is nice it's definitely going to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.149 
which is nice it's definitely going to
last<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.320> long<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.559> previous

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
last you just as long as previous

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.130 
last you just as long as previous
generation<00:01:05.760> power<00:01:06.299> cables<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.869> things<00:01:07.020> like

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
generation power cables and things like

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.410 
generation power cables and things like
that<00:01:07.200> hopefully<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.549> end<00:01:08.790> over<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that hopefully the end over here is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.690 
that hopefully the end over here is
going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:10.020> durable<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.369> previous

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
going to be as durable as the previous

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.880 
going to be as durable as the previous
generation<00:01:11.760> cable<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.689> let's<00:01:13.619> go<00:01:13.710> ahead<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
generation cable and let's go ahead and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.770 
generation cable and let's go ahead and
take<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> look<00:01:14.159> at<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> computer<00:01:14.640> itself<00:01:15.150> so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
take a look at the computer itself so

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.920 
take a look at the computer itself so
we'll<00:01:15.900> take<00:01:16.049> off<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:17.479> plastic<00:01:18.479> over

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
we'll take off all this plastic over

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100 
we'll take off all this plastic over
here<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.060> here<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> nice<00:01:21.659> space

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
here and here we have the nice space

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.429 
here and here we have the nice space
gray<00:01:22.880> pewter<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:23.909> take<00:01:24.659> them<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.869> cover<00:01:25.259> right

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
gray pewter and take them to cover right

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.749 
gray pewter and take them to cover right
there<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.090> there<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:28.220> very<00:01:29.220> nice<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
there and there you have it very nice so

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.030 
there and there you have it very nice so
you<00:01:29.820> could<00:01:30.150> see<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.810> brand-new

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
you could see that we have the brand-new

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.800 
you could see that we have the brand-new
low-profile<00:01:32.040> keyboard<00:01:32.520> over<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.659> key

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
low-profile keyboard over here the key

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.539 
low-profile keyboard over here the key
caps<00:01:34.049> themselves<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.619> larger<00:01:34.950> than<00:01:34.979> previous

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
caps themselves are larger than previous

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.179 
caps themselves are larger than previous
generation<00:01:36.119> macbooks<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.439> key<00:01:37.650> travel<00:01:38.070> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
generation macbooks the key travel is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.789 
generation macbooks the key travel is
much<00:01:38.430> less<00:01:39.240> than<00:01:39.270> previous<00:01:39.840> generation<00:01:40.409> but

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
much less than previous generation but

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.469 
much less than previous generation but
that's<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> reasons<00:01:41.579> why<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:42.299> could

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that's one of the reasons why they could

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.819 
that's one of the reasons why they could
make<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> computer<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.259> thin<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.649> only

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
make the computer so thin it only

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.399 
make the computer so thin it only
measures<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.820> 13<00:01:45.299> millimeters<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.229> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
measures about a 13 millimeters here and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
measures about a 13 millimeters here and
about<00:01:46.920> three<00:01:47.220> point<00:01:47.430> five<00:01:47.610> millimeters<00:01:48.180> over

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
about three point five millimeters over

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.660 
about three point five millimeters over
here<00:01:48.659> weight-wise<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.799> only<00:01:49.979> about<00:01:50.070> two

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
here weight-wise it's only about two

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.880 
here weight-wise it's only about two
pounds<00:01:50.909> under<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.720> kilogram<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.740> it's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
pounds under one kilogram so it's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.380 
pounds under one kilogram so it's
extremely<00:01:53.100> lightweight<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.880> feels<00:01:54.090> more<00:01:54.329> like

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
extremely lightweight it feels more like

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.880 
extremely lightweight it feels more like
a<00:01:54.540> tablet<00:01:54.869> than<00:01:55.200> anything<00:01:55.590> else<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
a tablet than anything else and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.190 
a tablet than anything else and
extremely<00:01:56.820> compact<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:57.840> there's<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
extremely compact so if there's the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.719 
extremely compact so if there's the
ports<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.590> connections<00:01:59.100> there's<00:01:59.310> really<00:01:59.490> not

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
ports of connections there's really not

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.340 
ports of connections there's really not
too<00:01:59.790> much<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> dual<00:02:00.780> microphones

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
too much you have the dual microphones

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350 
too much you have the dual microphones
right<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> headphone<00:02:02.820> jack

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
right there you have a headphone jack

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.450 
right there you have a headphone jack
right<00:02:03.899> there<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.200> well<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> other

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
right there as well and on the other

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.700 
right there as well and on the other
side<00:02:05.759> users<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> single<00:02:06.750> USB<00:02:07.320> type-c

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
side users have a single USB type-c

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.130 
side users have a single USB type-c
connection<00:02:08.459> which<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:09.149> plugs<00:02:09.569> into<00:02:09.810> your

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
connection which just plugs into your

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
connection which just plugs into your
USB<00:02:10.470> type-c<00:02:10.830> cable<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.819> for<00:02:11.940> a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
USB type-c cable and just for a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.710 
USB type-c cable and just for a
comparison<00:02:12.360> difference<00:02:12.810> here<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.110> can<00:02:13.290> see

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
comparison difference here you can see

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.410 
comparison difference here you can see
this<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.890> lightning<00:02:15.340> cable<00:02:15.730> they<00:02:15.850> use<00:02:16.120> for

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
this is the lightning cable they use for

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.570 
this is the lightning cable they use for
your<00:02:16.510> iphone<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.260> your<00:02:17.350> iPad<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.430> is

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
your iphone and your iPad and this is

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.430 
your iphone and your iPad and this is
the<00:02:18.670> USB<00:02:19.060> type-c<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.660> little<00:02:19.810> bit<00:02:19.990> different

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
the USB type-c so a little bit different

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.960 
the USB type-c so a little bit different
in<00:02:20.560> terms<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.160> overall<00:02:21.310> design<00:02:21.940> and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
in terms of overall design and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.780 
in terms of overall design and
dimensions<00:02:22.870> they're<00:02:23.830> both<00:02:23.950> reversible<00:02:24.580> which

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
dimensions they're both reversible which

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.640 
dimensions they're both reversible which
is<00:02:24.940> nice<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.300> see<00:02:25.480> but<00:02:25.720> this<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.140> obviously<00:02:26.320> a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
is nice to see but this is obviously a

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.920 
is nice to see but this is obviously a
lot<00:02:26.830> more<00:02:26.980> capable<00:02:27.490> in<00:02:27.670> terms<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.450> its<00:02:28.720> data

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
lot more capable in terms of its data

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.960 
lot more capable in terms of its data

whole bunch of different options and
this<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.550> really<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.090> future<00:02:37.540> of

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
this is really the future of

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.050 
this is really the future of
connectivity<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:39.310> kind<00:02:39.520> of<00:02:39.580> sucks<00:02:39.850> that

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
connectivity and it kind of sucks that

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.460 
connectivity and it kind of sucks that
this<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.600> only<00:02:40.690> port<00:02:41.050> that's<00:02:41.230> available

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
this is the only port that's available

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.370 
this is the only port that's available
on<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.250> new<00:02:42.400> macbook<00:02:42.670> but<00:02:43.180> hopefully<00:02:43.960> this

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
on the new macbook but hopefully this

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.990 
on the new macbook but hopefully this
won't<00:02:44.590> be<00:02:44.800> too<00:02:44.980> much<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.430> headache<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
won't be too much of a headache in the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.490 
won't be too much of a headache in the
future<00:02:46.360> but<00:02:46.690> really<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:46.959> than<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.290> guys

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
future but really I than that guys

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.720 
future but really I than that guys
that's<00:02:47.860> really<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.280> we're<00:02:48.430> going<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:48.700> a

that's really now we're going to have a

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.210 
that's really now we're going to have a
full<00:02:48.940> review<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:50.050> 12-inch<00:02:50.500> MacBook<00:02:50.650> as
