00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.350
 with the old teammates 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.490
 not always pleasant 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.589
 but sometimes changed the only two von Wehen Wiesbaden to Rostock 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.589
 At the beginning of the game had to take a lot first 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.579
 Tension at Hansas goalkeeper Müller because the Hesse initially better 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.749
 Wulz header 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.880
 but harmless 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.249
 Rostock in white comes better into the game APA afterwards 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.239
 35 STA game minute goat leg 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.800
 fights for the ball again 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 Goats was still one 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.410
 the one to zero for Hansa 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.410
 Ziegenbeins eighth goal of the season 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.320
 with this remarkable hammer Esther Rostock's most successful scorer 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.120
 Cheers on the guest stand but no reply as outward against 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.590
 Sandhausen had the Rostock fans stadium ban 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.550
 the crew though 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.550
 continue in forward gear 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.370
 the situation seems clear and then that 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.100
 Wehen Wiesbaden 4 degrees 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 against Marcel Schied 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 Referee Bern through the CDU Toccata 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 Space transfer for Boston 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.540
 pushes first copy against 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.570
 and then 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.590
 Third on his arm 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.590
 red card acceptable 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.430
 the place reference the topic of conversation at Ziegenbein and his 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.220
 old colleagues even when the break 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.220
 Rostock with one more man but the incident did not hurt 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.810
 the ball sails high into the penalty area and makes her rise highest 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.480
 Peter Vollmann wants to become Herbstmeister with his team 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.119
 must be a victory today 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.439
 and that against to be will be the necessary hi-awake effect 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.679
 Hansa better afterwards 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.579
 Lotte II 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.579
 2 4 1 in the 68 minute 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.220
 in the second at the hits 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.870
 The preliminary work of Pannewitz Lartey then only has to be inserted 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.019
 Rostock after the 2 2 1 0 at lay and with many good possibilities 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:36.809
 Yannick 11 forgives the decision 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.509
 Wehen Wiesbaden tries again 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.819
 Schönheim moves into the penalty area unhurt 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.709
 the perpetrators were allowed 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.359
 but lets continue playing 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.710
 rightly as the slow motion shows the students 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.829
 for not touching at all 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.439
 game over 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.839
 and in the stands they announce themselves that some Rostock fans have it 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:05.519
 managed to choose an extra bonus to celebrate their new away win 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.169
 Carriers should themselves
