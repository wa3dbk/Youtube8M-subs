00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:14.280
 and Sunday 27 July 2014 video 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:18.059
 presentation of the panda elettra 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.059
 let's start with the interiors 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.130
 natively no radio but I was 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.620
 warmed down thanks to this 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.900
 system the seat is equipped with change a 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.250
 four gears like that of 7 50 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.520
 fire model from which it derives directly 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.100
 the handbrake is that of the panda 4x4 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.080
 to be able to hold the weight better as much as 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.170
 concerns the commands 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.309
 the picture looks practically like 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.470
 that of all the other pandas with 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.630
 the absence of spies concerning the 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.580
 engine oil and what it is typically 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.140
 petrol traction the 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.860
 odometer compared to the version 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.410
 petrol 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.350
 I hope you can see and is equipped with 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.540
 partial with update button e 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.990
 of those colored arrows mark you 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.630
 the gear shift point 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.910
 ventilation has levers 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.590
 staff normal runs and one 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.869
 central nozzle like all the others 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.910
 versions the buttons are not there nor the 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.500
 neither heated rear window button 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.660
 of the rear glass despite these 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.020
 his are wired behind comes the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.929
 extra preparation cable in 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.640
 this cap that is for the watch 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.200
 enter this button here that serves 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.590
 to light a petrol burner for 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.590
 heating 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.780
 otherwise it looks like all the 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.869
 there are others when it is done inside 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.179
 also the clutch can be decided by four 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.240
 marches and that box where you are 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.979
 sees that red mark is a 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.069
 potentiometer a variable resistance 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.429
 which is connected to the accelerator and varies 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.880
 the frequency of the shopper to adjust the 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.800
 speed 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.800
 nothing and it is the only real peculiarity 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.380
 recharge with regards to the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.820
 recharge has this door 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.500
 front from which it is possible to extract 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.090
 a plug for charging this is not 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.470
 the original plug in fact you will see one 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.900
 v thorn in Ticino 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.570
 I put it I was replaced for 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.610
 technical reasons that we will see later 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.990
 in another video this plug does 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.520
 connects to a normal power outlet 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.520
 in particular in the case of use 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.010
 this extension with spinach and that one 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.940
 present is blocked since as the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.940
 recharge in a condominium courtyard 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.590
 I want to avoid danger to children 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.570
 animals that circulate in this area 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.160
 here's the video cut for a moment 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.280
 to be able to connect the cable 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.470
 once connected , goodbye 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.180
 switch hears a slight noise 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:49.260
 come from the hood because in here 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:53.940
 there is the power supply you can see on the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.850
 on-board computer and the 98.3 charge 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.410
 percent with the mode with the mode key 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.380
 I don't think we can read anything 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.930
 9 I read it I am absorbing 7.50 per 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.860
 charge the battery until you get to the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.510
 its maximum 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.890
 this is the only great peculiarity of 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.110
 this machine also share of heart or 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.950
 which is actually a control system 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.870
 of the batteries 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.530
 the junta I brought in these 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.390
 spies I put them I was not his and I am 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.190
 connected to the power supply that is in the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.830
 phase a launch presence in office 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.780
 voltage there is the connected plug start 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.989
 top up recharge because 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.360
 will be about 98 percent and recharge 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.980
 completed 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.810
 beside this is also inserted which is a 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.250
 nice glass that connected to the battery 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.450
 of the auxiliaries it serves for i 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.459
 wipers and all the rest 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.940
 to check that it is also charged 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.250
 that since the fans that do a 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.620
 reaction to the battery pack are 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.269
 linked to that 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.190
 from that battery therefore there is the 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.140
 possibility of that waste is already 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.519
 then I changed the circuit 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.519
 so that this no longer happens 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.520
 the theory of converter auxiliaries 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.960
 dc dc here enters the 72 times the 12 comes out 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.600
 to charge this auxiliary battery 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.820
 in here is one of the twelve bacteria 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.260
 of traffic with it here is mass 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.910
 a little in this way because not 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.220
 since its originals I had to 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.910
 replace I had to set aside some 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.820
 space for the original box 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.770
 fiat because the relay is a factor 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.510
 serve for bail 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.790
 this is why it is not original is 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.170
 was replaced and was practically the 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.210
 electronic control circuit of the 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.710
 motor here big cables that you see there 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.750
 in the corner are the ones that go then 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.290
 in the engine and we improve touch up because 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.790
 only intention, however, under someone it is 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.950
 serves to adjust the speed in the base 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.560
 to the accelerator and to the resistance that 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:47.120
 it's under the car's accelerator 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.740
 this here often here chargers 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.300
 it is not his original but for 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.220
 tobacco shop in a forklift or was 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.140
 replaced a few years ago with lahm though 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.340
 chemical minitro how much power but from 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.690
 current we are absorbing and below the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.940
 charging progress lights 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.710
 superior is changed and brought inside 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.780
 cabin 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.430
 this is the control unit of the 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.990
 heating that is made a 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.460
 auxiliary petrol cruiser e 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.020
 this container with continuous of 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.060
 classic coolant for 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.150
 radiators that is used for the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.910
 heating 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.350
 of the cockpit of the area box 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.880
 which you know works exactly like 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.620
 all the others at the palace with a fan 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.810
 a small water radiator 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.520
 I don't know if you hold this I want the 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.200
 little boy was this halogen statue 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.700
 I contain within it a 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.190
 switch the special friend 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.440
 commonly known as a life saver for a 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.960
 very good security 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.670
 one of the breaks that is a relay that 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.950
 connect the machine to the system 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.689
 electric home when he attacked the 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.699
 plug 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.729
 this is a fuse holder mentioned 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.830
 hours that interrupts the current to 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.089
 this dc dc converter to search 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.860
 part of auxiliary 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.729
 and this is the wind switch 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.559
 the cockpit because 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:03.150
 when it's hot or raining or for various 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:05.400
 reasons I can't open the windows but 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.229
 the machine in charge and the batteries 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.229
 release as a bit author matter 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:14.249
 the interior fan turns on for 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:17.039
 circulate air inside the 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:18.360
 stain that remains the reason so little 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.009
 not inserted into the switch 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.930
 always go to those who are very noisy and 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:23.460
 however, it can be particularly annoying 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.659
 because the machine is often loaded 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.370
 upstream for the rest looks like 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:32.430
 that of the other pandas for that little 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.349
 which continues has no spare wheel 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.059
 because there was no space to put it 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:37.830
 since there was a battery charger there 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:39.629
 but this was the canister that was supplied 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.680
 just originally from fiat ha 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:42.680
 already in 96 b
