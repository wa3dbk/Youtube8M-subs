00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
about RPMs why it's important as well it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.250 
about RPMs why it's important as well it
but<00:00:52.680> first<00:00:53.010> let's<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.460> look<00:00:53.610> at<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.260> fan

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
but first let's have a look at the fan

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.400 
but first let's have a look at the fan
itself<00:00:55.820> as<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.840> made<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.170> blue

the way from bottom to the top of the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.980 
the way from bottom to the top of the
fan<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:13.250> now<00:01:14.250> air<00:01:14.490> intake<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.509> air<00:01:15.659> intake

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
fan here now air intake for air intake

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.289 
fan here now air intake for air intake
they<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.770> lot<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> provision<00:01:17.880> from<00:01:18.060> either

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
they have a lot of provision from either

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.760 
they have a lot of provision from either
sides<00:01:18.689> which<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:20.130> quite<00:01:20.610> handy<00:01:20.939> for

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
sides which is actually quite handy for

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.249 
sides which is actually quite handy for
air<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.100> getting<00:01:23.880> sucked<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.299> from<00:01:24.600> either

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
air to be getting sucked in from either

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.289 
air to be getting sucked in from either
side<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.330> being<00:01:27.330> thrown<00:01:27.630> out<00:01:27.780> from<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> back

side and being thrown out from the back
now<00:01:30.950> for<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.400> dimensions<00:01:37.880> lengthwise<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
now for the dimensions lengthwise the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.210 
now for the dimensions lengthwise the
cooler<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:44.030> 170<00:01:45.030> millimeters<00:01:45.240> exactly<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
cooler is 170 millimeters exactly and

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.590 
cooler is 170 millimeters exactly and
width<00:01:47.220> wise<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:48.390> about<00:01:48.890> 28<00:01:49.890> millimeters

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600

width wise it's about 28 millimeters
sideways<00:01:51.600> which<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.070> actually<00:01:53.070> quite<00:01:53.280> good

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
sideways which is actually quite good

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.050 
sideways which is actually quite good
because<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:56.040> advertise<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.729> really

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
because as they advertise this really

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.990 
because as they advertise this really
will<00:01:57.240> fit<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.880> one<00:01:59.880> PCI<00:02:00.780> slot<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
will fit in just one PCI slot and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.870 
will fit in just one PCI slot and
possibly<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.149> between<00:02:03.630> two<00:02:04.159> cards<00:02:05.159> maybe<00:02:05.520> even

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
possibly in between two cards maybe even

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.070 
possibly in between two cards maybe even
two<00:02:06.000> graphics<00:02:06.420> cards<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.899> be

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
two graphics cards and and this can be

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.449 
two graphics cards and and this can be
strategically<00:02:10.619> advantageous<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
strategically advantageous that

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.929 
strategically advantageous that
hot<00:02:13.209> air<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.689> generated<00:02:14.230> there<00:02:14.829> is<00:02:15.129> taken

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
hot air that is generated there is taken

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.390 
hot air that is generated there is taken
up<00:02:16.060> right<00:02:16.629> then<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:16.930> there<00:02:16.989> before<00:02:17.950> it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
up right then and there before it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.140 
up right then and there before it
actually<00:02:18.989> moves<00:02:19.989> around<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.439> your<00:02:20.590> case<00:02:20.829> and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
actually moves around in your case and

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.309 
actually moves around in your case and
increases<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.329> temperature<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.290> your

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
increases the temperature of your

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:31.349 
increases the temperature of your
overall<00:02:23.980> casing<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:29.159> sound<00:02:30.359> let's

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
overall casing now for the sound let's

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:37.500 
overall casing now for the sound let's
quickly<00:02:32.170> hook<00:02:32.469> it<00:02:32.590> up<00:02:35.969> there<00:02:36.969> is<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.090> port<00:02:37.420> at

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
quickly hook it up there is a port at

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.129 
quickly hook it up there is a port at
the<00:02:37.540> bottom<00:02:40.769> plugs<00:02:41.769> in<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.629> now<00:02:43.629> I'm<00:02:43.810> going<00:02:44.049> to

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
the bottom plugs in so now I'm going to

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.780 
the bottom plugs in so now I'm going to
be<00:02:44.230> using<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:45.150> rpm<00:02:46.150> controller<00:02:46.540> here<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
be using a rpm controller here to

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.280 
be using a rpm controller here to
demonstrate<00:02:49.709> sound<00:02:50.709> levels<00:02:51.069> at<00:02:51.250> various<00:02:51.669> rpms

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:03.740 

okay<00:02:56.609> let's<00:02:57.609> power<00:02:57.879> it<00:02:57.909> up<00:03:01.290> first

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
okay let's power it up first

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:14.590 
okay let's power it up first
low<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.730> audible<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:10.340> not<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.940> much<00:03:12.240> so

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
low it is audible but not so much so

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.880 
low it is audible but not so much so
most<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.900> sound<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.560> may<00:03:16.830> be

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
most of the sound that you may be

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.470 
most of the sound that you may be
hearing<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:18.140> from<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.380> power<00:03:20.250> supply<00:03:20.670> that

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
hearing is from the power supply that

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.590 
hearing is from the power supply that
I'm<00:03:21.660> using<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.080> power<00:03:22.260> up<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.790> fan<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.420> there

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
I'm using to power up the fan but there

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.180 
I'm using to power up the fan but there
is<00:03:25.220> some<00:03:26.220> amount<00:03:26.460> of<00:03:27.020> actually<00:03:28.020> a<00:03:28.230> reasonable

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
is some amount of actually a reasonable

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.550 
is some amount of actually a reasonable
amount<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.580> airflow<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:30.960> can<00:03:31.110> feel<00:03:31.320> over

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
amount of airflow that we can feel over

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.070 
amount of airflow that we can feel over
here<00:03:31.770> yeah<00:03:32.130> I've<00:03:33.090> got<00:03:33.300> cotton<00:03:33.660> thread<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:33.960> my

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
here yeah I've got cotton thread in my

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.850 
here yeah I've got cotton thread in my
hand<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:36.080> we<00:03:37.080> have<00:03:37.260> airflow<00:03:37.800> let's<00:03:38.220> see<00:03:39.860> about

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
hand and we have airflow let's see about

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.940 
hand and we have airflow let's see about
that<00:03:41.010> far<00:03:41.400> away<00:03:41.670> it's<00:03:42.270> still<00:03:42.390> blowing<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.170> as

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
that far away it's still blowing so as

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.460 
that far away it's still blowing so as
you<00:03:44.070> can<00:03:44.190> see<00:03:44.390> deep<00:03:45.390> cool<00:03:45.600> advertise<00:03:46.050> is<00:03:46.260> that

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
you can see deep cool advertise is that

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.980 
you can see deep cool advertise is that
at<00:03:46.800> maximum<00:03:47.280> rate<00:03:47.490> it's<00:03:48.090> able<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.530> take<00:03:50.270> out<00:03:51.270> 17

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
at maximum rate it's able to take out 17

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.570 
at maximum rate it's able to take out 17
point<00:03:52.320> one<00:03:52.530> eight<00:03:53.690> cubic<00:03:54.690> feet<00:03:54.930> per<00:03:55.440> minute

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
point one eight cubic feet per minute

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.010 
point one eight cubic feet per minute
which<00:03:56.580> is<00:03:56.870> roughly<00:03:57.870> equivalent<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.920> about<00:04:00.020> 50

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
which is roughly equivalent to about 50

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.190 
which is roughly equivalent to about 50
to<00:04:01.140> 70<00:04:01.440> percent<00:04:02.000> amount<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.150> airflow<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:04.020> you

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
to 70 percent amount of airflow that you

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.160 
to 70 percent amount of airflow that you
may<00:04:04.350> expect<00:04:04.709> from<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:05.750> ordinary<00:04:06.750> hundred

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
may expect from a ordinary hundred

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
may expect from a ordinary hundred
twenty<00:04:07.380> millimeter<00:04:07.680> fan<00:04:07.920> which<00:04:08.670> is<00:04:09.410> yeah<00:04:10.410> it's

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
twenty millimeter fan which is yeah it's

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.930 
twenty millimeter fan which is yeah it's
okay<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.820> mean<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:13.620> idea<00:04:14.130> over<00:04:14.310> here<00:04:14.610> is<00:04:14.760> of

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
okay I mean the idea over here is of

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.470 
okay I mean the idea over here is of
strategy<00:04:15.890> or<00:04:16.890> in<00:04:17.400> case<00:04:17.640> if<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:18.000> don't<00:04:18.180> have

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
strategy or in case if you don't have

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.219 
strategy or in case if you don't have
any<00:04:18.630> further<00:04:18.930> provision<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:20.630> install<00:04:21.630> 820

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
any further provision to install 820

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.020 
any further provision to install 820
millimeter<00:04:22.560> fan<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.430> actually<00:04:23.820> going<00:04:23.940> to

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
millimeter fan this is actually going to

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.690 
millimeter fan this is actually going to
be<00:04:24.120> quite<00:04:24.330> handy<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:25.979> can<00:04:26.160> fit<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.520> in

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
be quite handy and and you can fit it in

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.340 
be quite handy and and you can fit it in
places<00:04:27.240> where<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.169> makes<00:04:28.440> more<00:04:28.650> sense<00:04:30.350> now

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
places where it makes more sense now

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:38.120 
places where it makes more sense now
let's<00:04:31.710> turn<00:04:31.979> up<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.130> RPM<00:04:34.880> there<00:04:35.880> we<00:04:35.940> go

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.650 

in<00:04:38.640> full<00:04:39.000> rpm<00:04:39.210> it's<00:04:39.750> actually<00:04:40.350> quite<00:04:40.620> audible

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.790 

but<00:04:46.970> there<00:04:47.970> is<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.420> very<00:04:48.990> good<00:04:49.410> amount<00:04:49.620> of

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
but there is a very good amount of

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.070 
but there is a very good amount of
airflow<00:04:50.070> as<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.520> can<00:04:50.700> see<00:04:50.940> I'm<00:04:51.690> holding<00:04:52.080> the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
airflow as you can see I'm holding the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.940 
airflow as you can see I'm holding the
absolutes<00:04:56.600> this<00:04:57.600> is<00:04:57.720> about<00:04:57.930> one<00:04:58.500> feet<00:04:58.800> away

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
absolutes this is about one feet away

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:06.650 
absolutes this is about one feet away
roughly<00:05:00.500> as<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:01.650> can<00:05:01.830> see<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:05.300> there<00:05:06.300> is<00:05:06.420> good

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
roughly as you can see and there is good

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.210 
roughly as you can see and there is good
amount<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:07.020> airflow<00:05:07.230> all<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.800> way<00:05:07.920> to<00:05:07.980> the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
amount of airflow all the way to the

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.970 
amount of airflow all the way to the
back<00:05:12.350> there<00:05:13.350> we<00:05:13.500> have<00:05:13.680> it

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
back there we have it

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.720 
back there we have it
this<00:05:14.580> was<00:05:15.170> the<00:05:16.820> deep<00:05:17.820> cool<00:05:18.140> expand<00:05:19.140> v<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:19.920> as<00:05:20.550> I

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
this was the deep cool expand v and as I

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.580 
this was the deep cool expand v and as I
have<00:05:20.850> just<00:05:21.090> demonstrated<00:05:21.210> it<00:05:21.810> can<00:05:22.110> be<00:05:22.320> used

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
have just demonstrated it can be used

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.680 
have just demonstrated it can be used
with<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:23.300> rpm<00:05:24.300> management<00:05:24.780> device<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:26.690> most

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
with a rpm management device and most

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.900 
with a rpm management device and most
gaming<00:05:28.140> builds<00:05:28.650> these<00:05:28.950> days<00:05:29.220> they<00:05:29.580> tend<00:05:29.820> to

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
gaming builds these days they tend to

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.570 
gaming builds these days they tend to
have<00:05:30.150> some<00:05:30.450> sort<00:05:30.630> of<00:05:30.720> rpm<00:05:31.170> management<00:05:31.650> system

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
have some sort of rpm management system

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.340 
have some sort of rpm management system
or<00:05:32.760> if<00:05:33.120> you<00:05:33.240> plug<00:05:33.510> it<00:05:33.660> directly<00:05:33.810> into<00:05:34.230> your

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
or if you plug it directly into your

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.730 
or if you plug it directly into your
motherboard<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:35.520> can<00:05:35.910> manage<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:37.080> RPM<00:05:37.500> via

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
motherboard you can manage the RPM via

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.440 
motherboard you can manage the RPM via
software<00:05:38.220> so<00:05:38.400> just<00:05:38.640> before<00:05:38.910> you<00:05:39.030> launch<00:05:39.300> a

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
software so just before you launch a

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.800 
software so just before you launch a
game<00:05:39.630> perhaps<00:05:40.370> you<00:05:41.370> can<00:05:41.580> turn<00:05:41.880> up<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:42.060> RPM<00:05:42.600> and

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
game perhaps you can turn up the RPM and

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.470 
game perhaps you can turn up the RPM and
at<00:05:43.170> other<00:05:43.800> times<00:05:43.890> when<00:05:44.400> your<00:05:44.910> system<00:05:45.180> is<00:05:45.300> not

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
at other times when your system is not

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.820 
at other times when your system is not
generating<00:05:45.930> so<00:05:46.050> much<00:05:46.110> heat<00:05:46.350> you<00:05:46.380> can<00:05:46.620> turn

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
generating so much heat you can turn

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.390 
generating so much heat you can turn

down the RPM this is actually to your

down the RPM this is actually to your
