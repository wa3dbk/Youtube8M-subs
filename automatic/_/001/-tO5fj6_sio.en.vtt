00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.639
 how about friends talking here with another 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.700
 video review and this time I bring you this 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.309
 so it's back and come back from the valley of 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.830
 the shadows of death for and 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.639
 Excuse me if you listen to what 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.920
 they seem to be guitars and beat well in 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.330
 the bottom but is that here is a 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:26.200
 band this is called minstrels 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.270
 that are entertaining or threatening us 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.790
 we still do not know why they rehearse 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.359
 all the damn days ok 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.519
 good sorry friends now since they 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:38.409
 I say do not blame me for my prolonged 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:42.339
 absence blame hasbro takara tomy 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:44.019
 mexico of discovery networks because it 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.699
 They had been slow to take out these new 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.579
 figures but then here we have returned 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.879
 with a transformers looks figure 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.379
 prime of it's called it's about nothing more and 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.379
 nothing less than the sergeant 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.600
 here we have friends to the sergeant cop that 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.790
 it's a repaint of the ironhide mold and 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.200
 curiously the repainting came out first 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.060
 what things do not and well here we can see 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.850
 that he becomes as his name what 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.890
 says in a pick-up in a van that 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.619
 bring back your navarone cannons 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.170
 height then now I will name you no 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.729
 ironhide we can remove the cannons from 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.350
 here from the back of there is no 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.350
 fait and put them here 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.450
 connect them here we have the mode of 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.980
 armed van that if he lived in 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.380
 Ciudad Juarez would serve them well 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.570
 it was a terrible joke I know I know but 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.130
 good to start the transformation what 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.830
 What we do is remove the cannons from the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.270
 back of noáin height now what 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.180
 we will do is we will 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.820
 lift all this assembly is a 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.360
 bit 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.159
 it's a bit orthodox to do is little 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.320
 orthodox the transformation let's 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.080
 lift from here back and we're going to 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.460
 lift these pieces all this 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.729
 assembly and we're going to do it towards 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.890
 in front of this form now we go to the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.630
 sides and we're going to separate these that are 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.720
 in a few small tabs we are going to 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.490
 make them sideways in this way 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.160
 I walk away a little bit more 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.290
 and I upload the exact shot so they can 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.630
 see the robot and now I approach now 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.040
 this part that you see here we're going to 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.829
 pull apart 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.200
 in this way we go to the part of here 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.540
 We're going to flip this robot 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.909
 assembly that will form the feet and 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.519
 now let's turn we 're going to take this 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.159
 bottom part of the bed of the 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.400
 truck we are going to turn the foot of this 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:50.110
 way it repeats the process on the other side 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.920
 here is very good now if you 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.349
 they set we're going to take all this part of 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.680
 everything that would be the waist 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.720
 hip and let's flex the towards 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.359
 in front 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.870
 yes it is true first let's lower this 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:10.510
 is in a slider this way and what 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.840
 we are going to go up there is here and the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.819
 raise the head of no ironhide or it 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.829
 approached and what we are going to do is that 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.099
 let's take all this part of the 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.489
 groin and we're going to flex it 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.900
 what assemblies if you look there 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:31.069
 assemble this part here 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.220
 we go down all this this part we rotate 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.040
 this assembly so that the tires 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.159
 are behind your forearms the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.860
 we turn in this way there is and now 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:46.549
 let's go to this part and we're going to collapse 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.939
 this panel on this piece and rotate 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.730
 of the forearm the entire arm so that 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:56.299
 the cobb rim is or is not ironhide 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:02.480
 Be behind your forearm we repeat 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:05.720
 the process goes down and in this way is 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.810
 very well there we have part of the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.819
 transformation already completed now what 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.459
 what are we going to do is we're going to take 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.680
 these lights that are in about 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.880
 sliders we will go up here 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.340
 we will separate and angular things a 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.310
 little bit this way, this is going to give us 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.440
 chance to raise your arms 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.960
 in this way I will make a small 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.520
 approach for you to see 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.520
 we upload it like this 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.509
 It is very good that you see the most 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.520
 beautiful that is has the sergeant corp 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.229
 captain and now what we're going to do is 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.479
 that we're going to go to the front of 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.360
 the truck and what we're going to do is 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:52.139
 that this always gives me a bit of 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.139
 problems 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.419
 let's separate this whole part wait 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.580
 to this one 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.520
 in this way I am having problems 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.620
 technicians we're going to lower this and now some 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.800
 small tabs that are here reached 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.470
 see and jay jay that goes with the approach 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.260
 a few small tabs that here are 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.620
 reach to see are going to assemble this 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.620
 shape 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.910
 is 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.509
 thus 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:31.110
 and in this way it is that I lower all 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:34.019
 assembly and this one what this 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.399
 we go down so that it stays that way and there 

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:41.689
 we have very cop ladies and gentlemen 

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:45.209
 pretty a very good figure the truth 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.799
 that although it does not come out in prime but 

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:50.779
 here we can see that your biggest problem 

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:53.339
 has two major problems that his 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:56.639
 clearly it is at a height even 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:59.729
 here with the cannons that we 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:03.179
 we choose to put them in the arms end 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:06.029
 the ironhide aesthetic is that this is how I 

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:08.529
 I just invented this word is here 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:11.189
 they finish the aesthetics 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:11.189
 there is 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.190
 the head is a bit difficult to rotate 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:22.030
 because you are in here but 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.370
 it is clearly ironhide and also the 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.349
 piece the kivu mazacote that has 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.509
 back here that if you already noticed 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:30.350
 in such a clumsy way of transforming what 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.890
 you can 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.630
 remove it and put it like this so that it 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:39.390
 down and in the opinion of a 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:42.120
 server that much much better 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:45.540
 responsibility for your arms rotate 360 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.880
 degrees your forearms rotate 360 ​​degrees 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.180
 his legs 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.550
 they rotate in front they rotate 360 ​​degrees 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:57.330
 it also has a bit of articulation 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.820
 here forward and back towards 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.950
 the sides that helps us to 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.920
 stabilize it in a variety of 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.360
 processes but friendly friends really if 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.330
 you had been waiting for 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.870
 sergeant cop you really spend a 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:15.540
 interesting figurine clearly should 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.630
 have come out as ironhide and well here 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.830
 we see all the 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.830
 the Clares 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.720
 visual clues that it's ironhide but 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.520
 if you do not mind the fact of 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.110
 that he possesses is not the character that 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.910
 you saw first where you 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.200
 I would have liked to see first because I do not know 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.390
 worry because this is a good 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.880
 figurine the truth is that it is not 

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.950
 excellent but it 's very good 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.650
 from this I found it in a walmart the 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:47.620
 true and then I had to travel to another 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.390
 wall mart to buy this but the 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.840
 truth is that both are pretty 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:55.330
 I recommend them to you 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.640
 friends that of the prime line it is 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:01.090
 quite has had its ups and downs 

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:04.000
 but this guy is one of the most 

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:06.610
 means within this line of 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.740
 prime transformers I recommend it but 

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.470
 well do not turn the world to 

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.630
 find him friendly friends I am biliary 

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:17.460
 this is the sergeant how is he not 

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.460
 ironhide and we said goodbye
