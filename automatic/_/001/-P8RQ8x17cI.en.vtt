00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.870
Has someone kidnapped your pet, and you need to learn the Zombie Story in less than

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.899
three minutes? You are in the right place. Let´s begin, your pet need us! &gt;:(

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.369
In 1908 many meteorites with element 115 fall out the Earth. Since then, all countries

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.759
had been picking up these 115 and investigating it. It was the beggining of everything.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.550
1939. The Earth. Germany. Der Riese. The Group 935 worked in this facility.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.259
The developped, using 115, some teleports, test-rings, 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.920
Die Glocke, Perk-A-Colas... But they had spent all their money, so they started to work for the Nazis,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.000
creating a Zombie army, weapons, Pack-a-Punch, stange things, Zombies, Zombies, more Zombies...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.370
The most importante people of the factory were Dr. Richtofen, 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.600
Schuster, Dr. Maxis, Samantha (her daughter)... and a dog.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.310
In 1943, Richtofen teleported himself, but he didn´t appear were he have to appear:

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.080
he appear at the Moon instead, in front of an ancient vril machine which was a state portal

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.200
to the Aether, a dimension where you can control the Zombie Army.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.260
A few weeks later, Richtofen returned to Der Riese, but he was evil. Some scientist wanted to help him, and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.020
he sent them to the Moon, where they built the Griffin Station in order to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.190
open the Pyramid device. At the same time,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.120
Richtofen was erasing the memory of his test subjects: Nikolai, Takeo and Dempsey,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.000
Demosey was a Marine who was sent to Verrückt to rescue

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.280
his friend Peter, who was a Marine infiltrate in 935.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.690
In November-December 1945, the pyramid was opened, and Richtofen wanted to kill Maxis.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.790
They were working on teleports, using Fluffy, Samantha´s dog, but

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.950
something happened and Fluffy turned evil.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.940
Samantha arrived, and Richtofen locked them with Fluffy.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.290
Maxis and Samantha went into the teleport. Samantha appeared in the Moon, and

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.630
she went into the Pyramid device. Now Richtofen wanted to find Maxis, who had teleport to ShangriLa.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.580
Maxis told Samantha that she had to kill all Group 935, and it was what she did.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.950
Richtofen, with his three Test Subjects, went to Shi No Numa in order to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.650
confirm that Peter, the Marine-spy, was 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.220
dead.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.570
Then they went to Der Riese, and they use the teleport to travel in spacetime.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.450
They arrived to 1960´s german cinema, and then they went to 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.790
Ascension, where they actived the Kassimir Mechanism. At the same time, Zombies are also at

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.710
the Pentagon.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.619
Then they travel to Siberia, in 2011, where they got the Vril-Device with the help of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.060
5 people who fight versus zombies, sorry, 4.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.229
The jungle, ShangriLa, In this place, they help Brock and Gary in 1946 and they got

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.930
the focusing stone.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.210
1961, Area51, they used a teleport to go to Griffin Station,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.439
where they were going to open the Pyramid and stop Samantha.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.919
Using the Kassimir, the Vril Device and the Focusing Stone, Richtofen switch souls with

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.469
Samantha. Now, he control the Zombies.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.669
But Maxis had planned everything. He knew that Richtofen will enter to the

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:22.159
Pyramid, and he knew that when we kill a zombie, his energy return

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.739
to the Aether, to Richtofen.

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.189
Maxis decide to threw 3 rockets to the Earth, to

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.069
kill all Zombies and disintegrate all their energy, so that Richtofen would have less energy.

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.439
But his calculations failed, there are Zombies at the Earth, and the planet is ... 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.889
destroyed.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:44.359
Well, now you can rescue your pet. The Story is end... or no.

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.009
Thanks for watching! ^^
