mask to make text look like it's going

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.590 
mask to make text look like it's going
behind<00:00:53.719> an<00:00:53.870> object<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:55.129> if<00:00:56.089> I<00:00:56.179> scrub<00:00:56.449> through

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
behind an object so if I scrub through

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.329 
behind an object so if I scrub through
my<00:00:56.780> timeline<00:00:57.260> this<00:00:57.559> is<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.949> effect<00:00:58.249> that

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
my timeline this is the effect that

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.329 
my timeline this is the effect that
we're<00:00:58.429> going<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:58.609> get<00:00:58.789> I<00:01:00.670> play<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:02.980> you<00:01:03.980> can<00:01:04.129> see

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
we're going to get I play it you can see

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.270 
we're going to get I play it you can see
this<00:01:04.460> will<00:01:04.730> be<00:01:04.760> very<00:01:05.089> useful<00:01:05.449> for<00:01:05.480> things<00:01:05.870> like

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
this will be very useful for things like

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.320 
this will be very useful for things like
titles<00:01:07.280> or<00:01:07.580> perhaps<00:01:08.450> if<00:01:09.020> you're<00:01:09.440> in<00:01:09.830> my<00:01:09.980> case

names or other information on time okay

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.540 
names or other information on time okay
so<00:01:21.560> let's<00:01:21.890> get<00:01:22.010> started<00:01:22.070> okay<00:01:23.440> so<00:01:24.490> create<00:01:25.490> a

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
so let's get started okay so create a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.230 
so let's get started okay so create a
new<00:01:25.670> project<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:27.010> I've<00:01:28.010> imported<00:01:28.670> my<00:01:28.790> footage

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
new project and I've imported my footage

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.890 
new project and I've imported my footage
so<00:01:30.110> now<00:01:30.260> I<00:01:30.500> drag<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.010> down<00:01:31.250> onto<00:01:31.570> this<00:01:32.570> little

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
so now I drag it down onto this little

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.590 
so now I drag it down onto this little
icon<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.380> create<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.650> new<00:01:33.680> composition<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.700> I'm

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
icon to create a new composition and I'm

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.060 
icon to create a new composition and I'm
just<00:01:35.870> going<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.050> cut<00:01:36.470> off<00:01:36.650> some<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
just going to cut off some of the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.640 
just going to cut off some of the
excesses<00:01:37.460> for<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:37.970> outdoor<00:01:38.350> don't<00:01:39.350> want<00:01:39.530> to

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
excesses for the outdoor don't want to

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.900 
excesses for the outdoor don't want to
work<00:01:39.920> on<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.280> massively<00:01:40.730> one<00:01:41.030> video<00:01:42.850> okay<00:01:43.850> so

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
work on the massively one video okay so

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.660 
work on the massively one video okay so
the<00:01:44.210> next<00:01:44.420> step<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.260> create<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.680> new<00:01:46.130> tags

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
the next step is to create a new tags

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.940 
the next step is to create a new tags
layer<00:01:47.050> so<00:01:48.050> I'm<00:01:48.110> just<00:01:48.260> going<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.500> put<00:01:48.620> my<00:01:48.740> name

layer so I'm just going to put my name

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:59.370 
layer so I'm just going to put my name
in<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:55.750> drag<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.900> up<00:01:57.050> so<00:01:57.800> somewhere<00:01:58.640> will<00:01:58.790> fit

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
in and drag it up so somewhere will fit

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.770 
in and drag it up so somewhere will fit
make<00:02:00.380> sure<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.800> bike<00:02:01.010> is<00:02:01.040> going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.580> it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
make sure that the bike is going to it

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.140 
make sure that the bike is going to it
okay<00:02:02.860> so<00:02:03.860> now<00:02:03.980> what<00:02:04.160> we<00:02:04.280> have<00:02:04.370> to<00:02:04.520> do<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.940> make

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
okay so now what we have to do is make

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.330 
okay so now what we have to do is make
the<00:02:05.300> text<00:02:05.810> appear<00:02:05.990> as<00:02:06.560> if<00:02:06.710> he's<00:02:06.860> being<00:02:07.040> rubbed

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
the text appear as if he's being rubbed

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.790 
the text appear as if he's being rubbed
out<00:02:07.550> or<00:02:07.820> going<00:02:08.030> behind<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.420> bike<00:02:08.569> okay<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:09.500> how

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
out or going behind the bike okay so how

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.940 
out or going behind the bike okay so how
we<00:02:09.860> do<00:02:10.069> this<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.610> we<00:02:11.000> click<00:02:11.360> on<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.540> text<00:02:11.840> layer

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
we do this is we click on the text layer

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.070 
we do this is we click on the text layer
make<00:02:12.950> sure<00:02:12.980> textile<00:02:13.640> selecting<00:02:14.180> adaptive<00:02:14.780> pen

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
tool and we're going to scrub through

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.530 
tool and we're going to scrub through
the<00:02:18.170> timeline<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.550> stage<00:02:19.910> where<00:02:20.300> we<00:02:20.330> can

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the timeline to a stage where we can

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.170 
the timeline to a stage where we can
start<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.109> see<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.379> bike<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.730> I'm<00:02:22.909> going<00:02:23.120> to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180

two points are and I'm going to create

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330 
two points are and I'm going to create
one<00:02:26.420> point<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.049> middle<00:02:27.230> clicking<00:02:28.189> and

one point in the middle clicking and
dragging<00:02:28.370> there<00:02:29.120> create<00:02:29.390> see<00:02:29.569> two<00:02:29.780> low<00:02:30.650> points

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
dragging there create see two low points

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.729 
dragging there create see two low points
it<00:02:31.700> each<00:02:32.120> side<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:33.049> means<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.439> we<00:02:33.530> can

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
it each side that means that we can

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.360 
it each side that means that we can
curve<00:02:34.090> how<00:02:35.090> long<00:02:36.189> okay

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
curve how long okay

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.429 
curve how long okay

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
just moving our point I'm holding shift

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.360 
just moving our point I'm holding shift
on<00:03:59.720> select<00:04:00.199> these<00:04:00.319> first<00:04:00.680> three<00:04:00.949> points

the<00:04:21.409> bike<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:22.460> various<00:04:23.360> point<00:04:23.720> within<00:04:24.199> this

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
the bike so various point within this

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.770 
the bike so various point within this
between<00:04:25.520> these<00:04:25.760> two<00:04:25.940> points<00:04:26.330> we<00:04:26.479> have<00:04:26.599> to

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
between these two points we have to

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
between these two points we have to
create<00:04:27.229> new<00:04:27.289> keyframes<00:04:28.389> by<00:04:29.389> moving<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:30.139> mask

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
create new keyframes by moving a mask

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.399 
create new keyframes by moving a mask
just<00:04:31.789> to<00:04:31.940> make<00:04:32.090> sure<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.510> another's<00:04:32.960> points

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
just to make sure that another's points

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.240 
just to make sure that another's points
a<00:04:33.560> lined<00:04:34.190> up<00:04:35.289> you<00:04:36.289> can<00:04:36.469> add<00:04:36.560> as<00:04:36.740> many<00:04:36.889> as<00:04:37.099> you

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
a lined up you can add as many as you

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.620 
a lined up you can add as many as you
want

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
want

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.840 
want
some<00:04:38.080> things<00:04:38.320> need<00:04:38.500> more<00:04:38.830> than<00:04:38.950> others<00:04:39.310> but

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
some things need more than others but

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.710 
some things need more than others but
this<00:04:39.970> sounds<00:04:40.240> pretty<00:04:40.480> good<00:04:41.790> that<00:04:43.140> okay<00:04:44.220> so<00:04:45.220> now

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
this sounds pretty good that okay so now

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.780 
this sounds pretty good that okay so now
pretty<00:04:46.720> much<00:04:47.010> we've<00:04:48.010> got<00:04:48.250> something<00:04:48.640> that

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
pretty much we've got something that

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.480 
pretty much we've got something that
actually<00:04:49.000> does<00:04:49.240> work<00:04:49.800> but<00:04:50.800> now<00:04:50.950> there<00:04:51.130> are<00:04:51.250> few

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
actually does work but now there are few

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.790 
actually does work but now there are few
things<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.850> can<00:04:52.060> do<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.510> make<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:52.810> look<00:04:52.960> more

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
things you can do to make it look more

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.940 
things you can do to make it look more
interesting<00:04:54.360> now<00:04:55.360> what<00:04:55.540> we<00:04:55.660> go<00:04:55.870> resume<00:04:56.650> in<00:04:56.830> two

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
interesting now what we go resume in two

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.250 
interesting now what we go resume in two
hundred<00:04:57.250> percent<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:58.540> problem<00:04:58.870> we<00:04:59.050> have<00:04:59.230> now

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
hundred percent the problem we have now

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.720 
hundred percent the problem we have now
is<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:01.330> mask<00:05:01.600> has<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:01.960> very<00:05:02.200> crisp<00:05:02.530> edge<00:05:02.770> but

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
is the mask has a very crisp edge but

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.100 
is the mask has a very crisp edge but
the<00:05:03.850> bike<00:05:04.120> wheel<00:05:04.690> doesn't<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:07.080> because<00:05:08.080> of

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
the bike wheel doesn't and because of

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.860 
the bike wheel doesn't and because of
the<00:05:08.230> motion<00:05:08.620> blur<00:05:08.860> looks<00:05:09.490> a<00:05:09.580> bit<00:05:09.610> weird<00:05:09.870> what

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
the motion blur looks a bit weird what

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.660 
the motion blur looks a bit weird what
we<00:05:11.020> want<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.590> do<00:05:11.740> is<00:05:11.920> create<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.310> mark

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
we want to do is create the mark

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
click on the mask come to this little

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.730 
click on the mask come to this little
down<00:05:15.070> arrow<00:05:15.130> where<00:05:15.970> it<00:05:16.060> says<00:05:16.210> mask<00:05:16.570> feather<00:05:17.050> we

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
down arrow where it says mask feather we

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.220 
down arrow where it says mask feather we
want<00:05:17.920> to<00:05:18.010> create<00:05:18.220> a<00:05:18.310> little<00:05:18.490> mask<00:05:18.790> better<00:05:19.230> as

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
want to create a little mask better as

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.050 
want to create a little mask better as
you<00:05:20.440> can<00:05:20.590> see<00:05:20.800> we<00:05:20.980> can<00:05:21.100> create<00:05:21.340> a<00:05:21.370> feather<00:05:21.820> the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
you can see we can create a feather the

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.010 
you can see we can create a feather the
feathers<00:05:22.450> into<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.900> world<00:05:24.540> I'm<00:05:25.540> going<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:25.900> go

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
feathers into the world I'm going to go

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.290 
feathers into the world I'm going to go
for<00:05:26.230> by<00:05:26.350> eighteen<00:05:26.800> problem<00:05:27.640> is<00:05:27.760> now<00:05:27.970> that<00:05:28.180> the

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
for by eighteen problem is now that the

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.800 
for by eighteen problem is now that the
mask<00:05:28.540> is<00:05:28.780> actually<00:05:29.170> slightly<00:05:29.440> wrong<00:05:29.830> because

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
mask is actually slightly wrong because

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.130 
mask is actually slightly wrong because
feather<00:05:31.810> come<00:05:32.530> to<00:05:32.680> this<00:05:32.800> side<00:05:33.160> of<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.430> mask<00:05:33.760> so

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
feather come to this side of the mask so

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.380 
feather come to this side of the mask so
what<00:05:35.140> we<00:05:35.230> want<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.440> do<00:05:35.590> is<00:05:35.710> use<00:05:35.860> his<00:05:35.890> mask

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
what we want to do is use his mask

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.120 
what we want to do is use his mask
expansion<00:05:38.280> just<00:05:39.280> is<00:05:39.490> slightly<00:05:39.790> so<00:05:40.780> we<00:05:41.130> correct

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
expansion just is slightly so we correct

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.920 
expansion just is slightly so we correct
the<00:05:42.370> foldable<00:05:42.810> feather

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
the foldable feather

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.620 
the foldable feather
now<00:05:44.560> each<00:05:44.770> battery<00:05:45.190> see<00:05:46.180> it<00:05:46.270> works<00:05:46.420> pretty

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
now each battery see it works pretty

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.100 
now each battery see it works pretty
well<00:05:47.250> another<00:05:48.250> little<00:05:48.580> tip<00:05:48.850> I<00:05:49.030> for<00:05:49.360> you<00:05:49.480> when

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
well another little tip I for you when

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.630 
well another little tip I for you when
you're<00:05:50.290> using<00:05:50.500> live<00:05:51.360> footage<00:05:52.360> real<00:05:52.870> footage

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
you're using live footage real footage

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.280 
you're using live footage real footage
text<00:05:54.640> cannot<00:05:54.940> often<00:05:55.300> look<00:05:55.570> at<00:05:55.690> our<00:05:55.930> place

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
text cannot often look at our place

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.680 
text cannot often look at our place
because<00:05:56.710> it's<00:05:56.830> so<00:05:57.010> sharp<00:05:57.340> so<00:05:58.240> if<00:05:58.300> you<00:05:58.450> just

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
because it's so sharp so if you just

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.070 
because it's so sharp so if you just
apply<00:05:59.050> a<00:05:59.820> slight<00:06:00.820> blur<00:06:01.180> so<00:06:01.690> we're<00:06:01.810> going<00:06:01.900> to<00:06:01.960> go

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
apply a slight blur so we're going to go

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.510 
apply a slight blur so we're going to go
Blair<00:06:02.680> pause<00:06:03.640> and<00:06:03.880> learn<00:06:04.000> we<00:06:04.780> just<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.110> PI<00:06:05.520> just

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
Blair pause and learn we just a PI just

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.120 
Blair pause and learn we just a PI just
the<00:06:06.610> radius<00:06:06.970> of<00:06:07.120> one<00:06:07.270> or<00:06:07.390> two<00:06:07.710> you<00:06:08.710> can<00:06:08.830> make<00:06:08.980> it

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
the radius of one or two you can make it

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.460 
the radius of one or two you can make it
look<00:06:09.250> a<00:06:09.400> little<00:06:09.580> bit<00:06:09.880> more<00:06:10.060> like<00:06:11.050> it's<00:06:11.260> meant

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
look a little bit more like it's meant

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.790 
look a little bit more like it's meant
to<00:06:11.560> be<00:06:11.650> there<00:06:12.330> so<00:06:13.330> a<00:06:13.360> zoom<00:06:13.630> back<00:06:13.810> out<00:06:14.050> so<00:06:14.710> you

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
to be there so a zoom back out so you

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.510 
to be there so a zoom back out so you
can<00:06:14.950> see<00:06:15.130> everyone's<00:06:15.490> of<00:06:15.730> it<00:06:16.000> and<00:06:17.520> when

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
can see everyone's of it and when

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.810 
can see everyone's of it and when
graphing<00:06:18.760> our<00:06:19.180> sequence<00:06:19.900> and<00:06:20.530> AC<00:06:20.820> works

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
graphing our sequence and AC works

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.060 
graphing our sequence and AC works
pretty<00:06:22.030> well<00:06:24.630> and<00:06:25.630> thanks<00:06:26.440> for<00:06:26.530> watching<00:06:26.860> and
