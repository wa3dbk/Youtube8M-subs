00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.729 
will automatically move left the
microswitch<00:02:19.370> inside<00:02:19.970> here<00:02:20.269> is<00:02:20.390> broken<00:02:20.739> so

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
microswitch inside here is broken so

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.890 
microswitch inside here is broken so
hoping<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.250> manager<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.970> our<00:02:23.630> lanes<00:02:23.870> will<00:02:25.900> and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
hoping a manager of our lanes will and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.350 
hoping a manager of our lanes will and
see<00:02:27.140> there<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.440> goes<00:02:28.120> automatically<00:02:29.120> you

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
see there it goes automatically you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.569 
see there it goes automatically you
would<00:02:29.510> have<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.810> bang<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:31.010> order<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.430> get

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
would have to bang it to in order to get

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.590 
would have to bang it to in order to get
away<00:02:32.320> but<00:02:33.320> it's<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.650> decent<00:02:33.829> machine<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:35.360> works

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
away but it's a decent machine it works

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.880 
away but it's a decent machine it works
but<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:38.450> holistic<00:02:38.690> doesn't<00:02:39.290> work<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.680> course

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890
