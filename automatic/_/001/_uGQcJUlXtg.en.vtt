00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
my friends I took a red sharpie and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.130 
my friends I took a red sharpie and
discord<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.510> does<00:00:45.629> look<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:45.899> weird

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
discord in so it does look really weird

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
discord in so it does look really weird
it<00:00:46.350> funny<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.309> regular<00:00:47.550> akin

lens<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> lot<00:01:32.130> bigger

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
lens is a lot bigger

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.770 
lens is a lot bigger
alright<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:32.909> now<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.390> show<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
alright so now I'm going to show you a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
alright so now I'm going to show you a
few<00:01:34.200> example<00:01:34.770> pictures<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.579> show<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
few example pictures to show you the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.819 
few example pictures to show you the
differences<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.570> these<00:01:36.900> lenses<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.680> right

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
differences of these lenses so right

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.830 
differences of these lenses so right
here<00:01:38.040> I'm<00:01:38.189> shooting<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.670> 10<00:01:39.090> millimeters<00:01:39.659> on

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
here I'm shooting at 10 millimeters on

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.929 
here I'm shooting at 10 millimeters on
the<00:01:40.110> Canon<00:01:40.530> 10<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.040> 18<00:01:41.369> millimeter<00:01:41.700> lens

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.440 
18 millimeter when sped up zoomed all
the<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.259> 18<00:01:49.950> millimeters<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.729> now<00:01:51.299> I'm

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the way up to 18 millimeters and now I'm

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.960 
the way up to 18 millimeters and now I'm
shooting<00:01:51.630> at<00:01:51.840> 5.6<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.430> third<00:01:53.579> picture<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
shooting at 5.6 on this third picture I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.209 
shooting at 5.6 on this third picture I
changed<00:01:54.360> my<00:01:54.509> 10<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.140> 18<00:01:55.470> millimeter<00:01:55.829> lens<00:01:56.009> out

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
changed my 10 to 18 millimeter lens out

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.959 
changed my 10 to 18 millimeter lens out
to<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.909> 10<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.899> 55<00:01:58.590> millimeter<00:01:59.070> ones<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.880> in

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
to the 10 to 55 millimeter ones so in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.100 
to the 10 to 55 millimeter ones so in
this<00:02:00.030> picture<00:02:00.180> I'm<00:02:00.390> shooting<00:02:00.659> at<00:02:00.719> 18

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
millimeters shooting at F 3.5 and as you

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.060 
millimeters shooting at F 3.5 and as you
can<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> image<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:04.890> bit

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
can see the image is a little bit

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.010 
can see the image is a little bit
overexposed<00:02:05.610> since<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.360> didn't<00:02:06.570> change<00:02:06.750> any<00:02:06.930> of

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the settings in the last image we have

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.559 
the settings in the last image we have
here<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.629> 55<00:02:10.050> millimetres<00:02:10.920> F<00:02:11.430> 5.6<00:02:12.300> with

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
can 18 to 55 millimeter ones now both of

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.349 
can 18 to 55 millimeter ones now both of
these<00:02:15.930> ones<00:02:16.170> are<00:02:16.379> available<00:02:16.829> in<00:02:16.950> STM<00:02:17.790> versions

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
these ones are available in STM versions

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.420 
these ones are available in STM versions
this<00:02:18.599> one<00:02:18.959> on<00:02:19.139> the<00:02:19.290> left<00:02:19.590> isn't<00:02:19.920> an<00:02:20.010> SDM

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
this one on the left isn't an SDM

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.399 
this one on the left isn't an SDM
version<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> had<00:02:21.389> used<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.719> SDM<00:02:22.079> version

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
version but I had used the SDM version

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.229 
version but I had used the SDM version
and<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.769> basically<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.400> exact<00:02:23.730> same<00:02:23.760> ones

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
and is basically the exact same ones

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.449 
and is basically the exact same ones
just<00:02:24.659> look<00:02:24.810> much<00:02:25.019> faster<00:02:25.499> and<00:02:25.680> smoother<00:02:26.159> auto

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
just look much faster and smoother auto

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.940 
just look much faster and smoother auto
focusing<00:02:26.999> now<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.569> have<00:02:27.749> to<00:02:27.930> say<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.290> Canon<00:02:28.650> 10

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
focusing now I have to say the Canon 10

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.379 
focusing now I have to say the Canon 10
to<00:02:29.099> 18<00:02:29.340> millimeter<00:02:29.639> lens<00:02:29.849> is<00:02:30.000> much<00:02:30.150> sharper

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
to 18 millimeter lens is much sharper

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.959 
to 18 millimeter lens is much sharper
than<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.959> kin<00:02:31.170> 18<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.859> 55<00:02:32.250> millimeter<00:02:32.730> ones

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
than the kin 18 to 55 millimeter ones

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.509 
than the kin 18 to 55 millimeter ones
now<00:02:33.359> most<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.930> already<00:02:34.170> have<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.650> kin<00:02:34.980> 18

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
now most of you already have the kin 18

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.009 
now most of you already have the kin 18
to<00:02:35.609> 55<00:02:36.000> millimeter<00:02:36.480> ones<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.930> are

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
to 55 millimeter ones and are

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.080 
to 55 millimeter ones and are
considering<00:02:37.439> buying<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.950> kin<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.430> 10<00:02:38.609> to<00:02:38.790> 18

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
considering buying the kin and 10 to 18

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.399 
considering buying the kin and 10 to 18
millimeter<00:02:39.419> ones<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.719> want<00:02:40.109> to<00:02:40.169> see<00:02:40.379> the

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
millimeter ones and want to see the

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.379 
millimeter ones and want to see the
differences<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.129> have<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.519> say<00:02:41.639> the<00:02:41.790> kin<00:02:41.999> 10<00:02:42.269> to

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
differences I have to say the kin 10 to

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.879 
differences I have to say the kin 10 to
18<00:02:42.659> millimeter<00:02:42.930> lens<00:02:43.139> is<00:02:43.260> much<00:02:43.469> better<00:02:43.620> ones

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
18 millimeter lens is much better ones

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.369 
18 millimeter lens is much better ones
and<00:02:44.069> then<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.489> Canon<00:02:44.849> 18<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.389> 55<00:02:45.810> millimeter

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
and then the Canon 18 to 55 millimeter

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.619 
and then the Canon 18 to 55 millimeter
lens<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.159> truly<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.609> amazing<00:02:48.239> how<00:02:48.419> much

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
lens and it truly is amazing how much

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.869 
lens and it truly is amazing how much
wider<00:02:48.870> 10<00:02:49.319> millimetres<00:02:49.769> is<00:02:49.980> than<00:02:50.400> 18

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
wider 10 millimetres is than 18

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.580 
wider 10 millimetres is than 18
millimeters<00:02:51.359> now<00:02:51.569> before<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.109> video<00:02:52.290> ends<00:02:52.500> I
