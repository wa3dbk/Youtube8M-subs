00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 even if the last game of the league 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.609
 west round no more impact on the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.890
 final table should have the round 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.019
 the huskies wanted to be clear 1 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.460
 to 5 defeat against frankfurt 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.380
 return your own ice cream 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.660
 However, all good tips were behind 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.029
 five minutes lapsed since the lions 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.250
 immediately came out of gas pedal and one 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.080
 Fast 2 0 leadership played out 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.820
 after one and a half minutes he moved with 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.250
 Kessen everywhere dry from the puck 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.439
 hit flat in the housing to the 1 0 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.269
 and used only four minutes later 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.669
 the hosts made a mistake in the construction of the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.399
 huskies from quickly countered like that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.640
 that patrick schmidt from a short distance 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.690
 problems that could mark us 2 0 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.790
 the sled dogs started to improve 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.920
 in the second third, however, they missed 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.600
 it to hit the jackpot 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.539
 instead, the lions acted again 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 ice cold in the 23 minutes of play left 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.140
 richard mueller semen glusanok on the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.449
 Right outside line stand and found 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.030
 christian wichert in the middle of the on 3 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.280
 0 increased a minute later brought 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.739
 Alex Angel outnumbered his men 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.140
 for the first time also the scoreboard in which he 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.330
 except distance the 3 1 marked 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.460
 a gate that gave even more backwind 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.040
 because shortly afterwards there were even several times 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.270
 the chance of the 3 2 though the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.950
 connecting hit in the air was 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.380
 then the puck fidgeted again 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.390
 the opposite side in the last need mostly one 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 gross error in the game structure of the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.869
 lions enabled with two players too 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
 boris ackers 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.250
 layegang conquered the puck and lies 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.979
 the one for clarke broadcross on the one 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.140
 27 minutes to the 4 1 met 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.270
 to catch up in the last third 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.990
 The huskies needed to realize that 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 fast goal 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.150
 and that here actually in the 41st 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.220
 play minute turned his Gretzinger 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.380
 Extraclass under proof left two 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.930
 against players stand and hit dry for 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.329
 4 2 the huskies kept with man 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.520
 mouse and boris ackers against it 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.149
 but six minutes later the 52 is not 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.840
 prevent 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.920
 Once again the lions could call it fast 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.630
 suddenly in the second attempt 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.850
 Now the preliminary decision was final 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.710
 Even if the huskies themselves 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.369
 again mythen the third hit 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.159
 achieve 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.659
 in the 56 minute minute it was again 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.080
 less the 6 2 endstand 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.050
 I made it clear in front of 6400 spectators 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.580
 think the first third of the sentence 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.319
 We did not come very hard 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.200
 has held against the passion 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.269
 We lacked emotion and we have the gates 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.760
 partly that passed on so easily 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.190
 own mistakes against top team must 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.360
 you just play and do not try 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.489
 in certain scenes provide a unique performance 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.799
 to prevail that chamber against 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.299
 eat or make enemies grefrath but 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.900
 just not heard top team and out 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.090
 He had been punished twice today 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.040
 it has some phases in front of me 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.959
 also heard where you already partially the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.450
 has done very well what I wanted 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.910
 and the measurement network try over 60 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.590
 minutes to play and then have to 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.049
 against gates are now also used to 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.670
 partially unfavorable time fallen 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.590
 always wander off equals 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.750
 then we say the next against us 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.629
 fallen that was unhappy and then 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.730
 just be awake and then I am 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.720
 Confident being frankfurt 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.720
 natural top team is
