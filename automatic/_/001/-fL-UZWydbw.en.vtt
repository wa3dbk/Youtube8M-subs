00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.349
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.990
 As promised , I will show you the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.449
 car is soon but for now 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.820
 I'll show you what I 'm doing because 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.880
 I was a little off also be the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.949
 business is the following is in the old car the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.660
 people changed cars right now 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:36.180
 I had this massive box and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.469
 payne sw 308 subwoofer including myself 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.750
 I think I'm going to sell they did not have 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.460
 interest in accepting that they risk 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.350
 here, but it only looked like that. 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.980
 a has no problem I'm 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 thinking of doing that, then I would stay 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.770
 box 96 and the bag obviously does not 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.750
 existed he was pushed to believe 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.100
 I only know that 400 is not better. 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.180
 the world but it does very well in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.219
 service 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 I'm not an audiophile of life then 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.000
 It turns out we changed cars 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.360
 the car a fox or is his suitcase is a 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.670
 rear glove compartment then I thought 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.920
 I wanted to kill him then if I had 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.430
 I wish I could not just use the box 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.560
 Then I designed to protect then 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.130
 I made the project of your child this project 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.400
 here to draw the box and I decided 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.400
 do it on your own are watching there is 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.000
 will a subwoofer come jl I do not know if 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.290
 You know, but it's a very good brand. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 It was not one of the best of course I 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.490
 uploaded the movie was the best of them but only 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.829
 to be theirs, I think it's a step then 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.290
 10-inch subwoofer this time I 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.119
 I already bought it has not arrived yet that the box 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.970
 that I did was so that she stayed 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.320
 in the bottom of the suitcase because flash was better 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.020
 way to do so that we 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.579
 suitcase had I made in like this 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.240
 box now show neither have a line 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.550
 only difference in the background then got 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.440
 Ie 91 cm wide to 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.100
 damn it 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.630
 and with 15 of height né is thus well 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.410
 this way it will stay in the bottom of the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.090
 mala 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.680
 the caxiense will not be all will be just the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.540
 show me you're more 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.710
 easy then this is a project that we are going to 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.830
 Speak now that I've done nothing for 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.760
 While it's in the box I made 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.420
 sorry mess in bed but do what 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.420
 it is 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.840
 so like I said I did it's like this I 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.940
 I just took that top part and 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.550
 yesterday 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:57.770
 the study comprises the wood already comes 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.710
 cut off when leaving 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:04.190
 How can you even see a tip to 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.910
 you if you're boring punch a hole 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.240
 larger so that the head screw 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.240
 out 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.790
 It's time you close the box and 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.590
 will not get any undesired relief 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:28.850
 Alright then the following is s 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:33.080
 the bottom of the suitcase literally normal in the 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:43.840
 The box to itself is just that, right? 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:43.840
 here he asks for 31 free then this 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.880
 product inside 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.959
 well then the box for 5 as I told you 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.730
 box in itself just this in here 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.650
 here could even use it to put the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.840
 my amplifier just how it goes 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.820
 be closed and I think at the right time 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.680
 It's going to get too hot and I do not want to. 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.600
 take this risk 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.120
 other things but at first not to vote 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.890
 nothing then will end up serving as 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.690
 background for you to pick up a suitcase 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.850
 literally on top as if it were a 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.470
 box only this size when it comes to putting 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.609
 in the car and put the bags on top not 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.299
 stay cool 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.840
 the following beauty line support bags 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.780
 to mdf wood 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.410
 of 15 even had not 20 that is the 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.199
 ideal 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.320
 to the end of 15 thousand as the office says 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.690
 and nothing will stay cool and is then 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.850
 also had no mdf group only had yes 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.850
 a chance here 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:48.740
 then said the theme of the box here 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:52.280
 it's just to stay with acoustics better this 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.520
 here I did I bought popular cola and it is 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.830
 may way is the powder that came out when I did 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.900
 this cut of stocking that cut of the duct 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.680
 It's so bloody good that he's here. 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.720
 still image 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.039
 I used to do it here so I gave you 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.050
 to stick a lot 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.280
 I mixed up the mother gives a 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.080
 legal consistency then I think the 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.039
 Your fault is going to get better 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:24.789
 and obviously you read Chávez's borders 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:27.530
 I 'll have a silicone and nervous with 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:32.539
 how to do this can be a 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:36.289
 silicone with hot glue with the head and 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:41.410
 I decided to do the way I thought 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.410
 more convenient is the duct 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:06:01.759
 the product is this guy there yes he goes 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.759
 stay 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.560
 right 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:14.260
 and that's the face of the closed box 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.900
 now it will be full of screws, right? 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.500
 Only I'm going to go, obviously. 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:25.510
 lining it will cover with carpet or with 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:28.120
 It's with the leather, I do not know. I'll find a way. 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.590
 here only made it because car back 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.240
 everything closed 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:36.300
 maybe I'll run now show the 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.300
 car and see there if you choose too
