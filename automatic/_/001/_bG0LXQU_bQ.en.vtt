is<00:02:04.050> terrible<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> lot<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.759> especially

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
is terrible for a lot of the especially

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.969 
is terrible for a lot of the especially
their<00:02:06.420> past<00:02:06.629> events<00:02:06.989> they<00:02:07.379> shut<00:02:07.709> down<00:02:07.739> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
their past events they shut down the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.910 
their past events they shut down the
Broncos<00:02:08.640> passing<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.989> front<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.679> was

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
Broncos passing the front for was

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.220 
Broncos passing the front for was
absolutely<00:02:11.580> tremendous<00:02:11.819> Vince<00:02:12.390> Wilfork<00:02:12.989> had

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
absolutely tremendous Vince Wilfork had

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.290 
absolutely tremendous Vince Wilfork had
a<00:02:13.260> monster<00:02:13.620> game<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.580> think<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.150> is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
a monster game and I think that that is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.729 
a monster game and I think that that is
something<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.930> carry<00:02:16.140> over<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.530> this

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
something that can carry over to this

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.130 
something that can carry over to this
game<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.220> really<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.879> and<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.450> Broncos<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.080> a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
game I really do and the Broncos have a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.559 
game I really do and the Broncos have a
solid<00:02:19.470> offensive<00:02:19.860> line<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.819> sort<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
solid offensive line and sort of the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.350 
solid offensive line and sort of the
page<00:02:21.780> are<00:02:22.019> sort<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.470> Ravens<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.670> they

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
page are sort of the Ravens but if they

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.000 
page are sort of the Ravens but if they
can<00:02:24.510> stop<00:02:24.720> one<00:02:24.930> solid<00:02:25.290> offensive<00:02:25.440> lie<00:02:25.800> think

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
can stop one solid offensive lie think

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.920 
can stop one solid offensive lie think
they<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.280> stop<00:02:26.400> another<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.000> know<00:02:27.300> ray<00:02:27.510> rice<00:02:27.750> is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
they can stop another I know ray rice is

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.900 
they can stop another I know ray rice is
a<00:02:27.960> better<00:02:28.260> running

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
a better running

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.470 
a better running
the<00:02:28.970> world's<00:02:29.300> McGahee<00:02:29.780> Willis<00:02:29.890> McGee<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:31.480> has

had a very good season and B you have to
also<00:02:34.340> account<00:02:34.850> for<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.120> fact<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.450> Tim<00:02:35.750> Tebow

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
also account for the fact that Tim Tebow

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.410 
also account for the fact that Tim Tebow
could<00:02:36.410> run<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.860> Tim<00:02:37.460> Tebow<00:02:37.850> putting<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.330> out

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
could run and Tim Tebow putting it out

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.880 
could run and Tim Tebow putting it out
of<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.570> pocket<00:02:39.050> last<00:02:39.230> week<00:02:39.530> with<00:02:39.710> this

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
of the pocket last week with this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.790 
of the pocket last week with this
Patriots<00:02:40.880> front<00:02:41.150> for<00:02:41.420> just<00:02:41.930> collapsing<00:02:42.650> on

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
Patriots front for just collapsing on

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.740 
Patriots front for just collapsing on
him<00:02:42.980> every<00:02:43.550> single<00:02:43.880> time<00:02:44.090> he<00:02:44.270> snapped<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
him every single time he snapped the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.250 
him every single time he snapped the
ball<00:02:45.490> offensively<00:02:46.490> we<00:02:47.090> saw<00:02:47.120> Tom<00:02:47.600> Brady<00:02:47.960> just

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
ball offensively we saw Tom Brady just

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.530 
ball offensively we saw Tom Brady just
light<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.530> up<00:02:48.740> as<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.220> said<00:02:49.550> last<00:02:49.580> week<00:02:49.910> if<00:02:50.180> he

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
light it up as I said last week if he

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.510 
light it up as I said last week if he
wanted<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.900> throw<00:02:51.200> for<00:02:51.410> nine<00:02:51.620> touchdowns<00:02:52.340> last

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
wanted to throw for nine touchdowns last

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.670 
wanted to throw for nine touchdowns last
week<00:02:52.850> he<00:02:53.270> could<00:02:53.510> have<00:02:53.630> done<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.990> the<00:02:54.200> Broncos

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
week he could have done and the Broncos

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.980 
week he could have done and the Broncos
had<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.860> damn<00:02:55.130> good<00:02:55.160> defense<00:02:56.000> last<00:02:56.270> week<00:02:56.600> or

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
had a damn good defense last week or

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.720 
had a damn good defense last week or
this<00:02:57.650> entire<00:02:58.070> season<00:02:58.460> and<00:03:00.400> really<00:03:01.400> i<00:03:01.610> think

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
this entire season and really i think

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.900 
this entire season and really i think
that<00:03:02.150> uh<00:03:02.410> Tom<00:03:03.410> Brady<00:03:03.710> just<00:03:04.010> shut<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.460> defense

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
that uh Tom Brady just shut that defense

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.390 
that uh Tom Brady just shut that defense
down<00:03:05.150> last<00:03:05.480> or<00:03:05.800> shut<00:03:06.800> them<00:03:06.980> now<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.130> guess

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
down last or shut them now I guess

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.400 
down last or shut them now I guess
that's<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.760> way<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:07.940> put<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.180> Tom<00:03:08.750> Brady<00:03:09.050> throws

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
that's a way to put it Tom Brady throws

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.890 
that's a way to put it Tom Brady throws
for<00:03:09.590> six<00:03:09.830> touchdowns<00:03:10.370> 400<00:03:11.210> yards<00:03:11.570> last<00:03:11.690> week

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
for six touchdowns 400 yards last week

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.840 
for six touchdowns 400 yards last week
the<00:03:12.500> Ravens<00:03:12.890> obviously<00:03:13.400> have<00:03:13.490> a<00:03:13.550> better

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
the Ravens obviously have a better

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.250 
the Ravens obviously have a better
defense<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:15.500> think<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.580> reason<00:03:17.260> well

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
defense and I think that the reason well

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.810 
defense and I think that the reason well
let<00:03:18.410> me<00:03:18.500> get<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:18.740> that<00:03:18.890> in<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.040> sec<00:03:19.250> let<00:03:19.790> me

or this season that I cannot predict

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.460

against<00:03:34.459> this<00:03:34.670> guy<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.150> think<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.200> things

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470

we've seen out of him this entire season

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.770 
we've seen out of him this entire season
have<00:03:39.590> shown<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:39.950> he<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.610> mean<00:03:41.060> he's<00:03:41.450> always

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
have shown that he I mean he's always

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.360 
have shown that he I mean he's always
been<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:41.959> tremendous<00:03:42.380> coach<00:03:42.560> but<00:03:42.920> last<00:03:43.100> year

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
they did not have a great game plan to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.170 
they did not have a great game plan to
beat<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.320> jets<00:03:45.680> defense<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.400> they<00:03:46.760> did<00:03:46.970> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.970 
beat that jets defense and they did the
Jets<00:03:47.450> do<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.780> Mark<00:03:48.020> Sanchez<00:03:48.500> who<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.770> worse

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
Jets do that Mark Sanchez who is worse

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.070 
Jets do that Mark Sanchez who is worse
than<00:03:49.190> Joe<00:03:49.370> Flacco<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:50.030> they<00:03:50.360> did<00:03:50.600> beat<00:03:50.840> them

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
than Joe Flacco and they did beat them

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.630 
than Joe Flacco and they did beat them
I'm<00:03:51.260> not<00:03:51.500> saying<00:03:51.709> Jill<00:03:51.950> flag<00:03:52.190> was<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.430> bad

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
I'm not saying Jill flag was a bad

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.040 
I'm not saying Jill flag was a bad
quarterback<00:03:53.320> but<00:03:54.320> they<00:03:55.040> did<00:03:55.310> beat<00:03:55.580> them<00:03:56.050> but

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
quarterback but they did beat them but

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.550 
quarterback but they did beat them but
last<00:03:57.920> year<00:03:58.220> was<00:03:58.400> all<00:03:58.610> past<00:03:58.910> past<00:03:59.300> past<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.989> just

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
last year was all past past past I just

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.550 
last year was all past past past I just
think<00:04:00.709> that<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:01.850> tight<00:04:02.180> ends<00:04:02.600> emerging

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
think that the tight ends emerging

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.199 
think that the tight ends emerging
Hernandez<00:04:04.040> has<00:04:04.160> been<00:04:04.370> good<00:04:04.640> but<00:04:04.820> he's<00:04:05.000> been

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
Hernandez has been good but he's been

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.900 
Hernandez has been good but he's been
better<00:04:05.420> this<00:04:05.720> year<00:04:05.780> Rob<00:04:06.590> Gronkowski<00:04:07.580> will

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
better this year Rob Gronkowski will

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.850 
better this year Rob Gronkowski will
finish<00:04:08.120> in<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.360> top<00:04:08.450> ten<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:09.080> MVP<00:04:09.590> voting

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
finish in the top ten and MVP voting

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.250 
finish in the top ten and MVP voting
this<00:04:10.160> year<00:04:10.220> i<00:04:10.670> think<00:04:11.510> that<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.750> emergence<00:04:12.170> of

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
this year i think that the emergence of

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.080 
this year i think that the emergence of
that<00:04:12.410> deion<00:04:12.739> branch<00:04:12.950> had<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.340> huge<00:04:13.640> catch<00:04:13.880> this

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
that deion branch had a huge catch this

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.790 
that deion branch had a huge catch this
week<00:04:14.330> I<00:04:14.480> just<00:04:14.780> think<00:04:14.959> it's<00:04:15.140> too<00:04:15.290> much<00:04:15.500> for<00:04:15.680> the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
week I just think it's too much for the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.740 
week I just think it's too much for the
Ravens<00:04:16.160> i<00:04:16.340> think<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:17.000> ravens<00:04:17.359> defense

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
Ravens i think that the ravens defense

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.800 
Ravens i think that the ravens defense
is<00:04:17.900> very<00:04:18.080> good<00:04:18.410> but<00:04:18.950> i<00:04:19.299> just<00:04:20.299> don't<00:04:20.450> think<00:04:20.600> that

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
is very good but i just don't think that

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.659 
is very good but i just don't think that
the<00:04:21.020> ravens<00:04:21.440> defense<00:04:21.830> is<00:04:21.980> good<00:04:22.160> enough<00:04:22.430> to

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
the ravens defense is good enough to

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.840 
the ravens defense is good enough to
hold<00:04:23.150> this<00:04:23.419> team<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:24.350> below<00:04:24.650> 21<00:04:25.160> points<00:04:25.730> which

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
hold this team to below 21 points which

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.400 
hold this team to below 21 points which
i<00:04:25.970> think<00:04:26.030> is<00:04:26.270> what<00:04:26.450> it's<00:04:26.570> going<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.750> take<00:04:26.810> to

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
i think is what it's going to take to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.400 
i think is what it's going to take to
win<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:27.770> game<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:29.570> don't<00:04:29.750> trust<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.200> Joe

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
win this game and I don't trust a Joe

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.260 
win this game and I don't trust a Joe

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
Flacco if they get in a shootout can

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.850 
Flacco if they get in a shootout can

only compete with Tom Brady and to be
honest<00:04:34.220> how<00:04:35.090> many<00:04:35.120> quarterbacks<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.990> NFL<00:04:36.410> can

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
honest how many quarterbacks the NFL can

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.430 
honest how many quarterbacks the NFL can
compete<00:04:36.890> with<00:04:36.950> Tom

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
narrow doctors and a shootout that's

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.630 
narrow doctors and a shootout that's
just<00:04:43.140> about<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.500> maybe<00:04:43.920> Matt<00:04:44.220> Stafford

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
just about it maybe Matt Stafford

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.430 
just about it maybe Matt Stafford
because<00:04:45.180> they<00:04:45.480> mean<00:04:45.630> that<00:04:45.660> line<00:04:45.990> Steve

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
because they mean that line Steve

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.830 
because they mean that line Steve
offense<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.190> just<00:04:47.460> an<00:04:47.610> incredible<00:04:48.390> passing

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
offense is just an incredible passing

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.050 
offense is just an incredible passing
attack<00:04:49.110> but<00:04:50.010> not<00:04:50.220> too<00:04:50.430> many<00:04:50.610> teams<00:04:50.820> are<00:04:50.940> going

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
attack but not too many teams are going

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.820 
attack but not too many teams are going
to<00:04:51.150> be<00:04:51.240> able<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.450> have<00:04:51.540> success<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.230> I<00:04:52.590> think

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
to be able to have success and I think

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.320 
to be able to have success and I think
if<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:53.040> get<00:04:53.220> down<00:04:53.460> you're<00:04:53.730> gonna<00:04:53.790> take<00:04:54.060> ray

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
if you get down you're gonna take ray

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.100 
if you get down you're gonna take ray
rice<00:04:54.630> out<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:54.930> this<00:04:55.140> game<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:57.060> me<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.480> think<00:04:58.020> that

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
rice out of this game to me I think that

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.380 
rice out of this game to me I think that
this<00:04:58.230> will<00:04:58.410> be<00:04:58.470> a<00:04:58.590> good<00:04:59.190> game<00:04:59.460> that<00:05:00.120> I<00:05:00.150> think

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
this will be a good game that I think

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.180 
this will be a good game that I think
that<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.660> 49ers<00:05:01.350> and<00:05:01.380> Giants<00:05:01.860> is<00:05:01.980> really

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
that the 49ers and Giants is really

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.170 
that the 49ers and Giants is really
going<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.370> be<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.550> game<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:02.850> you're<00:05:03.120> going

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
going to be the game that you're going

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.300 
going to be the game that you're going
to<00:05:03.330> look<00:05:03.480> at<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:03.930> say<00:05:04.290> that<00:05:04.530> was<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.710> Greek<00:05:05.100> II

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
to look at and say that was a Greek II

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.420 
to look at and say that was a Greek II
this<00:05:05.760> game<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.350> think<00:05:07.860> it'll<00:05:07.980> be<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.190> decent

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
this game and I think it'll be a decent

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.010 
this game and I think it'll be a decent
game<00:05:08.820> but<00:05:09.120> it's<00:05:09.330> not<00:05:09.540> going<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.750> be<00:05:09.810> anything

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
game but it's not going to be anything

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.860 
game but it's not going to be anything

bowl<00:05:22.050> I<00:05:22.580> think<00:05:23.580> that<00:05:23.700> that's<00:05:23.910> just<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.680> ruling

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.350 
bowl I think that that's just the ruling
with<00:05:25.830> their<00:05:26.010> heart<00:05:26.190> because<00:05:26.760> either<00:05:26.910> a<00:05:27.030> they

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
with their heart because either a they

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.970 
with their heart because either a they
don't<00:05:27.540> like<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.810> Patriots<00:05:28.350> or<00:05:28.470> be<00:05:28.620> they<00:05:28.770> want

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980

matchup and I did pick the 49ers to play

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.240

offense against what I think really

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.310 
offense against what I think really
right<00:06:02.160> now<00:06:02.400> is<00:06:02.669> the<00:06:03.000> best<00:06:03.240> defense<00:06:03.750> in<00:06:03.960> the<00:06:04.080> in

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
right now is the best defense in the in

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.680 
right now is the best defense in the in
our<00:06:05.250> left<00:06:05.550> in<00:06:05.669> the<00:06:05.730> playoffs<00:06:06.120> and<00:06:06.270> that<00:06:06.390> is<00:06:06.540> the

our left in the playoffs and that is the

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.020 
our left in the playoffs and that is the
49ers<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:07.350> Ravens<00:06:07.800> defense<00:06:08.220> is<00:06:08.370> great<00:06:08.640> but

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
49ers the Ravens defense is great but

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.060 
49ers the Ravens defense is great but

rolls<00:06:19.169> this<00:06:19.410> season<00:06:19.800> I<00:06:19.890> think<00:06:20.130> that<00:06:20.280> they're

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
rolls this season I think that they're

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.159 
rolls this season I think that they're
the<00:06:20.490> best<00:06:20.700> defense<00:06:21.090> left<00:06:21.390> and<00:06:21.630> I<00:06:21.690> think<00:06:21.960> Alex

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
the best defense left and I think Alex

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.320 
the best defense left and I think Alex
Smith<00:06:22.620> has<00:06:22.830> had<00:06:23.280> a<00:06:23.310> tremendous<00:06:23.520> season<00:06:24.030> and

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
Smith has had a tremendous season and

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.090 
Smith has had a tremendous season and
that<00:06:24.690> would<00:06:24.870> be<00:06:24.900> a<00:06:25.020> tremendous<00:06:25.260> matchup<00:06:25.740> to

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
that would be a tremendous matchup to

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.190 
that would be a tremendous matchup to
see<00:06:26.130> that<00:06:27.090> being<00:06:27.270> said<00:06:27.510> I<00:06:27.570> did<00:06:27.780> not<00:06:27.930> pick<00:06:28.169> that

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.960
