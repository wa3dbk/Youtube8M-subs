used and smartphone theft is rampant and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
used and smartphone theft is rampant and
it<00:00:45.840> accounts<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.260> about<00:00:46.410> half<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> crimes

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it accounts for about half of the crimes

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369 
it accounts for about half of the crimes
in<00:00:47.700> cities<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.120> San<00:00:48.450> Francisco<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.079> New<00:00:49.170> York

in cities like San Francisco in New York
City<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.879> something<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.420> lawmakers

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
City so it's something that lawmakers

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.900 
City so it's something that lawmakers
have<00:00:52.110> been<00:00:52.289> pressing<00:00:52.829> companies<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.520> Apple

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
have been pressing companies like Apple

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.209 
have been pressing companies like Apple
to<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.360> their<00:00:54.960> smartphones<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> line

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
to do their smartphones in the line

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819 
to do their smartphones in the line
share<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.670> those<00:00:56.879> thefts<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:58.109> Apple<00:00:58.590> devices

share of those thefts are Apple devices

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.740 
share of those thefts are Apple devices
they're<00:00:59.160> easy<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.670> identify<00:00:59.850> because<00:01:00.420> they

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
they're easy to identify because they

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.229 
they're easy to identify because they
tend<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.170> white<00:01:01.440> your<00:01:02.340> butt<00:01:02.520> riding<00:01:03.000> out

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.030 
tend to have white your butt riding out
there<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.260> what<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> name<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.830> this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
there so what is the name of this

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.580 
there so what is the name of this
exploit<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.729> how<00:01:05.909> does<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.150> work<00:01:06.409> sure<00:01:07.409> it's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
exploit and how does it work sure it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.280 
exploit and how does it work sure it's
called<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.010> dolci<00:01:08.880> which<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.330> ipod<00:01:09.780> backwards

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
called a dolci which is ipod backwards

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.550 
called a dolci which is ipod backwards
it's<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:11.280> pair<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.700> anonymous<00:01:12.150> hackers<00:01:12.560> that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it's this pair of anonymous hackers that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.980 
it's this pair of anonymous hackers that
put<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> website<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.360> week<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
put the website up for it this week and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.749 
put the website up for it this week and
they're<00:01:16.740> claiming<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.369> world's

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
first iCloud activation bypass and so

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.240 
first iCloud activation bypass and so
essentially<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.869> perform<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.650> man<00:01:23.100> in

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
essentially they perform in that man in

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.120 
essentially they perform in that man in
the<00:01:23.310> middle<00:01:23.520> attack<00:01:23.909> where<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.979> were

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the middle attack where when you were

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.969 
the middle attack where when you were
want<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.450> they<00:01:28.200> claimed<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.710> for

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
want to see for they claimed it's for

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.649 
want to see for they claimed it's for
people<00:01:29.159> who<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.790> lost<00:01:30.000> their<00:01:30.270> iPhones

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
people who have just lost their iPhones

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.410 
people who have just lost their iPhones
they're<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.590> claiming<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.189> support<00:01:32.640> theory

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
they're not claiming to support theory

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.410 
they're not claiming to support theory
but<00:01:33.659> obviously<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:36.000> something

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
but obviously this is what something

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.999 
but obviously this is what something
like<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.659> would<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:36.960> used<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.439> when<00:01:37.860> you're

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
like this would be used for when you're

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.999 
like this would be used for when you're
restoring<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.970> phone<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.960> trick<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.829> into

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
restoring the phone they trick it into

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.770 
restoring the phone they trick it into
thinking<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.790> talking<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.360> Apple

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
thinking that it's talking to Apple

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510 
thinking that it's talking to Apple
servers<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.409> being<00:01:43.560> activated<00:01:43.979> when<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> check

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
servers and being activated when a check

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.889 
servers and being activated when a check
when<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.850> actually<00:01:45.030> talking<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> theirs

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
when it's actually talking to theirs

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.410 
when it's actually talking to theirs
it's<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> relatively<00:01:47.250> easy<00:01:47.610> process<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it's a relatively easy process that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.149 
it's a relatively easy process that
really<00:01:48.659> only<00:01:48.750> requires<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.290> single<00:01:49.950> line<00:01:50.130> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
really only requires a single line of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.429 
really only requires a single line of
code<00:01:50.310> being<00:01:50.939> added<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> host<00:01:51.750> file<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.380> a

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
that have been a lot using this hack and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.119 
that have been a lot using this hack and
I<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.020> hard<00:02:07.229> time<00:02:07.350> believing<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.860> it's

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
I have a hard time believing that it's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.690 
I have a hard time believing that it's
about<00:02:08.520> all<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:09.390> personal<00:02:09.899> use<00:02:10.459> yeah<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
about all for personal use yeah it's a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.780 
about all for personal use yeah it's a
good<00:02:11.849> point<00:02:12.000> now<00:02:12.239> that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
good point now that

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.179 
good point now that
this<00:02:13.090> requires<00:02:13.659> actual<00:02:14.230> servers<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.129> are

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
this requires actual servers that are

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.309 
this requires actual servers that are
maintained<00:02:15.879> by<00:02:15.969> the<00:02:16.090> hackers<00:02:16.750> have<00:02:17.079> these

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
maintained by the hackers have these

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.809 
maintained by the hackers have these
servers<00:02:17.650> been<00:02:17.950> shut<00:02:18.219> down<00:02:18.250> they<00:02:18.430> still

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
servers been shut down they still

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.580 
servers been shut down they still
operating<00:02:19.269> no<00:02:19.840> they're<00:02:20.049> still<00:02:20.200> operational

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
operating no they're still operational

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.729 
operating no they're still operational
and<00:02:21.099> as<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.359> couple<00:02:22.390> days<00:02:22.959> ago<00:02:22.989> they<00:02:23.590> had

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
and as of a couple days ago they had

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.959 
and as of a couple days ago they had
seen<00:02:24.040> over<00:02:24.519> 30,000<00:02:25.950> unlocks<00:02:26.950> through<00:02:27.549> them<00:02:27.730> in

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
seen over 30,000 unlocks through them in

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.099 
seen over 30,000 unlocks through them in
just<00:02:28.209> one<00:02:28.359> day<00:02:28.859> and<00:02:29.859> I've<00:02:30.780> tried<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.930> contact

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
just one day and I've tried to contact

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.839 
just one day and I've tried to contact
apple<00:02:32.620> about<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.189> they're<00:02:33.310> not<00:02:33.430> issuing

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
apple about this and they're not issuing

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.030 
apple about this and they're not issuing
any<00:02:34.120> comments<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.629> it<00:02:34.810> yet<00:02:35.019> but<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.709> hackers

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
any comments on it yet but the hackers

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
any comments on it yet but the hackers
have<00:02:36.220> told<00:02:36.400> me<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.549> they've<00:02:36.790> been<00:02:36.939> in

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
have told me that they've been in

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.119 
have told me that they've been in
communication<00:02:37.239> with<00:02:37.810> Apple<00:02:38.170> but<00:02:38.349> I<00:02:38.560> don't

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
communication with Apple but I don't

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.520 
communication with Apple but I don't
think<00:02:39.250> anything's<00:02:39.609> come<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.909> that<00:02:39.939> yet<00:02:40.530> now

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
think anything's come of that yet now

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.199 
think anything's come of that yet now
you<00:02:41.590> mentioned<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.069> SIM<00:02:42.370> card<00:02:42.670> problem<00:02:43.090> at

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
you mentioned this SIM card problem at

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.449 
you mentioned this SIM card problem at
the<00:02:43.329> end<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.780> says<00:02:43.989> them<00:02:44.260> once<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.889> once<00:02:45.310> you

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
the end it says them once you once you

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.640 
the end it says them once you once you
use<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:46.030> exploit<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.900> sim<00:02:47.170> card<00:02:47.200> will<00:02:47.620> be

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
use this exploit the sim card will be

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.349 
use this exploit the sim card will be
recognized<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.489> could<00:02:48.639> never<00:02:48.819> use<00:02:48.909> it<00:02:49.090> as

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
recognized so you could never use it as

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.479 
recognized so you could never use it as
a<00:02:49.450> phone<00:02:49.689> again<00:02:49.989> essentially<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.069> becomes<00:02:51.129> an

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
a phone again essentially it becomes an

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.550 
a phone again essentially it becomes an
ipod<00:02:51.760> touch<00:02:51.970> right<00:02:52.599> right<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.260> that's

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
ipod touch right right and that's

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.780 
ipod touch right right and that's
actually<00:02:53.919> something<00:02:54.069> that<00:02:54.250> they're<00:02:54.519> saying

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
actually something that they're saying

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.190 
actually something that they're saying
they<00:02:54.970> have<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> workaround<00:02:55.540> for<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.079> they're

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
they have a workaround for and they're

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.470 
they have a workaround for and they're
going<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.379> introduce<00:02:56.620> soon<00:02:57.069> but<00:02:57.760> yeah<00:02:57.970> that

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
going to introduce soon but yeah that

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.379 
going to introduce soon but yeah that
issues<00:02:58.930> because<00:02:59.379> they<00:02:59.889> can<00:03:00.099> trick<00:03:00.370> iOS<00:03:01.090> and

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
issues because they can trick iOS and

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.759 
issues because they can trick iOS and
the<00:03:01.450> thing<00:03:01.629> that's<00:03:01.659> activated<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:02.620> they

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
the thing that's activated but they

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.379 
the thing that's activated but they
haven't<00:03:03.040> been<00:03:03.220> able<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.549> trick<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.909> baseband

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
haven't been able to trick the baseband

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.789 
haven't been able to trick the baseband
which<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.109> part<00:03:05.319> of<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.439> phone<00:03:05.620> we

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
which is the part of the phone we

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.470 
which is the part of the phone we
communicates<00:03:06.310> with<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.489> carrier<00:03:06.909> into

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
communicates with the carrier into

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.050 
communicates with the carrier into
thinking<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.019> it's<00:03:08.319> active<00:03:08.829> and<00:03:09.250> they're

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
thinking that it's active and they're

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.490 
thinking that it's active and they're
claiming<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.629> actually<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.959> fixed<00:03:11.319> for

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
claiming that actually the fixed for

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.839 
claiming that actually the fixed for
this<00:03:11.879> so<00:03:12.879> but<00:03:13.359> for<00:03:13.840> ipad<00:03:14.230> or<00:03:14.650> ipod<00:03:15.340> touches

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
this so but for ipad or ipod touches

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.599 
this so but for ipad or ipod touches
their<00:03:16.750> stolen<00:03:17.049> or<00:03:17.260> misplace<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.949> would<00:03:18.459> work

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
their stolen or misplace it would work

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.640 
their stolen or misplace it would work
like<00:03:19.000> normal<00:03:19.209> yeah<00:03:19.720> but<00:03:19.930> with<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.079> phone<00:03:20.409> yes

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
like normal yeah but with the phone yes

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.229 
like normal yeah but with the phone yes
you<00:03:20.829> still<00:03:20.889> have<00:03:21.069> that<00:03:21.220> sim<00:03:21.579> blocking<00:03:21.970> issue

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
you still have that sim blocking issue

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.960 
you still have that sim blocking issue
now<00:03:23.229> Alex<00:03:23.799> Heath<00:03:24.010> do<00:03:24.250> they<00:03:24.400> kind<00:03:24.699> of<00:03:24.790> have<00:03:24.940> a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
now Alex Heath do they kind of have a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.030 
now Alex Heath do they kind of have a
point<00:03:25.299> is<00:03:25.540> out<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:26.079> activation<00:03:26.620> amount<00:03:26.889> of<00:03:26.949> a

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
point is out is activation amount of a

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.949 
point is out is activation amount of a
problem<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.699> for<00:03:27.879> example<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.389> can<00:03:28.810> imagine

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
problem and for example you can imagine

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.890 
problem and for example you can imagine
the<00:03:29.229> scenario<00:03:29.560> where<00:03:30.010> somebody<00:03:30.459> has<00:03:30.780> an<00:03:31.780> all

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
the scenario where somebody has an all

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.180 
the scenario where somebody has an all
device<00:03:32.169> they<00:03:32.349> don't<00:03:32.530> remember<00:03:32.859> what<00:03:33.010> their

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
device they don't remember what their

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.039 
device they don't remember what their
password<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.120> or<00:03:34.329> something<00:03:34.540> like<00:03:34.629> that<00:03:34.690> and

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
password is or something like that and

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.839 
password is or something like that and
they<00:03:35.169> could<00:03:35.319> end<00:03:35.680> up<00:03:36.010> with<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.340> neck<00:03:36.519> being

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
they could end up with the neck being

locked out of their own device is this a

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.490 
locked out of their own device is this a
legitimate<00:03:39.819> problem<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.690> requires<00:03:40.720> some

legitimate problem that requires some

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.979 
legitimate problem that requires some

solution other than an exploit the two

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.449 
solution other than an exploit the two
is<00:03:44.349> this<00:03:44.470> something<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.799> Apple<00:03:45.220> should

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
is this something that Apple should

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.969 
is this something that Apple should
should<00:03:45.970> deal<00:03:46.150> with<00:03:46.180> better<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:47.500> know<00:03:47.650> I'm<00:03:47.949> not

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:47.979 
should deal with better you know I'm not

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.710 
should deal with better you know I'm not
really<00:03:48.159> sure<00:03:48.549> to<00:03:48.760> be<00:03:48.909> honest<00:03:49.269> I<00:03:49.389> tried<00:03:49.629> to

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
really sure to be honest I tried to

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.449 
really sure to be honest I tried to
think<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:50.019> scenarios<00:03:50.530> where<00:03:50.769> this<00:03:51.159> would<00:03:51.340> be

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
think of scenarios where this would be

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.330 
think of scenarios where this would be
useful<00:03:51.849> as<00:03:51.940> somebody<00:03:52.269> that's<00:03:52.449> just<00:03:52.540> genuinely

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
useful as somebody that's just genuinely

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.849 
useful as somebody that's just genuinely
lost<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.549> phone<00:03:54.849> or<00:03:55.439> misplaced<00:03:56.439> it<00:03:56.620> but<00:03:56.769> the

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
lost the phone or misplaced it but the

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.170 
lost the phone or misplaced it but the
thing<00:03:57.069> is<00:03:57.099> if<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.519> have<00:03:57.549> your<00:03:57.819> login

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
thing is if you have your login

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.509 
thing is if you have your login
information<00:03:58.449> you<00:03:58.900> can<00:03:59.079> access<00:03:59.590> where<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
information you can access where the

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.309 
information you can access where the
device<00:04:00.639> says<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.209> can<00:04:01.359> even<00:04:01.449> remotely<00:04:01.989> wipe

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
device says you can even remotely wipe

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.770 
device says you can even remotely wipe
it<00:04:02.560> from<00:04:02.709> iCloud<00:04:03.099> com<00:04:03.549> so<00:04:04.299> I<00:04:04.329> guess<00:04:04.449> in<00:04:04.689> the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
it from iCloud com so I guess in the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.000 
it from iCloud com so I guess in the
scenario<00:04:05.019> where<00:04:05.319> you've<00:04:05.439> forgotten<00:04:05.829> your

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
scenario where you've forgotten your

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.479 
scenario where you've forgotten your
Apple<00:04:06.340> ID<00:04:06.459> maybe<00:04:07.739> but<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:08.949> really<00:04:09.250> don't<00:04:09.430> see

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
Apple ID maybe but I really don't see

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.129 
Apple ID maybe but I really don't see
many<00:04:09.819> practical<00:04:10.239> applications<00:04:10.389> for<00:04:11.019> this

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
many practical applications for this

Mildred right I think the real issue

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.420 
Mildred right I think the real issue
here<00:05:05.420> is<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:06.260> know<00:05:06.380> this<00:05:06.710> was<00:05:06.950> apple's
