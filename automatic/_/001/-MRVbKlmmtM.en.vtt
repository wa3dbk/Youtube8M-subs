00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.709
 planet in which we play at least 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.450
 the moment then good gentlemen the 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.610
 first cofe is in the first 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.960
 mission at the beginning of the spot just follow 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.490
 your way right to this little 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.650
 construction that is like a kind of a 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.940
 little house is going to see then then and once 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.440
 that they enter their remains they will see some 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.500
 boxes and on top of these boxes will be 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.630
 the first chest the second chest is 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.070
 finds in the mission the spira of 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.570
 garden will come a part in which 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.030
 they have to hold an ambush by 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.350
 part of the cabal and once they arrive 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.850
 to this part where the door is 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.380
 closed and they have to get rid of all 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.610
 they have to get on these 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.100
 small pipes that are next 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.150
 left and get to reach the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.739
 pipes that are up right side 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.480
 then you just have to go through this 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.489
 little path floating and magically jumping 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.980
 and until the bottom the second one will be 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.149
 The third and fourth chest are 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.220
 find the city in the mission 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.320
 buried in the third of them 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.059
 find to the left of the spot they are going to 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.010
 get as small as a little cave 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.500
 tunnel I do not know how you can see it and before 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.510
 that they leave they will see that up in the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.590
 ceiling so to speak there is a there is a 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.880
 hole from which you 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.920
 so what they have to do is 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.240
 jump this hole crouch down to 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.890
 pass the fence that is in front of 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.509
 you and on your right in the corner goes 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.509
 to be the third chest 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.080
 then on this same mission they go to 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.940
 get to a place known as the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.830
 palace of dust and in this place 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.360
 will eventually come to a part 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.100
 below in the key as several 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.170
 offices with numbers have to look 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.670
 the office with the number 35 that is the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.200
 which is also here on screen and a 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.300
 Once they enter it 's like that office or 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.760
 fourth as you can see it behind the 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.650
 counter in the corner like all 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.950
 the other chests will be the fourth 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.950
 chest 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.130
 and finally the fifth chest is 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.080
 find the tide in the mission 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.340
 growing in this mission will come a 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.689
 moment when they are asked to destroy 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.130
 the doors you see are like these 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.299
 portals that you will find have 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.310
 that destroy several of them but one 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.570
 Once you find the first one go to your 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.060
 left and you will see a room in this 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.380
 fourth to the bottom to the left also 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.060
 is going to see how that kind of corridor behind 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.800
 from a grate and to the bottom of this 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.010
 place is going to be the fifth and last 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.780
 chest at least for now and good gentlemen 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.910
 he gave me a peculiar machine gun 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.200
 but you can really indicate I do not know by 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.850
 what kept bullets but that would be all 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.530

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.310
