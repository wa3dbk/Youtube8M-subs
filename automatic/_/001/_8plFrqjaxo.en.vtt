00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.690
 hello very good everyone there is a look 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.340
 for everything I am in a small 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:15.220
 line state tutorial with a character 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.230
 very much the truth very good that is 20 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:23.490
 and I bring you a little combo of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.220
 of great damage that unites the super movement 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.579
 8 for attack of 20 first of all 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.360
 we'll start the combo with a kick 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.500
 thunderous 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.110
 it would be this 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.620
 that I stamped it against the wall and what 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:44.620
 returns the second would be in the air 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.620
 this 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.090
 plus 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.879
 well now that we have that already controlled 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.860
 and we do not know it well enough we'll go to 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.950
 boxing toad that consists of having two 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.520
 times to the x repeatedly 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.520
 and there they are 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.870
 12 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.870
 well now we do the three movements 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.820
 and we've seen that in the air and as 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.140
 last move we have the attack 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.140
 special bein 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.630
 that I would take it and well I would do the super 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.450
 movement 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.450
 so let's go let's do it 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.760
 first 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.430
 well as you see we just did the 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:00.410
 Combo 11 hits 41% damage 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:04.020
 and good is a pretty pretty combo 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.390
 good and it does a lot of damage but not what 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.940
 enough how can we make it 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.360
 more harm then good using the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.600
 special ability of 20 that you see that is 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.450
 Green gets veins green 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.610
 this that makes every stroke that you must 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.440
 now a lot more damage I think it's a 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.150
 10% 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.180
 of damage more I'm not very sure but 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.010
 does a lot more damage so nothing 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.390
 we make the combo again the same but with 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.390
 super activated skill 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.250
 dance 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.660
 and this is still a combo of 11 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.660
 hits but now with 61% damage 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.060
 this current has been everything I hope 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.740
 that you liked has helped them and 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.740
 brings us closer until later
