00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 let's move on 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.549
 hello to guys and girls welcome a 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.100
 more time to granero dotcom today I bring you 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:20.000
 a video in which we are going to prepare 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.310
 for her a dinner to the theater some 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.310
 event that we have with basic 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.860
 and I consider as basic in the 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.670
 closet then consider a shirt 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.180
 white short-sleeved you're in chita a 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.180
 cowboy pants 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.090
 I'm going to use the cigarette but you 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.090
 use the one that suits you best 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.250
 body shape and on the feet a 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.740
 black heeled shoes so you do not 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.210
 use more the figure and in this case I'm going 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.190
 to use some stilettos because good 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.410
 because the opening in front uses me 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.540
 still more and it makes me a little bit more 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.730
 high a black coat 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.220
 for me it's a basic but if you do not have 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.950
 Any color that fits and almost 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.850
 with what you are going to put and a black bag 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.500
 also a necklace that looks not for 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.450
 how are we going to go so basic so 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.340
 simple, well, a necklace is 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.160
 liked repealed and if not then any 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.120
 necklace that gives you some joy 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.950
 to the look and for the basic makeup 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.400
 Well you are going to see them now because it has 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.230
 I recorded aggravated the look and nothing shall 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.790
 I leave you with the makeup 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.790
 pre base in the eye 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.320
 a neutral vanilla shadow for all 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.320
 eyelid mobile 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.039
 a brush to blur and we take a 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.009
 medium brown shadow with her we are going to 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.310
 mark what is the basin of our 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.310
 eye 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.870
 with a skewer with another skewer 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.450
 to take the clear shadow that we have 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.940
 applied at the beginning and we're going to mark 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.330
 the bone of the eyebrows 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.400
 and we retouched the initial shadow that we have 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.200
 applied then if with the dither 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.209
 has left us a little 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.209
 we draw a little bit our eyebrow 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.240
 and now what we are going to do is delineate 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.220
 our eye 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.410
 when we're going to start delineating the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.090
 internal part if you can stretch a 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.170
 little eye but when you do the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.170
 extreme never 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.990
 and 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.970
 i 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.810
 now we make up our eyelashes 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.900
 we put makeup base 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.270
 a little bit of concealer 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.930
 we apply a little bit of dust 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.099
 a very finite layer simply for 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.180
 seal the makeup I give a little 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.180
 in shape to the face 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.100
 and I'm going to give a little color to the 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.100
 cheek 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.780
 we give a little light to the face 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.219
 makeup ready 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.900
 Well, this is the makeup 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.720
 that I think it takes us out of any 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.760
 trouble is a basic among the basics of 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.200
 makeup and the only thing that you have to 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.230
 to do is to control the technique of 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.210
 delineated if you have questions or want to 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.310
 recorded a video of how to do the 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.920
 delineated and others you put it here 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.890
 down in comments that I will 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.100
 Many people ask me but I do not know if yes 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.950
 there's really a go you want that 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.050

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.720
 free oysters put me if you want me to upload 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.790
 a video with tips or how I have 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.890
 learned to do the delineation and I 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.170
 I will do nothing I hope you liked the 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:05.890
 Real video that go smart and pretty 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:07.450
 it does not consist in bringing the maximum of 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.790
 the most simply you can see that with 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.009
 a white shirt a cowboy and a 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.889
 high heel shoe 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:17.110
 you have it ready that yes it is accessory a 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:20.710
 little so that it is not so simple 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.300
 look I hope you liked the light 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.069

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.349
