skills I have 99 in I do plan on making
these<00:02:00.540> guides<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:02.159> don't<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
these guides but I just don't have the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.510 
these guides but I just don't have the
time<00:02:02.579> right<00:02:02.820> now<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.799> do<00:02:04.799> expect<00:02:04.950> those

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
time right now but do expect those

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.249 
time right now but do expect those
guides<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> future<00:02:06.509> because<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.899> a

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
guides in the future because I know a

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.729 
guides in the future because I know a
lot<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.310> scalars<00:02:08.789> are<00:02:09.289> like<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.470> know<00:02:10.590> how

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
lot of you scalars are like to know how

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.590 
lot of you scalars are like to know how
to<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:11.099> these<00:02:11.360> 99s<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.510> how<00:02:12.810> how

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
to get these 99s and how how

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.020 
to get these 99s and how how
I got<00:02:13.780> them<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.350> i<00:02:14.620> will<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.490> making<00:02:15.610> guides

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
I got them so i will be making guides

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.390 
I got them so i will be making guides
just<00:02:16.390> don't<00:02:16.660> worry<00:02:16.890> they'll<00:02:17.890> be<00:02:18.040> up<00:02:18.190> sometime

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
just don't worry they'll be up sometime

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.860 
just don't worry they'll be up sometime
soon<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.660> year<00:02:20.050> also<00:02:20.350> oh<00:02:20.740> yeah<00:02:21.040> forgot

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
soon and the year also oh yeah forgot

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.130 
soon and the year also oh yeah forgot
2012<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.200> what<00:02:23.710> you<00:02:23.800> can<00:02:23.920> expect<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:25.140> better

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
2012 so what you can expect is better

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.080 
2012 so what you can expect is better
videos<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.560> guess<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.640> try<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.880> get<00:02:28.030> a

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
videos I guess and you try to get a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.690 
videos I guess and you try to get a
better<00:02:28.210> recording<00:02:28.810> program<00:02:29.170> because<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.470> know

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
better recording program because I know

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.940 
better recording program because I know
this<00:02:30.700> one<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.420> kind<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.380> little<00:02:32.680> hazy
