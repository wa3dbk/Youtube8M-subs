00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello friends swami channel claus 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.430
 games we all love superheroes someone 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.020
 less someone more no difference 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.240
 to everybody and you dreamed in childhood 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.280
 become them and someone still dreams of becoming 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.870
 batman or spider maine and in 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.030
 Today's video, I'll tell you what 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.369
 games convey the feeling that you are super 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.990
 hero well let's get on in fifth place 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.670
 then the game from which nothing good is not 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.140
 waited the game was on the film we all 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 well know what they end up 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.119
 turn out but this game was able to surprise and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.219
 you guessed it wolverine 2009 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.110
 years the game is a slasher with 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.550
 a lot of meat and blood ssu excellent combat 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.469
 action scenes systems 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.570
 Also in the game there are excellent bosses 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.550
 which is really hard to kill and figured out 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.410
 stabbing to the limit in general game 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.239
 turned out great and she is rightfully 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.640
 opens our today's top and we 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.140
 go to fourth place 4 corner 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.239
 our top must play every 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.559
 superhero lover and especially company 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.809
 dc injustice 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.100
 the game is a boot from the developers 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.780
 mortal kombat only with all 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.300
 superheroes dc universe 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.070
 the game turned out just great mechanics 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.960
 quite different from that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.760
 I have no mortal kombat 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.380
 fatalities or babality but there is 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.450
 interaction with the outside world 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.340
 you can break the pool and the water strong 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.409
 pressure can spill on the enemy 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.509
 pick up objects located near and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.310
 bring down the enemy to them and such like that 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.710
 greatly diversify the gameplay 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.270
 the gameplay itself is different for all the characters 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.250
 apart that's huge 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.650
 The advantage of the game and this is not found in 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.240
 all fighting games but the word game turned out 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.240
 great and we move to third place 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.080
 the third game takes first 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.300
 individualities but i'm at least not 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.280
 I remember where in one game there were four at once 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.870
 the main characters and even more so in 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.880
 different realities you guessed it 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.190
 this is spiderman satar dms 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.320
 as I said in the game of tehran 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.820
 spider-man from different realities and 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.490
 they differ from each other just 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.460
 dramatically I even list them to you 1 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.880
 ordinary spider man 2 ultimate dash 3 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.020
 spider 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.010
 from the future and the most unusual 4 noir y 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.080
 The first three gameplay is not much 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.910
 different solid bit and action 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.190
 noir is stealth and enough 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.080
 good and thoughtful plot in the game 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.670
 intertwined with all four characters and 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.650
 in the end ends enough 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.720
 mysterious and rightfully occupied game 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.140
 third place in the top what come to 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.640
 second place second place us 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.980
 meets the patron there and just 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.170
 batman good man batman 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.010
 arkham city game just turned over 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.870
 concepts about and 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.910
 superhero games we are used to 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.860
 that these games are aimed more at 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.440
 children's audience and not how to 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.750
 were not serious and but the first batman 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.790
 have aham assalam made a breakthrough and 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.560
 proved that the game about superheroes can 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.870
 be serious gloomy out great 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.880
 gameplay and plot continuation of the first 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.440
 games arkham city I'll be all in 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.570
 several times in this game was all 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.549
 perfectly balanced thought out a 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.610
 former system gave a lesson to all subsequent 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.570
 exam of this type but not a bit 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.570
 had enough up the pen instead 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.580
 maybe many will agree with me so 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.740
 how this game moves away from the rest of the rut 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.730
 games of this top but still i think she 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.850
 worth it 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.100
 and this they share the mass of the end yes yes and the verge 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.840
 from the main studios releasing comics 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.570
 films and cartoons about superheroes 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.970
 i mean marvel and dc but it is worthy 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.980
 This is the end of the third game in the series. 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.959
 in flames telling us the story where 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.700
 people started randomly getting 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.560
 super powers someone use them for evil 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.720
 someone in good and the main character should 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.660
 choose whom he should become a super hero or 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.610
 the villain in the game was a great system with 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.100
 a bunch of a variety of super powers such 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.140
 like possessions of fire ion carlin and 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.720
 gaming power and advancing in 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.459
 the plot we will open them all and which 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.830
 actions we will do on promotion 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.600
 such abilities and we appear if 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.730
 we will destroy and destroy everything 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.980
 kill people and choose evil options 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.150
 then at the sight of us, people on the streets will 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.220
 run away side 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.670
 and our superpowers are acquired 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.050
 evil character and vice versa all ends 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.459
 there is a big open world in 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.620
 our full possession with 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.570
 additional missions and intelligence 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.730
 checkpoints opponents that can 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.830
 destroy to the ground and also in the game 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.600
 there is a very well-developed plot for 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.790
 which is really interesting to watch and 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.630
 sometimes he is very impressive with his 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.880
 unpredictability 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.859
 so how not to say about the graphics she 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.510
 here is just fantastic in the game 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.669
 just great implement and facial expressions 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.160
 such characters we have not seen yet 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.260
 Only if you are Lenoir, it is not near 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.419
 worth and special effects in the game looks 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.700
 just awesome you can watch them 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.590
 infinitely, I do not represent what 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.340
 the effort cost the developers to do 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.960
 this job 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.970
 is that the console on the initial 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.410
 development produces such a picture says 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.990
 us about what's next will only get better 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.880
 and more beautiful and as for me all ends 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.050
 deserve the title of the best game he 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.700
