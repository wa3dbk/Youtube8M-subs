00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:22.320
 Hello, I'm Ivan Evdokimov 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.300
 expert journal 4 on 4 club today i 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.950
 tell you how to use on 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.980
 off road vehicles with box 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.980
 machine 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.480
 do you know what horse cross 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.610
 much higher than the car but we 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.150
 they prefer to ride on machines 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.309
 riding horses 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.150
 yes and how many of you know how to manage 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.270
 ungulates 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.860
 also with a manual transmission 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.320
 this rudiment of the middle of the last century 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.110
 can sometimes do much more than 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.090
 machine for example allows you to pull out 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.940
 the car is slippery with us 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.560
 swinging and yes on the road sometimes gives 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.110
 much more features 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.120
 on the other hand a modern car 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.160
 can easily do without virtuoso 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.180
 pilot skills 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.000
 compensating for the lack thereof 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.280
 electronic payment systems such 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.770
 both with and without traction control 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.140
 latest generations stabilize and 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.300
 assistance during the descent from the mountain and many 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.220
 SUVs are also equipped with electronic 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.860
 they Tatars interlocks 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.720
 what's stopping lovers mechanics last 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.790
 material connections with your car 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.560
 so every year advantage 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.380
 manual gear boxes 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.900
 disappear like smoke the eternal dispute that 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.600
 better mechanics or machine in the city 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.580
 long ago decided in favor of the machine however 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 so as not to ruin the machine on the roads 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.890
 need to remember some commandments 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.500
 the first thing us remember is oil in 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.810
 automatic box is very specific 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.150
 and radically different under properties 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.490
 from oil for mechanics unlike 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.650
 ordinary boxes she not only lubricates 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.140
 details but also is a working body 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.720
 transmitting torque and including 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.800
 pressure transmission so that the automatic 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.850
 worked without hitches 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.860
 it is desirable to warm it up at least a little 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.680
 10 seconds are enough to warm up in the summer 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.020
 and in the winter, a minute of hard frost 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.239
 motor after parking wait a little longer 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.580
 a couple of minutes when your trip 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.380
 starts on smooth asphalt can 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.870
 move and on a warm motor with 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.250
 a box but if the first ice meters 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.160
 you are driving off-road 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.959
 need to be fully prepared here 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.209
 smooth and precise guarantee of box 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.160
 warm up the motor at the same time 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.110
 properly and never turn 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.620
 reverse gear while the car is rolling 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.640
 forward 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.640
 exactly the opposite 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.390
 off-road main rule driving 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.730
 off road on the machine is 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.209
 what to slip on top gears to him 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.450
 can't 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.940
 the box just doesn't understand what you are books 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.800
 leave and stand still and continue 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.910
 shift gears up to as if you 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.930
 rushing on asphalt 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.550
 sharp jerks while killing machine 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.830
 so always use the first or 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.440
 second gear all modern cars 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.330
 allow it to do if the car 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.519
 yours is equipped with a downshift in 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.540
 transfer case be sure to turn on 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.049
 her and the lowest gear in the automatic transmission 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.239
 allows to some extent 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.519
 implement and engine braking 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.630
 This is especially useful on steep descents and 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.630
 slippery surfaces 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.540
 is it possible to ride a brow with an automatic 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.640
 a box is possible but after overcoming 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.440
 water barrier even if it's just 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.930
 deep puddle always follows 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.010
 stop open the hood and check 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.990
 oil transparency on the dipstick and CAT 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.690
 if on the dipstick dull emulsions and therefore 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.130
 water has penetrated into the transmission is 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.230
 oil needs urgent replacement 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.900
 if it works out on the spot 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.420
 very good if not include the most 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.910
 low gear in the box and slowly 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.959
 do not slowly gas and get out 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.060
 nearest asphalt 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.770
 there is a tow truck or in tow 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.770
 go for an oil change service 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.850
 how to sharpen tug car 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.230
 automatic transmission 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.030
 if the machine is equipped with a dispenser 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.160
 which is neutral 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.810
 position you can just car how 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.270
 take a long time in tow 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.630
 put a neutral in the transfer case 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.700
 machine standing parking and forth worse 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.220
 if there is no such option then we put 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.740
 neutral in the box and pull slowly 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.110
 at a speed not higher than 50 kilometers per hour 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.970
 a distance of no more than 30 and 50 kilometers 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.200
 and better to the nearest asphalt where 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.880
 just ship the tow truck if on 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.440
 share your SUV regularly 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.900
 Riding on heavy falls 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.940
 off road with slipping them stuck 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.400
 then note that the oil is repeatedly 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.590
 heated to the limits inside the box is very 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.990
 is aging intensively loses its properties 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.630
 and contributes to extremely fast wear 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.480
 recipe boxes too serious load 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.190
 for the box so after serious 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.470
 works using automatic 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.170
 boxes of oil can acquire 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.300
 brown hue and a burning smell like that 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.730
 then said she just burnt oil 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.070
 intensively saturated with wear particles 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.630
 friction and these particles are actually 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.840
 really burn giving oil 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.640
 characteristic smell and color 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.600
 obviously what is oil with 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.040
 filter need to change as soon as possible 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.950
 if you occasionally leave on the mouth 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.270
 just pay attention to the oil and 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.950
 use only recommended brands 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.950
 never tighten with his change 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.190
 so the basic rules always warm up 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.720
 box in the bitter cold 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.090
 never let the car slip on 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.699
 top gears include first or 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.720
 second if your maxim car is needed 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.030
 haul in tow 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.449
 then turn on the neutral in the dispenser 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.669
 boxes and parking box automatic 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.039
 if there is no neutral in the transfer case 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.560
 the boxes she turn on the neutral in the box 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:13.979
 machine and drag slowly for short 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.199
 distance besides don't forget if 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.000
 you drag someone in tow include 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.070
 downshift in transfer 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.560
 boxes and lowest gear in 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.020
 I let the machine cool down 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.060
 sure and follow up and timely 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.060
 oil do not forget to change it in time
