00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.290
 light when they give us light blows 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.660
 we do this at the same time 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.080
 press them at the same time we will see 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.080

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.140
 all the deep ones 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.780
 and well, we only have to practice 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.909
 It is how to know when this being how 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.410
 know what blows they are giving us for 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.060
 being able to make them as breakers is coming 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.119
 being hit hard he has to do it 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.460
 as breaker of the strong blow half test 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.960
 what to do as middle breaker and hit 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.709
 light tease that is the light hit 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.180
 hit as light breaker and good the 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.300
 remember that the blow this one 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.940
 strong comes r &amp; b 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.150
 and rt that are the ones above are the wheat 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.220
 and the bumper then this to do the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.140
 medium has to be and you see that they are the 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.670
 medium hits and to make light has 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.980
 to be X and we only have left 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.690
 practice knowing what hit us 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.850
 giving to be able to make the combo breaker 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.280
 because if they give you light blows and that is 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.260
 you see the light riki combo and so whack 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.910
 media are like bric in the middle if 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.450

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.010
 a strong and good clicker combo that has 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.020
 been still only remains to practice 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.530
 to get it right in the fight and 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.660
