00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.949 
know things like that people don't know
what<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.640> don't<00:02:23.880> make<00:02:24.090> people<00:02:24.269> love<00:02:24.690> that

what it is don't make people love that

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.020 
what it is don't make people love that
shape<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.769> of<00:02:25.920> course<00:02:26.099> it's<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.430> distinctive

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
shape and of course it's so distinctive

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.000 
shape and of course it's so distinctive
the<00:02:27.150> shape<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:28.049> what<00:02:28.230> we've<00:02:28.410> been<00:02:28.530> able<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.890> do

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the shape but what we've been able to do

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.339 
the shape but what we've been able to do
is<00:02:29.130> register<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.670> as<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.790> trademark<00:02:30.120> now<00:02:30.750> you

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
be honest you'd be very hard pushed to

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.240 
be honest you'd be very hard pushed to
know<00:02:41.700> with<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> qui<00:02:42.269> tam<00:02:42.299> why<00:02:42.690> body<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.680> of

know with a qui tam why body and of

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.099 
know with a qui tam why body and of
course<00:02:44.459> what<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.970> trademark<00:02:45.390> office<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.870> they

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
course what the trademark office is they

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.199 
course what the trademark office is they
want<00:02:46.320> distinctiveness<00:02:46.920> yes<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.910> Morgan

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
want distinctiveness yes and the Morgan

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.360 
want distinctiveness yes and the Morgan
is<00:02:48.329> distinctive<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.859> be<00:02:49.980> honest<00:02:50.190> that

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
is distinctive so to be honest that

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.880 
is distinctive so to be honest that
shape<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.180> it's<00:02:51.329> if<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:51.989> its<00:02:52.170> pull<00:02:52.470> over

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
shape and it's if you like its pull over

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.039 
shape and it's if you like its pull over
the<00:02:52.980> engineering<00:02:53.609> so<00:02:53.910> it's<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.450> minimalist

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
the engineering so it's the minimalist

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.870 
the engineering so it's the minimalist
car<00:02:55.380> sure<00:02:56.040> but<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.400> still<00:02:56.640> very

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
car sure but it's still very

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.190 
car sure but it's still very
attractively<00:02:57.600> particularly<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.170> young

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
attractively particularly to young

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.410 
attractively particularly to young
people<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.519> think<00:02:59.640> there's<00:03:00.090> always

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
people and so I think there's always

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.199 
people and so I think there's always
going<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.630> be<00:03:00.690> room<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:02.010> classic<00:03:02.640> Morgan

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
going to be room for that classic Morgan

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.020 
going to be room for that classic Morgan
car<00:03:03.690> now<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.410> course<00:03:04.829> it<00:03:05.459> has<00:03:05.609> to<00:03:05.730> be<00:03:05.790> relevant

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
car now of course it has to be relevant

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.449 
car now of course it has to be relevant
sure<00:03:06.690> because<00:03:07.139> nobody<00:03:07.560> wants<00:03:07.859> to<00:03:07.980> own<00:03:08.100> an<00:03:08.310> old

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
sure because nobody wants to own an old

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.960 
sure because nobody wants to own an old
thing

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
thing

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.170 
thing

electric yet version here as well plans
for<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.630> future<00:03:49.050> because<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.650> electric<00:03:50.100> idea

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
for the future because the electric idea
