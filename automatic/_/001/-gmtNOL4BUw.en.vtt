facility<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:47.969> try<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> prove<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.289> allow<00:00:49.530> the

where<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> pilot<00:00:51.870> plant<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> lot<00:00:54.480> of

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
where the pilot plant so we see a lot of

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.299 
where the pilot plant so we see a lot of
the<00:00:54.719> stuff<00:00:54.930> before<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> assembly<00:00:55.890> plants<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the stuff before the assembly plants to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
the stuff before the assembly plants to
see<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.940> we'll<00:00:57.030> make<00:00:57.180> sure<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> works<00:00:57.600> here

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
see it so we'll make sure it works here

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.020 
see it so we'll make sure it works here
first<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.530> measured<00:00:58.739> two<00:00:59.520> things<00:00:59.820> primarily

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
first we measured two things primarily

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.410 
first we measured two things primarily
margin<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.899> flush<00:01:01.170> will<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.559> our<00:01:01.770> our<00:01:02.280> fit<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
margin and flush will be our our fit and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.990 
margin and flush will be our our fit and
our<00:01:03.629> gaps<00:01:03.870> between<00:01:04.710> closure<00:01:05.189> panels<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
our gaps between closure panels and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.060 
our gaps between closure panels and
that's<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.390> customer<00:01:06.869> sees<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.770> down<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that's what customer sees going down the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.240 
that's what customer sees going down the
road<00:01:08.220> used<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.659> manual<00:01:10.380> check<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
road used to be a manual check and it

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.820 
road used to be a manual check and it
grew<00:01:11.520> into<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:12.140> mechanical<00:01:13.140> mechanism<00:01:13.290> now

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
grew into a mechanical mechanism now

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.800 
grew into a mechanical mechanism now
we're<00:01:14.010> using<00:01:14.159> hand-held<00:01:14.580> lasers<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
we're using hand-held lasers the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
we're using hand-held lasers the
handheld<00:01:16.170> lasers<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.159> lot<00:01:17.340> more

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
handheld lasers are a lot more

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.660 
handheld lasers are a lot more
repeatable<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.240> lot<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:19.080> accurate<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.220> we're

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
repeatable a lot more accurate so we're

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.850 
repeatable a lot more accurate so we're
getting<00:01:20.759> good<00:01:21.060> data<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:21.540> good<00:01:21.750> decisions

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
getting good data to make good decisions

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.840 
getting good data to make good decisions
second<00:01:22.860> thing<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.220> measure<00:01:23.400> over<00:01:23.670> here

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
second thing that we measure over here

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.420 
second thing that we measure over here
are<00:01:23.939> seal<00:01:24.299> gaps<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> door<00:01:25.950> interface

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
are seal gaps which is a door interface

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.999 
are seal gaps which is a door interface
to<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.909> seal<00:01:27.210> flange<00:01:27.590> that's<00:01:28.590> important

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to the seal flange that's important

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.410 
to the seal flange that's important
because<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.220> directly<00:01:29.700> affects<00:01:30.119> door

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
because that directly affects door

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.770 
because that directly affects door
uproots<00:01:30.810> wind<00:01:31.409> noise<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:33.000> water<00:01:33.240> leaks<00:01:33.509> which

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
uproots wind noise and water leaks which

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.380 
uproots wind noise and water leaks which
are<00:01:33.930> all<00:01:34.049> potential<00:01:34.680> customer<00:01:35.220> concerns<00:01:35.400> we

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
are all potential customer concerns we

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.990 
are all potential customer concerns we
used<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> use<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> clay<00:01:37.409> which<00:01:37.950> basically<00:01:38.280> put

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
used to use a clay which basically put

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.280 
used to use a clay which basically put
clay<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.390> between<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> door<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> seal
