00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.750
 did you see that the Australian police are 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.110
 using a weapon a weapon not the scanner 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.420
 3d as a weapon against the bad guys service 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.670
 expensive then the next year has the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.130
 device that actually generates images of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.810
 3d maps any environment he can 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.109
 do it in 20 minutes 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.070
 there monitoring and scanning the environment 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.039
 is being used by the police 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 and criminal investigations and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.660
 all there 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.520
 in relation to the part of the crime scene 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.760
 then using the data collected they 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.540
 can quickly recreate the scene from the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.610
 crime 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.170
 your computers then imagine more 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.239
 or less the following one person only 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 can control this business this 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.750
 device and scanner back and forth supported 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.520
 on a ball but keeping the whole environment 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.920
 continuously while the computer is 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.879
 records the data collected by the census 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.800
 according to the company an advantage 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.090
 of this device in relation to its 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.920
 competitors some other province 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.899
 were made in this direction is that it 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.080
 can map stairs and other 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.600
 environments difficult to scan and the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.090
 with rugged relief also that the price 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.979
 of him that is played only 40 thousand 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.000
 dollars but it's logical that it goes full 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.159
 to your house right? 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.140
 it's 40 thousand dollars the police I think 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.909
 it is quite feasible this company already thinks about 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.820
 future future but perhaps the most 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.040
 beautiful still use these cane in areas of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.909
 emergency and also in non-mining 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.100
 know him all that was dug to give 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.159
 to protect the miners and also 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.680
 are already developing a version 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.500
 flying this equipment to legal people 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.329
 we are still far from there mapping the whole 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.689
 area always gives even one person only 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.399
 he with helicopters and four propellers 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.479
 making this monitoring pretty cool 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.250
 very cool when we see that 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.439
 some things that were used in games 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.439
 They are coming in real life.
