tried it but I think it probably

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.030 
tried it but I think it probably
regenerates<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.900> health<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.410> you<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.740> like

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
regenerates it health if you are like

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640 
regenerates it health if you are like
low<00:01:38.310> health<00:01:38.550> because<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:40.080> it<00:01:40.410> seems

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
low health because that's all it seems

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.969 
low health because that's all it seems
to<00:01:40.800> do<00:01:41.010> like<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.350> don't<00:01:43.830> actually
