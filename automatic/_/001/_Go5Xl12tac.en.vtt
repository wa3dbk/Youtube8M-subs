00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.319
 you have been very many to me 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:08.110
 ask for another method to use 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:11.350
 thumb serum for hair 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:13.360
 so another way of proceeding like 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.500
 for the other technique you need 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:21.300
 of a nice fresh onions cut the 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.300
 ends then remove the skin 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.739
 then cut out their pieces and 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.730
 do not forget to remove the greenest 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.730
 if there has 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.379
 good 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.229
 now switch everything to the mixer for 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.229
 get small pieces 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.500
 for the next step 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.460
 you will need an old stocking or a 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.740
 very fine fabric and without slipping too much 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.400
 your flacco applicators a little 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.250
 funnel 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.460
 you can also use a simple 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.630
 voice or a small bottle 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.630
 cover everything with the bottom 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.970
 it is enough now to pay 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.990
 pieces of onions in the bottom and 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.990
 well pressed all 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:18.840
 and here you are 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.970
 apply the juice on your roots and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.580
 leave about fifteen minutes 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.620
 as a reminder this care is to be done on 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.550
 dirty hair at the rate of once a 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.550
 week at least
