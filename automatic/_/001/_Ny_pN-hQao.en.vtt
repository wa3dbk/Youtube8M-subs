 find the horticulture nursery project 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.360

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.180
 the university and the private company 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.710
 where they bet on national production 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.840
 8 years ago they decided to diversify 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.700
 since then they started production 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.980
 of vegetables under an organic concept 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.980

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.090

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.070
 this project has been very successful and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.720
 the demand increased in such a way that it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.710
 have seen the need to evaluate open 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.710
 one more day a week 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.570
 all harvested in their facilities and 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.820
 people bet this project for 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.739
 its freshness the nursery has a slogan 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.800
 in which he ensures that his products are 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.800
 0km of cutting for the house 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.560
 customers have been grateful 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.600
 and I applaud this initiative of 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.950
 national production all agree that 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.230
 this is what the country needs to 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.130
 get ahead you need to invest and 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.130
 believe in venezuela 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 we talk to one of your partners and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.439
 founders Mrs. Mariana Martinez 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.330
 who told us how this was born 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.040
 private initiative the benefits that 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.820
 brings and the variety of products that 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.200
 offers 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.200
 well we were born in year 6 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.610
 and from that beginning we started with 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.270
 ornamental plants in the year 99 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.240
 we started working as a local 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.979
 basically with apple-tree tomato and 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.979
 full standard 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.239
 in the market and starting in the middle of 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.540
 last year we started to diversify the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.819
 production planting lettuce 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.700
 different types to the idea of 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.489
 diversify was to offer something other than 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.680
 what was in the market if you go to 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.959
 market sees only tomato pear and 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.880
 apple tomato if you go to the automercado that 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.489
 my attempt sounds at the moment in block 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.280
 or Lamuyo pepper and the truth is that 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.590
 diversity and cee the flavors and 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.500
 textures of these of these products 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.400
 new ones that are very differentiated to 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.840
 that you normally get 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.700
 Later we opened the store at 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.440
 public 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.290
 about two months ago to offer the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.930
 product in fresh form we talk the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.879
 fresher way possible in addition to 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.540
 We are in other distribution points 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:02.150
 in caracas but this is our idea 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.170
 was to generate a point of sale that 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.780
 would serve for this in addition to showing the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.630
 products can report properly 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.069
 to the customer of what products are 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.690
 leading and that is what we are trying 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.910
 towards the work 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.770
 mainly it has been crazy that 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.950
 we have done this through 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.750
 twitter and facebook accounts and 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.630
 now recently very recently 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.540
 with the instagram and the answer has 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.150
 been not really not the people we did not 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.840
 we expected this answer we thought 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.769
 that we were going to have a point of sale 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.959
 normal small where we could share 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.080
 with people quietly back 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.500
 one a reference point for good 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.300
 We are betting on risks 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.700
 we continue betting on venezuela we believe 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.019
 in what we are doing deeply 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.470
 If we were not doing it, 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.470
 Actions 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.870
 they are many years of tradition 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.060
 and because 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.700
 at this moment we are doing 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.049
 really something very positive and we are 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.720
 very happy with what we are 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.450
 doing 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.220
 It has been the effort of the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.000
 investors has been the effort of 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.970
 many years of creative work and 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.850
 innovative 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.850
 I think we are doing something new 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.409
 during the production of this report 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.479
 we saw how people bought the 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.129
 products and they said they were unique to us 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.229
 we approach several of them to know 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.910
 his impressions and the reason for his 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:52.360
 shopping in the nursery 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:56.710
 because of a different flavor taste with 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:01.050
 the freshness of the prisoners tomato the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.050
 special prey for salsa 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.380
 economic organic 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:29.210
 I'm from the university and that people 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:32.570
 know what we have that has no interest 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.670
 really things can be done a 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:41.030
 entrepreneurship and we must form 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:42.770
 part of these organisms do not have 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.100
 addiction have no pollution and nothing 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.100
 plus 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.499
 we met and we saw a venezuela from 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.870
 progress a venezuela that we dream and the 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:06:00.120
 that we all want to have the venezuela of 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.969
 possible, I invite you to believe in your 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:07.759
 country and invest in it from caracas 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.759
 for the puntocom román camacho
