00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 and today we will learn to build one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.140
 screamer 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.120
 we will use a 1710 hook from the c 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.550
 before starting here i want to teach 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.769
 a little trick you see in this hook a 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.020
 a barb to crush it into 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:23.070
 we will definitely put it in 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:28.980
 this way inside the clamp one 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 once inserted we will go to tighten the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.690
 clamp clamp and hook will be the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.780
 private of the barb as you see 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.730
 this is also used to insert later 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.660
 our 3.8 mm silver ball 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.059
 Right now stands is fine but the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.079
 we will slip in and in this case we will not have 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.329
 no difficulty because lardizzone not 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.699
 will prevent ok entry 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.100
 once inserted and tightened ours 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.680
 i love inside the mors et takemo 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.960
 to our premier coil reel with a 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:20.820
 black thread and we're going to create a kind 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.920
 thick so as to block the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.119
 ball you see the ball does not go down anymore 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.960
 then we will simply go a lot 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:35.579
 quickly to create a sub-body up 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:41.030
 which will fix the material and we will go 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.030
 end the curvature of their ok then 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:51.530
 we will remove the thread 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:56.579
 we will take some red marabou and we will go to 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:59.360
 take some fiber this way 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.360
 We will match 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.420
 ok we're going to see the women length 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.640
 point of view the length and hour s more 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.420
 or less than those of the year therefore 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:20.380
 we will go to fix on the stem we will make a 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:22.390
 ride 2g three laps 1 below and we'll be back 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.220
 above ok 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.160
 in this way we have a fixing 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:33.760
 quite firm and we will tear up the 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.080
 surplus in this way ok then 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:47.970
 we would have made a red tail we will pass again 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:47.970
 to give another thickness under the body 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.680
 at this point we will take a 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.680
 copper wire 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:07.360
 we will cut off copper ceo and we will go to 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:10.900
 fix the where there was a tail ok enough not 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.110
 french because then we will go to get 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.959
 of the aaisla b in this case black because 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.620
 we want to create a red contrast e 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.840
 black than in some water situations 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.370
 clear can be very interesting 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:33.790
 even in the ponds we will take this one 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:38.560
 material and we're going to fix on the wire 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.950
 without using any glue in the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:47.380
 meaning that this is a material with 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:52.000
 of very long fibers than with some 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.820
 of expertise can be without wax 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.940
 see that we have done so now 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.940
 big bike this 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.610
 we will see clearly if we then see that 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.379
 there is something to fix we do 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:16.949
 always placed body must be more or 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:20.669
 less uniform and we will finally get to the 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:24.419
 head ok if there is surplus this point 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:31.650
 we remove it we do two three kinds e 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:35.550
 let's go get a copper madness e 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:40.590
 pro we will fix it we will turn it around 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:45.150
 to the body of our stream and up to 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.960
 get to the head 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.720
 we provide a few rounds we'll cut and 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.360
 wanting to create a different contrast 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:00.990
 in our heads we will go for example 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:08.520
 an unstable green so we will put it 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:13.949
 on the wire and we're going to create premises 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:16.020
 yellow white pink what you feel 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:21.530
 appropriate for the situation in that data 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.530
 I draw this case I created 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:37.660
 I'll go and close then do a 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:41.080
 other around besides this point the 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.530
 Our expression is finished materials 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:50.140
 we used are a black thread 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:53.410
 a 1710 year from ici live dub in black and 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.810
 green in this case and the foliage of 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.620
 marabou for the tail thank you for 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.470
 attention 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.710

 and if this video seemed to me

 interesting and share it with i 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.510
 your fly fishing friends 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.370
 hello from the alde marzorati and from fly 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.370
