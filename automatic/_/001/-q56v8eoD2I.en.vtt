the<00:00:19.539> thing<00:00:19.779> about<00:00:19.810> brakes<00:00:20.349> that<00:00:20.529> drive<00:00:20.740> people

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
the thing about brakes that drive people

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.609 
the thing about brakes that drive people
insane<00:00:21.249> is<00:00:21.789> they<00:00:21.999> squeal<00:00:22.359> and<00:00:22.630> when<00:00:23.320> brakes

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
insane is they squeal and when brakes

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.390 
insane is they squeal and when brakes
squeal<00:00:24.009> it<00:00:24.310> is<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.699> constant<00:00:25.439> shrieking<00:00:26.439> you

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
squeal it is a constant shrieking you

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.970 
squeal it is a constant shrieking you
think<00:00:28.109> fingernails<00:00:29.109> on<00:00:29.259> the<00:00:29.349> blackboard<00:00:29.829> of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
think fingernails on the blackboard of

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.970 
think fingernails on the blackboard of
man<00:00:32.400> it<00:00:33.400> hurts<00:00:33.880> because<00:00:34.620> they<00:00:35.620> are<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:37.180> loud

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
man it hurts because they are so loud

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.080 
man it hurts because they are so loud
they<00:00:38.980> are<00:00:39.220> at<00:00:40.030> a<00:00:40.420> frequency<00:00:40.840> that<00:00:41.350> just

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
they are at a frequency that just

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.370 
they are at a frequency that just
absolutely<00:00:43.090> hurts<00:00:44.050> it's<00:00:44.940> painful<00:00:46.200> when<00:00:47.200> they

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
absolutely hurts it's painful when they

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.780 
absolutely hurts it's painful when they
squeal<00:00:47.730> I've<00:00:48.730> been<00:00:48.970> with<00:00:49.120> DfE<00:00:49.510> for<00:00:49.690> 20<00:00:49.960> years

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
squeal I've been with DfE for 20 years

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.190 
squeal I've been with DfE for 20 years
one<00:00:51.790> of<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.000> first<00:00:52.270> things<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.840> heard<00:00:53.080> about

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
one of the first things I heard about

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.080 
one of the first things I heard about
when<00:00:53.500> I<00:00:53.530> came<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:53.980> door<00:00:54.130> was<00:00:54.520> squealing

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
when I came in the door was squealing

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.480 
when I came in the door was squealing
brakes<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:55.900> everybody<00:00:56.560> then<00:00:56.770> had<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.040> theory

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
brakes and everybody then had a theory

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.090 
brakes and everybody then had a theory
about<00:00:57.780> pressures<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.640> speeds<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:02.070> none<00:01:03.070> of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
about pressures and speeds and none of

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.180 
about pressures and speeds and none of
it<00:01:03.310> amounts<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.730> anything<00:01:04.740> when<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.770> break<00:01:06.010> is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
it amounts to anything when a break is

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.220 
it amounts to anything when a break is
gonna<00:01:06.370> squeal<00:01:06.730> it's<00:01:07.030> due<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.300> vibration<00:01:07.900> that

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
gonna squeal it's due to vibration that

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.990 
gonna squeal it's due to vibration that
vibration<00:01:08.860> could<00:01:09.070> be<00:01:09.190> caused<00:01:09.430> by<00:01:09.700> poor

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
vibration could be caused by poor

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.810 
vibration could be caused by poor
mounting<00:01:10.330> practices<00:01:11.080> by<00:01:11.470> a<00:01:11.830> pin<00:01:12.040> shaft<00:01:12.400> by<00:01:12.790> a

mounting practices by a pin shaft by a

mounting practices by a pin shaft by a
bad<00:01:13.210> bearing<00:01:13.510> whatever<00:01:14.380> but<00:01:15.159> once<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:15.580> starts

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
bad bearing whatever but once it starts

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.660 
bad bearing whatever but once it starts
it<00:01:17.680> is<00:01:18.240> unnerving<00:01:19.920> what<00:01:20.920> we<00:01:21.130> have<00:01:21.400> is

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
it is unnerving what we have is

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.930 
it is unnerving what we have is
something<00:01:21.940> that<00:01:22.090> makes<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:22.750> stop<00:01:23.940> regardless

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
something that makes it stop regardless

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.080 
something that makes it stop regardless
of<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.180> cause<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:26.850> elimination<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.880> brake

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
of the cause the elimination of brake

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.390 
of the cause the elimination of brake
school<00:01:28.360> is<00:01:28.510> as<00:01:28.690> simple<00:01:28.990> as<00:01:29.140> changing<00:01:29.470> two<00:01:30.070> pads

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
school is as simple as changing two pads

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.190 
school is as simple as changing two pads
one<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:31.420> each<00:01:31.540> side<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.020> actuator<00:01:34.200> it's

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
one on each side of the actuator it's

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.410 
one on each side of the actuator it's
taken<00:01:35.560> many<00:01:35.710> years<00:01:35.830> of<00:01:37.290> trial<00:01:38.340> evaluation

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
taken many years of trial evaluation

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.830 
taken many years of trial evaluation
examination<00:01:40.420> it's<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:42.250> been<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> phenomenal

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
examination it's just been a phenomenal

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.070 
examination it's just been a phenomenal
battle<00:01:43.840> but<00:01:44.590> at<00:01:45.010> this<00:01:45.850> point<00:01:46.150> we<00:01:46.479> seem<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.780> have

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
battle but at this point we seem to have

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:58.360 
battle but at this point we seem to have
found<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.650> absolute<00:01:47.920> fix<00:01:48.670> for<00:01:48.909> brakes<00:01:49.090> wheel
