spark<00:00:05.530> plugs<00:00:05.860> and<00:00:06.100> everything<00:00:07.589> right<00:00:08.589> now<00:00:08.740> I'm

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:08.830 
spark plugs and everything right now I'm

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.279 
spark plugs and everything right now I'm
using<00:00:08.950> these<00:00:09.280> a<00:00:09.360> g3<00:00:10.360> spark<00:00:11.019> plugs<00:00:13.289> diamond

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:14.289 
using these a g3 spark plugs diamond

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.590 
using these a g3 spark plugs diamond
fire<00:00:14.499> technology<00:00:14.910> let's<00:00:15.910> see<00:00:16.059> let's<00:00:16.390> see<00:00:16.450> if

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
fire technology let's see let's see if

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.130 
fire technology let's see let's see if
you<00:00:16.690> can<00:00:16.840> see<00:00:16.990> it<00:00:17.110> it<00:00:17.710> has<00:00:17.890> this<00:00:18.040> nice<00:00:18.310> sweet

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
you can see it it has this nice sweet

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.750 
you can see it it has this nice sweet
three-prong<00:00:20.910> technology<00:00:21.910> so<00:00:22.120> you<00:00:22.210> get<00:00:22.390> a<00:00:22.420> much

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
three-prong technology so you get a much

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.930 
three-prong technology so you get a much
hotter<00:00:24.760> spark<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.400> they're<00:00:27.670> pretty<00:00:27.760> sweet

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
hotter spark so they're pretty sweet

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.279 
hotter spark so they're pretty sweet
I've<00:00:28.450> been<00:00:28.630> using<00:00:28.810> them<00:00:28.960> for<00:00:28.990> a<00:00:29.200> while<00:00:30.450> so<00:00:31.450> here

simply<00:00:56.620> you<00:00:57.339> know<00:00:57.429> pull<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:57.850> out<00:00:57.969> there's<00:00:58.510> no

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
simply you know pull it out there's no

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.059 
simply you know pull it out there's no
specific<00:00:58.809> order<00:00:59.289> they<00:00:59.469> have<00:00:59.499> to<00:00:59.710> go<00:00:59.829> in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
specific order they have to go in

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:01.229 
specific order they have to go in
because<00:01:00.309> they're<00:01:00.429> all<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.639> same<00:01:00.670> so<00:01:00.999> you<00:01:01.059> just

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
because they're all the same so you just

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.499 
because they're all the same so you just
take<00:01:01.389> them<00:01:01.569> all<00:01:01.690> out<00:01:01.899> are<00:01:02.620> what<00:01:03.579> you<00:01:03.729> will<00:01:03.879> need

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
to do by on just taking off like just

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.310 
to do by on just taking off like just
breaking<00:01:45.040> it<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.490> he<00:01:45.610> asked<00:01:45.729> run<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.119> off

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
until and there you go got a spark plug

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.190 
until and there you go got a spark plug
and<00:01:54.039> as<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.580> can<00:01:54.700> see<00:01:54.850> it's<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.149> III<00:01:57.930> holy<00:01:58.930> crab

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
and as you can see it's a III holy crab

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.070 
and as you can see it's a III holy crab
it's<00:01:59.440> actually<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.070> know<00:02:00.690> looking<00:02:01.690> at<00:02:01.899> it's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
it's actually you know looking at it's

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.190 
it's actually you know looking at it's
in<00:02:02.229> pretty<00:02:02.380> good<00:02:02.470> shape<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.869> I'm<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.080> little

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
in pretty good shape but I'm a little

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.950 
in pretty good shape but I'm a little
kinetic<00:02:05.979> about<00:02:06.190> my<00:02:06.280> car<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:06.759> I<00:02:06.789> change<00:02:07.119> it<00:02:07.360> as

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
kinetic about my car so I change it as

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.050 
kinetic about my car so I change it as
much<00:02:08.739> as<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:08.890> get<00:02:09.100> it<00:02:09.220> oil<00:02:09.399> change<00:02:09.729> which<00:02:09.910> is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
much as I get it oil change which is

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.729 
much as I get it oil change which is
like<00:02:10.209> every<00:02:10.509> three<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.810> four<00:02:10.989> months<00:02:11.380> just<00:02:11.500> to

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
like every three to four months just to

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.820 
like every three to four months just to
keep<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.040> performance<00:02:12.819> at<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.540> know<00:02:13.830> max

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
keep the performance at you know max

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.780 
keep the performance at you know max
level<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:17.590> I'm<00:02:17.769> going<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:17.950> pause<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:18.760> here

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
level so I'm going to pause it here

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.720 
level so I'm going to pause it here
because<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.239> need<00:02:19.480> both<00:02:19.510> hands<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.610> put<00:02:21.610> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
because I need both hands to put the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.990 
because I need both hands to put the
other<00:02:21.850> spark<00:02:22.150> plug<00:02:22.330> in<00:02:22.540> here<00:02:23.519> also<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:24.640> can

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
other spark plug in here also you can

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.440 
other spark plug in here also you can
spray<00:02:25.299> wd-40<00:02:26.049> down<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.470> there<00:02:26.680> but<00:02:27.360> seeing<00:02:28.360> how

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
spray wd-40 down in there but seeing how

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.520 
spray wd-40 down in there but seeing how
it's<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.660> whole<00:02:28.810> car<00:02:29.019> don't<00:02:29.230> have<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.410> do

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
it's in the whole car don't have to do

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.830 
it's in the whole car don't have to do
that<00:02:29.739> but<00:02:30.519> normally<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.390> just<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.720> make

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
that but normally I do that just to make

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.620 
that but normally I do that just to make
it<00:02:32.049> a<00:02:32.080> lot<00:02:32.830> easier<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.670> it's<00:02:34.030> all<00:02:34.120> easy<00:02:34.420> to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
it a lot easier and it's all easy to

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.580 
it a lot easier and it's all easy to
take<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:36.489> plug<00:02:36.760> off<00:02:37.569> of<00:02:38.019> this<00:02:38.140> socket

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
take the the plug off of this socket

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.410 
take the the plug off of this socket
because<00:02:38.769> sometimes<00:02:39.130> when<00:02:39.459> when<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.060> fasten

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
because sometimes when when you fasten

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.710 
because sometimes when when you fasten
it<00:02:40.480> back<00:02:40.630> in<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.769> doesn't<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:43.060> know<00:02:43.209> pull<00:02:43.540> out

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
it back in it doesn't you know pull out

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.410 
it back in it doesn't you know pull out
it<00:02:43.900> gets<00:02:43.989> kind<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.380> stuck<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:46.150> that's<00:02:46.299> only

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
it gets kind of stuck but that's only

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.660 
it gets kind of stuck but that's only
because<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.870> has<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.019> plastic<00:02:47.739> suction<00:02:48.430> like

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
because it has a plastic suction like

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.960 
because it has a plastic suction like
right<00:02:48.940> down<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.390> here<00:02:50.370> but<00:02:51.370> I'm<00:02:51.609> opposed<00:02:51.880> to

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970
