hello everyone and welcome to your
fourth<00:00:03.149> swift<00:00:04.049> programming<00:00:04.680> tutorial<00:00:05.220> in

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
fourth swift programming tutorial in

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.210 
fourth swift programming tutorial in
this<00:00:06.450> tutorial<00:00:06.509> I'm<00:00:07.230> gonna<00:00:07.470> be<00:00:07.620> covering<00:00:07.980> how

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
this tutorial I'm gonna be covering how

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.509 
this tutorial I'm gonna be covering how
we<00:00:08.280> can<00:00:08.519> work<00:00:08.730> with<00:00:08.840> tuples<00:00:09.840> or<00:00:10.250> tuples<00:00:11.250> in

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
we can work with tuples or tuples in

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.140 
we can work with tuples or tuples in
Swift<00:00:12.889> from<00:00:13.889> now<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.309> I'm<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:14.700> going<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
Swift from now on I'm just going to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.510 
Swift from now on I'm just going to
refer<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.420> them<00:00:15.599> as<00:00:15.680> tuples<00:00:16.680> although<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> know

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
refer to them as tuples although I know

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.370 
refer to them as tuples although I know
some<00:00:17.940> people<00:00:18.090> do<00:00:18.359> refer<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.750> them<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:18.960> tuples

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
some people do refer to them as tuples

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.980 
some people do refer to them as tuples
I've<00:00:19.800> just<00:00:20.189> learnt<00:00:20.430> them<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.850> tuples<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.720> so

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
I've just learnt them as tuples and so

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.900 
I've just learnt them as tuples and so
for<00:00:22.410> me<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.710> try<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.070> switch<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.640> my<00:00:23.730> head

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
for me to try and switch that in my head

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.109 
for me to try and switch that in my head
just<00:00:24.119> more<00:00:25.019> than<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.230> want<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> take<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
just more than I want to take on so you

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.630 
just more than I want to take on so you
can<00:00:27.330> learn<00:00:27.689> them<00:00:27.990> however<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.410> want<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:28.859> I'm

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
can learn them however you want but I'm

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.680 
can learn them however you want but I'm
gonna<00:00:29.820> say<00:00:30.210> tuples<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> tuple<00:00:33.420> in

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
gonna say tuples so what is a tuple in

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.560 
gonna say tuples so what is a tuple in
Swift<00:00:34.230> well<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.680> tuple<00:00:35.370> simply<00:00:35.700> represents<00:00:36.450> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
Swift well a tuple simply represents a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.540 
Swift well a tuple simply represents a
collection<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.590> values<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.190> are<00:00:38.340> very

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
collection of values that are very

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.660 
collection of values that are very
closely<00:00:39.360> linked<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> each<00:00:40.170> other<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.770> maybe<00:00:41.489> as

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
closely linked to each other so maybe as

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
closely linked to each other so maybe as
an<00:00:41.790> example<00:00:42.270> you're<00:00:42.690> looking<00:00:42.719> up<00:00:43.140> somebody's

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
an example you're looking up somebody's

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.790 
an example you're looking up somebody's
name<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> phone<00:00:44.370> book<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:46.140> come<00:00:46.469> across

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
name in a phone book and you come across

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.590 
name in a phone book and you come across
their<00:00:47.100> name<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.640> there's<00:00:48.030> specific

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
their name and there's specific

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.970 
their name and there's specific
information<00:00:48.840> that's<00:00:49.320> tired<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.770> right

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
information that's tired of them right

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760 
information that's tired of them right
you<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.460> their<00:00:50.760> name<00:00:51.110> their<00:00:52.110> phone<00:00:52.410> number

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
you have their name their phone number

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.619 
you have their name their phone number
probably<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.640> phone<00:00:53.820> book<00:00:54.059> is

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
probably if it's a phone book is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.389 
probably if it's a phone book is
hopefully<00:00:55.110> there's<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> phone<00:00:55.860> number<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
hopefully there's a phone number and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.970 
hopefully there's a phone number and
then<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.690> would<00:00:57.899> perhaps<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.649> their

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
then you would perhaps have their

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.910 
then you would perhaps have their
address<00:00:59.489> right<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.539> three<00:01:01.350> pieces<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
address right so this is three pieces of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
address right so this is three pieces of
information<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.879> would<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.629> very<00:01:04.140> closely

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
information that would be very closely

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.870 
information that would be very closely
linked<00:01:04.860> together<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.460> might<00:01:05.610> want<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
linked together and you might want to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.420 
linked together and you might want to
represent<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.540> sort<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> group<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.860> we

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
represent this sort of as a group and we

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.890 
represent this sort of as a group and we
can<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.170> Swift<00:01:10.170> using<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.010> tuple<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:12.689> my

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
can do that in Swift using a tuple in my

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.240 
can do that in Swift using a tuple in my
example<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> use<00:01:13.740> something

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
example I'm going to use something

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.770 
example I'm going to use something
slightly<00:01:14.610> different<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> show<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
slightly different just to show you that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
slightly different just to show you that
you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.110> different<00:01:16.950> things<00:01:17.009> other<00:01:17.400> than

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you can have different things other than

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.990 
you can have different things other than
strings<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:19.500> could<00:01:19.680> represent<00:01:20.000> perhaps

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
strings you could represent perhaps

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.859 
strings you could represent perhaps
getting<00:01:21.630> somebody<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.659> address<00:01:24.659> book

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
getting somebody out of the address book

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.600 
getting somebody out of the address book
that<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.650> your<00:01:26.070> address<00:01:26.250> book

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that you have and your address book

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.910 
that you have and your address book
might<00:01:26.820> contain<00:01:27.210> their<00:01:28.020> name<00:01:28.320> their<00:01:28.710> phone

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
might contain their name their phone

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
might contain their name their phone
number<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.430> perhaps<00:01:29.909> their<00:01:30.299> birthday<00:01:30.689> so

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
number and perhaps their birthday so

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
number and perhaps their birthday so
maybe<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.229> their<00:01:31.590> age<00:01:31.829> sort<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.759> kept

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
maybe you have their age sort of kept

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.929 
maybe you have their age sort of kept
track<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.350> address<00:01:34.710> book<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.820> an

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
track in the address book just as an

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.870 
track in the address book just as an
example<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.170> let's<00:01:37.770> call<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.189> thing<00:01:38.400> entry

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
example so let's call this thing entry

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.190 
example so let's call this thing entry
and<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:40.560> start<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> tuple<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.670> create

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
and to start a tuple you just create

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.789 
and to start a tuple you just create
parentheses<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.380> that

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
parentheses like that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.030 
parentheses like that
and<00:01:43.939> all<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:44.970> want<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> say<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.320> guy's<00:01:46.649> Bob

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and all I want to say is this guy's Bob

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.889 
and all I want to say is this guy's Bob
that's<00:01:47.909> his<00:01:48.090> name<00:01:48.380> then<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.860> want<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.750> his

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
that's his name then I want to have his

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.499 
that's his name then I want to have his
phone<00:01:52.079> number<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.710> we'll<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.729> give<00:01:54.149> him<00:01:54.210> some

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
phone number so we'll just give him some

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.069 
phone number so we'll just give him some
arbitrary<00:01:54.990> phone<00:01:55.229> number<00:01:56.600> there<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
arbitrary phone number there you go and

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.679 
arbitrary phone number there you go and
you<00:01:58.140> guys<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.590> all<00:01:58.740> go<00:01:59.040> home<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.340> call<00:02:00.180> Bob<00:02:00.450> if

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
you guys can all go home and call Bob if

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.639 
you guys can all go home and call Bob if
you<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.579> see<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:02.700> he<00:02:02.820> picks<00:02:02.969> up<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.689> then

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you want and see if he picks up and then

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.199 
you want and see if he picks up and then
let's<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.430> say<00:02:05.610> he's<00:02:05.939> 22<00:02:06.509> years<00:02:06.689> old<00:02:07.250> okay<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
let's just say he's 22 years old okay so

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.270 
let's just say he's 22 years old okay so
with<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.810> how<00:02:10.410> can<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.649> get<00:02:11.039> this

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
with that how can we get this

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.610 
with that how can we get this
information<00:02:11.489> out<00:02:12.000> right

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
information out right

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.290 
information out right
we<00:02:12.769> just<00:02:13.010> created<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.400> little<00:02:13.700> grouping<00:02:14.120> of

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
we just created this little grouping of

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.170 
we just created this little grouping of
Bob<00:02:15.170> his<00:02:15.440> phone<00:02:15.620> number<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:16.040> his<00:02:16.160> age<00:02:16.310> how<00:02:17.000> can

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
Bob his phone number in his age how can

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.210 
Bob his phone number in his age how can
we<00:02:17.269> get<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.540> out<00:02:17.720> well<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.560> simplest<00:02:18.890> way<00:02:19.190> is

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
we get this out well the simplest way is

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.330 
we get this out well the simplest way is
just<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.670> say<00:02:19.849> entry<00:02:20.239> dot<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:21.290> index<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:22.069> what

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
just to say entry dot the index of what

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.860 
just to say entry dot the index of what
you<00:02:22.459> want<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.760> get<00:02:22.879> so<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.209> comes<00:02:23.450> back<00:02:23.690> to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
you want to get so this comes back to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.900 
you want to get so this comes back to
that<00:02:23.900> zero<00:02:24.349> indexing<00:02:25.010> system<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:25.700> work

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
that zero indexing system that we work

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.790 
that zero indexing system that we work
in<00:02:26.120> when<00:02:26.599> we're<00:02:26.780> programming<00:02:27.379> right<00:02:27.500> Bob

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
in when we're programming right Bob

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.150 
in when we're programming right Bob
represents<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.000> zero<00:02:29.360> if<00:02:29.599> index<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.709> the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
represents the zero if index and the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.830 
represents the zero if index and the
other<00:02:31.400> things<00:02:31.670> are<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.970> first<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.480> second

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
other things are the first in the second

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.559 
other things are the first in the second
so<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.980> get<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.489> we<00:02:34.549> get<00:02:34.760> entry<00:02:35.030> zero<00:02:35.299> we<00:02:35.450> can

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
so to get if we get entry zero we can

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.660 
so to get if we get entry zero we can
see<00:02:35.840> over<00:02:36.140> on<00:02:36.260> our<00:02:36.410> output<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:37.040> we<00:02:37.250> get<00:02:37.430> Bob

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
see over on our output that we get Bob

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.440 
see over on our output that we get Bob
if<00:02:38.420> we<00:02:38.540> do<00:02:38.660> entry<00:02:39.110> dot<00:02:39.500> one<00:02:39.799> we<00:02:40.430> get<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:41.269> phone

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
if we do entry dot one we get the phone

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.320 
if we do entry dot one we get the phone
number<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.989> entry<00:02:42.349> two<00:02:42.709> not<00:02:43.430> surprisingly<00:02:44.030> is

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
number and entry two not surprisingly is

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.650 
number and entry two not surprisingly is
his<00:02:45.049> age<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.040> very<00:02:46.280> simple<00:02:46.549> way<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.790> get<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
his age so a very simple way to get the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.470 
his age so a very simple way to get the
values<00:02:48.160> however<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.880> isn't<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.329> most

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
values however this isn't the most

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.050 
values however this isn't the most
descriptive<00:02:51.140> way<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.739> it's<00:02:51.860> not<00:02:51.950> always<00:02:52.280> the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
descriptive way and it's not always the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.699 
descriptive way and it's not always the
easiest<00:02:53.420> if<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.079> reuse<00:02:54.290> these

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
easiest if you have to reuse these

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.309 
easiest if you have to reuse these
values<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.190> lot<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:56.209> let's<00:02:56.480> say<00:02:56.630> for<00:02:56.660> example<00:02:57.200> we

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
values a lot so let's say for example we

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.470 
values a lot so let's say for example we
wanted<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.709> get<00:02:57.890> all<00:02:58.160> these<00:02:58.370> values<00:02:58.760> out<00:02:59.269> of

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
wanted to get all these values out of

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.119 
wanted to get all these values out of
the<00:02:59.599> tuple<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.049> assign<00:03:00.379> them<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.799> their<00:03:00.980> own

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
the tuple and assign them to their own

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.789 
the tuple and assign them to their own
variables<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.000> perhaps<00:03:02.629> we<00:03:02.870> want<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.110> give<00:03:03.230> the

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
variables so perhaps we want to give the

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.300 
variables so perhaps we want to give the
name<00:03:04.069> or<00:03:04.760> create<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.569> variable<00:03:05.900> called<00:03:06.019> Bob<00:03:06.950> and

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
name or create a variable called Bob and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.670 
name or create a variable called Bob and
his<00:03:07.430> name<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.000> phone<00:03:08.720> number<00:03:08.750> could<00:03:09.620> be

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
his name and phone number could be

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.830 
his name and phone number could be
represented<00:03:09.950> with<00:03:10.310> phone<00:03:10.579> and<00:03:10.879> age<00:03:11.450> could<00:03:11.720> be

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
represented with phone and age could be

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.140 
represented with phone and age could be
represented<00:03:12.019> with<00:03:12.410> age<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.879> do<00:03:13.970> this

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
represented with age and to do this

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.089 
represented with age and to do this
there's<00:03:14.360> very<00:03:14.629> easy<00:03:14.959> syntax<00:03:15.590> we<00:03:15.799> don't<00:03:15.980> have

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
there's very easy syntax we don't have

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.099 
there's very easy syntax we don't have
to<00:03:16.250> assign<00:03:16.639> each<00:03:17.030> element<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.569> new<00:03:17.750> variable

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
to assign each element to a new variable

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.379 
to assign each element to a new variable
we<00:03:18.319> can<00:03:18.470> simply<00:03:18.829> say<00:03:19.040> let<00:03:19.310> use<00:03:20.180> the

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
we can simply say let use the

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.940 
we can simply say let use the
parentheses<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.200> represent<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:21.799> we're

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
parentheses to represent that we're

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.090 
parentheses to represent that we're
assigning<00:03:22.639> a<00:03:22.790> tuple<00:03:23.239> basically<00:03:23.720> we<00:03:24.709> can<00:03:24.859> say

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
assigning a tuple basically we can say

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.720 
assigning a tuple basically we can say
name<00:03:25.730> phone<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.900> age<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.829> then<00:03:28.310> we<00:03:28.430> can<00:03:28.579> just

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
name phone and age and then we can just

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.170 
name phone and age and then we can just
say<00:03:29.239> assign<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.380> entry<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:31.370> these<00:03:31.519> values<00:03:31.940> so

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
say assign the entry to these values so

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.900 
say assign the entry to these values so
what<00:03:32.329> we're<00:03:32.480> doing<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:32.989> this<00:03:33.440> is<00:03:33.620> known<00:03:33.829> as

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
what we're doing is this is known as

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.030 
what we're doing is this is known as
decomposing<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.060> tuple<00:03:35.389> and<00:03:35.709> all<00:03:36.709> we're

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
decomposing the tuple and all we're

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.860 
decomposing the tuple and all we're
doing<00:03:37.340> is<00:03:37.489> we're<00:03:37.700> taking<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.209> elements<00:03:38.780> that

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
doing is we're taking the elements that

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.199 
doing is we're taking the elements that
are<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.230> entry<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.880> basically<00:03:40.880> breaking

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
are in the entry and basically breaking

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.690 
are in the entry and basically breaking
it<00:03:41.450> apart<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:41.900> then<00:03:42.139> setting<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:43.220> values

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
it apart and then setting the values

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.960 
it apart and then setting the values
into<00:03:44.389> the<00:03:44.569> ones<00:03:44.750> we<00:03:44.900> just<00:03:45.109> defined<00:03:45.410> here<00:03:45.709> so

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
into the ones we just defined here so

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.879 
into the ones we just defined here so
Bob<00:03:46.970> will<00:03:47.269> be<00:03:47.299> mapped<00:03:47.599> to<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.870> name<00:03:48.079> phone<00:03:48.590> to

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
Bob will be mapped to the name phone to

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.150 
Bob will be mapped to the name phone to
the<00:03:48.980> phone<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.819> age<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.660> age<00:03:50.919> so<00:03:51.919> if<00:03:52.069> I

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
the phone and the age to the age so if I

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.339 
the phone and the age to the age so if I
want<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.370> use<00:03:52.519> these<00:03:52.700> now<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:52.940> can<00:03:53.540> just<00:03:53.750> feel

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
want to use these now I can just feel

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.589 
want to use these now I can just feel
free<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.650> type<00:03:55.310> them<00:03:55.459> out<00:03:55.609> and<00:03:55.790> we<00:03:55.880> can<00:03:56.030> see<00:03:56.060> all

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
free to type them out and we can see all

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.270 
free to type them out and we can see all
the<00:03:56.840> values<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.380> are<00:03:57.530> associated<00:03:57.799> with<00:03:58.099> them

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
the values that are associated with them

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.099 
the values that are associated with them
and<00:03:58.459> as<00:03:58.549> you<00:03:58.700> can<00:03:58.790> see<00:03:59.030> they're<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.630> exact

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
and as you can see they're the exact

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.809 
and as you can see they're the exact
ones<00:04:00.380> that<00:04:00.620> we<00:04:00.709> had<00:04:00.980> in<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:02.000> tuple<00:04:02.709> another

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
ones that we had in the tuple another

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.129 
ones that we had in the tuple another
interesting<00:04:04.819> thing<00:04:04.849> that<00:04:05.540> we<00:04:05.720> can<00:04:05.870> do<00:04:05.989> with

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
interesting thing that we can do with

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.839 
interesting thing that we can do with
this<00:04:06.260> though<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.680> let's<00:04:07.010> say<00:04:07.220> for<00:04:07.250> example<00:04:07.760> we

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
this though is let's say for example we

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.059 
this though is let's say for example we
don't<00:04:07.970> actually<00:04:08.209> care<00:04:08.630> about<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.870> age<00:04:09.139> what

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
don't actually care about the age what

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.710 
don't actually care about the age what
we<00:04:10.190> can<00:04:10.340> do<00:04:10.519> with<00:04:10.669> this<00:04:10.790> is<00:04:11.030> we<00:04:11.150> can<00:04:11.329> use<00:04:11.359> the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
we can do with this is we can use the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.839 
we can do with this is we can use the
wild<00:04:12.049> card<00:04:12.349> character<00:04:12.410> or<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.340> wild<00:04:13.639> card

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
wild card character or the wild card

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.180 
wild card character or the wild card
expression<00:04:14.389> which<00:04:15.139> is<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.440> underscore<00:04:15.980> and

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
expression which is the underscore and

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.890 
expression which is the underscore and
this<00:04:16.669> indicates<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.359> we<00:04:17.510> don't<00:04:17.720> actually

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
this indicates that we don't actually

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.080 
this indicates that we don't actually
want<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.410> use<00:04:18.560> this<00:04:19.220> value<00:04:19.609> we<00:04:19.729> just<00:04:19.760> don't

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
want to use this value we just don't

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.630 
want to use this value we just don't
care<00:04:20.269> about<00:04:20.389> it<00:04:20.659> and<00:04:21.130> oftentimes<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:22.490> might

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
care about it and oftentimes you might

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.219 
care about it and oftentimes you might
not<00:04:22.849> care<00:04:23.090> about<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.419> maybe<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.780> just<00:04:23.930> want<00:04:24.169> to

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
not care about it maybe you just want to

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.360 
not care about it maybe you just want to
get<00:04:24.349> all<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.800> names

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
get all the names

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.030 
get all the names
that<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.550> had<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:26.090> these<00:04:27.050> entries<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:27.860> maybe

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
that you had in these entries so maybe

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.950 
that you had in these entries so maybe
you<00:04:28.130> have<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.340> array<00:04:28.940> of<00:04:29.090> entries<00:04:29.449> or<00:04:29.630> something

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
you have a array of entries or something

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.900 
you have a array of entries or something
and<00:04:30.139> you<00:04:30.860> wanted<00:04:31.130> just<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.370> get<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.699> name<00:04:31.880> of

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
and you wanted just to get the name of

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.360 
and you wanted just to get the name of
everybody<00:04:32.570> in<00:04:32.840> these<00:04:33.020> entries<00:04:33.410> well<00:04:34.070> to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
everybody in these entries well to

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.040 
everybody in these entries well to
simply<00:04:34.699> do<00:04:34.850> that<00:04:35.000> you<00:04:35.300> could<00:04:35.479> just<00:04:35.600> say<00:04:35.810> name

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
simply do that you could just say name

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.409 
simply do that you could just say name
underscore<00:04:36.860> underscore<00:04:37.150> don't<00:04:38.150> worry<00:04:38.330> about

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
underscore underscore don't worry about

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.909 
underscore underscore don't worry about
the<00:04:38.600> other<00:04:38.720> parameters<00:04:39.229> because<00:04:39.410> you're<00:04:39.830> not

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
the other parameters because you're not

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.400 
the other parameters because you're not
interested<00:04:40.520> in<00:04:40.580> them<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.810> while<00:04:41.960> the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
interested in them and the while the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.140 
interested in them and the while the
wild-card<00:04:42.740> character<00:04:42.949> makes<00:04:43.460> this<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.850> little

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
wild-card character makes this a little

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.330 
wild-card character makes this a little
more<00:04:44.270> clear<00:04:44.570> so<00:04:44.600> if<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.710> include<00:04:46.040> that<00:04:46.280> of

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
more clear so if I include that of

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.640 
more clear so if I include that of
course<00:04:46.760> I<00:04:46.940> can't<00:04:47.180> use<00:04:47.419> that<00:04:47.690> age<00:04:48.199> variable

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
course I can't use that age variable

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.120 
course I can't use that age variable
because<00:04:49.160> it<00:04:49.970> doesn't<00:04:50.270> exist

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
because it doesn't exist

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.379 
because it doesn't exist
okay<00:04:52.130> so<00:04:52.190> that's<00:04:52.490> just<00:04:52.669> another<00:04:52.910> neat<00:04:53.360> thing

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
okay so that's just another neat thing

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.439 
okay so that's just another neat thing
that<00:04:53.720> you<00:04:53.810> can<00:04:53.930> do<00:04:54.139> with<00:04:54.680> tuples<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:56.120> last

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
that you can do with tuples the last

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.659 
that you can do with tuples the last
thing<00:04:56.720> that<00:04:56.750> I'm<00:04:56.960> gonna<00:04:57.110> show<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:57.410> is<00:04:58.010> naming

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
thing that I'm gonna show you is naming

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.120 
thing that I'm gonna show you is naming
the<00:04:58.940> parameters<00:04:59.419> when<00:04:59.780> you<00:04:59.810> create<00:05:00.440> them<00:05:00.650> so

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
the parameters when you create them so

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.730 
the parameters when you create them so
what<00:05:01.460> you<00:05:01.580> can<00:05:01.760> do<00:05:01.940> is<00:05:02.180> let's<00:05:03.020> say<00:05:03.199> for<00:05:03.229> example

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
what you can do is let's say for example

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.860 
what you can do is let's say for example
we<00:05:03.830> wanted<00:05:04.130> to<00:05:04.250> represent<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.940> size<00:05:05.360> of<00:05:05.720> a

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
we wanted to represent the size of a

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.370 
we wanted to represent the size of a
rectangle<00:05:06.500> we<00:05:07.039> could<00:05:07.220> say<00:05:07.400> let's<00:05:07.699> size<00:05:08.169> be<00:05:09.169> a

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
rectangle we could say let's size be a

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.029 
rectangle we could say let's size be a
tuple<00:05:10.070> and<00:05:10.510> we'll<00:05:11.510> name<00:05:11.810> each<00:05:12.199> parameter<00:05:12.800> so

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
tuple and we'll name each parameter so

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.909 
tuple and we'll name each parameter so
we'll<00:05:13.190> say<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.729> width<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.660> we<00:05:15.560> just<00:05:15.770> use

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
we'll say the width and we just use

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.550 
we'll say the width and we just use
colon<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.550> then<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.150> thing<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:17.990> we<00:05:18.080> want<00:05:18.229> so

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
colon and then the thing that we want so

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.620 
colon and then the thing that we want so
with<00:05:18.800> 10<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:19.960> we'll<00:05:20.960> say<00:05:21.169> length<00:05:21.470> and<00:05:22.630> that

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
with 10 and we'll say length and that

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.010 
with 10 and we'll say length and that
could<00:05:23.810> be<00:05:23.900> 20<00:05:24.229> for<00:05:24.500> example<00:05:24.889> okay<00:05:25.880> so<00:05:26.330> our<00:05:26.720> size

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
could be 20 for example okay so our size

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.260 
could be 20 for example okay so our size
we've<00:05:27.530> now<00:05:27.830> defined<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.490> have<00:05:28.520> a<00:05:28.639> width<00:05:28.850> of<00:05:29.060> 10

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
we've now defined to have a width of 10

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.659 
we've now defined to have a width of 10
the<00:05:29.450> length<00:05:29.630> of<00:05:29.810> 20<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.320> we<00:05:30.860> can<00:05:31.010> access<00:05:31.250> each

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
the length of 20 and we can access each

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.930 
the length of 20 and we can access each
one<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.120> these<00:05:32.210> by<00:05:32.810> saying<00:05:33.110> size<00:05:33.860> dot<00:05:34.340> length

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
one of these by saying size dot length

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.839 
one of these by saying size dot length
or<00:05:35.270> size<00:05:35.330> dot<00:05:36.020> width<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:36.650> as<00:05:37.130> we<00:05:37.340> can<00:05:37.430> see<00:05:37.490> we

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
or size dot width and as we can see we

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.930 
or size dot width and as we can see we
get<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.120> output<00:05:38.150> of<00:05:38.630> each<00:05:39.410> element<00:05:40.250> that<00:05:40.700> is

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
get the output of each element that is

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.650 
get the output of each element that is
in<00:05:41.090> this<00:05:41.900> tuple<00:05:42.770> so<00:05:43.310> we're<00:05:43.520> essentially<00:05:44.300> sort

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
in this tuple so we're essentially sort

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.300 
in this tuple so we're essentially sort
of<00:05:44.780> decomposing<00:05:45.410> it<00:05:45.650> but<00:05:45.889> this<00:05:46.099> is<00:05:46.280> a

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
of decomposing it but this is a

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.370 
of decomposing it but this is a
different<00:05:46.729> way<00:05:46.940> that<00:05:47.510> we<00:05:47.570> can<00:05:47.840> represent<00:05:48.020> it

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
different way that we can represent it

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.900 
different way that we can represent it
if<00:05:48.470> we<00:05:48.620> name<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:49.070> parameters<00:05:49.639> from<00:05:49.820> the

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
if we name the parameters from the

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.050 
if we name the parameters from the
beginning<00:05:50.270> instead<00:05:50.870> of<00:05:51.200> using<00:05:51.500> 0<00:05:51.830> 1<00:05:52.039> 2<00:05:52.280> we<00:05:52.910> can

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
beginning instead of using 0 1 2 we can

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.700 
beginning instead of using 0 1 2 we can
actually<00:05:53.450> use<00:05:53.660> the<00:05:53.990> names<00:05:54.229> that<00:05:54.560> we

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
actually use the names that we

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.450 
actually use the names that we
associated<00:05:55.580> with<00:05:55.940> that<00:05:56.710> anyway<00:05:57.710> I<00:05:57.860> hope<00:05:58.280> you

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
associated with that anyway I hope you

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.100 
associated with that anyway I hope you
enjoyed<00:05:58.760> this<00:05:58.910> tutorial<00:05:59.060> if<00:05:59.479> you<00:05:59.599> have<00:05:59.930> any

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
enjoyed this tutorial if you have any

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.689 
enjoyed this tutorial if you have any
other<00:06:00.229> questions<00:06:00.620> on<00:06:00.770> tuples<00:06:01.250> I<00:06:01.430> know<00:06:01.490> this

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 
other questions on tuples I know this

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.339 
other questions on tuples I know this
was<00:06:01.820> a<00:06:01.910> pretty<00:06:02.090> quick<00:06:02.300> one<00:06:02.479> but<00:06:02.720> it's<00:06:03.169> all<00:06:03.289> I

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
was a pretty quick one but it's all I

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:04.930 
was a pretty quick one but it's all I
really<00:06:03.530> had<00:06:03.740> to<00:06:03.830> cover<00:06:04.010> for<00:06:04.160> tuples<00:06:04.760> that

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
really had to cover for tuples that

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.300 
really had to cover for tuples that
really<00:06:05.360> explains<00:06:06.169> just<00:06:06.979> about<00:06:07.099> everything

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
really explains just about everything

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.490 
really explains just about everything
you<00:06:07.430> can<00:06:07.669> do<00:06:07.880> with<00:06:07.910> them<00:06:08.120> we'll<00:06:08.870> talk<00:06:09.349> about

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
you can do with them we'll talk about

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.200 
you can do with them we'll talk about
how<00:06:09.740> we<00:06:09.770> can<00:06:10.010> use<00:06:10.039> these<00:06:10.370> in<00:06:10.580> functions<00:06:11.030> and

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
how we can use these in functions and

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.540 
how we can use these in functions and
everything<00:06:11.510> when<00:06:11.690> we<00:06:11.720> actually<00:06:12.590> get<00:06:12.770> to<00:06:12.800> using

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
everything when we actually get to using

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.159 
everything when we actually get to using
them<00:06:13.669> in<00:06:13.789> functions<00:06:14.150> but<00:06:14.840> you'll<00:06:15.020> actually

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
them in functions but you'll actually

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.409 
them in functions but you'll actually
see<00:06:15.530> the<00:06:15.740> use<00:06:15.979> of<00:06:16.160> them<00:06:16.340> in<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.760> next<00:06:16.970> tutorial

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
see the use of them in the next tutorial

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.659 
see the use of them in the next tutorial
as<00:06:17.479> well<00:06:17.660> so<00:06:17.990> I<00:06:18.020> figured<00:06:18.410> I'd<00:06:18.590> try<00:06:19.190> and<00:06:19.310> explain

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
as well so I figured I'd try and explain

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:21.760 
as well so I figured I'd try and explain
them<00:06:19.820> now<00:06:20.000> if<00:06:20.840> you<00:06:20.930> have<00:06:21.080> any<00:06:21.229> questions<00:06:21.560> leave

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
them now if you have any questions leave

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.200 
them now if you have any questions leave
your<00:06:21.889> questions<00:06:22.220> in<00:06:22.310> the<00:06:22.460> comments<00:06:22.729> below<00:06:22.849> and
