00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.910
 well we've been two and a half months since 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.550
 that since we started this project 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.970
 of Peter Pan syndrome and also already 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.539
 We have our official logo 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.539
 syndrome 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.900
 he is responsible for being the image to this 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.330
 today I came to see the balloons that have 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.239
 made all the generation that I started to 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.010
 use for is talking about one thing 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.110
 for other 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.590
 Andrew 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.350
 He said the following, I left the planet 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.350
 personal 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.350
 d 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.620
 starts 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.970
 it is possible today we are July 20 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.790
 but we did not have so much 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.320
 complications the truth is part of 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.870
 all this process that we are living 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.130
 in a new experience that we are 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.100
 leaving our comfort zone and 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.320
 for leaving the comfort zone is 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.860
 that preproduction is taking a lot 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.790
 more time than scheduled but good not 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.980
 everything is bad news in all that that 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.200
 time interval we have had 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.260
 meetings with the person who is going to 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.530
 commission art if there was barraza 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.830
 art director and frank flowers is in 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.830
 hour 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:51.490
 old a color palette of what it brings 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.490
 here and you go back to double wall painting 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.360
 cabal also hired another member 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.050
 important of the team we refer to 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.080
 estefanÃ­a escobar who is working 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.200
 as assistant director the family 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.650
 is growing more and more we have had 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.540
 tours and rally on television do the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.580
 call to the castings by terminate 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.400
 doing three castings and open 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.580
 public have withdrawn more than 100 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.500
 people and has not been easy had 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.820
 people who acted very well but not 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.700
 fit in the physical profile of 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.250
 character or vice versa at the end if 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.430
 He made a first preselection 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.410
 they called those pre-selected for 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.740
 see if they had chemistry with each other to see 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.780
 if they looked like family as friends 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.870
 and of them we end up closing or 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.940
 closing deal with several and I see them 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.410
 quite motivated and that makes me happy that 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.240
 yes it is an advance 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.240
 things that the country 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.430
 for all 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.800
 mark history and my life marks the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.000
 story of a support hopefully if you can 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.680
 you have to put it in and I feel the same 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.680
 character I feel identified 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.010
 finishing the 80's of work 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.230
 we had thought that these pieces were 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.230
 nobles 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.459
 with unique pieces 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.530
 we hope that we do well that the 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.049
 true a lot has happened we are 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.400
 enjoying the process we are 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:19.220
 learning a lot and the best is coming 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.600
 so watch these videos 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.600
