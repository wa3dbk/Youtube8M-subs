waiting for another to phoenix up to
eight<00:00:12.389> total<00:00:12.719> as<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.769> see<00:00:13.980> these<00:00:14.280> Phoenix<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
eight total as we see these Phoenix a

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.010 
eight total as we see these Phoenix a
few<00:00:15.420> kills<00:00:15.690> on<00:00:15.960> each<00:00:17.630> now<00:00:18.630> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.900> be<00:00:18.960> able

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
few kills on each now going to be able

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.080 
few kills on each now going to be able
to<00:00:19.170> bounce<00:00:19.320> around<00:00:19.619> all<00:00:19.890> three<00:00:20.160> bases<00:00:20.580> so

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
to bounce around all three bases so

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.210 
to bounce around all three bases so
slush<00:00:21.420> maybe<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:22.109> he<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.830> he's<00:00:23.130> doing

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
slush maybe think he think he's doing

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.740 
slush maybe think he think he's doing
the<00:00:23.670> right<00:00:23.850> thing<00:00:24.090> trying<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.600> his

the right thing trying to get his
economy<00:00:25.050> up<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> three<00:00:25.980> basis<00:00:26.340> but

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
economy up and going a three basis but

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.160 
economy up and going a three basis but
if<00:00:27.000> anything<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.539> makes<00:00:27.869> them<00:00:28.019> more

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
if anything it just makes them more

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.290 
if anything it just makes them more

many Phoenix they're going to unlimited
energy<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.129> most<00:00:38.309> part<00:00:38.489> able<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> take

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
energy for the most part able to take

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.479 
energy for the most part able to take
down<00:00:39.510> those<00:00:39.690> drones<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.260> soon<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.680> they<00:00:40.860> get

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
down those drones as soon as they get

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.850 
down those drones as soon as they get
lifted<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.170> sport<00:00:43.559> girl<00:00:43.739> or

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
coming out for slush so good reaction

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.420 
coming out for slush so good reaction
there<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.680> up<00:00:46.800> enough<00:00:47.129> spore

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
there if you can get up enough spore

there if you can get up enough spore
colors<00:00:47.760> around<00:00:48.450> these<00:00:48.690> bases<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.350> looks<00:00:49.469> like

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
colors around these bases it looks like

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.740

Nexus if it does try to be warped in
again<00:03:52.049> looks<00:03:53.049> like<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.320> rich<00:03:53.500> can<00:03:53.860> be<00:03:54.010> seen

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
again looks like that rich can be seen

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.100 
again looks like that rich can be seen

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
by that photon cannon again the photon

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.100 
by that photon cannon again the photon
cannon<00:03:56.440> can<00:03:56.590> see<00:03:56.890> farther<00:03:57.250> than<00:03:57.549> it<00:03:57.700> can<00:03:57.910> shoot

and cubic are you going to throw up that

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.310 
and cubic are you going to throw up that
third<00:04:08.720> expansion<00:04:09.080> again<00:04:10.120> see<00:04:11.120> slush<00:04:11.480> is<00:04:11.960> going

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
third expansion again see slush is going

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.860 
third expansion again see slush is going
to<00:04:12.380> lose<00:04:12.530> this<00:04:12.680> nydus<00:04:13.070> worm<00:04:13.570> fortunately<00:04:14.570> his

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
nydus worms like to think maybe they're

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.630 
nydus worms like to think maybe they're
underneath<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.550> map<00:04:22.790> here<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:28.070> we<00:04:28.130> see<00:04:28.310> slush

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
underneath the map here so we see slush

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.630 
underneath the map here so we see slush
just<00:04:29.090> trying<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.540> get<00:04:30.380> up<00:04:30.500> an<00:04:30.680> infestation<00:04:31.280> pit

as<00:04:31.820> well<00:04:32.030> as<00:04:32.150> aspire<00:04:32.480> he's<00:04:33.290> on<00:04:33.440> every<00:04:33.680> single

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
as well as aspire he's on every single

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.820 
as well as aspire he's on every single
layer<00:04:34.400> tech<00:04:34.610> right<00:04:34.850> now<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.630> not<00:04:36.350> really<00:04:36.530> sure

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
layer tech right now so not really sure

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.370 
layer tech right now so not really sure
what<00:04:37.190> he's<00:04:37.310> going<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.520> focus<00:04:37.760> on<00:04:38.230> looks<00:04:39.230> like

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
what he's going to focus on looks like

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.750 
what he's going to focus on looks like
he's<00:04:39.500> getting<00:04:39.620> out<00:04:39.860> another<00:04:40.160> evolution

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
he's getting out another evolution

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.150 
he's getting out another evolution
chamber<00:04:40.910> so<00:04:41.360> he's<00:04:42.169> sort<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.470> transitioning

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
chamber so he's sort of transitioning

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.460 
chamber so he's sort of transitioning
into<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.669> late-game<00:04:44.060> build<00:04:44.600> but<00:04:45.050> I<00:04:45.080> don't<00:04:45.350> think

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
into a late-game build but I don't think

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.350 
into a late-game build but I don't think
his<00:04:45.620> economy<00:04:45.860> is<00:04:46.100> very<00:04:46.250> strong<00:04:46.490> just<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:46.880> 51

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
his economy is very strong just the 51

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.870 
his economy is very strong just the 51
harvesters<00:04:47.810> on<00:04:48.020> these<00:04:48.200> three<00:04:48.440> bases<00:04:48.880> looks

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
harvesters on these three bases looks

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.460 
harvesters on these three bases looks
like<00:04:50.000> he's<00:04:50.150> just<00:04:50.419> on<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.660> for<00:04:50.870> gas<00:04:51.080> right<00:04:51.350> now

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
like he's just on the for gas right now

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.190 
like he's just on the for gas right now
as<00:04:51.620> well<00:04:51.830> his<00:04:52.340> income<00:04:52.610> only<00:04:52.970> yeah<00:04:53.480> well<00:04:53.990> it

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.900 
actually is up to 1,500 now miss ms redd
then<00:04:57.320> thought<00:04:57.620> he<00:04:57.800> was<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:58.040> 700<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:58.730> looks

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
then thought he was the 700 it looks

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.420 
then thought he was the 700 it looks
