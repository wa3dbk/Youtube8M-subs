tough subject to draw because a lot of
complex<00:00:27.730> angles<00:00:28.210> now<00:00:28.659> we're<00:00:28.749> going<00:00:28.839> to<00:00:28.899> be

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
complex angles now we're going to be

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.259

a<00:00:31.300> medium<00:00:31.689> is<00:00:32.619> tricky<00:00:33.250> because<00:00:33.399> if<00:00:33.700> you<00:00:33.850> get

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
a medium is tricky because if you get

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.330 
a medium is tricky because if you get
the<00:00:34.630> wrong<00:00:34.809> kind<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.109> start<00:00:35.440> you<00:00:36.039> don't<00:00:36.129> get<00:00:36.309> a

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
the wrong kind of start you don't get a

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.250 
the wrong kind of start you don't get a
second<00:00:36.730> chance<00:00:36.760> as<00:00:37.660> we<00:00:37.840> look<00:00:37.989> at<00:00:38.079> these

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
second chance as we look at these

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.669 
second chance as we look at these

thank<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.270> Steve<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:50.440> is<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.710> metal<00:01:51.160> helix

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
thank you Steve this is a metal helix

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.440 
thank you Steve this is a metal helix
clip<00:01:52.390> which<00:01:52.690> holds<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:54.360> thing<00:01:55.360> on<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.810> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
clip which holds the thing on to the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.840 
clip which holds the thing on to the
water<00:01:58.450> color<00:01:58.540> set<00:01:59.160> here's<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.340> water<00:02:00.550> cup

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
water color set here's the water cup

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.790 
water color set here's the water cup
which<00:02:01.180> would<00:02:01.780> otherwise<00:02:01.900> just<00:02:02.110> sit<00:02:02.500> on<00:02:02.530> here

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
which would otherwise just sit on here

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.640 
which would otherwise just sit on here
loosely<00:02:03.280> but<00:02:04.270> by<00:02:04.420> using<00:02:04.600> this<00:02:04.900> high-power

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
loosely but by using this high-power

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.880 
loosely but by using this high-power
rare<00:02:06.520> metal<00:02:06.880> magnet<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.510> could<00:02:08.349> just<00:02:08.530> set<00:02:08.739> that

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
rare metal magnet I could just set that

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.510 
rare metal magnet I could just set that
right<00:02:09.069> into<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.429> water<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.980> it<00:02:11.980> holds<00:02:12.400> on

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
right into the water and it holds on

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.350 
right into the water and it holds on
tight<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:13.960> clip<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:14.740> this<00:02:15.700> thing<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.180> not

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
tight to that clip so this thing is not

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.480
