00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.440 
holds a curl really well and I'm just
going<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> kind<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.040> separate<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.670> fluff<00:01:42.150> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
going to kind of separate and fluff and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.780 
going to kind of separate and fluff and
I'm<00:01:42.540> starting<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.079> my<00:01:43.439> own<00:01:43.619> hair<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> I'm

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
I'm starting with my own hair and I'm

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.210 
I'm starting with my own hair and I'm
going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.090> move<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.720> doing<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
going to move on to doing that with the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.999 
going to move on to doing that with the
whole<00:01:47.970> kinky<00:01:48.299> hair<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.710> came<00:01:49.890> across

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
whole kinky hair and if I came across

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.940 
whole kinky hair and if I came across
any<00:01:50.399> tangles<00:01:50.990> I<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.409> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.619> worked

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
any tangles I just kind of worked

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.389 
any tangles I just kind of worked
through<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.700> very<00:01:53.909> similar<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.130> my<00:01:56.130> own

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
through them it's very similar to my own

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.910 
through them it's very similar to my own
hair<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.180> whatever<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.110> would<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.590> my<00:01:58.710> hair

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
right there that little piece up there

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.110 
right there that little piece up there
and<00:02:31.860> I'm<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.070> continuing<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.670> separate

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
and I'm just continuing to separate

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.840 
and I'm just continuing to separate
fun-fun-fun<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:35.160> took<00:02:35.310> me<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> long<00:02:35.790> time

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
fun-fun-fun it this took me a long time

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.790 
fun-fun-fun it this took me a long time
it<00:02:36.360> was<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.480> long<00:02:36.780> process<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:38.400> 30<00:02:38.760> minutes

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
it was a long process like 30 minutes

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.870 
it was a long process like 30 minutes
this<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> same<00:02:41.190> thing<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.520> would<00:02:41.640> do

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
this is the same thing that I would do

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.420 
this is the same thing that I would do
if<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.060> wanted<00:02:42.540> big<00:02:42.810> hair<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.350> would<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.310> is

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
if I wanted big hair I would and this is

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.980 
if I wanted big hair I would and this is
what<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.580> did<00:02:44.820> do<00:02:45.030> when<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.270> my<00:02:45.390> hair<00:02:45.600> was<00:02:45.750> blown

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
what I did do when it my hair was blown

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.660 
what I did do when it my hair was blown
out<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.320> just<00:02:46.500> put<00:02:46.710> it<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.890> some<00:02:47.100> braids<00:02:47.370> and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
out I just put it in some braids and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.630 
out I just put it in some braids and
then<00:02:48.270> separated<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.050> fluffed<00:02:49.560> until<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.460> was

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
then separated and fluffed until it was

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.700 
then separated and fluffed until it was
super<00:02:50.970> big<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.570> same<00:02:51.720> process<00:02:52.110> works<00:02:52.380> on

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
super big so the same process works on

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.560 
super big so the same process works on
this<00:02:53.280> hair<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.940> pretty<00:02:54.120> much<00:02:54.210> do

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
this hair and you can pretty much do

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.240 
this hair and you can pretty much do
whatever<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.530> want<00:02:55.710> to<00:02:55.800> do<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.070> your<00:02:56.190> own

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
whatever you want to do to your own

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.750 
whatever you want to do to your own
