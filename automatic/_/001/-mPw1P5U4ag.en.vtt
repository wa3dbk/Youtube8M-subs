damaged<00:00:20.090> satsang<00:00:20.599> with<00:00:20.720> comparison<00:00:21.619> and<00:00:21.829> then

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
damaged satsang with comparison and then

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.159 
damaged satsang with comparison and then
my<00:00:22.070> own<00:00:22.189> opinion<00:00:22.579> of<00:00:22.669> the<00:00:22.730> gun<00:00:22.989> island<00:00:23.989> so

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
my own opinion of the gun island so

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.599 
my own opinion of the gun island so
close<00:00:24.529> range<00:00:24.859> you're<00:00:25.039> going<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:25.220> do<00:00:25.310> a<00:00:25.339> hundred

11 to the body between six and seven to
the<00:01:26.840> legs<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.470> with<00:01:27.709> our<00:01:27.920> me<00:01:28.130> you'll<00:01:28.250> be

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
the legs and with our me you'll be

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.359 
the legs and with our me you'll be
you'll<00:01:29.030> do<00:01:29.270> between<00:01:29.569> 29<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.289> 30<00:01:30.709> to<00:01:31.039> the<00:01:31.130> head

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
you'll do between 29 and 30 to the head

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.680 
you'll do between 29 and 30 to the head
seven<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.479> chest<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.170> eight<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.709> the<00:01:33.770> body

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
seven to the chest and eight to the body

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.240 
seven to the chest and eight to the body
right<00:01:36.690> so<00:01:36.870> I'll<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.080> comparing<00:01:37.800> it<00:01:37.890> against

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
right so I'll be comparing it against

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.270 
right so I'll be comparing it against
normal<00:01:38.729> em<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.810> firing<00:01:40.320> rate<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.620> ever<00:01:40.860> so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
normal em for the firing rate is ever so

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.780 
normal em for the firing rate is ever so
slightly<00:01:41.550> faster<00:01:41.820> than<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.300> m4<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:44.220> reloaded

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
slightly faster than the m4 the reloaded

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.969 
slightly faster than the m4 the reloaded
the<00:01:44.880> ACR<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.330> also<00:01:45.930> ever<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.409> slightly<00:01:46.680> faster

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the ACR is also ever so slightly faster

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.040 
the ACR is also ever so slightly faster
and<00:01:47.460> I'll<00:01:47.670> play<00:01:47.820> again<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.210> slow<00:01:48.330> motion<00:01:48.720> so

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
and I'll play again in slow motion so

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:57.220 
and I'll play again in slow motion so
that<00:01:49.080> you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> difference

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.950 

and<00:01:57.640> finally<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.760> drawer<00:01:59.030> speed<00:01:59.330> is<00:01:59.450> also

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
and finally the drawer speed is also

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.990 
and finally the drawer speed is also
faster<00:02:00.260> and<00:02:00.740> I'll<00:02:00.860> once<00:02:01.310> again<00:02:01.580> play<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:01.850> in

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
faster and I'll once again play it in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.370 
faster and I'll once again play it in
slow<00:02:02.030> motion<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.960> can<00:02:03.080> see<00:02:03.260> the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
slow motion so that you can see the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.790 
slow motion so that you can see the
difference

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.890 

now<00:02:12.800> for<00:02:13.010> my<00:02:13.130> own<00:02:13.280> opinion<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:13.850> gun<00:02:14.060> honestly

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
now for my own opinion of a gun honestly

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.170 
now for my own opinion of a gun honestly
I<00:02:15.260> think<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:15.980> gun<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.310> pretty<00:02:16.670> good<00:02:16.910> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
I think this gun is pretty good the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.140 
I think this gun is pretty good the
rifle<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.830> good<00:02:18.830> at<00:02:18.950> range<00:02:19.250> it's<00:02:19.760> got<00:02:20.000> high

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
rifle is good at range it's got high

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.110 
rifle is good at range it's got high
power<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:20.960> got<00:02:21.380> good<00:02:21.830> reload<00:02:22.280> good<00:02:22.730> draw

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
power it's got good reload good draw

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.170

speed good fire rate there's nothing bad
really<00:02:26.540> about<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.170> gun<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.860> really<00:02:28.700> enjoyed

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
really about the gun I really enjoyed

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.040 
really about the gun I really enjoyed
using<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:30.740> only<00:02:31.190> slight<00:02:32.150> issue<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.990> I

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
using it the only slight issue that I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.220 
using it the only slight issue that I
have<00:02:33.200> with<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:34.580> recoil<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.540> best

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
have with it is that the recoil the best

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.110 
have with it is that the recoil the best
way<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.500> describe<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.250> kind<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.700> like<00:02:37.850> the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
way to describe it is kind of like the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.140 
way to describe it is kind of like the
mm<00:02:38.959> 14<00:02:39.620> but<00:02:40.070> in<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.280> sense<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.730> it's<00:02:40.940> also

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
mm 14 but in the sense that it's also

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.620 
mm 14 but in the sense that it's also
got<00:02:41.480> vertical<00:02:42.020> route<00:02:42.380> or<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.790> m14<00:02:44.330> has

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
got vertical route or so the m14 has

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.020 
got vertical route or so the m14 has
Rica<00:02:45.350> where<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.620> goes<00:02:45.740> left<00:02:46.100> all<00:02:46.430> right<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.940> it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
Rica where it goes left all right and it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.030 
Rica where it goes left all right and it
just<00:02:47.240> sticks<00:02:47.540> at<00:02:47.810> either<00:02:47.930> one<00:02:48.140> with<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.860> it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
just sticks at either one with this it

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.670 
just sticks at either one with this it
seemed<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.459> go<00:02:49.640> up<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.570> left<00:02:50.870> really<00:02:51.500> high

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
seemed to go up to the left really high

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.920 
seemed to go up to the left really high
or<00:02:51.920> up<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.340> right<00:02:52.550> really<00:02:52.820> high<00:02:53.090> more<00:02:53.720> so

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
or up to the right really high more so

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.590 
or up to the right really high more so
the<00:02:54.050> left<00:02:54.290> but<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:55.070> takes<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.760> bit<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.000> adjusting

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
the left but it takes a bit of adjusting

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.750 
the left but it takes a bit of adjusting
to<00:02:56.840> but<00:02:57.320> I<00:02:57.350> mean<00:02:57.620> once<00:02:57.920> you've<00:02:58.160> got<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.370> is

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
to but I mean once you've got it is

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.390 
to but I mean once you've got it is
really<00:02:59.209> good<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.810> kill<00:03:00.170> people<00:03:00.400> really

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
really good you kill people really

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.770 
really good you kill people really
quickly<00:03:01.790> because<00:03:01.910> it's<00:03:02.090> because<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.690> the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
quickly because it's because of the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.900 
quickly because it's because of the
power<00:03:02.959> it's<00:03:03.260> pretty<00:03:03.800> much<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.100> three<00:03:04.520> shot<00:03:04.700> kill

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
power it's pretty much a three shot kill

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.440 
power it's pretty much a three shot kill
at<00:03:05.030> any<00:03:05.180> range<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:06.010> did<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.310> did<00:03:08.180> pretty<00:03:08.330> well

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
at any range I did I did pretty well

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.390 
at any range I did I did pretty well
with<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.780> when<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:08.959> got<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.709> mean<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.130> was

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
with it when I got it so I mean I was

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.520 
with it when I got it so I mean I was
having<00:03:10.640> fun<00:03:10.880> it's<00:03:11.150> good<00:03:11.420> good<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.050> use<00:03:12.260> it's

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
there people will prefer certain guns

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.280 
there people will prefer certain guns
that<00:03:34.880> have<00:03:34.940> slightly<00:03:35.510> less<00:03:35.810> recoil<00:03:36.140> or<00:03:37.989> say<00:03:38.989> a

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
that have slightly less recoil or say a

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.710 
that have slightly less recoil or say a
slightly<00:03:39.860> faster<00:03:40.100> firing<00:03:40.370> etc<00:03:41.030> etc<00:03:41.090> but<00:03:41.540> I

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
slightly faster firing etc etc but I

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.640

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
preference if you can handle the recoil

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.009 
preference if you can handle the recoil
