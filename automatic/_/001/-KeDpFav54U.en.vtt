00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.660
 good to everyone here with raquel in a 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.219
 new video of animal crossing today I'm going to 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.650
 make a guide about fruits 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.560
 delicious as well says in the video 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:25.030
 previous for those who do not know 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:29.320
 delicious fruits are fruits that are 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:33.699
 peculiar for example apples 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:39.040
 delicious a normal apple is this 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:41.710
 a delicious apple is whole red by 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.060
 the bottom part more clarita and more 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.090
 sparkly 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.110
 the delicious fruits you are going to give 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.680
 account right away because they are more 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.190
 bright are very different but the 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.280
 shape is except the shape of the orange 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:05.300
 They are equal 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.370
 let's continue well the first day you start 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.430
 to play maybe in some of your 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.730
 fruit trees of your town you leave 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.500
 a fruit that is different from the others 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.080
 Well, that will be a delicious fruit 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.350
 in my case the first day that I started 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.870
 to play a delicious fruit came out but 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.720
 Of course I thought that nothing would happen if 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.150
 I took it that I would go out again 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.350
 but it was not like that I ate it and to the day 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.140
 Next he came not to leave anything 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.259
 then some friends of mine told me 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.770
 and then I said good then then the 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.960
 next time I'll be careful how I did not have 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.540
 nothing my friends gave me a peach 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.630
 delicious and I planted it 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.960
 and I came out a tree with fruits 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.510
 delicious in this case peaches os 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.420
 I'm going to teach it so you can see it 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.630
 here it is 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.549
 a normal peach would be Russian but without 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.850
 But this thing with a delicious 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:13.570
 last more or less 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:17.590
 let's continue to see the only fruits 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:22.140
 delicious are 5 peaches pears 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.140
 cherries apples and oranges 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.650
 normally when the first day that 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.230
 you play and it comes out like native fruit what 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.150
 natal fruit means that it is the fruit 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.370
 that since you start to play is the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.340
 that you get for example if you get 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.950
 cherries you know you have to plant 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.990
 a delicious cherry if you plant a 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.050
 delicious peach will not serve 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.590
 nothing 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.130
 and another thing when you shake many times 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.610
 the tree to be able to obtain the fruit 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.160
 you stay like that, do not worry, it cuts 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.790
 jce and go back to brand to plant another 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.590
 delicious fruit 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.590
 well I think I do not forget anything 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.299
 so when after shaking it from sant 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:15.109
 in two delicious fries and a fruit 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:20.480
 Pucha the pochas you have to sell 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:24.200
 because they usually do not pay you but 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.379
 you have to pay a cultured whore by 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.750
 it then better that you throw it away and if 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.970
 you want to plant it, it's not going, it's going to 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.150
 work is already coming to you like it was 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.830
 rotten therefore the pucha you have it 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.290
 to sell because we will serve 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.250
 nothing 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.130
 and another curious thing is that 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.350
 it can be any kind of tree if 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.100
 this heel or fruit if it is a pine a 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.770
 normal weapon when you cut it 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.000
 you may stump the stumps 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:02.350
 normal only have circles and those that 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:09.020
 they are special they have a sheet shape 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:12.470
 zinc of different fruits because they are 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.840
 to be important is good I left not what 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.320
 you take advantage of it because around 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.040
 he leaves these species of mushrooms that 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.070
 usually the ones that are worth the most are these 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.970
 those that are buried and others that are 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.240
 beige so sell because 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.689
 to me at least they come back to me and 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.889
 I am selling 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:41.830
 good , delicious fruit guys, no 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.469
 I have more to say I'll leave 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.360
 saying goodbye to me and this video has been 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:49.449
 very short 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.300
 but nothing happens would follow 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.280
 uploading videos do not worry if you 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.889
 I say that if you are interested in this 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.120
 I sell it to you at a good price 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:04.520
 ok I 'm not going to overdo it 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.849
 you can also make text these up 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.219
 9 fruits that's another thing that I tell you 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:14.029
 in case you do not know because I did not before 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:17.090
 I knew it made three baskets but now 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:20.810
 I make nine which is better 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.150
