00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.160
 do I like this kind of video and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.929
 I found that my outfit today 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.590
 was pretty cool anyway 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.269
 I really like 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.799
 so I wanted to share with you that 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.599
 start small by the make up 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.550
 so I made it very simple I'm doing my 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.980

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.510

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.680
 with le lie leiter winter sun 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.289
 from peggy wise I made my 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.130

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.070

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.260

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.390
 slightly darker of the year worry a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.010
 pure bottom is a little hollow end do 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.219
 a little less than with api super mia 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.760
 simple on the lips I wear a 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.340
 gloss bourgeois diabolic pink no 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.809
 devilish red where I know more too 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.000
 what would I put you the reference in 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.930
 info bar if you're interested 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.640
 my earrings are loops 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.109
 h &amp; m earrings that you can 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.879
 find again I think they are 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.989
 super rebel 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:09.409
 here and on my nails I wear the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.409
 manicure croco golden jungle 2 at dior 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.729
 that's to know they were out of order 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.689
 on sephora nocibe and marionnaud me I 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.880
 found them in my marionnaud 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 avoiding getting one at the south hour 2 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.360
 so here we are, I was so happy 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.259
 but for now on the internet it's 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.509
 break for those interested 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.710
 I'll do a tutorial above 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.659
 since it can swear anything is 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.790
 really far from being that easy 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.329
 seems to ask but really what 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.000
 short I describe you maintained so I 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.920
 wears a kind of little top in matter 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.600
 a little bit this weed from zara where from 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 who is gray 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.220
 gray a little china and mix I like 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.689
 too much and that's the material these rooms 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.509
 In fact, it's very sweet and 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.040
 we are really too good in it 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.570
 there is a big bank of lace on the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.729
 chest and arms 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.020
 it goes around the arm why it s 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.539
 here it takes 39 euros 95 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.710
 he arrived last week in 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.009
 the store so I think we can 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.239
 find it just that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.170
 little trick there are things of the times 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.400
 that you do not find in the store 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.360
 asked a seller because that's 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.470
 often in reserve 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.959
 since we had more all sizes 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.220
 anything negative point for this 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.080
 t-shirts and that there is only one 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.790
 size m it's a unique size so 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.890
 for people who are all 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.890
 came his head do super wide for 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.090
 people who are a little bit more 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.800
 round we'll say that was very much too 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.450
 tight is a little pity I 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.450
 find that it stinks super bowl short 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.980
 here is my pants I wear my 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.600
 slim trousers from promod who had 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.519
 an effect a bit bored over the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.060
 washes the effect is gone which is not 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.350
 no worse 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.480
 here is a slim and to add a 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.700
 little bit of punch to this outfit 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.560
 I wanted to put red shoes 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.900
 since I love red shoes and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.160
 it's never very easy to wear so 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.299
 I thought it was 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.130
 really a touch of color 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.040
 super nice I do not know if you 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.560
 must very very well but hey I think 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.870
 it's super pretty I'll wear this 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.880
 held to answer with canonical lancaster 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.440
 these are the ones you already had 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.880
 showed that it is too beautiful I hesitated 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.959
 with a red bag but I 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.280
 I'm told it's a little bit 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.959
 too much miro just a touch of color 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.579
 here I try to climb in whole it's 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.579
 not won here 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.989
 you will never see lied I believe that 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.500
 I'm going so here's a little bit of that 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.900
 give I think it's super nice this well 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.069
 it's really that's a little 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.080
 not like a sweatshirt but it's really 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.720
 more elegant though a 4.8 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.010
 frankly to tell you this is I 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.730
 do not know what you think but me 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.459
 in any case 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.319
 I really love it's healthy it's 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.380
 comfortable but it's still pretty 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.489
 Here these illegal calls to say here 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.660
 if I make you big kisses I 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.660
 you say to soon hold
