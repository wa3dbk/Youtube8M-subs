all<00:00:00.690> right<00:00:00.840> complex<00:00:01.380> dynamesh<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:02.250> low<00:00:02.610> poly

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
all right complex dynamesh to low poly

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.900 
all right complex dynamesh to low poly
representation<00:00:03.840> so<00:00:04.799> what<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.220> have<00:00:05.460> here<00:00:05.490> is

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
representation so what I have here is

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.930 
representation so what I have here is
mesh<00:00:06.240> made<00:00:06.509> from<00:00:06.810> dynamesh<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.500> if<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.670> look

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
mesh made from dynamesh and if you look

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.980 
mesh made from dynamesh and if you look
at<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.210> poly<00:00:09.510> frame<00:00:09.860> it's<00:00:10.860> got<00:00:11.429> some<00:00:11.610> unique

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
at the poly frame it's got some unique

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.240 
at the poly frame it's got some unique
flow<00:00:12.990> no<00:00:13.590> doubt<00:00:13.769> about<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:15.980> what<00:00:16.980> we're<00:00:17.130> going

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
flow no doubt about it what we're going

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.070 
flow no doubt about it what we're going
to<00:00:17.279> be<00:00:17.400> doing<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.880> taking<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.300> look<00:00:18.449> at<00:00:18.660> how<00:00:19.020> to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
to be doing is taking a look at how to

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.840 
to be doing is taking a look at how to
improve<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.580> how<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.300> get<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> low<00:00:21.810> res

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
improve this and how to get a low res

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.460 
improve this and how to get a low res
the<00:00:23.850> first<00:00:24.090> off<00:00:24.300> know<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.260> uncheck

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the first off know that if you uncheck

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.960 
the first off know that if you uncheck
dynamesh<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.609> go<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:28.250> on<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.670> freeze

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
dynamesh and go to on the freeze

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.990 
dynamesh and go to on the freeze
subdivision<00:00:30.720> levels<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:33.950> levels<00:00:35.010> if

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
subdivision levels we have two levels if

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.150 
subdivision levels we have two levels if
you<00:00:36.090> lower<00:00:36.270> down<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.750> has<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> mask<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.950> can

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
you lower down it has a mask so I can

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.760 
you lower down it has a mask so I can
clear<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.430> now<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.870> problem<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.559> is

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
clear that now the problem with this is

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.280 
clear that now the problem with this is
I<00:00:41.399> won't<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.790> able<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.059> reconstruct<00:00:42.450> subdivide

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
I won't be able to reconstruct subdivide

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.459 
I won't be able to reconstruct subdivide
it<00:00:43.440> okay<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.940> no<00:00:45.210> reconstruct<00:00:45.899> subdivide<00:00:46.350> at

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it okay so no reconstruct subdivide at

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.490 
it okay so no reconstruct subdivide at
that<00:00:46.620> point<00:00:47.210> also<00:00:48.210> notice<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.140> gives<00:00:49.320> out

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that point also notice it gives out

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500 
that point also notice it gives out
anomalies<00:00:50.280> under<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.420> piece<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> let's<00:00:54.059> undo

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
anomalies under the piece so let's undo

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.660 
anomalies under the piece so let's undo
that<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.980> want<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> show<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.489> what

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that I just want to show you what

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.590 
that I just want to show you what
happens<00:01:00.890> instead<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.359> what<00:01:03.359> we're<00:01:03.480> going

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
happens instead of that what we're going

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.380 
happens instead of that what we're going
to<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.140> make<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.949> polymesh3d<00:01:05.540> out<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
to do is make a polymesh3d out of this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.969 
to do is make a polymesh3d out of this
and<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> poly<00:01:10.229> mesh<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.710> notice

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and if I go to the poly mesh you notice

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.230 
and if I go to the poly mesh you notice
that<00:01:11.130> nothing<00:01:11.520> else<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.820> on

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that nothing else is on

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
that nothing else is on
there's<00:01:12.510> no<00:01:12.689> dynamesh<00:01:13.200> there's<00:01:13.470> no<00:01:13.619> nothing

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
there's no dynamesh there's no nothing

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.300 
there's no dynamesh there's no nothing
but<00:01:14.430> none<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.180> anomalies<00:01:15.720> show<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
but none of you anomalies show up on the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.780 
but none of you anomalies show up on the
piece<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.840> still<00:01:19.170> has<00:01:19.350> some<00:01:19.380> pretty<00:01:20.340> jacked<00:01:20.580> up

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
piece it still has some pretty jacked up

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.469 
piece it still has some pretty jacked up
flow<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.720> okay<00:01:23.060> at<00:01:24.060> least<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.390> out

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
flow but that's okay at least it's out

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
flow but that's okay at least it's out
of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> dynamesh<00:01:25.200> mode<00:01:27.710> okay<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
of the dynamesh mode okay I'm going to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.580 
of the dynamesh mode okay I'm going to
go<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.369> step<00:01:29.610> further<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.000> say<00:01:30.479> well<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:31.470> if

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
go one step further and say well what if

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.039 
go one step further and say well what if
I<00:01:31.710> made<00:01:31.979> some<00:01:32.009> surface<00:01:32.729> noise<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.509> so

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
I made some surface noise on to it so

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.920 
I made some surface noise on to it so
I'll<00:01:34.140> divide<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.619> once<00:01:34.939> take<00:01:35.939> smooth<00:01:36.240> off<00:01:38.930> use

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
I'll divide it once take smooth off use

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.920 
I'll divide it once take smooth off use
my<00:01:40.110> mouse<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:41.119> surface<00:01:42.119> noise<00:01:44.869> then<00:01:45.869> I'm

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
my mouse for this surface noise then I'm

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.080 
my mouse for this surface noise then I'm
going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.079> make<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.259> curve<00:01:46.680> again<00:01:47.640> I'm<00:01:47.790> using<00:01:47.909> my

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
going to make a curve again I'm using my

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.690 
going to make a curve again I'm using my
mouse<00:01:48.329> because<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.350> curve<00:01:49.740> menu<00:01:50.579> in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
mouse because I know the curve menu in

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.520 
mouse because I know the curve menu in
here<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.149> use<00:01:51.329> your<00:01:51.540> weeken<00:01:52.200> drawing

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
here if you use your weeken drawing

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.440 
here if you use your weeken drawing
tablets<00:01:52.950> kind<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.250> hard<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> control

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
tablets kind of hard to control

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.350 
tablets kind of hard to control
sometimes<00:01:54.950> it's<00:01:55.950> very<00:01:55.979> sensitive<00:01:59.360> probably

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
sometimes it's very sensitive probably

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.800 
sometimes it's very sensitive probably
turn<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.659> down<00:02:00.869> somewhere<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.560> that's<00:02:01.649> okay

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
turn that down somewhere but that's okay

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.469 
turn that down somewhere but that's okay
okay<00:02:03.810> here's<00:02:04.350> some<00:02:04.530> rust<00:02:05.210> just<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> hit

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
okay here's some rust just going to hit

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.080 
okay here's some rust just going to hit
okay<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> complex<00:02:08.340> part<00:02:08.670> with

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
okay so now I have a complex part with

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.820 
okay so now I have a complex part with
some<00:02:09.539> kind<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.810> surface<00:02:09.989> detail<00:02:11.239> good<00:02:12.239> enough

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.100 

so<00:02:16.830> my<00:02:16.980> main<00:02:17.280> mission<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.030> get<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.720> high<00:02:18.959> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
so my main mission is to get a high and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.920 
so my main mission is to get a high and
low<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:21.030> I'm<00:02:21.239> just<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.690> clone

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
low to do that I'm just going to clone

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.770 
low to do that I'm just going to clone
it<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.340> upend<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.430> back<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:24.000> way<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.450> keep

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
it and upend it back that way I can keep

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.880

this<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.239> go<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.480> decimation<00:02:40.019> master<00:02:41.269> I'll<00:02:42.269> pre

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
this I go to decimation master I'll pre

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.699 
this I go to decimation master I'll pre
process<00:02:43.140> current<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:47.599> then<00:02:48.599> lower<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.680> down

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
process current and then lower it down

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.550

I'm going to try and shoot for a point
zero<00:02:52.829> five<00:02:53.160> generally<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> do<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:54.540> because

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
zero five generally I do this because

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:03.009 
zero five generally I do this because
it's<00:02:55.170> very<00:02:55.230> very<00:02:55.590> low<00:02:57.260> that's<00:02:58.260> pretty<00:02:59.069> low

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:13.470 

okay<00:03:04.019> let's<00:03:04.230> go<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.440> point<00:03:04.769> zero<00:03:05.220> six

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.070 

that's<00:03:14.050> pretty<00:03:14.410> good<00:03:14.590> right<00:03:14.650> there<00:03:19.080> notice

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
that's pretty good right there notice

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.290 
that's pretty good right there notice
the<00:03:20.170> bottom<00:03:20.470> one<00:03:20.620> if<00:03:20.800> I<00:03:20.950> take<00:03:21.250> off<00:03:21.610> on<00:03:22.950> the

surface detail I could

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.930 
surface detail I could
that's<00:03:29.560> not<00:03:29.739> important<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.370> can<00:03:30.610> actually

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
that's not important you can actually

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.729 
that's not important you can actually
lower<00:03:31.120> down<00:03:31.420> with<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.810> surface<00:03:32.170> detail<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:32.709> it

lower down with the surface detail on it

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.790 
lower down with the surface detail on it
or<00:03:33.069> not<00:03:33.849> it'll<00:03:34.630> still<00:03:34.989> work<00:03:35.019> with<00:03:35.380> decimation

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
or not it'll still work with decimation

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.280 
or not it'll still work with decimation
this<00:03:36.790> one<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.000> do<00:03:37.150> want<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.630> apply<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:37.989> though

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
this one I do want to apply it though

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.089 
this one I do want to apply it though
okay<00:03:41.610> next<00:03:42.610> what<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.510> want<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.780> do<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.140> take<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.799> Z

the high to the low let's hit a ok there

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.760 
the high to the low let's hit a ok there
we<00:05:19.080> go<00:05:19.250> now<00:05:20.250> if<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.550> add<00:05:21.320> more<00:05:22.320> density<00:05:22.680> -<00:05:22.950> it

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
we go now if I add more density - it

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.230 
we go now if I add more density - it
takes<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.890> little<00:05:26.040> longer<00:05:26.220> but<00:05:26.580> I<00:05:26.790> get<00:05:27.000> a<00:05:27.030> better

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
takes a little longer but I get a better

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.200 
takes a little longer but I get a better
representation<00:05:27.780> of<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:28.610> okay<00:05:29.610> now<00:05:29.790> check<00:05:29.820> this

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
representation of it okay now check this

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.500 
representation of it okay now check this
out<00:05:30.420> let's<00:05:31.050> go<00:05:31.200> back<00:05:31.590> up<00:05:32.040> here<00:05:32.640> to<00:05:32.910> make

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
out let's go back up here to make

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.700 
out let's go back up here to make
adaptive<00:05:34.050> skin<00:05:35.270> let's<00:05:36.270> go<00:05:36.360> find<00:05:36.600> that<00:05:36.780> skin<00:05:37.110> it

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
adaptive skin let's go find that skin it

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.080 
adaptive skin let's go find that skin it
should<00:05:37.890> be<00:05:37.980> labeled<00:05:38.160> skin<00:05:38.580> up<00:05:38.730> here<00:05:40.730> ok<00:05:41.730> looks

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
should be labeled skin up here ok looks

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.150 
should be labeled skin up here ok looks
just<00:05:42.240> like<00:05:42.420> the<00:05:42.660> one<00:05:42.810> before<00:05:42.990> but<00:05:43.710> this<00:05:43.890> time

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
just like the one before but this time
