paints and this means that they are good
quality<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.980> right<00:01:00.519> one<00:01:00.850> is<00:01:01.089> silver

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
color and then suddenly this left one is

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.880 
color and then suddenly this left one is
not<00:01:06.220> black<00:01:06.550> it<00:01:06.820> is<00:01:06.940> white<00:01:07.620> white<00:01:08.620> paint<00:01:09.100> and

not black it is white white paint and
first<00:01:11.890> thing<00:01:12.190> is<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.820> when<00:01:13.330> we<00:01:13.360> have<00:01:13.780> this

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
first thing is that when we have this

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.160 
first thing is that when we have this
spray<00:01:14.920> paint

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
spray paint

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.090 
spray paint
there<00:01:17.170> is<00:01:17.610> normal<00:01:18.610> issuer<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:20.020> myself<00:01:20.440> that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
there is normal issuer in myself that

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.230 
there is normal issuer in myself that
this<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.270> had<00:01:22.800> his<00:01:23.800> hat<00:01:24.040> is<00:01:24.310> really<00:01:24.790> difficult

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
this is had his hat is really difficult

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.490 
this is had his hat is really difficult
to<00:01:25.780> open<00:01:25.930> normally<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:26.980> this<00:01:27.670> this<00:01:27.940> makes

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to open normally and this this makes

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.020 
to open normally and this this makes
stress<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:30.070> me<00:01:30.250> always<00:01:30.960> next<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.490> saw<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:33.760> how

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
stress to me always next I saw that how

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:43.090 
stress to me always next I saw that how
I<00:01:34.060> opened<00:01:34.840> that

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.980 

and<00:01:43.490> for<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.270> opening<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:45.890> need

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
and for this opening you need

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.660 
and for this opening you need
screwdriver<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.440> there<00:01:48.800> is<00:01:48.950> this<00:01:49.100> idea<00:01:49.400> that

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
screwdriver and there is this idea that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
screwdriver and there is this idea that
this<00:01:50.210> point<00:01:50.710> this<00:01:51.710> must<00:01:52.400> be<00:01:52.729> quite<00:01:53.000> wide

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
this point this must be quite wide

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.530 
this point this must be quite wide
displayed<00:01:54.700> like<00:01:55.700> in<00:01:55.910> here

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
displayed like in here

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.219 
displayed like in here
this<00:01:57.260> is<00:01:57.560> like<00:01:57.830> how<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.490> sees<00:01:58.880> or<00:01:59.229> something

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
this is like how in sees or something

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.550 
this is like how in sees or something
like<00:02:00.440> 1<00:02:01.040> 1<00:02:02.350> centimeter<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.770> this<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.880> part

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
like 1 1 centimeter and this this part

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.820 
like 1 1 centimeter and this this part
fits<00:02:06.560> really<00:02:07.220> well<00:02:07.580> in<00:02:08.000> here<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.959> then<00:02:09.380> then

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
fits really well in here and then then

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.320 
fits really well in here and then then
when<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.250> rotate<00:02:11.209> this<00:02:11.540> my<00:02:12.050> screwdriver<00:02:13.330> then

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
when I rotate this my screwdriver then

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.820 
when I rotate this my screwdriver then
this<00:02:14.600> open<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.750> most<00:02:17.830> part

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
this open and this is that most part

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.180 
this open and this is that most part
listing<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.520> this<00:02:19.760> plain<00:02:20.330> standard<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:22.010> this

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
listing in this plain standard that this

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.199 
listing in this plain standard that this
cut<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.760> difficult<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.450> open<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.650> then<00:02:25.209> next

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
cut is difficult to open and then next

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.600 
cut is difficult to open and then next
step<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:27.050> but<00:02:27.709> we<00:02:27.920> need<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.340> always

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
step is that but we need to always

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.009 
step is that but we need to always
little<00:02:29.540> bit<00:02:29.720> take<00:02:32.440> inside<00:02:33.440> persistence<00:02:35.019> and

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
little bit take inside persistence and

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.470 
little bit take inside persistence and
there<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.380> recommendation<00:02:37.280> Facebook<00:02:37.850> open

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
there is recommendation Facebook open

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.870 
there is recommendation Facebook open
something<00:02:38.930> like<00:02:39.290> 2<00:02:39.560> minutes<00:02:42.489> but<00:02:43.489> because

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
something like 2 minutes but because

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.470 
something like 2 minutes but because
this<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.239> like<00:02:44.450> my<00:02:45.440> lesson<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.190> think<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.700> now

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
this is like my lesson I think that now

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.289 
this is like my lesson I think that now
I<00:02:47.750> am<00:02:47.810> fine<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.500> then<00:02:48.739> next<00:02:49.610> step<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:49.850> look

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
I am fine and then next step that look

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.560 
I am fine and then next step that look
this<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:51.650> point<00:02:52.340> where<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:53.030> spray<00:02:53.540> is

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
this this point where this spray is

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.490 
this this point where this spray is
going<00:02:54.260> out<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.860> don't<00:02:55.430> ever<00:02:56.260> insert<00:02:57.260> this

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
going out and don't ever insert this

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.410 
going out and don't ever insert this
pain<00:02:57.920> against<00:02:58.880> your<00:03:00.010> faces<00:03:01.010> or<00:03:01.310> skin<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.030> then

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
pain against your faces or skin and then

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.360 
pain against your faces or skin and then
you<00:03:02.570> need<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.930> rotate<00:03:03.049> that<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:03.860> way<00:03:04.130> and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
you need to rotate that in this way and

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.970 
you need to rotate that in this way and
there's<00:03:04.610> bad<00:03:04.880> words<00:03:05.239> are<00:03:05.600> oh<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.590> then<00:03:06.799> when

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
there's bad words are oh and then when

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.810 
there's bad words are oh and then when
we<00:03:07.220> press<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:08.140> button<00:03:09.140> then<00:03:09.470> this<00:03:09.820> spray
