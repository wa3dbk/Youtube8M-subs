of like a big event movie we shot the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.770 
of like a big event movie we shot the
film<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.680> 2d<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.189> normal<00:00:32.640> format<00:00:33.330> and<00:00:33.570> then

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
film in 2d like normal format and then

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.439 
film in 2d like normal format and then
when<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.960> finish<00:00:34.730> hundreds<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.820> people<00:00:35.879> come

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
when you finish hundreds of people come

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.049 
when you finish hundreds of people come
in<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.199> break<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.920> apart<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.489> give

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
in and they just break it apart and give

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.439 
in and they just break it apart and give
it<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> dance<00:00:40.790> we've<00:00:41.790> done<00:00:41.940> comparing

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
it all the dance we've done comparing

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.450 
it all the dance we've done comparing
like<00:00:42.720> to<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.049> real<00:00:43.199> camera<00:00:43.589> stuff<00:00:43.830> and<00:00:44.100> I

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
like to the real camera stuff and I

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.280 
like to the real camera stuff and I
think<00:00:44.729> it's<00:00:44.850> better<00:00:45.059> because<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.110> more

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
think it's better because you have more

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.020 
think it's better because you have more
control<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.250> convert<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.670> afterwards

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
control when you convert it afterwards

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.219 
control when you convert it afterwards
you<00:00:48.150> can<00:00:48.269> push<00:00:48.479> things<00:00:48.720> back<00:00:48.780> pull<00:00:49.140> them

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:49.229 
you can push things back pull them

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.380 
you can push things back pull them
forward<00:00:49.409> shape<00:00:49.830> things<00:00:50.159> more<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.729> you<00:00:51.239> can

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
forward shape things more and you can

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.990 
forward shape things more and you can
finesse<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.140> lot<00:00:52.379> more<00:00:52.530> imposed<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:53.699> hoping

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
finesse it a lot more imposed I'm hoping

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
finesse it a lot more imposed I'm hoping
to<00:00:54.299> bring<00:00:54.479> out<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.229> the<00:00:55.409> massiveness<00:00:55.979> of
