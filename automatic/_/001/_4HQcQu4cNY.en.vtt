00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.850 

field<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.240> so<00:03:16.450> vital<00:03:16.990> in<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.470> sense<00:03:17.680> of

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
field is so vital in the sense of

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.100 
field is so vital in the sense of
performance<00:03:18.550> for<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.760> players<00:03:19.000> if<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.810> if

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
performance for the players if the if

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.830 
performance for the players if the if
the<00:03:20.260> pitch<00:03:20.470> isn't<00:03:20.710> right<00:03:21.010> then<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.660> ball

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
the pitch isn't right then the ball

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.660 
the pitch isn't right then the ball
doesn't<00:03:23.020> roll<00:03:23.260> through<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.070> ball<00:03:24.250> bubbles

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
doesn't roll through the ball bubbles

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.610 
doesn't roll through the ball bubbles
and<00:03:24.970> then<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.660> puts<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.990> into<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.320> mind<00:03:26.500> of

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
and then that puts it into the mind of

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.560 
and then that puts it into the mind of
the<00:03:26.680> players<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.250> it's<00:03:27.640> an<00:03:27.790> untrue<00:03:28.060> surface

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
the players that it's an untrue surface

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.870 
the players that it's an untrue surface
and<00:03:28.860> consequently<00:03:29.860> this<00:03:30.010> leads<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.400> players

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
and consequently this leads to players

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.300 
and consequently this leads to players
you<00:03:31.510> know<00:03:31.630> not<00:03:32.080> not<00:03:32.350> performing<00:03:32.890> at<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.070> level

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
you know not not performing at the level

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.180 
you know not not performing at the level
