00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.560
Welcome to the second part of the MiWuLa News Christmas Edition!

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:17.000
There are two new airplanes at the airport.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.680
Gerrit and his Team are testing the Concorde at the moment.

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:23.493
Many features have already been implemented, such as the lowerable nose -

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.700
important for the landing approach and the runway -

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.308
as well as impressive lighting in the jet engines.

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:30.850
It performed well during testing

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.325
and will receive paintwork soon.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.150
Another machine is the now completed, propeller driven Lockheed Super Constellation.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.234
With its four individually selectable propellers

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.594
and paintwork in the original design, it's a real eyecatcher.

00:00:44.787 --> 00:00:48.520
The whole crew of the original airplane was present for the maiden flight,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.825
to accompany the replica's first take-off.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.811
At the Airport Days, the oldtimer days near the Lufthansa-Technik Hangar,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.137
another plane of the past can be found beside the DC-6 and the new Concorde.

00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:09.700
For our funfair in Middle Germany, Holger is working on

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.385
new rides or is restoring the existing ones.

00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:16.622
This section will be filled with even more life than before.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.577
For this purpose, funfair rides are being collected

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:23.170
and equipped with electromechanics and lighting.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.213
Several hundred tiny LEDs are used for each ride.

00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:31.539
A continous operation without errors is an issue here, because

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.715
most components by the original manufacturers are too delicate.

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:38.725
After modification, they are gradually brought back to the layout.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.713
The Wunderland district hopes to draw more visitors this way.

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:46.009
We will keep you informed about this.

00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:51.927
The lighting of our buildings is much more detailled than in our early years.

00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:56.261
Many rooms inside of the buildings can be switched on or off.

00:01:56.598 --> 00:02:01.365
Numerous buildings on the layout are receiving new lighting.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.813
Outdated incandescent bulbs are being replaced by modern LEDs.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.403
They use a lot less electricity while lasting a lot longer.

00:02:10.858 --> 00:02:12.985
The reconstruction of one of our train stations,

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:17.857
the Dammtor Bahnhof in the Hamburg section, is another large-scale project.

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:23.065
The hall is completely redesigned and rebuilt.

00:02:23.197 --> 00:02:26.192
The old station hall is several years old,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.908
and the quality of our models has increased considerably.

00:02:29.146 --> 00:02:32.326
Today, we are replacing things we couldn't do properly in the past

00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:34.402
with more impressive new buildings.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.591
In this case, the whole Dammtor area is being replaced.

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:41.290
From the train tracks to the roof construction to the lighting,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.652
the modelmakers are preparing everything for the coming renovation.

00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:50.448
Even the station's stone ornaments and adornments are being recreated.

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.940
The static construction of the building is very sophisticated

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.040
because it serves to actually stabilise the miniature.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.905
The goal is to be able to look into the large glass windows

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:02.521
and see far into the station hall.

00:03:02.674 --> 00:03:07.280
Benches for visitors and information schedules at the platform 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.098
are only a few of the countless details to be found here.

00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:15.834
The polar sea in Scandinavia has finally been renovated.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:19.414
The many hours in constant operation have taken their toll

00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:23.114
on the sensitive water surface in the past years.

00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:26.687
It was time for an overhaul.

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:32.726
Stefan explains why this work led to the complete removal of the surface panel:

00:03:32.942 --> 00:03:34.383
This is the old panel for the polar sea.

00:03:34.932 --> 00:03:40.748
We levered this out to remove the old water surface.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.487
We sealed it with blue paint.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.425
Then we repainted it.

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.700
Then we added a special kind of clear laquer,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.805
to avoid bubbles when we pour.

00:03:51.842 --> 00:03:56.390
Unfortunately, this clear laquer didn't agree with the base coat and soaked through.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.430
That's how this damage was caused - it foamed up.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.550
The surface became frizzy, no way you can pour on it now.

00:04:05.873 --> 00:04:12.656
It would take the three times as many hours to remove this than

00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:17.107
to just replace the whole thing.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.623
And whose fault is it?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.775
Now we also have better quality here,

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:27.400
and with a new and easily replacable plexiglass plate, we hope to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.696
keep this part of the layout in even better shape.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.606
A lot of the old technology was replaced.

00:04:33.826 --> 00:04:37.864
Stefan explains how our Flying Dutchman works:

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:41.157
This is the magnet that pulls the ship above.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.216
When I pick up the ship, you see:

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:49.224
There's another magnet up here, similar to our cars.

00:04:49.612 --> 00:04:54.119
To charge the ship - for the lighting -

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.920
there are two contacts below.

00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:06.084
Inside are gold cap capacitors that supply the LEDs.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.658
It drives automatically on these contact strips

00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:13.909
and then reaches its charging position.

00:05:14.068 --> 00:05:17.700
It charges just enough to go another round,

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.477
charges again, and so on.

00:05:20.835 --> 00:05:27.170
New details such as seals, polar bears, ice floes and icebergs

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.874
fill the scene with life.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.500
On Christmas Eve, all children under the age of 16 are traditionally

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.018
let into the Miniatur Wunderland free of charge.

00:05:37.173 --> 00:05:39.430
Come visit us with your loved ones

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.413
and enjoy your free hours before the celebration.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.809
We are open on that day until 4 PM.

00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:48.000
After years of experience, we suggest to look up our waiting times

00:05:48.073 --> 00:05:53.705
during the holidays and between Christmas and New Year.

00:05:53.836 --> 00:05:58.018
You can use the internet to book free of charge to avoid waiting times.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.440
If you can't decide on an exact time beforehand,

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.989
try to come in the morning or evenig time.

00:06:03.285 --> 00:06:05.647
Usually, there is hardly any waiting time during these hours.

00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:09.143
We have extended our opening hours during most of the holiday season.

00:06:09.463 --> 00:06:12.721

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.050
We wish you and your loved ones

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.700
a wonderful Christmas and a Happy New Year,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.193
