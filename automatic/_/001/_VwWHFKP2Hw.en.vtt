00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.150 
obviously a little bit of mesh something
that's<00:03:33.630> light<00:03:33.900> but<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.739> one<00:03:34.890> thing<00:03:35.040> about

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
that's light but the one thing about

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.870 
that's light but the one thing about
wearing<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.579> hat<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:36.030> trail<00:03:36.660> runs<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:38.010> when

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
wearing a hat on trail runs is that when

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.640 
wearing a hat on trail runs is that when
you're<00:03:38.970> running<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.390> woods<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:40.350> tends<00:03:40.560> to

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
you're running in the woods it tends to

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.920 
you're running in the woods it tends to
be<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.799> lot<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.100> reflection<00:03:41.750> bouncing<00:03:42.750> off<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
be a lot of reflection bouncing off the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.599 
be a lot of reflection bouncing off the
leaves<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.620> when<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.829> Sun<00:03:44.040> comes<00:03:44.190> through<00:03:44.459> and

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
leaves of when the Sun comes through and

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:45.949 
leaves of when the Sun comes through and
that<00:03:44.700> can<00:03:44.850> be<00:03:44.880> distracting<00:03:45.299> when<00:03:45.630> your<00:03:45.750> trail

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
that can be distracting when your trail

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.900 
that can be distracting when your trail
running<00:03:46.230> because<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.190> causes<00:03:47.370> kind<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.820> a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
running because it causes kind of a

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.210 
running because it causes kind of a
dancing<00:03:48.359> effect<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.590> can<00:03:49.709> distract<00:03:50.040> your

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
dancing effect and it can distract your

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.819 
dancing effect and it can distract your
attention<00:03:50.519> from<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.660> trail<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.500> you're<00:03:52.709> on

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
attention from the trail that you're on

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.180 
attention from the trail that you're on
and<00:03:53.459> can<00:03:53.670> even<00:03:53.790> cause<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.959> trip<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.859> a

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
and can even cause you to to a trip so a

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.199 
and can even cause you to to a trip so a
brim<00:03:56.519> will<00:03:57.120> help<00:03:57.299> keep<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:58.010> reflection<00:03:59.209> off

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
brim will help keep that reflection off

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.300 
brim will help keep that reflection off
a<00:04:00.269> little<00:04:00.600> bit<00:04:00.780> more<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.350> have<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.100> a<00:04:02.160> little

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
a little bit more and have you a little

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.880 
a little bit more and have you a little
bit<00:04:02.400> more<00:04:02.519> stable<00:04:02.790> in<00:04:03.120> your<00:04:03.480> running<00:04:04.140> on<00:04:04.260> the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
bit more stable in your running on the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.069 
bit more stable in your running on the
trails<00:04:05.190> but<00:04:06.180> one<00:04:06.329> thing<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:06.660> do<00:04:06.870> want<00:04:06.989> to

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
trails but one thing that you do want to

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.660 
trails but one thing that you do want to
think<00:04:07.260> about<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.829> socks<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.459> wear

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
think about is the socks that you wear

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.520 
think about is the socks that you wear
now<00:04:09.269> just<00:04:09.510> like<00:04:09.690> road<00:04:09.900> running<00:04:10.139> you<00:04:10.319> want<00:04:10.470> to

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
now just like road running you want to

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.740 
now just like road running you want to
make<00:04:10.650> sure<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.980> they<00:04:11.130> fit<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:12.150> they're<00:04:12.420> the

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
make sure that they fit that they're the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.330 
make sure that they fit that they're the
right<00:04:12.930> thickness<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.620> go<00:04:13.739> with<00:04:13.920> your<00:04:14.069> shoes

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
right thickness that go with your shoes

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.430 
right thickness that go with your shoes
so<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:14.880> don't<00:04:15.060> have<00:04:15.239> as<00:04:15.480> much<00:04:15.959> slipping

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
so that you don't have as much slipping

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.750 
so that you don't have as much slipping
around<00:04:16.560> particularly<00:04:17.220> when<00:04:17.489> you're<00:04:17.609> running

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
around particularly when you're running

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.090 
around particularly when you're running
on<00:04:17.880> trails<00:04:18.180> because<00:04:19.109> your<00:04:19.440> foot<00:04:19.650> is<00:04:19.739> going<00:04:19.829> to

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
on trails because your foot is going to

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.860 
on trails because your foot is going to
be<00:04:20.250> slipping<00:04:21.090> around<00:04:21.209> you're<00:04:21.630> going<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.810> be

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
be slipping around you're going to be

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.659 
be slipping around you're going to be
doing<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.080> lot<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.260> rocking<00:04:23.010> forward<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.550> aft

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
doing a lot of rocking forward and aft

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.790 
doing a lot of rocking forward and aft
and<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> sides<00:04:24.390> so<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.229> don't<00:04:25.440> want<00:04:25.650> this

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
and to the sides so you don't want this

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800 
and to the sides so you don't want this
foot<00:04:26.099> slipping<00:04:26.610> inside<00:04:26.789> the<00:04:27.180> shoe<00:04:27.419> so<00:04:27.630> you

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
foot slipping inside the shoe so you

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.129 
foot slipping inside the shoe so you
a nice<00:04:28.080> snug<00:04:28.440> fit<00:04:29.150> but<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.300> socks<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.810> also
