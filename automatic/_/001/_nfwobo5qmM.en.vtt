00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:09.680
 we come back with more 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:14.970
 rural abc this block is presented by 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.760
 North supply in other programs we saw the 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.070
 breeding of bees and also of the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.550
 preparation of the cells and breeding of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.400
 queens 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.259
 now with engineer Juan Ramón 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.240
 martínez and the engineer mario quiñones 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.579
 will show us how the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.140
 extraction and delivery of queens for their 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.140
 breed in other drawers 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.469
 in a previous program we had them 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.809
 shown how the 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.059
 future bees queens and how they were 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.039
 placed inside the real cells for 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.870
 its subsequent development this meticulous 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.269
 work is to follow 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.850
 reproducing hives with a genetic 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.339
 improved since in our country there is no 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.010
 there are many people who dedicate themselves 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:07.539
 to the production of queen bees we are 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.700
 in ypacaraí km 45 route 2 company juice and 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:13.420
 specifically today what we are going to do 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.050
 is a delivery of real cells to calin 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.119
 gender 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.069
 chiñones for the faculty of agronomy and 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.409
 It's the real ones that I 'm going to 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:22.210
 prepare more because it's important 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.460
 reproduce queens what I'm going to 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.830
 deliver a queen improved is that I 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.049
 I have the queen mother that Italian and 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.759
 that olvera law I'm reproducing the 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.740
 Queen that I am giving now 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.869
 according to what was indicated by don juan 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.940
 martínez the time it takes to 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.069
 develop a queen inside a drawer 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.090
 to then be taken to another drawer 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:45.200
 of breeding is approximately 15 days 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.960
 he explained 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.090
 the breeding of queens for a long time and 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.219
 that provides the material to the faculty of 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.219
 agronomy of the one as well as others 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.320
 beekeepers later we saw how it 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.539
 performs activity that explains the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.399
 engineer mario quiñones in what is 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.069
 doing now Mr. martinez the 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.500
 revision is the nurse hive that already 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.080
 has grace had already introduced a 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.030
 transfer box for the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.110
 production in real cells for the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.480
 queen gras 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.200
 then what to extract is extracting 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.019
 now with the real cells already 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.329
 completely built with the process of 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.880
 development of the larvae that is already 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.579
 transformed into pupae and return to 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.400
 introduce this new box 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.950
 transfer so that the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.860
 production of real cells that is the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.170
 process then what he is bringing 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.739
 now they are the real cells already 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.069
 finished as to lead to introduce 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.030
 in specially prepared cores 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.260
 for this job that breeding work 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.569
 of queens 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.579
 as you will see here the cells 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:01.129
 reals are fully developed 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.950
 and sealed so that you can already 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.040
 transport to any place in the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.069
 very careful conditions because the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.870
 real cells are delicate then what 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.760
 which you are doing Mr. Martinez and 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.269
 enter again a box of 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.970
 transfer and it will start over 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.640
 the process of cell construction 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.379
 real the engineer stressed that the 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.049
 Queens production is a job 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:30.620
 quite complicated the transfer of 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:34.040
 long a very delicate job because 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.829
 with a little careless the long one can 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.590
 be damaged and in that case the workers 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.980
 nurses no longer accept in a way that 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.239
 It depends a lot on us we call it 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.430
 transfer the one that does the 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.480
 long transfer must have 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.049
 a very soft hand so that the larvae 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.970
 can not be damaged then we saw how is the 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.860
 process for the transfer of the bees 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.260
 queens 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.230
 how are these real cells do I have to 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.020
 move to san lorenzo we are of 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.370
 pacará and I carry in a box of isopor 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.460
 with cotton and you have to take care not 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.790
 hitting during transport and 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.150
 also temperature change that's why it's 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.240
 that we carry a isopor box to 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.430
 that as far as possible, there is no change in 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.860
 temperature you have to take into account that 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.430
 inside the hive one keeps 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.220
 temperature of 34 35 degrees centigrade 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.820
 so that the real cells also 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.250
 if possible, it should be transported in 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.620
 preserved form because the change of 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.750
 temperature may be that the future 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.960
 Queen may die inside the cell 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.380
 real and you do not have the desired success but 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.970
 are what we were not accepted 12 capsules 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.070
 they did not accept because the larvae 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.710
 surely the engineer had a problem 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.510
 He explained why it is important how 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.479
 of the capsules that 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.040
 they contain the queens another care that is 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.110
 have to have 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.390
 the real cell can not be grabbed from 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.380
 here but in the real cell you have to 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.870
 grab the base and hold this position 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.210
 in this position it must be maintained because 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.280
 the queen is the head of the queen 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.550
 up here at the tip of the actual cell 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.220
 then if we turn around we invest 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.890
 the queen can fall in the background and for 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.160
 his birth can already be difficult 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.350
 that's why you have to have this attention the 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.080
 engineer mario quiñones stressed that 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.690
 according to the data that only the 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.450
 Mr. Juan Ramón Martínez and the Ipta de 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.180
 blood does not produce queens currently 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.880
 we have very good relations with the 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.100
 Mr. Martinez, which is the private sector 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.680
 and we who are from the institute 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.200
 Paraguayan agricultural technology ipta no 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.470
 we do not have a beekeeping program and 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.750
 this beekeeping program is 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.600
 producing improved genetic material 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.390
 royal forests for the producers myself 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.210
 I think Mr. Martinez and we 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.670
 of ipsa we are the only ones who are 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.520
 producing bio material improved 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.190
 of the country so that is a 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.430
 invaluable cooperation what is not 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:21.370
 doing Mr. Martinez in the aspect 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.280
 of carrying an improved living material already 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.950
 that he has a queen mother of the line 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.980
 Italian and how we are 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.790
 working in that line I'm taking 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.450
 this 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.430
 this material alive improved so that 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.850
 we can make him add 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.370
 also and produce real cells for 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:45.160
 the producers of the line with blood 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.650
 Italian since we have a line 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.810
 africanizada quite aggressive that 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.090
 a bit difficult work finally 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.750
 Mr. Martinez explained that he can 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.400
 receive the visit of interested parties I received 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.770
 lots of visits especially from 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.430
 university that are private like being 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.960
 san carlos university columbia 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.390
 coming north university soon 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.860
 I have also projects or whether I 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.780
 they are applying for the other university 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.460
 who want to come true but if not 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.050
 I have so much work there is no 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.460
 I am going to receive everything 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.889
 they are interested in 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.970
 and see the old the improved breed that 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:21.250
 I'm having now that I'm 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.740
 producing but I expect more from the 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.960
 government that I expect more from the government 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.750
 because if at least one works in a way 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.000
 it is very profitable you can live without 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.940
 no problem can live to the 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.759
 people say there is no work but when 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:40.740
 one wants can this block was 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:40.740
 presented by northern supply
