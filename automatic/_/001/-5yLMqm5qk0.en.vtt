insole

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.020 
insole
there<00:00:41.900> isn't<00:00:42.020> much<00:00:42.170> arch<00:00:42.770> there<00:00:43.220> not<00:00:43.850> much

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
there isn't much arch there not much

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.990 
there isn't much arch there not much
support<00:00:44.510> it's<00:00:44.930> pretty<00:00:45.200> basic<00:00:45.410> I<00:00:45.920> actually<00:00:46.640> got

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
support it's pretty basic I actually got

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.080 
support it's pretty basic I actually got
the<00:00:47.149> shoe<00:00:47.360> for<00:00:47.570> $30<00:00:48.260> pretty<00:00:48.890> cheap<00:00:49.190> right<00:00:49.310> the

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
the shoe for $30 pretty cheap right the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.970 
the shoe for $30 pretty cheap right the
reason<00:00:50.390> I<00:00:50.480> use<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:50.870> for<00:00:51.170> weight<00:00:51.350> lifting<00:00:51.800> is

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
reason I use this for weight lifting is

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.490 
reason I use this for weight lifting is
because<00:00:52.790> there<00:00:53.300> isn't<00:00:53.660> any<00:00:53.780> cushion<00:00:54.260> to

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
because there isn't any cushion to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.610 
because there isn't any cushion to
absorb<00:00:54.640> my<00:00:55.640> lifting<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:56.930> I<00:00:56.960> feel<00:00:57.290> all<00:00:57.469> the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
absorb my lifting so I feel all the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.900 
absorb my lifting so I feel all the
weight<00:00:57.770> in<00:00:57.920> my<00:00:57.950> heels<00:00:58.340> just<00:00:58.460> like<00:00:58.730> I<00:00:58.850> should

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
weight in my heels just like I should

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.110 
weight in my heels just like I should
and<00:00:59.270> this<00:00:59.719> right<00:00:59.930> here<00:01:00.320> is<00:01:00.530> my<00:01:01.070> cardio<00:01:01.760> and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
and this right here is my cardio and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.600 
and this right here is my cardio and
running<00:01:02.510> shoe<00:01:02.800> now<00:01:03.800> this<00:01:03.950> shoe<00:01:04.159> is<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.309> little

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.219 
running shoe now this shoe is a little
bit<00:01:04.729> more<00:01:04.879> expensive<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.570> think<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:05.930> ran<00:01:06.079> about

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
I have a higher arch so I made sure that

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.219 
I have a higher arch so I made sure that
when<00:01:34.279> I<00:01:34.340> bought<00:01:34.639> my<00:01:34.819> running<00:01:35.149> shoe<00:01:35.389> it<00:01:35.869> fit

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
properly one of the biggest problems

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.620 
properly one of the biggest problems
people<00:01:40.219> will<00:01:40.520> have<00:01:40.729> when<00:01:41.029> buying<00:01:41.240> running

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
people will have when buying running

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.679 
people will have when buying running
shoes<00:01:41.899> is<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.979> their<00:01:43.369> arch<00:01:43.639> doesn't<00:01:44.299> fit<00:01:44.479> the

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
shoes is that their arch doesn't fit the

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.749 
shoes is that their arch doesn't fit the
support<00:01:45.109> in<00:01:45.259> there<00:01:45.469> so<00:01:45.979> if<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.249> have<00:01:46.459> a<00:01:46.490> high

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
support in there so if you have a high

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.359 
support in there so if you have a high
arch<00:01:46.789> don't<00:01:47.509> buy<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.689> low<00:01:48.079> arch<00:01:48.289> shoe<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.950> vice
