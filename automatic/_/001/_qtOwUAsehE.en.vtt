00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.240
 investment there are 16 million people 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.240
 living in extreme poverty 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.740
 There was a lot of commotion bone that good for 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.160
 patriotism and people were happy 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.050
 but there was always a lot of response 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.329
 because the history of the games 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.270
 previous in other countries in South Africa 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.219
 for example, the 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.110
 results that they invested in 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:40.610
 infrastructure for games that 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:43.270
 will remain there without benefiting the population 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.270
 so 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.179
 the idea of ​​the fifa world cup was that 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.690
 various cities in the country were seen 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.690
 the games 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.620
 that these events 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.850
 could bring benefits to the population 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.250
 in terms of infrastructure of 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.730
 transport 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.320
 I do not know how everything would be to 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.950
 environment 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.180
 to seal is then on the metrobus 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.510
 is 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.940
 even structural improvements with the 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.790
 silver that would come from the games 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.190
 and what happened during the years 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.530
 that the works will be delayed 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.200
 and obviously good they stayed more and more 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.620
 faces then there was a lot of investment 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.900
 public in the stadiums be a paolo for 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.340
 example I would have already had three 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.539
 large stadiums 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.960
 a room with more than 500 was built 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.210
 public real millions 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.930
 so 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.360
 there there was I do not know an intervention in the 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.030
 city ​​in new stadium areas 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.560
 how benefiting 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.560
 a private event 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.120
 as the uncertainty of policies 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.340
 public services greatly affect the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.260
 families because you have there a 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.270
 settlement that is that exists 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.600
 in 10 years or more 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.910
 and the villagers 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.780
 will hear from someone can be from 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.380
 public power or a politician or not 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.900
 I know who out there where his 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.350
 settlement will pass an avenue or 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.350
 our 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.349
 and not easy access to information 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:52.739
 of future projects of the municipality 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:55.950
 of the state then what happens is that 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.590
 them as they spend several years living in 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.400
 the uncertainty then for many times 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.739
 some by the residents and neighbors 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.680
 have the possibility to invest in their 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.080
 housing but they do not do it because they do not 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.680
 they know how long they can stay and 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:19.860
 then that on the one hand and on the other that 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.660
 as to create the bone structure of 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.480
 roads 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:30.420
 works of 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.420
 I do not know secondary to stadiums 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.439
 there was a lot of violation of the rights of 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:41.010
 the family in terms of staying in 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.870
 the land where they were there was no no 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.560
 will follow the processes recommended by 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.540
 the un for negotiation for the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.790
 follow up of the family for 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.819
 generation of capabilities that 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.519
 they allowed her to develop 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.739
 then what happened is that good will 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.300
 we take from here we send you to another place 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.520
 further away 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.520
 and that's it or no dialogue
