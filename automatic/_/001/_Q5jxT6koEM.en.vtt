with<00:00:19.859> cross-country<00:00:20.520> flying<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.300> might<00:00:21.480> want

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
with cross-country flying you might want

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.380 
with cross-country flying you might want
to<00:00:21.779> go<00:00:21.900> cross-country<00:00:22.470> flying<00:00:23.250> through<00:00:24.180> all

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390

for Grandma but one of the things you
got<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> learn<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.399> how<00:00:33.000> much<00:00:33.450> weight<00:00:33.960> will

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
got to learn is how much weight will

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.370 
got to learn is how much weight will
this<00:00:34.559> airplane<00:00:35.070> take<00:00:36.050> considering<00:00:37.050> how<00:00:37.200> much

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
this airplane take considering how much

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.280

fuel you put in there how much everybody

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.670 
fuel you put in there how much everybody
ways<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.300> airplane<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.930> only<00:00:43.110> carry<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
ways and the airplane can only carry so

much<00:00:44.100> weight<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.760> after<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.840> airplane

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
much weight and after that the airplane

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.860 
much weight and after that the airplane
will<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:47.100> fly<00:00:47.809> we<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:50.090> loading<00:00:51.090> graft<00:00:51.420> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
what the airplane will do it's going to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.240 
what the airplane will do it's going to
take<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> longer<00:01:36.299> roll<00:01:37.170> down<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.829> runway

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
take a longer roll down the runway

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.340 
take a longer roll down the runway
before<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.850> climbs<00:01:39.299> before<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.110> get<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
before it climbs before you can get it

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.719 
before it climbs before you can get it
off<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.680> runway<00:01:41.040> because<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.549> got<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
off the runway because you got the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.389 
off the runway because you got the
forward<00:01:42.390> weight<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> airplane<00:01:43.290> too<00:01:44.040> far

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
forward weight of the airplane too far

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
forward weight of the airplane too far
forward<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.270> doesn't<00:01:45.720> want<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
forward and it just doesn't want to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.219 
forward and it just doesn't want to
climb<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.250> other<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.909> called<00:01:48.229> FCG

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
climb and the other one is called FCG

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.510 
climb and the other one is called FCG
and<00:01:49.820> FCG<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.970> probably<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> most<00:01:51.810> serious<00:01:52.590> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and FCG is probably the most serious you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.030 
and FCG is probably the most serious you
do<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.479> load<00:01:54.689> aircraft<00:01:55.290> f<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.920> is

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
do not like the load aircraft f there is

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.700 
do not like the load aircraft f there is
a<00:01:56.070> couple<00:01:56.520> benefits<00:01:57.090> you'll<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> faster

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
a couple benefits you'll get a faster

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.469 
a couple benefits you'll get a faster
airspeed<00:01:59.369> out<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.759> an<00:01:59.850> airplane<00:02:00.030> that's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
airspeed out of an airplane that's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.410 
airspeed out of an airplane that's
loaded<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.140> nap<00:02:01.439> CG<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> worst<00:02:03.210> thing

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
loaded with a nap CG but the worst thing

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.780 
loaded with a nap CG but the worst thing
is<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.110> you'll<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> higher<00:02:04.890> stall<00:02:05.340> speed

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
is is you'll have a higher stall speed

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.670 
is is you'll have a higher stall speed
and<00:02:06.060> you'll<00:02:06.299> have<00:02:06.479> more<00:02:06.689> violent<00:02:07.380> stall

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and you'll have more violent stall

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.390 
and you'll have more violent stall
characteristics<00:02:08.629> so<00:02:09.629> again<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.649> teach<00:02:10.920> stalls

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
characteristics so again we teach stalls

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.180 
characteristics so again we teach stalls
but<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.180> also<00:02:12.390> want<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
but we also want to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.310 
but we also want to
eat<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.520> not<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.030> load<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.510> aircraft<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.260> you

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
eat you not to load the aircraft so you

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.270 
eat you not to load the aircraft so you
get<00:02:15.620> into<00:02:16.040> an<00:02:16.280> F<00:02:17.030> CG<00:02:17.960> or<00:02:18.220> nasty<00:02:19.330> violent<00:02:20.330> stall

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
get into an F CG or nasty violent stall

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.610 
get into an F CG or nasty violent stall
characteristic<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:22.940> during<00:02:23.630> your<00:02:24.020> practice

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
characteristic so during your practice

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.330 
characteristic so during your practice
we<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.490> weight<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.090> balances<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.080> also<00:02:27.340> a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
we do weight and balances this is also a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.150 
we do weight and balances this is also a
pre<00:02:28.970> requirement<00:02:29.720> for<00:02:29.990> your<00:02:30.200> checkride<00:02:30.530> you

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
pre requirement for your checkride you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.060 
pre requirement for your checkride you
will<00:02:31.340> do<00:02:31.610> your<00:02:32.510> cross<00:02:32.810> country<00:02:33.200> procedures

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
will do your cross country procedures

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.250 
will do your cross country procedures
and<00:02:34.400> you'll<00:02:34.610> go<00:02:34.820> out<00:02:34.850> with<00:02:35.000> an<00:02:35.420> examiner<00:02:35.840> and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
and you'll go out with an examiner and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.380 
and you'll go out with an examiner and
do<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.410> cross<00:02:36.680> country<00:02:36.980> you'll<00:02:37.730> also<00:02:37.940> do<00:02:38.360> a

do a cross country you'll also do a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.170 
do a cross country you'll also do a
practice<00:02:38.750> weight<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.470> balance<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.220> you'll

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
practice weight and balance and you'll

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.630 
practice weight and balance and you'll
