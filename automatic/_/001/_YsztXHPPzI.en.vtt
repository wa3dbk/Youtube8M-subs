00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
also be nice transition piece for fall
too<00:01:20.700> while<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.119> still<00:01:21.360> kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.720> warm<00:01:21.990> but

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
too while it's still kind of warm but

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.289 
too while it's still kind of warm but
you<00:01:22.439> still<00:01:22.710> want<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.890> wear<00:01:23.009> scarves<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.790> then

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you still want to wear scarves and then

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.910 
you still want to wear scarves and then
the<00:01:24.420> second<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:25.020> got<00:01:25.170> me<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.530> super

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the second one they got me is super

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.530 
the second one they got me is super
pretty<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.549> kind<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.850> reminds<00:01:27.150> me<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.390> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
pretty to it kind of reminds me of a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.069 
pretty to it kind of reminds me of a
peacock<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> looks<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:30.150> basically

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
peacock and it looks like this basically

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
peacock and it looks like this basically
it's<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> peacock

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it's like a kind of like a peacock

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.140 
it's like a kind of like a peacock
peacock<00:01:33.750> pattern<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.710> Navy<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
peacock pattern with like Navy and I

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.490 
peacock pattern with like Navy and I
think<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.049> pretty<00:01:37.229> too

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
think that this is really pretty too

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.780 
think that this is really pretty too
because<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.009> fall<00:01:38.250> colors<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.759> well

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
because it's like fall colors as well

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.030 
because it's like fall colors as well
you<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.720> still<00:01:39.990> wear<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.380> summer<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.920> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you can still wear in the summer if you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.649 
you can still wear in the summer if you
want<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:41.970> light<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.329> this

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
want and it's just really light and this

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.810 
want and it's just really light and this
one's<00:01:42.899> really<00:01:43.320> long<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.070> love<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.700 
one's really long so I love that and
then<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> third<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.689> they<00:01:45.990> got<00:01:46.170> meat<00:01:46.470> is

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
then the third one they got meat is

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.710 
then the third one they got meat is
really<00:01:47.130> light<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.670> well<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.420> looks<00:01:48.630> like

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189

looks like floral mixed with no it's

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.850 
looks like floral mixed with no it's
floral<00:02:33.660> but<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.230> kind<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.470> feels<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.739> an

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
floral but it kind of feels like an

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.290 
floral but it kind of feels like an
animal<00:02:35.130> print<00:02:35.400> pattern<00:02:35.519> throughout<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.269> and

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
animal print pattern throughout it and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.259 
animal print pattern throughout it and
then<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:37.019> me<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.680> end<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.340> has<00:02:38.849> like<00:02:39.090> these

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
then in me on the end and has like these

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.949 
then in me on the end and has like these
little<00:02:39.599> like<00:02:40.049> lace<00:02:41.120> crocheted<00:02:42.120> these<00:02:42.780> aren't

well<00:05:51.690> I<00:05:51.720> mean<00:05:51.870> I<00:05:51.960> think<00:05:51.990> it's<00:05:52.199> cotton<00:05:52.560> but<00:05:52.949> it

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
well I mean I think it's cotton but it

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.620 
well I mean I think it's cotton but it
kind<00:05:53.250> of<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:53.490> materials<00:05:53.970> just<00:05:54.180> look<00:05:54.330> really

that it's super super comfortable and

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.060 
that it's super super comfortable and
yeah<00:06:00.659> it's<00:06:00.810> cotton<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.349> polyester<00:06:01.680> that's

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
yeah it's cotton and polyester that's

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.620 
yeah it's cotton and polyester that's
something<00:06:02.340> special<00:06:02.669> but<00:06:02.760> it's<00:06:02.909> really<00:06:03.389> soft

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
something special but it's really soft

it<00:06:37.540> looks<00:06:37.690> like<00:06:37.870> and<00:06:38.080> then<00:06:38.620> i<00:06:38.890> have<00:06:38.920> like<00:06:39.220> a

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
it looks like and then i have like a

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.070 
it looks like and then i have like a
weighted<00:06:39.730> hula<00:06:39.910> hoop<00:06:40.240> that<00:06:40.270> my<00:06:40.600> mom<00:06:40.780> gave<00:06:41.020> me

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
weighted hula hoop that my mom gave me

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.230 
weighted hula hoop that my mom gave me
because<00:06:41.560> she<00:06:41.770> tried<00:06:42.010> it<00:06:42.220> but<00:06:42.340> she<00:06:43.120> actually

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
because she tried it but she actually

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.490 
because she tried it but she actually
gave<00:06:43.510> it<00:06:43.660> to<00:06:43.720> me<00:06:43.870> which<00:06:44.020> is<00:06:44.140> really<00:06:44.410> fun

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
gave it to me which is really fun

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.260 
gave it to me which is really fun
because<00:06:44.920> hula<00:06:45.280> hooping<00:06:45.640> just<00:06:45.820> reminds<00:06:46.120> you<00:06:46.210> of

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
because hula hooping just reminds you of

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.240 
because hula hooping just reminds you of
childhood<00:06:46.840> and<00:06:46.990> then<00:06:47.500> you<00:06:47.950> know<00:06:48.040> it's

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
childhood and then you know it's

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.350 
childhood and then you know it's
weighted<00:06:48.640> hula<00:06:48.790> hoop<00:06:49.000> so<00:06:49.150> you're<00:06:49.270> actually

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
weighted hula hoop so you're actually

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.150 
weighted hula hoop so you're actually
getting<00:06:49.630> exercise<00:06:50.110> so<00:06:50.560> i'm<00:06:50.620> gonna<00:06:50.740> try<00:06:50.950> that

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.400 
getting exercise so i'm gonna try that
out<00:06:51.220> and<00:06:51.580> then<00:06:52.000> we'll<00:06:52.630> see<00:06:52.840> what<00:06:52.990> goes<00:06:53.230> from
