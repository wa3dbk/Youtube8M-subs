00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.160
 Welcome back to stars and showcase 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.370
 planetary systems today is about that 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.730
 cooling system the tariff system is a whole 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.609
 system of the central star is one 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.760
 nova the so-called dying star around the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.070
 six planets circle data 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.039
 the power system is between the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.900
 systems taralis and minden to which it 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.239
 also has a respective jump point 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.010
 by the nova is in the center 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.989
 However, the radiation load is very high 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.730
 high so you only with the strongest 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.860
 Shield through the system 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.829
 can fly and it is very rare 1 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.200
 Trade route is used data for 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.300
 settlement the power system is almost 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 completely uninhabited none of the six 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.410
 planets also offers only the rudimentary 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.000
 possibility of settlement only the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.460
 rest in a deserted station 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.730
 terraforming station in orbit of cairo 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.149
 6 is outlaws pirate and triftern 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.070
 used as a retreat is therefore the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.350
 economic power of the power system almost 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.970
 completely neglecting to find it 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.170
 not worth mentioning in the system 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.790
 resources more 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.210
 the few occurred within 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.110
 of five years completely used up 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.150
 however, it can be found on the u1 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.280
 station a small black market on the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.650
 according to rumors even nuclear weapons 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.330
 can acquire the quality of life in 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.320
 paris system is conceivably bad 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.479
 apart from the high 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.579
 radiation load in the system itself 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.590
 There are no habitable areas there 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.390
 Planets and the ruins station is one 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.970
 lawless place in the murder and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.920
 homicide prevails 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.049
 With that we come to the crash rating because that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.610
 Passsystem anyway not negotiated like that 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.140
 good is used and the general 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.420
 it is known that there only 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.890
 some shady rabble hanging around there 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.270
 there is no reasonable reason in it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.759
 to stop this system 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.759
 we give the system a plus 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.110
 we thank you for watching and 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.210
 happy if you like this episode 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.640
 We especially liked ourselves 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.990
 happy if you have many comments and 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.210
 leave feedback and look too 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.730
 let's go to the others 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.350
 citizen showcase purely for something more 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.630
 the universe behind the game too 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.510
 otherwise I will stay like 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.510
 always with zion the texan has
