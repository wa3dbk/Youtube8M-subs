00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.849
 quick configuration of the drive 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.849
 312 hauls speed 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.720
 Wiring diagram 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.630
 in this example we will use simply 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.059
 the digital inputs to give order of 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.160
 gear and a potentiometer connected to 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.809
 the analog inputs to send the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.809
 speed reference to the drive 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.060
 adjustment of main parameters 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.820
 first we will pass the inverter to 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.820
 Factory parameters 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.370
 Later we will introduce the data 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.370
 of straw engine characteristics 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.210
 and 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.270
 Y 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.270
 Once this is done we will perform another 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.720
 Adjustment to optimize the control loop 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.720
 of the engine 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.020
 with the same configuration we can 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.500
 perform control in three ways 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.989
 different the first by entries 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.100
 digital and speed reference by 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.740
 Analog input from 0 to 10 volts 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.660
 the second simply by entries 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.040
 digital using the function of 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.820
 pre-selected speeds 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.820
 configurable 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.700
 and the third option giving order of 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.739
 march through digital inputs and the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.049
 speed reference and direction of 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.659
 turn using the analog input there is 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.620
 two connected to an external source of 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.620
 about 10 points 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.209

 consult download and view more 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.640

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.640
 formats
