 always goodies 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.530

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.210

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.840

 if you really really have a cow that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.680

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.149
 That 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.010
 how they do this we seem that is 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:12.720
 The best thing to do is make the block start 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:14.100
