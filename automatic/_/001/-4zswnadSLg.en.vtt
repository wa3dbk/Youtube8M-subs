00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:10.670
 Hello everyone, today we bought glasses 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:15.829
 principle polarized glasses 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 here on your company hvvs airflow means 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:22.619
 model points f 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:28.689
 b07 74 psd 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:32.320
 will cut the hook model will write the captions 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:36.400
 Of course, it means the glasses are so hard 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.320
 case go as I said glasses 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.860
 polarization 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.640
 In principle, here is a plus of this case 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.620
 here the zipper itself is removed from 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.710
 the edges that is when closing on the glass 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.710
 nitrate on 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.520
 so these glasses are very light 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.160
 know this as you know 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.230
 they are not pink they are something between 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.430
 someone just some ordinary 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.750
 brown dimming and yes there is such 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.330
 slightly reddish 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.680
 that's how i said glasses 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.380
 polarization 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.870
 in a plastic case of course it is not 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.310
 Glass is also plastic, too, have what 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.600
 A definite plus is that the glasses are light and 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.330
 a huge plus of these points I basically 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.180
 I was looking for such that the glasses will be closed 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.900
 and side view too i.e. sun 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.080
 across the sideline more accurately publish 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.640
 will not be unlike ordinary glasses 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.800
 which sideline is open 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.250
 and of course you still have to say this 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.920
 One caveat when buying 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.920
 polaroid them points as taught me 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.340
 seller check polaroid or not then 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.320
 there are two take them sexual points and 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.510
 We add up here and so crosswise 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.070
 if the glass is not completely translucent 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:13.650
 That turns out completely black square 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.370
 on the lumen of two intersecting glasses 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.850
 crosswise 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.070
 means polarized glasses 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.950
 if some kind of translucent means 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.489
 bullshit here and of course I also wanted 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.540
 weigh them on the stove since i bought 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.250
 myself actually for fishing 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.600
 Yes, I must say, I started in Minsk for 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.600
 these glasses are 45 dollars 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.940
 So here I think that now I see my 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.940
 Misha 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.120
 26 grams of thread just a little case 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.560
 seventy six and seven in their own way 77 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.450
 gram more patronymic actually here 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.700
 I have such a change today 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.830
 I basically walked looked through these 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.250
 glasses on the water yes really removes 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.700
 black 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.709
 Well, actually all if there will be 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.930
 any complaints want something about 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.060
 I tell them of course I will tell you bye 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.920
 that sort of suits everything at first 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.270
 sight 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.830
 hello, many do not know why 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.870
 Polaroid glasses may be needed 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.459
 polarized glasses they need in 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.350
 principle ready to shoot glare from the water 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.800
 let me try to show just 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.230
 helping went to the pond here it means here 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.850
 thats right now in front of me in the industry 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.310
 which is not visible naturally due 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.050
 films of water and for shine though the weather 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.820
 family is not at all sunny new so you 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.530
 see very calm and therefore very 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.010
 well will it show i mean 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:52.269
 Now I will try in front of the lens 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.120
 put and i really hope that you 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.570
 will see age that is you right in front 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.820
 we should be visible on vacation i'm not 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.739
 I know they are visible to you or not because I 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.780
 I feel a little screen I do not see because 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.269
 screen looks relatively to the sky and 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.140
 in fact, everything flashes to me 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.140
 Thank you all for your attention
