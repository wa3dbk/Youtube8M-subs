00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.970
 Water is the number one food 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.639
 no matter if it's from the bottle or from the bottle 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.540
 But there is an ecological connection 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.550
 a difference 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.080
 Drinking water is more environmentally friendly than 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.970
 water from the bottle a liter 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.189
 Drinking water from the line needed for 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.320
 the provision up to 1000 times 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.449
 less energy than water from the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 bottle 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.070
 Such a bill is called LCA 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.840
 on the creation of such life cycle assessments 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.949
 is the swiss e services 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.200
 specialized 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.750
 there one calculated the expenditure for the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.590
 provision of drinking water 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 bottled water in bottles from the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.629
 domestic region and imported 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.489
 Mineral water yes the mineral water what 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.739
 one buys in the shop he must first 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.289
 be packed that is then the must 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.809
 Produce packaging and it will too 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.879
 often transported relatively far up to 10 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.770
 comes to the consumer and the middle of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.500
 load also stored and so on 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.449
 and all these processes and processes 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.640
 production steps that consume 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.650
 energy which ultimately leads to it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.350
 that the mineral water is much more energy 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.270
 consumed in the manufacture than that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.270
 drinking water from the tap comes 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.140
 the energy expenditure can be used in life cycle assessments 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.579
 be converted into petroleum equivalents 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.759
 a liter of drinking water from the pipe 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:28.619
 does not require more than 0.3 milliliters 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.909
 oil equivalent a favorable balance 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.549
 drinking water year makes it the crowd 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.469
 and no packaging required 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.390
 is an essential aspect and also that 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.979
 transport is via pipelines 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.719
 of course much easier than with 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.450
 Of course, the truck and that too 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.399
 not so long distances 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.319
 Much more oil equivalent need 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.149
 The water comes out calculated 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.979
 the bottle 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.280
 A big item is the energy expenditure 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.849
 for the production of the pet bottle 94 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.009
 mm 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.380
 Added to this is the consumption for the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.509
 entire production process flushing the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.470
 bottling labeling and 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.470
 much more 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:09.899
 13 milliliters of petroleum fall for that 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.099
 equivalent per liter 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.620
 then the bottles have to be the same 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.109
 reach the consumer is the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.090
 Supermarket maximum 50 kilometers from the 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:24.069
 production facility removed resulting 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.200
 4.9 milliliters for the transport all 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.910
 this effort is redeveloped for one 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.069
 liter of mineral water from their own 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.069
 region to 103 10 milliliters 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.560
 So if the water is from the region 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.540
 comes or so relatively close up 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.450
 come dennis the pet bottle or the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.670
 bottle the most important and from further 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.080
 this is considered as being transported 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.180
 or that becomes more important 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.980
 the transport 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.189
 Switzerland imports about one third 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.079
 of the consumed mineral water long 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.840
 transport routes devour a lot of energy 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.750
 at a transport distance of up to 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.400
 1000 kilometers will be held instead of the 49 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.700
 milliliter of bottles from the 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.120
 domestic region 97 milliliters of oil 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.180
 equivalent consumed 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.219
 this beats strongly on the life cycle assessment 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.099
 from the EU to Switzerland imports the 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:20.849
 Mineral water needs the highest 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:24.549
 energy consumption per liter 209 milliliters 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:27.310
 One equals one oil now 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.829
 lifestyle products so that's not it 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.040
 normal bottled water will ever do it 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.480
 further from each one it happens like that 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.879
 exclusive, it is more expensive values 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.549
 those are getting better and better 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.530
 bought or settle the qualitative 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.629
 chroniclers could forgive this 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.239
 development criticizes the conservative 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.180
 swiss national councilor 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.519
 chutney will be in environmental politics 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.440
 fought for every gram of co2 and at 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.349
 Mineral water could be with the simplest 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.519
 help relieve the environment 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.040
 ritterbach nice but it is a 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.870
 but also a market in 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.790
 which only seven or eight percent of 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.849
 bottles are returned to the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.500
 means that 220 million pet bottles 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.949
 land or burned in nature 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.810
 become 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:13.510
 and that's what people need in the end 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.539
 pay for it when you have a pet bottle 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.519
 the co2 burns and burns too 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.310
 all the efforts of our policy 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.349
 co2 must avoid production too 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.349
 A limitation of pet bottles include 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.240
 in the swiss parliament brought theirs 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.320
 Therefore, request a mineral water in 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.699
 ban pet bottles 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.460
 in the first chamber failed 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.470
 conservative MP but it goes 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.930
 first and foremost a public one 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.729
 discussion which expenditure may a 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.720
 society for a simple product like 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.240
 operate water exactly 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.030
 It is impossible for such an initiative 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.550
 to go through the first time 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.590
 it's more about it first of all 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.560
 to draw attention to the problem 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.910
 you have to initiate a discussion like that 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.300
 that piece by piece 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.250
 Consciousness developed for this topic 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.470
 in the parliament but also in the 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.270
 public opinion and if that 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.270
 happened we have better chances 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.010
 to get a positive vote and 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.410
 sooner or later, the price of oil will be 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.060
 rise again which means that too 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.870
 the price for the bottles continues 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.000
 will rise 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.490
 the financial crisis and unemployment 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.580
 force us to consume anyway 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.260
 finish that is absolutely superfluous for 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.420
 The consumer would be banned from 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.090
 Mineral water in pet bottles quite 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.800
 make sense because tap water is with 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.169
 not even one cent per liter 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.300
 priced absolutely unrivaled and 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.530
 There are many things about the price 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.530
 product enforced
