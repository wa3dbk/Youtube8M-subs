00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:10.650
 let's prepare 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.650
 which is sensitive 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.220
 is the ginger root so it looks when 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.490
 It is cool of a light yellow color and 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.880
 the skin totally light 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.900
 we put water in a pot we are going to use 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.460
 three small wells 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.070
 a little bit bigger than the well 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.090
 inkwell 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.090
 and we treat ourselves 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.789
 and we light the fire 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.859
 we leave it on medium high heat while 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.969
 so much we are going to split a piece of 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:53.379
 ginger and with a spoon 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:56.870
 let's go scraping the skin to peel 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.210
 previously we washed it of course the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.870

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.240
 intense yellow tone 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 and it's pretty juicy 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.939
 It can also be used when wearing a 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.250
 good weather but cool is much more 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.380
 sacred we grate it 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.570
 until getting more or less three quarters 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.780

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.560

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.740

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.420
 and we let it boil 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.330
 approximately 30 seconds 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.850

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.830

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.960
