00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.980
 hi to all and pernod memory card is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.080
 welcome today for a new 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.360
 mobile discovery was only a game 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.799
 addressed india arcade and minimalist have 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.660
 a rather complicated description for a 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.920
 very simple game principle as soon as you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.880
 click on the screen do you go from 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.680
 the other side of the circle 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.240
 the goal is to finish the highest level 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.519
 quickly possible with the least amount of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.439
 dead and as soon as you go to confront 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.039
 another circle touched peaks you 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.420
 go die 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.119
 you have checkpoints that you 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.450
 save you'll see the game goes fast 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.579
 to reach maximum difficulty with 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.260
 typical at the beginning it's okay it's 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.270
 quite simple it's quiet but the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.670
 circles to reduce themselves the speed is going 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.250
 speed up the timing increase and you 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.960
 are also going to have pretty long fans there 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.430
 appears very concentrated the eyes sting 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 at that moment it's normal 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.930
 and with these small piquerouge aquifer 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.879
 stressed to death you will start to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.199
 pay law firms masterfully I 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.899
 will show you a little neo that I have 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.219
 managed to push your crosses almost 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.109
 they had right away or else we 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.850
 come on it's good it's normal 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.140
 I'm accelerating for you see a little bit 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.700
 the mood of the level and after I'm going 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.680
 tell you about other game modes that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.580
 are completely completely 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.580
 devils completely vain 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.690
 ok little clever they scored a 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.350
 number of deaths she has strongly 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.600
 increases 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.130
 yeah actually is a little good montage 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.780
 go i'll show you anyway 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.840
 levels that are very difficult 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.390
 level there with kinds of roles in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.550
 plus it's moving levels and yeah 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.950
 and you're going to have your circles that 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.720
 begins to move the junction point 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.010
 always very difficult to catch so that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.530
 this is the first level that you go 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.640
 unlock in my couple had made a 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.830
 or twice you made the word more 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.000
 difficult me will be very simple because 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.830
 look at what are you going to type 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.560
 behind but you type destructive 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.810
 ultra fast it will be necessary to tap with 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.730
 almost perfect synchronization 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.830
 we will have to wait in circles 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.990
 to be able to get through my name without 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.520
 to be eaten by his spades after 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.570
 this one we will see of course the famous 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.820
 red spike 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.870
 and yes that opens that closes but they 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.190
 are right here to piss you off 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.570
 red cefic because you're going 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.980
 start farting cables to stay 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.600
 who blogs to see when 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.430
 we will be able to get to this little 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.900
 checkpoint in any case the game is 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.790
 really successful besides being 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.709
 beautiful the ultra objective I 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.440
 spent hours and hours 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.880
 finish some levels and what is 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.850
 nice is that there is a last mode of 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.200
 game or there the what it is in the spotlight and 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.770
 you will have to go farther 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.209
 possible 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.380
 your score is more number of deaths 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.209
 but the distance you are going 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.520
 browse the number of circles you 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.980
 will succeed to swallow to go the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.840
 further in this new and finish it 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.120
 in any case if you liked what 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.230
 I challenge you to succeed in doing 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.900
 a better score than mans on this 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.420
 level to 87 dead and six by any chance 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.070
 you make less than 800 death on this 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.200
 level there say more than you have 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.850
 make me i fucked royal mickeal in 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.140
 Anyway thank you for all and do not hesitate 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.360
 not to go for a ride on our 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.150
 latest mobile gaming videos or 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.680
 still on memory card 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.060
 I tell you to a next and 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.829
