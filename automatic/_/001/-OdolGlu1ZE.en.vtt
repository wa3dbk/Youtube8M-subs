gonna drizzle this in the top nice and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.440 
gonna drizzle this in the top nice and
easy<00:01:46.240> all<00:01:47.160> right<00:01:48.160> so<00:01:48.460> let's<00:01:48.640> take<00:01:48.730> a<00:01:48.790> look<00:01:49.090> here

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
easy all right so let's take a look here

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.810 
easy all right so let's take a look here
probably<00:01:50.170> have<00:01:50.380> about<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.710> cup<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.340> cup<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.760> a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
probably have about a cup to a cup and a

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.270 
probably have about a cup to a cup and a
half<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:52.210> there<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.680> that's<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.860> consistency

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
half in there and that's the consistency

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.060 
half in there and that's the consistency
we<00:01:54.790> have<00:01:54.970> as<00:01:55.270> this<00:01:56.230> stuff<00:01:56.440> cools<00:01:56.710> it's<00:01:56.920> going

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
we have as this stuff cools it's going

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.310 
we have as this stuff cools it's going
to<00:01:57.130> thicken<00:01:57.400> so<00:01:57.760> I'd<00:01:57.850> say<00:01:58.030> right<00:01:58.360> now<00:01:58.390> it's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
to thicken so I'd say right now it's

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.200 
to thicken so I'd say right now it's
about<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.650> right<00:01:59.950> consistency<00:02:00.340> for<00:02:00.970> a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
about the right consistency for a

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.090

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
are other ways to do that but they're

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.070 
are other ways to do that but they're
usually<00:04:51.580> a<00:04:51.820> little<00:04:51.880> bit<00:04:52.180> Messier<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.600> not

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080
