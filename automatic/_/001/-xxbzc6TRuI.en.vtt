00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.280
 Brazil is preparing to receive 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.120
 the whole world and you can not stand 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.250
 out of this 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.049
 then take a look at this recipe that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.710
 will leave your guests with water in the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.660
 mouth 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.119
 After all, you only know Brazil really. 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.130
 Who knows the feijoada way? 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.189
 note the ingredients that are worth a lot 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.189
 feather 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.519
 the feijoada preparation always starts a 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.920
 the day before you leave the beans in the water and 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.810
 this water you always despise 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.119
 this is for the beans to cook 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.580
 faster and also important in the 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.350
 our management becomes much lighter 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.110
 here I already have three to four liters 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.110
 I put beans straight here. 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.950
 there a pan goes and always the part to 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.409
 people make a spice like that if you need 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.100
 pepper the salt you put aside then 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.240
 we put the oil waiting heat 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.759
 people add the minced bacon 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.840
 and also adds that the bird case 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.640
 I need salt 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.090
 you put it right here in the seasoning there 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.950
 always salty houses that you can 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.440
 do a day before take care not to 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.159
 let carlos sainz algar our much 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.560
 salty 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.700
 here we have dried meat in public 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.520
 already salty 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.770
 we put you have people do this 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.619
 with a long as well and in the sequence 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.229
 puts smoked pork rib is very 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.650
 more practical and easier to do 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.000
 then we can put the foot of the ear 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.890
 and the rap 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.870
 if you do not like these ingredients 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.239
 Do you think it gets too heavy for you? 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.720
 You can put it on and take it, no problem. 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.030
 none 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.510
 they give the creaminess very nice in the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.510
 our revenue 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.730
 here we put two bay leaves 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.280
 then I add sausage 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:44.480
 Portuguese also puts the sausage 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.549
 calabresa and also with the father 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.489
 if these languages cook faster 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.290
 You can separate them and then put them alone. 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.060
 in the final moment that you will serve 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.829
 while the loads are cooking at 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.319
 people can put a spice and 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.220
 If you need to, you can put the 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.220
 Salt here too. 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.200
 It's a cool trophy to put a 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.200
 Sugarcane liquor 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.909
 rice already has its own way 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.030
 but here is a tip that is infallible is 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:32.370
 you squeeze half a lemon rice before 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.900
 put this recipe or make it into 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.129
