00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.529
 the first measurement estimates someone 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.580
 if we want the diameter of the earth 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.830
 these offenses are they done ordinary is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.349
 beautiful that I have told 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.880
 a shape a little bit a little bit 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.920
 romanticized but respectful of history 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.090
 in a man and one of my books that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.970
 tell a little bit about everything that happened 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 passed to antiquity and especially the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.750
 famous library of Alexandria all 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.760
 these Greek scholars began to try 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
 to decode the cosmos precisely with 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.970
 tools that he had at the time that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.199
 is essentially geometry here is 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.360
 while it's someone called 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.610
 Eratosthenes who did what did 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.600
 it's sure to be extraordinary already 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.780
 shows that we are not an organ 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.379
 bright eratosthenes and 200 forward before 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.140
 the Christian era 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.760
 they were bio tekere of the famous 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.500
 Alexandria Library 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.750
 he was near it's a very character 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.820
 important because it's a very 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.140
 important to be director of the museum of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.180
 the library of Alexandria at the time 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.770
 he was also a preceptor of 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.629
 King's children so washed of loads 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.520
 extremely important this real 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.780
 genius was called a knowledge athlete 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.879
 because he was competent in all 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.320
 the areas of our early hymn of the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.970
 geometry in the field of 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.500
 astronomy in the field of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.510
 geography in the field of music 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.640
 in the field of goodbye poetry 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.020
 to be absolutely universal come out 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.340
 so rebirth of rebirth 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.930
 before the letter 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.700
 so they owned the hosts 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.960
 hydrometric had been developed a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.670
 century before him by the great 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.500
 euclid mathematician who had been the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.939
 first great scientist to be precisely 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.329
 avoid by the pharaoh for nothing 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:32.009
 worked in Alexandria and we say that 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.229
 eratosthenes so knowing that the earth 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.790
 was round we already knew at this 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.409
 time but the question is what is 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.119
 the size that diabetes or she is 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.840
 circumference of the earth is what we 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.360
 can measure it 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.310
 it's absolutely asking yourself the question 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.480
 how to do that and then go back to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.060
 stand hears talk 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.120
 of caravaneers who went to the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.590
 south of egypt in a city that at 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.930
 the time was called syed which today 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.140
 corresponds to the current often has to then 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.270
 pretty much on the tropic line that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.100
 so about 2000 km south of 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.180
 Alexandria which I recall is 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.010
 north of egypt on the delta of the nile 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.710
 had heard that the day of 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.770
 summer solstice that is to say on June 21 to 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.770
 noon in siena there was a well 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.840
 deep dug in the ground and that day there 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.660
 a noon on June 21st 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.670
 we said because a phenomenon quite 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.490
 extraordinary the sun was at the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.050
 perfect vertical of that one and that 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.510
 so it was the only time of the year 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.920
 where we could see the bottom of the well the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.050
 bury the bottom because it was 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.320
 to illuminate directly otherwise obviously 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.560
 the bottom of the well were hidden good test 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.550
 but eratosthenes knows very well that this 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.710
 day there the same day 21 June at noon to 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.980
 Alexandria the sun is not at all 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.190
 vertical it makes a small angle so 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.459
 who thinks if the earth actually 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.520
 round is actually the angle that make the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.320
 sun rays depends on the latitude 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.040
 from place the position on the globe 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.590
 earthly 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.900
 if the sun is also sunny 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.220
 are vertical to his 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.600
 actually thyssen lies on the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.440
 tropic so that's the definition of 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.350
 tropics that's it languages will not be 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.280
 not exactly to be perpendicular to 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.780
 Earth's surface 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.100
 a little further north, ie 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.040
 Alexandria so what am I going 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.800
 do I'm going to measure language that do 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.150
 the sunbeams in alexandria on the 21st 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.489
 June at noon what does he do there 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.500
 plant a boat or a monument 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.750
 vertical the imager to the length of 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.630
 shade because obviously if it's a 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.459
 article there is a shadow measures the 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.200
 length of the shadow he deduces the angle 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:47.340
 what are the sunshine with a 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.980
 vertical 7 ° good 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.410
 he says to himself 7 ° well what is it 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.800
 fiftieth of 360 degrees ie 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.750
 a 50th of the full turn that means that 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.150
 so the circle art that separates 6n 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.370
 Alexandria is a fiftieth of times 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.569
 the earth circumference so that's it 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.310
 how will we measure the circumference 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.530
 terrestrial one wants enough to multiply 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.660
 by fifty the distance that separates 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.940
 sienne alexandrie he still remains to 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.769
 physically measure this time at a 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.620
 unit of measure of the time which not 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.060
 I used stadiums 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.130
 here I measure them the distance between 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.479
 sienne alexandrie so he also 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.729
 the story takes proportions all to 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.710
 extraordinary because he before 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.570
 we did not have the means of geodesy 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.280
 like today to get him elected to 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.600
 all and use the quantities 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.580
 different information that the 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.750
 connect together to try to do 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.710
 an average then for example there 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.360
 interrogates 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.060
 what are called baptism dbm berries 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.860
 Atistes it was people at the time 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.360
 who were walkers paying for 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.940
 measure precisely the distances along 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.470
 roads he did not get 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.630
 victim knowledge in the length of the 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.550
 not at the end, or not 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.680
 not seem to me not be able to say ben voila 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.210
 I traveled this or that distance 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.370
 which he questions maths east he 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.900
 the interviewed caravaneers knowing the 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.979
 average speed and coal to make the 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.919
 way et cetera et cetera 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.750
 he also uses the cadastres of 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.130
 the time on the fields that are 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.729
 flooded by the Nîmes so it was necessary 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.680
 measure 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.250
 it cuts across all this information 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.690
 together and as a stadium 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.510
 distance from siena and alexandria and 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.550
 multiplied by 50 and therefore this is the 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.289
 circumference of the earth it's 250 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.720
 miles to the stadium when we know the 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.630
 value of the stage into 30 transform into 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.430
 master the stadium if I repeat it was to 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.139
 the length of the famous stadium where 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.650
 spent the Olympics at olympie 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.120
 what is found between 40000 km 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.289
 it's purebred by the real thing 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.289
 circumference of the earth
