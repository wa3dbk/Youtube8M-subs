00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
was definitely something that was a

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.729 
was definitely something that was a
must-have<00:00:34.210> you<00:00:34.600> know<00:00:34.719> to<00:00:35.199> be<00:00:35.260> able<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.500> split

the<00:00:35.920> screen<00:00:36.100> up<00:00:36.399> into<00:00:36.670> four<00:00:36.910> sections<00:00:37.149> give

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109 
the screen up into four sections give

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:40.920 
the screen up into four sections give
each<00:00:38.260> person<00:00:38.289> a<00:00:38.739> controller<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.690> can<00:00:40.750> get

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
each person a controller you can get

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.540 
each person a controller you can get
together<00:00:41.079> with<00:00:41.320> your<00:00:41.470> friends<00:00:41.649> on<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.040> Saturday

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
and break out some chips and dip and

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.520 
and break out some chips and dip and
just<00:00:45.370> play<00:00:45.520> minecraft<00:00:45.970> together<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:46.750> I<00:00:46.780> think

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
just play minecraft together and I think

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.840 
just play minecraft together and I think
that's<00:00:47.680> one<00:00:47.829> of<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:47.920> main<00:00:48.130> differentiating

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
that's one of the main differentiating

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.210 
that's one of the main differentiating
factors<00:00:49.300> about<00:00:49.989> this<00:00:50.350> version<00:00:50.770> then<00:00:50.980> about

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
factors about this version then about

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.900 
factors about this version then about
you<00:00:51.460> know<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:51.610> pc<00:00:52.239> or<00:00:52.480> anywhere<00:00:53.440> else<00:00:53.500> so<00:00:53.950> i

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
you know the pc or anywhere else so i

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.100 
you know the pc or anywhere else so i
think<00:00:54.969> people<00:00:55.210> are<00:00:55.360> really<00:00:55.390> really<00:00:55.960> gonna

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
think people are really really gonna

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.319 
think people are really really gonna
like<00:00:56.320> that<00:00:56.500> a<00:00:56.559> lot<00:00:56.800> it's<00:00:57.760> already<00:00:57.940> at<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.149> show

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
and people have been really excited to

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.490 
and people have been really excited to
be<00:01:01.239> able<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.450> do<00:01:01.540> that<00:01:01.690> in<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.960> concept<00:01:02.350> of

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
be able to do that in the concept of

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:14.140 
be able to do that in the concept of
that

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150

I really tried to do was create a very
good<00:02:02.150> interface<00:02:03.430> for<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.490> game<00:02:04.700> using<00:02:05.240> a

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
good interface for the game using a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.270 
good interface for the game using a
controller<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.960> one<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.260> things<00:02:06.290> that

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
controller and one of the things that

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.969 
controller and one of the things that
was<00:02:07.600> decided<00:02:08.600> on<00:02:08.899> was<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:09.260> new<00:02:09.500> crafting

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
was decided on was this new crafting

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.460 
was decided on was this new crafting
system<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:11.510> basically<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.990> menu<00:02:12.320> based

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
system so it's basically a menu based

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.310 
system so it's basically a menu based
system<00:02:13.310> where<00:02:13.580> all<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.510> recipes<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:15.020> are

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
system where all of the recipes that are

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.400 
system where all of the recipes that are
in<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.560> game<00:02:16.030> are<00:02:17.030> are<00:02:17.570> already<00:02:17.990> built<00:02:18.200> into

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
in the game are are already built into

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.930 
in the game are are already built into
the<00:02:18.530> game<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:18.830> can<00:02:18.980> see<00:02:19.010> what<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.430> required<00:02:19.580> to

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
the game you can see what is required to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.240 
the game you can see what is required to
make<00:02:20.210> a<00:02:20.240> bed<00:02:20.570> for<00:02:20.600> example<00:02:21.350> or<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:22.070> make<00:02:22.220> a
