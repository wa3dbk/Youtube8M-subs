00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.030
 hello friends I'm the reviewer 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.360
 today we are going to visit the triceratops and 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.210
 we will find out what they eat come all 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.420
 with me and his life the money in everything 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.000
 will come out 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.980
 one 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.980
 the triceratops come to eat 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:34.320
 four children come to help me prepare 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.320
 the nest today we have visits visit 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.270
 I hope 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.170
 who do you think it will be I do not know but 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:49.410
 sure he comes to eat and that means 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:52.550
 fish we will like you will see 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.550
 to dig 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:03.150
 none of you tires a 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.970
 little fish and fish is the 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.700
 best food there is in the universe that 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.890
 It can be better than good fish 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.900
 it depends on the dinosaur that eats it 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.110
 herbivores do not need to eat fish 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.750
 that is an herbivore the herbivores are 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.020
 dinosaurs that take plants only 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.350
 plants that we are then 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.410
 vigorous fishing see the saint and we are 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.590
 carnivores we eat meat the fish is 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.450
 meat the fish is meat the fish is 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.520
 delicious I think that all 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.400
 Dinosaurs would like it if they tried it 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.729
 even herbivores and guests 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.550
 that are going to come are herbivores and there 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.229
 is the problem I'm not sure will be the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.780
 first time you eat with the family 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.910
 triceratops we have fish and leaves but 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.850
 I would not like to offer you something that is not 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.400
 like it 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.530
 maybe we can see the 13 data in 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.460
 the train station and find out what they 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.369
 like before eating if we can mommy that 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.350
 it's a good idea come kids let's go to 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.720
 the train wine station 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.720
 I stay to prepare the nest 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.870
 Carlos, I'm dying to see the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.140
 triceratops and find out what they like 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.840
 eat all this as they are 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.800
 triceratops are very large and have 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.600
 three horns walk on four legs and are 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.590
 the dinosaurs that have the most head 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:46.990
 really great because I did not know that 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.740
 did not edit it or a very big head to 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.700
 brody kids is instructing triceratops and 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.290
 his son so headbut and he was kidding eight 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.770
 four cases that are three that are two 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.959
 a very big head warning of a 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.560
 preguntita you who you like more 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.660
 fish or plants are joking the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.630
 I love plants 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.000
 I am a herbivore for me the plants are 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.730
 the best food and now I'm hungry 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.830
 let's eat mom what do you think that 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.350
 we have come out to eat at our 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.209
 herbivorous friends and it's a magnificent 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.980
 idea children 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.310
 trudy I think I have the most appropriate 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.310
 for you 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.700
 he kissed 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.200
 bryant and trudy tank are herbivores like this 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.080
 that I would serve them 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.569
 delicious plants but mom this is 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.290
 fish to all who taste it 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.730
 like but I do not like fish the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.670
 evidence of ever 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.210
 no fifth is the fish is your food 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.010
 favorite just that you do not know yet 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.830
 try it is a special recipe from mom 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.190
 I do not think a herbivore thinks the same 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.250
 sainz that's so you do not have to eat the 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.770
 fish nothing happens I'll try it on that 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.880
 I have hunger 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.880
 sure he knows 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.800
 fatal 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.830
 although in the background it is delicious 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.229
 you'll see good is not because of your recipe is that 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.810
 the mouth of the triceratops is not made 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.240
 to eat fish our nose is 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.180
 ready to chew thick plants 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.039
 and hard well that's great not 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.009
 you will find thicker and harder plants 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.650
 that in the neighborhood of the pteranodon is 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:46.009
 eat so serious I take care 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.009

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.440
 eat the whole neighborhood of our 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.340
 hosts sorry for the ones I have 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.350
 much maya hunger how many plants do you think 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.210
 that you can eat a triceratops at 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.130
 we can better know the big pond 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.110
 It has so many different plants so 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.870
 you can eat there as much as you want to 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.270
 you that's a good idea let's go in the 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.180
 came 30 to the big stan there's only 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.660
 one stop away you are all 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.660
 ready 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.330
 I jumped 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.840
 with jump 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.630
 and nothing more 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.370
 they all do 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.760
 appetizers snacks we serve the 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.550
 carnivores whatever you want I did not find 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.310
 food has something that has clear leaves 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.070
 I do have leaves dipped in sap 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.890
 -He said- a chus leaf as if by 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.230
 please, I want them all, so do not chew 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:56.450
 before the meal will take away your appetite 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:06:01.860
 but nothing takes away my appetite 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:07.189
 the next stop the big pond 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.189
 now he must eat in there 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.190
 look at what huge juicy plants and 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.190
 with incredible 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:21.149
 it's amazing how you can eat so much 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.189
 and so fast and it 's my nose like it is 

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:25.939
 sharpening and helps tear the leaves and 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:25.939
 chew the
