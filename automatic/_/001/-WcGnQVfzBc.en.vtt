00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840

guitar<00:01:25.869> to<00:01:26.350> use<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.560> b-minor<00:01:27.069> setting<00:01:27.520> just

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
guitar to use a b-minor setting just

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.279 
guitar to use a b-minor setting just
sounds<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.090> little<00:01:28.210> bit<00:01:28.390> softer<00:01:28.899> a<00:01:28.929> little<00:01:29.020> bit

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
sounds a little bit softer a little bit

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.480 
sounds a little bit softer a little bit
smoother<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.810> those<00:01:32.140> are<00:01:32.380> there<00:01:32.500> those<00:01:33.280> are

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
smoother so those are there those are
