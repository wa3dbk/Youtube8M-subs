00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.309 
profile or whatever you want to do with
it<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.730> really<00:02:18.849> cheap<00:02:19.209> really<00:02:19.660> sturdy<00:02:20.019> I

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
it it's really cheap really sturdy I

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.259 
it it's really cheap really sturdy I
didn't<00:02:21.250> really<00:02:21.370> tighten<00:02:21.730> my<00:02:21.819> down<00:02:22.000> enough

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
didn't really tighten my down enough

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.550 
didn't really tighten my down enough
like<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:23.970> push<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.209> whatever<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:26.349> rip

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
like just push it in whatever and rip

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.670 
like just push it in whatever and rip
hammer<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.980> um<00:02:27.959> there's<00:02:28.959> no<00:02:29.019> flexing<00:02:29.620> or

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
hammer it um there's no flexing or

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.070 
hammer it um there's no flexing or
filming<00:02:29.920> lines<00:02:30.160> which<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.209> really<00:02:31.540> big

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
filming lines which is like a really big

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.140 
filming lines which is like a really big
plus<00:02:32.349> over<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.709> extra<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.760> only<00:02:33.970> thing

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
plus over the extra the only thing

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.699 
plus over the extra the only thing
that's<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.569> problem<00:02:34.900> with<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.440> because

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
that's the problem with this is because

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.059 
that's the problem with this is because
it's<00:02:35.830> rounded<00:02:37.140> sometimes<00:02:38.140> your<00:02:38.349> camera<00:02:38.799> will

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
it's rounded sometimes your camera will

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.589 
it's rounded sometimes your camera will
sway<00:02:39.430> side<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.730> side<00:02:39.970> if<00:02:40.120> y'all<00:02:40.269> tighten<00:02:40.540> it

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
sway side to side if y'all tighten it

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.020 
sway side to side if y'all tighten it
down<00:02:40.650> enough<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.220> solved<00:02:42.549> that<00:02:42.610> basically

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
down enough but I solved that basically

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.839 
down enough but I solved that basically
just<00:02:43.299> by<00:02:43.530> adding<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.830> few<00:02:45.130> more<00:02:45.190> layers<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.670> duct

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
just by adding a few more layers of duct

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.300 
just by adding a few more layers of duct
tape<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.660> Len<00:02:46.840> sits<00:02:47.110> higher<00:02:47.890> and

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
tape so that the Len sits higher and

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.360 
tape so that the Len sits higher and
there's<00:02:48.880> friction<00:02:49.299> alone<00:02:49.709> all<00:02:50.709> musing<00:02:51.190> there

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
there's friction alone all musing there

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.759 
there's friction alone all musing there
loking<00:02:52.000> on<00:02:52.120> or<00:02:52.209> whatever<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:53.500> puts

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
loking on or whatever and it puts

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.180 
loking on or whatever and it puts
friction<00:02:54.700> on<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.940> on<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.890> lens<00:02:56.890> hood<00:02:57.069> or

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
friction on the on the lens hood or

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.640 
friction on the on the lens hood or
whatever<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.819> it<00:02:57.970> doesn't<00:02:58.120> move<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:59.470> sign<00:02:59.620> it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
whatever so it doesn't move just sign it

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.170 
whatever so it doesn't move just sign it
down<00:02:59.860> pretty<00:03:00.010> good<00:03:00.190> or<00:03:00.519> you<00:03:00.670> can<00:03:00.790> get<00:03:00.970> another

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
down pretty good or you can get another

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.650 
down pretty good or you can get another
T<00:03:01.690> joint<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.170> then<00:03:02.459> cut<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:04.060> half<00:03:04.150> put

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
T joint and then cut this in half put

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.979 
T joint and then cut this in half put
that<00:03:04.840> there<00:03:05.019> drill<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:06.569> I'll<00:03:07.569> just<00:03:07.720> let<00:03:07.870> the

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
that there drill that I'll just let the

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.199 
that there drill that I'll just let the
frugal<00:03:08.349> filemaker<00:03:08.709> explain<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:10.000> one

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
frugal filemaker explain you that one

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.990 
frugal filemaker explain you that one
time<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:11.440> do<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.739> but<00:03:12.040> i'll<00:03:12.310> link<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.760> in

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
time to do that but i'll link that in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.069 
time to do that but i'll link that in
the<00:03:13.030> description<00:03:13.090> too<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:15.069> yeah<00:03:16.049> it's<00:03:17.049> a

the description too but yeah it's a
really<00:03:17.200> good<00:03:17.410> handle<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.950> works<00:03:18.549> really<00:03:19.209> well

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
really good handle it works really well

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.770 
really good handle it works really well
it<00:03:19.750> looks<00:03:20.019> decent<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:21.280> can<00:03:21.459> drill<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.180> top<00:03:22.420> here

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
it looks decent you can drill a top here

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.780 
it looks decent you can drill a top here
for<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.400> cold<00:03:24.400> shoe<00:03:24.609> for<00:03:24.940> micro<00:03:25.329> Lites

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.789 

it's<00:03:28.790> really<00:03:28.969> good<00:03:29.120> handle<00:03:29.500> if<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.650> don't

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
it's really good handle if you don't

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.050 
it's really good handle if you don't
have<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:30.980> money<00:03:31.159> to<00:03:31.340> spend<00:03:31.579> for<00:03:31.670> an<00:03:31.849> easy
