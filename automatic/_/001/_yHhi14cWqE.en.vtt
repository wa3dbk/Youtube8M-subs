so<00:03:22.890> unlike<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.880> Evo<00:03:24.120> 3d<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.660> actually<00:03:24.990> works

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
so unlike the Evo 3d that actually works

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.470 
so unlike the Evo 3d that actually works
right<00:03:25.500> now<00:03:25.610> I'm<00:03:26.610> guessing<00:03:26.820> that's<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.270> back

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
right now I'm guessing that's the back

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.910 
right now I'm guessing that's the back
button<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.100> that's<00:03:29.270> console<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.930> home<00:03:34.290> whoo

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
