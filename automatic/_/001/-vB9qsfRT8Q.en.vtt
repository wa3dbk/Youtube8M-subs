00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.460
 hello youtube friends the group one 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.200
 touch top 5 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.420
 in this opportunity I am going to teach you 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.230
 how to root our alcatel one touch 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.910
 of 6 5 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.750
 with our application that will be in the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.750
 resolution of the video 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.949
 this application helps us to surround 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.960
 any terminal water in two good one 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.810
 once the application is installed we give it 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 click on ready 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.950
 without opening it 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.790
 what we will do now is restart it 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.790
 extra terminal 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.490
 we do not start, I will not do it because 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.320
 It would take away a lot of good time once 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.020
 rebooted our terminal 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.739
 we go to the scholarship folder and the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.739
 we reinstalled 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.450
 We are going to be 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.570
 or in this case it would reinstall 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.590
 we wait a moment 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.070
 ready now if we open it 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.070
 all right 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.340
 how 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.659
 and ready as we see there tells us the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.890
 model of our terminal in this case 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.979
 mine is one touch of 65 once we 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.799
 this good screen appears before 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.899
 that will show us a box will be in 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.689
 Chinese and there will be two options we have to 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.750
 click on the option on the right and 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:49.390
 then it will appear and what we have to 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:53.170
 to do is click on that button and there 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.470
 and here it will begin to load three bars 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.990
 when you load the third one they will be 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.440
 root users do not leave me because I 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.510
 I'm already root and when I started when 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.750
 load everything will appear again that 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.030
 bars and when you click 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.190
 no longer because it will not charge again if not 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.220
 it will appear like this all the applications that 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.090
 we have in our device once 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.210
 done that we are already your radios root 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.840
 that would be all do not forget to subscribe
