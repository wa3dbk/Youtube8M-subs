the right thing so like it this is about

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.730 
the right thing so like it this is about
5/8<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.800> this<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.400> 3/4<00:01:51.940> so<00:01:52.630> I<00:01:52.810> took<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.410> planer

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
5/8 and this is 3/4 so I took a planer

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.880 
5/8 and this is 3/4 so I took a planer
and<00:01:53.980> plane<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:55.120> this<00:01:56.050> thing<00:01:56.260> at<00:01:56.350> an<00:01:56.440> angle<00:01:56.740> so

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
and plane this this thing at an angle so

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
and plane this this thing at an angle so
it's<00:01:57.010> flush<00:01:57.220> here<00:01:57.580> and<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.330> flush<00:01:58.510> here<00:01:59.910> big

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
it's flush here and it's flush here big

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.310 
it's flush here and it's flush here big
way<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.120> we're<00:02:01.420> having<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.720> do<00:02:01.840> little<00:02:02.020> things

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
any further because all these gotta let

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.660 
any further because all these gotta let

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
into that so anyway that's it for now

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:23.970 
into that so anyway that's it for now
okay<00:03:13.890> now<00:03:15.600> how<00:03:16.600> long<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:16.900> angle<00:03:17.530> here<00:03:22.980> 45

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
okay now how long is angle here 45

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.100 
okay now how long is angle here 45
minutes<00:03:24.250> like<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:24.790> between<00:03:25.480> two<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.959> half

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
minutes like this between two and a half

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.830 
minutes like this between two and a half
three<00:03:26.700> long<00:03:27.700> you're<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.150> line<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.540> snapped

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
three long you're the line of snapped

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:38.910 
three long you're the line of snapped
out<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:34.560> think<00:03:35.910> it's<00:03:36.910> tough<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.450> get<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.959> want

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
out but I think it's tough to get I want

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.770 
out but I think it's tough to get I want
to<00:03:38.980> be<00:03:39.040> able<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.250> really<00:03:39.730> push<00:03:40.299> against<00:03:40.660> that

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
to be able to really push against that

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.400 
to be able to really push against that
because<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:42.299> started<00:03:43.299> with<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:44.079> it's<00:03:44.200> right

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
because I started with it and it's right

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
because I started with it and it's right
away

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.649 

and<00:03:55.430> that<00:03:55.580> works<00:03:55.760> fine<00:03:55.940> then<00:03:56.180> did<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.510> other

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
and that works fine then did the other

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:08.320 
and that works fine then did the other
thing<00:03:56.900> once<00:04:06.069> to<00:04:07.069> begin<00:04:07.370> with<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:07.849> then<00:04:08.209> I'll

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
thing once to begin with and then I'll

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330 
thing once to begin with and then I'll
come<00:04:08.569> back<00:04:08.599> I'll<00:04:09.530> take<00:04:09.709> those<00:04:09.950> things<00:04:10.129> off

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
I'm coming to that board I've got this

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:43.330 
I'm coming to that board I've got this
end<00:04:35.810> up<00:04:36.160> just<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.280> little<00:04:37.310> bit<00:04:38.530> so<00:04:39.610> go<00:04:42.100> take<00:04:43.100> this

end up just a little bit so go take this

00:04:43.340 --> 00:05:01.360 
end up just a little bit so go take this
