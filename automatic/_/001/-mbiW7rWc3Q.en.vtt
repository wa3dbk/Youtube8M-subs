inches long and 5 inches wide and in
order<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.680> make<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> strap<00:00:17.850> 5<00:00:18.090> inches<00:00:18.390> wide

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
order to make the strap 5 inches wide

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.660 
order to make the strap 5 inches wide
what<00:00:19.439> we're<00:00:19.529> going<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.920> get<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> fabric

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
what we're going to do is get the fabric

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.359 
what we're going to do is get the fabric
and<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:20.910> put<00:00:21.480> right<00:00:21.720> sides<00:00:21.750> together<00:00:22.369> this

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
and just put right sides together this

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.859 
and just put right sides together this
fabric<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.820> can't<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.240> tell<00:00:24.539> because<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
fabric you can't really tell because the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.019 
fabric you can't really tell because the
right<00:00:25.019> sides<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.650> wrong<00:00:26.130> sides<00:00:26.430> look<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> same

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
right sides in wrong sides look the same

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.089 
right sides in wrong sides look the same
so<00:00:27.449> I'm<00:00:27.599> not<00:00:27.720> really<00:00:27.900> concerned<00:00:28.109> about<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> but

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
so I'm not really concerned about it but

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.820 
so I'm not really concerned about it but
your<00:00:29.310> fabric<00:00:29.730> might<00:00:30.539> not<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.050> way<00:00:31.260> you

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
your fabric might not be this way you

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350 
your fabric might not be this way you
just<00:00:31.920> want<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.099> make<00:00:32.219> sure<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
just want to make sure that the the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.819 
just want to make sure that the the
right<00:00:33.870> side<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> fabric<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
right side of the fabric is on the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.889 
right side of the fabric is on the
inside<00:00:34.980> sleep<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> right<00:00:36.300> sides<00:00:36.630> together

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
inside sleep it right sides together

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.560 
inside sleep it right sides together
that's<00:00:37.469> basically<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.219> means<00:00:38.579> it's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
that's basically what that means it's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.110

out so many times so anyways let's start
this<00:01:35.009> again

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
this again

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.440 
this again
this<00:01:35.670> back<00:01:35.909> tack<00:01:36.180> right<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.390> is

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
this back tack right here and so this is

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
this back tack right here and so this is
my<00:01:39.689> edge<00:01:39.930> I'm<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> make<00:01:40.890> sure<00:01:40.920> that

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
