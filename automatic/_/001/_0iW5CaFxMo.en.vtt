 the system will not be able to work correctly 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 childâ€™s account can be managed from here 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.820
 here it is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.310
 parent office 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.510
 after registration the child appears 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.510

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.860

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.810

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.430

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.370

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.450

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.969

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.890

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.860
