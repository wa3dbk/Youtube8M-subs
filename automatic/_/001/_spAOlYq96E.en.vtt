the<00:00:43.920> things<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.160> makes<00:00:44.309> us<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.610> unique

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the things that makes us really unique

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
the things that makes us really unique
is<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.239> actually<00:00:45.390> use<00:00:45.719> depth<00:00:46.020> cameras<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.559> an

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
is we actually use depth cameras as an

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.590 
is we actually use depth cameras as an
input<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.520> track<00:00:47.760> faces<00:00:48.270> really

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
input so we can track faces really

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840 
input so we can track faces really
really<00:00:48.960> well<00:00:49.140> we've<00:00:50.100> got<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> long<00:00:50.520> history

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
really well we've got a long history

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.479 
really well we've got a long history
using<00:00:51.449> depth<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.899> video<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.980> understand<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
using depth and video to understand the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.340 
using depth and video to understand the
shape<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.969> contours<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.660> your<00:00:54.780> face<00:00:55.110> the

shape and contours of your face the
color<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.710> your<00:00:55.829> face<00:00:56.039> as<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.280> change

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
color of your face as you change

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.910 
color of your face as you change
expressions<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.420> we're<00:00:58.260> utilizing<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
expressions and we're utilizing that

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.400 
expressions and we're utilizing that
with<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> intel<00:01:00.300> realsense<00:01:00.329> camera<00:01:01.199> that's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
with the intel realsense camera that's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.160 
with the intel realsense camera that's
being<00:01:01.590> embedded<00:01:02.190> into<00:01:02.489> laptops<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.930> speak

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
being embedded into laptops as we speak

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.590 
being embedded into laptops as we speak
that's<00:01:05.040> that's<00:01:05.339> fantastic<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
that's that's fantastic so what is the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.969 
that's that's fantastic so what is the
camera<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.020> you're<00:01:07.110> using<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:07.650> here

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
for this demo so what we're showing

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.570 
for this demo so what we're showing
right<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.350> prime<00:01:10.770> sense<00:01:11.040> carmine

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
right now is the prime sense carmine

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.490 
right now is the prime sense carmine
it's<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.150> camera<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.070> was<00:01:14.070> originally<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
it's a camera that was originally the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.460 
it's a camera that was originally the
internal<00:01:16.500> guts<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.340> original<00:01:17.700> Kinect<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
internal guts of the original Kinect and

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
internal guts of the original Kinect and
actually<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:20.130> built<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.640> cool<00:01:20.790> camera

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
actually they built a really cool camera

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.700 
actually they built a really cool camera
a<00:01:21.360> couple<00:01:21.479> years<00:01:21.750> ago<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.200> tiny<00:01:22.470> one

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
a couple years ago really tiny one

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
a couple years ago really tiny one
that's<00:01:22.890> embeddable<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.939> Apple<00:01:24.299> bought<00:01:24.509> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that's embeddable and Apple bought that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.300 
that's embeddable and Apple bought that
company<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.439> don't<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.740> what's<00:01:25.950> happening

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
company we don't know what's happening

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.499 
company we don't know what's happening
with<00:01:26.369> Apple<00:01:26.729> we're<00:01:26.880> kind<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.119> hoping<00:01:27.390> they

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
with Apple we're kind of hoping they

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.109 
with Apple we're kind of hoping they
might<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.810> something<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> future<00:01:29.119> but

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
might do something in the future but

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.940 
might do something in the future but
that<00:01:30.150> spurred<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.750> lot<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.170> developments<00:01:31.770> in

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
that spurred on a lot of developments in

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.810 
that spurred on a lot of developments in
in<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.579> depth<00:01:32.939> camera<00:01:33.900> industry<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.860> so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
in this depth camera industry and so

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
in this depth camera industry and so
people<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.540> Intel<00:01:36.990> has<00:01:37.170> produced<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
people like Intel has produced a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.289 
people like Intel has produced a
fantastic<00:01:38.130> camera<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.670> now<00:01:38.850> embeddable

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
fantastic camera that's now embeddable

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.999 
fantastic camera that's now embeddable

and<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:20.790> that's<00:02:20.969> been<00:02:21.180> our<00:02:21.359> kind<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.900> primary

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
and so that's been our kind of primary

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.649 
and so that's been our kind of primary
industry<00:02:22.829> until<00:02:23.189> today<00:02:23.430> yeah<00:02:24.120> that's<00:02:24.510> great

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
industry until today yeah that's great

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.420 
industry until today yeah that's great
so<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.349> thing<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.620> thought<00:02:25.799> about<00:02:25.950> first<00:02:26.159> is

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
so the thing I thought about first is

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.640 
so the thing I thought about first is
when<00:02:27.420> we're<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.689> virtual<00:02:28.019> reality<00:02:28.079> and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
when we're in virtual reality and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.280 
when we're in virtual reality and
especially<00:02:29.519> something<00:02:30.299> like<00:02:30.420> VR<00:02:30.750> chats

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
especially something like VR chats

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.500 
especially something like VR chats
social<00:02:31.859> platforms<00:02:32.310> facial<00:02:33.090> expression<00:02:33.450> is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
social platforms facial expression is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.059 
social platforms facial expression is
something<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:33.840> can<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.109> expand<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
something that can really expand the

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.209 
something that can really expand the
experience<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:36.510> obviously<00:02:36.750> if<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.930> have

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:37.219 
experience so obviously if you have

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.319 
experience so obviously if you have
something<00:02:38.219> on<00:02:38.340> your<00:02:38.430> face<00:02:38.489> like<00:02:38.879> an<00:02:38.969> oculus

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
something on your face like an oculus

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.410 
something on your face like an oculus
rift<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:39.780> example<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:41.250> would<00:02:41.459> be<00:02:41.579> a<00:02:41.939> little

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
rift for example this would be a little

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.030 
rift for example this would be a little
bit<00:02:42.540> more<00:02:42.840> difficult<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.349> use<00:02:43.379> obviously<00:02:43.739> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
bit more difficult to use obviously so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.679 
bit more difficult to use obviously so
but<00:02:44.189> could<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.579> still<00:02:44.819> use<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.150> for<00:02:45.359> at<00:02:45.569> least

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
but could you still use it for at least

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.559 
but could you still use it for at least
the<00:02:45.900> mouth<00:02:46.079> portion<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.829> your<00:02:47.400> face<00:02:47.639> yeah

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
the mouth portion of your face yeah

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.149 
the mouth portion of your face yeah
that's<00:02:48.989> actually<00:02:49.169> one<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.650> reasons<00:02:50.010> we're

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
that's actually one of the reasons we're

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.789 
that's actually one of the reasons we're
at<00:02:50.370> SV<00:02:50.730> VR<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.239> we<00:02:51.450> want<00:02:51.689> to<00:02:51.780> bring<00:02:51.989> life<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.530> VR

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
at SV VR is we want to bring life to VR

their face they're looking at these
wonderful<00:03:01.019> experiences<00:03:01.169> are<00:03:01.829> immersed<00:03:02.250> in

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
wonderful experiences are immersed in

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.339 
wonderful experiences are immersed in
something<00:03:02.909> that<00:03:02.939> you<00:03:03.689> just<00:03:03.900> couldn't<00:03:04.169> see

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
something that you just couldn't see

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.679 
something that you just couldn't see
anywhere<00:03:04.680> else<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.310> yet<00:03:06.030> there's<00:03:06.269> no<00:03:06.510> one

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
anywhere else and yet there's no one

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.420 
anywhere else and yet there's no one
interacting<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.349> them<00:03:07.500> in<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.799> space<00:03:08.099> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
interacting with them in that space and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.089 
interacting with them in that space and
I<00:03:08.849> think<00:03:09.060> that's<00:03:09.239> where<00:03:09.480> we'll<00:03:09.629> be<00:03:09.859> in<00:03:10.859> the

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
I think that's where we'll be in the

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.520 
I think that's where we'll be in the
future<00:03:11.400> at<00:03:11.609> some<00:03:11.849> point<00:03:12.120> we<00:03:12.930> want<00:03:13.169> to<00:03:13.319> bring

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
future at some point we want to bring

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.289 
future at some point we want to bring
life<00:03:13.769> we<00:03:14.189> want<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.519> bring<00:03:14.729> a<00:03:14.849> social

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
life we want to bring a social

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.050 
life we want to bring a social
connection<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.989> VR<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.620> that's<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.549> space<00:03:17.849> that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
connection to VR and that's a space that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.719 
connection to VR and that's a space that
will<00:03:18.180> help<00:03:18.329> solve<00:03:18.709> eventually<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:20.639> the

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
will help solve eventually in the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.879 
will help solve eventually in the
meantime<00:03:20.909> yes<00:03:21.419> we<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.959> track<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.739> lower

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
meantime yes we can track the lower
