00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
like that this is going to work out

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.450 
like that this is going to work out
amazing<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.950> too<00:01:20.159> many<00:01:20.250> problems

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
amazing I don't have too many problems

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.399 
amazing I don't have too many problems
with<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:20.939> skin<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.780> don't<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.110> too<00:01:22.380> many

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
with my skin and I don't get too many

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.620 
with my skin and I don't get too many
breakouts<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:24.090> bit<00:01:24.270> thick

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
breakouts so it is a little bit thick

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.320 
breakouts so it is a little bit thick
for<00:01:24.960> me<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.250> kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.820> tend<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.210> look

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
for me and it can kind of tend to look

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330 
for me and it can kind of tend to look
cakey<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> don't<00:01:28.290> use<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> finishing

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
cakey if you don't use like a finishing

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.179 
cakey if you don't use like a finishing
powder<00:01:29.490> over<00:01:30.210> top<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.590> overall<00:01:32.070> I

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
powder over top of it but overall I

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
powder over top of it but overall I
think<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.210> nice<00:01:33.509> winter

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
think this is really nice winter

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.289 
think this is really nice winter
foundation<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.189> don't<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.729> myself<00:01:35.880> I

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
number buff the color and it probably

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.899
