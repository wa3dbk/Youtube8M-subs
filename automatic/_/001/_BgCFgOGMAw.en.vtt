00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.180
 Hello 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:17.290
 This time as science studio work movie second 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.290
 We will show you how to make a thread phone that can be used by two people 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.500
 First , referring to the previous thread telephone work movie 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.970
 Do octopus yarn in a paper cup 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.480
 Please tie slowly 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.480
 next 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:46.010
 Use a clip 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.760
 Please tie the octopus thread to this clip 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.760
 At this time 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:58.270
 As octopus yarn can not be easily unwound 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.270
 Please tie tightly 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.960
 I play the same thing after this 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.280
 Make for the number of people 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.280
 Once you moisture 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.680
 The last is 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.100
 this 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.970
 If all clips are connected and opened 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:30.270
 It will be completed 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.740
 When done, use a large place as shown in the picture and play at a distance until the thread is taut. 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.780
 Please 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.290
 Also 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.580
 In the movie I used a short thread, but when I played I had some conversation at some distance 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.619
 Because it is easy 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.619
 When making a yarn starch, please use a yarn of 1 meter or more 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:59.370
 This is the end of the science studio work movie movie No. 3 Garr Make a thread phone with your friends by all means 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.370
 Please try playing
