all races are graded here in Australia
and<00:01:37.979> that's<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:38.400> much<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> same<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and that's pretty much the same for the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.510 
and that's pretty much the same for the
rest<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> world<00:01:39.869> now<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> grading<00:01:41.130> system

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
rest of the world now the grading system

rest of the world now the grading system
is<00:01:41.640> either<00:01:41.850> done<00:01:42.180> by<00:01:42.479> age<00:01:42.780> group<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.950> done

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
by ability so it really depends on the

groups<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:52.979> you'd<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.159> junior<00:01:53.790> categories

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
groups so you'd have junior categories

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.260 
groups so you'd have junior categories
open<00:01:55.200> categories<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> masters<00:01:56.790> categories

run at the local club level so what

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.600

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.320 
improving their fitness to get them to a
level<00:05:01.320> so<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.130> they're<00:05:02.430> ready<00:05:02.700> to<00:05:02.910> compete<00:05:03.270> a

level so that they're ready to compete a
nice<00:05:03.750> sort<00:05:04.200> of<00:05:04.440> events<00:05:05.150> now<00:05:06.150> sometimes<00:05:06.690> we<00:05:07.050> may

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
getting them to the event now I can

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.700 
getting them to the event now I can
always<00:05:14.970> work<00:05:15.300> on<00:05:15.510> getting<00:05:15.720> them<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.380> event

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
in their best possible form but it may

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.710 
in their best possible form but it may
not<00:05:19.890> necessarily<00:05:20.160> be<00:05:20.790> good<00:05:21.120> enough<00:05:21.330> for<00:05:21.390> that

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
not necessarily be good enough for that

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.140 
not necessarily be good enough for that
particular<00:05:21.870> event<00:05:22.500> so<00:05:22.980> sometimes<00:05:23.490> I<00:05:23.730> also

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
particular event so sometimes I also

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.210 
particular event so sometimes I also
need<00:05:24.540> to<00:05:24.570> address<00:05:24.870> their<00:05:25.260> time<00:05:25.530> frame<00:05:25.980> around

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
need to address their time frame around

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.330 
need to address their time frame around

the<00:05:46.560> planning<00:05:47.130> and<00:05:47.250> goal<00:05:47.730> setting<00:05:48.260> associated

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
the planning and goal setting associated

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.530 
the planning and goal setting associated
with<00:05:49.350> a<00:05:49.470> particular<00:05:49.680> event<00:05:50.180> we<00:05:51.180> can<00:05:51.360> then

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
with a particular event we can then

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.480 
with a particular event we can then
ensure<00:05:51.930> that<00:05:52.140> your<00:05:52.290> athlete<00:05:52.680> arrives<00:05:53.160> that

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
ensure that your athlete arrives that

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.310 
ensure that your athlete arrives that
event<00:05:53.730> in<00:05:53.910> the<00:05:54.060> best<00:05:54.270> possible<00:05:54.510> condition<00:05:55.140> and

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
event in the best possible condition and

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.590 
event in the best possible condition and
that's<00:05:55.920> a<00:05:56.070> really<00:05:56.400> big<00:05:56.760> plus<00:05:57.150> for<00:05:57.180> them

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
that's a really big plus for them

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.900 
that's a really big plus for them
mentally<00:05:58.020> so<00:05:59.010> the<00:05:59.130> other<00:05:59.310> thing<00:05:59.400> that<00:05:59.550> we<00:05:59.730> work

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
mentally so the other thing that we work

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.430 
mentally so the other thing that we work
on<00:06:00.120> is<00:06:00.240> making<00:06:00.420> sure<00:06:00.630> that<00:06:00.840> they're<00:06:01.260> prepared

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
on is making sure that they're prepared

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.130 
on is making sure that they're prepared
logistically<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:02.670> that's<00:06:03.390> the<00:06:03.570> other<00:06:03.780> big

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
logistically and that's the other big

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.080 
logistically and that's the other big
issue<00:06:04.290> that<00:06:04.620> happens<00:06:05.580> when<00:06:05.760> you<00:06:05.850> get<00:06:05.970> two

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
issue that happens when you get two

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.330 
issue that happens when you get two
races<00:06:06.480> there<00:06:06.690> is<00:06:06.960> also<00:06:07.260> nothing<00:06:07.680> worse<00:06:08.070> than

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
races there is also nothing worse than

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.700 
races there is also nothing worse than
getting<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.700> an<00:06:08.790> event<00:06:09.030> and<00:06:09.240> finding<00:06:09.810> out<00:06:09.990> that
