00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
that was exactly what Metro said a

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.119 
that was exactly what Metro said a
couple<00:03:06.810> episodes<00:03:06.989> back<00:03:07.470> Marilyn<00:03:08.040> was

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
couple episodes back Marilyn was

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.949 
couple episodes back Marilyn was
shifting<00:03:08.519> back<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.760> forth<00:03:09.030> between<00:03:09.359> human

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
shifting back and forth between human

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.750 
shifting back and forth between human
and<00:03:10.049> ant<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.890> he<00:03:11.010> didn't<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.340> one<00:03:11.549> dominant

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
