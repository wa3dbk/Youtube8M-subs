um<00:01:09.430> shooting<00:01:10.430> outside<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:11.060> always<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.200> best<00:01:12.229> I

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
um shooting outside is always the best I

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.070 
um shooting outside is always the best I
think<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:13.250> can<00:01:13.370> do<00:01:13.520> that<00:01:14.050> nature<00:01:15.050> provides

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
think it can do that nature provides

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.530 
think it can do that nature provides
this<00:01:15.560> beautiful<00:01:16.100> light<00:01:16.250> however<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:17.390> think

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
this beautiful light however I think

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.890 
this beautiful light however I think
common<00:01:18.170> sense<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:19.310> shoot<00:01:20.030> in<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.270> Sun<00:01:20.630> and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
common sense is to shoot in the Sun and

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.290 
common sense is to shoot in the Sun and
put<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.740> Sun<00:01:21.950> behind<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.460> camera<00:01:22.790> that's

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
put the Sun behind the camera that's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.140 
put the Sun behind the camera that's
what<00:01:23.479> my<00:01:23.600> dad<00:01:23.810> would<00:01:24.020> do<00:01:24.140> anyway<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.820> result

I would recommend taking cover finding
some<00:01:43.520> shade<00:01:43.729> under<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.180> tree<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.229> find<00:01:45.440> some

open shade like this and it's still full

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.630 
open shade like this and it's still full
sunlight<00:01:49.789> somewhere<00:01:50.420> just<00:01:50.690> not<00:01:51.080> here<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.680> I

would also recommend having the camera

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.380 
would also recommend having the camera
placed<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.979> little<00:01:55.190> bit<00:01:55.280> above<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.210> that

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
lots of challenges mainly the light is

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.869 
lots of challenges mainly the light is
pretty<00:02:43.310> low<00:02:43.519> inside<00:02:44.050> which<00:02:45.050> will<00:02:45.610> cause<00:02:46.610> your

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
flash it might be fine but generally

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.589

speaking on camera flashes like on your
point-and-shoot<00:02:53.870> will<00:02:54.530> cause<00:02:54.920> very<00:02:55.280> harsh

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
point-and-shoot will cause very harsh

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.270

whiten things out one alternative to

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.280 
whiten things out one alternative to
this<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.430> turn<00:03:04.640> on<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.790> lamp<00:03:05.030> or<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.810> add<00:03:05.959> some

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
this is to turn on a lamp or to add some

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.680 
this is to turn on a lamp or to add some
lights<00:03:06.530> inhale<00:03:07.599> like<00:03:08.599> this<00:03:08.840> one<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:12.819> then<00:03:13.819> you

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
lights inhale like this one and then you

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.330 
lights inhale like this one and then you
know<00:03:14.810> it'll<00:03:15.200> add<00:03:15.349> some<00:03:15.560> light<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:16.010> hopefully

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
know it'll add some light so hopefully

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.550 
know it'll add some light so hopefully
your<00:03:16.489> camera's<00:03:16.790> flash<00:03:16.819> won't<00:03:17.480> fire<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.410> can
