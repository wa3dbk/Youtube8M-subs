00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
damage to the hero when the time is
right<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.949> where<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.309> def<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.090> very

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
right and where it's def at so it's very

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
right and where it's def at so it's very
challenging<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:04.019> completely<00:01:04.350> remove<00:01:04.739> keeping

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400

the<00:01:05.460> right<00:01:05.610> circumstances<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.750> scavenging

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the right circumstances the scavenging

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.530 
the right circumstances the scavenging
hyena<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.890> buff<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.310> very<00:01:08.610> fast<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> early

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
hyena can buff up very fast in the early

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
hyena can buff up very fast in the early
game<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.260> also<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.890> tube<00:01:11.159> card<00:01:11.460> that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
game but it's also just a tube card that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.399 
game but it's also just a tube card that
later<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> match<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.840> come<00:01:13.080> out<00:01:13.229> in

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
later in the match can come out in

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.170 
later in the match can come out in
combination<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.220> sacrificing<00:01:15.000> other

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
combination with sacrificing other

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.330 
combination with sacrificing other
beasts<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:16.049> make<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> big<00:01:16.530> minion<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.040> away

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
beasts to make a big minion right away

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.719 
beasts to make a big minion right away
so<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> 2<00:01:18.450> man<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.780> 6<00:01:18.990> 4<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:19.500> 85<00:01:20.189> now

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
so it's like a 2 man or 6 4 or 85 now

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.580 
so it's like a 2 man or 6 4 or 85 now
when<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.150> think<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.540> beasts<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.020> sacrifice

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
when we think of beasts to sacrifice

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.440 
when we think of beasts to sacrifice
unleash<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> hounds<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.759> snake<00:01:24.030> trap<00:01:24.270> our

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
obvious choices and then because of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
obvious choices and then because of
those<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.729> want<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> take<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> knife<00:01:27.540> juggler
