00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.669
 the web of souls the first extension 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.130
 to diablo 3 95 story nude around the 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.349
 undead overrun city west marge den 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.480
 crusaders as new heroes class and 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.330
 quasi followers of the paladins from diablo 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.700
 2 as well as the death angel malta elans new 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.919
 erzfeind brings the knowledge we have 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.960
 since the gamescom on the blizzcon 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.489
 blizzard does not change that now 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.619
 only for the consoles more specifically for 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.750
 the playstation 4 shown as well 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.610
 various other innovations demonstrated 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.010
 including the one for diablo 3 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.019
 thought then but in exile 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.760
 deported mystic one 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.339
 craftswoman with the objects 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.710
 Attributes sony enchant and trans 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.960
 so it can look like that 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.730
 from one item to another 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.460
 also new and much more important 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.710
 is the alternative adventure mode of the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.149
 the long-term motivation with new coincidence 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.359
 should start elements 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.489
 so will be 25 ps at the start of each campaign 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.100
 generates special quests in which one 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.989
 for example, boss monster hunting next to 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.180
 the bond issue in which you get it 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.860
 story about moths spiders queen 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.930
 For example , there is something to do 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.730
 also orders in which one an event 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.560
 must complete a dungeon of 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.810
 Monsters, for example, clean the good ones 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.280
 old goat cave or a well-known one 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.370
 monster in an unfamiliar environment 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.500
 mira was the wife of the blacksmith 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.210
 completed bounty quests bring gold 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.580
 experience and especially powerful 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.040
 Above all, bring legendary items 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.050
 she tore flows so stones again 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.330
 you can never fall into the city tore 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.060
 open up another important facet 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.650
 of the adventure mode through these portals 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.780
 you jump into special 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.360
 challenge the dungeon and the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.250
 are completely randomly generated 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.470
 venue the lighting the weather 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.720
 as well as the type and number of monstrous 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.670
 Residents are all diced 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.470
 and therefore do not have to 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.960
 keep normal diablo logic 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.120
 for example, the first of the could be 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.520
 to ten dungeon floors one 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.280
 colorful county mood full of brook 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.260
 be demons and the second lava cave 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.720
 full siege beasts and 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.820
 monster saying worms or maybe 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.869
 Lying in the level also just 20 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.360
 scorpions around 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.890
 well then comes to dad or you get 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.780
 a wacky baff the 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.240
 for example, permanent chains blitzer 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.270
 fired or the cool down times of all 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.130
 magic to zero lowers to completion 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.390
 every neverland dungeon will wait 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.840
 naturally in randomly generated 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.720
 boss opponent including appropriate booty so 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.790
 Each case is individual 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.320
 play the ancient grinding of the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.150
 always the same areas would be with it 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.280
 past and because now 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.170
 unlimited ascend the paragon level 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.180
 and even attribute points 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.370
 distribute around about the critical 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.620
 can increase the chance of winning the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.020
 own monster hunters now also off the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.270
 Equipment is always improving 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.410
 That should be the long-term motivation, well 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.880
 do not just lower 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.190
 In addition, in the adventure mode 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.770
 all waypoints free from the beginning 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.420
 switched differently than in the regular story 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.170
 Mode can be so free through the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.970
 move the world 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.130
 For example, from the prison then already in 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.880
 first act directly to the west margin in the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.920
 fifth 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.930
 In addition, the adventure mode is synonymous 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.120
 low level heroes immediately to 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.820
 You do not have to first the new one 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.650
 reach maximum level 70 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.269
 the difficulties can now 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.860
 also change immediately 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.910
 you do not have to go through the game anymore 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.260
 play for the next highest 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.420
 unlock 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.880
 the challenging levels will also be new 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.390
 divided into slightly normal heart 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.519
 painfully demonic and apocalypse all 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.230
 of which are in the campaigns from the beginning 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.230
 and in adventure mode available 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.480
 but of course they become more challenging 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.850
 also the new monsters of the fifth act 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.370
 Summoners pollute the ground and 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.680
 awaken spirits the kind of death swings 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.900
 her sense and the punisher colossus his 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.580
 he fisted good five crusader knights 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.410
 is that still no problem 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.450
 of course there are still in the west 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.730
 Another blow like the exorcist 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.420
 charging and the lightning monster 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.150
 transformed or the west margin and the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.700
 Heroes are preferably swallowed and if 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.430
 he pisses her off at the death cross 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.840
 bad dog besides, the monster 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.940
 now more often with each other 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.400
 rather interact with the little one 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.040
 budget and his bigger buddy 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.290
 brut of the heavyweights gets in the fight 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.940
 bring little bobic and throw it up 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.240
 the hero before he himself 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.980
 cloth feel goes 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.740
 Congenially complemented is this dynamic 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.140
 duo for the terror bat the bobic 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.940
 bite and turn into bruce the 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.110
 then in turn generate more bobic the 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.370
 the feathers can negotiate from the blood 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.630
 the other box will produce the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.400
 Bats boots can transform the 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.169
 new box yes create this cycle 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.690
 you should interrupt quickly 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.450
 the last family member is the 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.880
 bow staircase of angling sets and 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.010
 stun dart shoots while hus 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.230
 So deduct their celebrity show 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.970
 hit distance 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.410
 and treat the hero with falling and 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.220
 unite that is not in itself 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.690
 spectacular 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.700
 However, not necessarily now 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.260
 one of the bats show up 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.480
 In addition, the hits in such 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.760
 entrench yourself in a tower and believe it 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.190
 be up there and vulnerable are you 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.300
 but not 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.300
 another nice example for one 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.740
 original monster type is the massive 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.020
 Robot's on his back porch 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.970
 he lugs around through the monster 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.130
 a different dimension to the player 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.110
 hurls when the beast dies 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.940
 the portal back and you can do it 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.070
 traverse the inhabitants of the others 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.840
 to poke aside and around her 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.680
 equipment belongings too 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.870
 facilitate 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.850
 the skylab crawlers are again 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.770
 possible but there are many in this 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.660
 catacombs greece from every angle 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.060
 that's not really dangerous 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.620
 also because smaller opponents of the hero now 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.350
 can no longer pinch 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.340
 you just walk over it 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.630
 archer, however, should now 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.520
 intelligent behavior 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.830
 so far they could only run or 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.870
 shooting in ried of souls on the other hand 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.030
 they can also escape backwards and 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.160
 Keep firing that makes the fighting 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.550
 a little more challenging but good 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.070
 trifle the big finale of the 56th 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.780
 rises in the pandemonium on this 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.510
 Battlefield are fighting each other 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.160
 Hell since time immemorial and subleased 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.170
 lately you also live the death angel 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.000
 malta so you can with 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.230
 unfriendly angels and devils 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.370
 to grapple 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:23.260
 na super special about it the 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.450
 Pandemonium will pass every time 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.130
 completely randomized all the way to 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.380
 the organic level edges 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.270
 So it always looks a bit different 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.850
 where, of course, on known 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.440
 For example, blocks will be encountered 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.570
 abandoned garrisons to explore 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.790
 may or parts of heavenly 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.950
 fall infernal and more deadly or 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.240
 time couple among those frozen 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.070
 to be trapped by demons 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.110
 The domes can be destroyed 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.430
 guessing treasures then you have to 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.410
 but also with the devil stuff 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.600
 beat around so well we grasp 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.460
 along with the adventure mode the 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.319
 deliver 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.940
 the crusader of the mystic and the 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:59.100
 brings new monsters and territories 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.440
 rieter of souls enough ideas with around 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.120
 the endgame of diablo 3 belongs 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.530
 to value and long-term motivation 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.120
 to increase 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.099
 looks like blizzard here 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.449
 actually belonged to the community 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:10.080
 and that can not really happen 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.599
 damage 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.849
 only at the arbitrary talent system changes 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:17.990
 nothing in the addon but good then 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:17.990
 at the next extension
