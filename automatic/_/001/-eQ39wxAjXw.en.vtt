00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
happening in most industrialized

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.240 
happening in most industrialized
countries<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.459> let's<00:02:35.640> say<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.819> travel<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.330> some

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
countries but let's say I travel to some

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.380 
countries but let's say I travel to some
somewhere<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.400> Africa<00:02:38.640> where<00:02:39.060> there's<00:02:39.239> some

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
somewhere in Africa where there's some

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.740 
somewhere in Africa where there's some
sort<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.630> tribe<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.200> does<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.620> look<00:02:41.750> what

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
sort of tribe that does that look what

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.080 
sort of tribe that does that look what
in<00:02:42.870> Rome<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.819> think<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:44.910> might<00:02:45.060> be

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
in Rome I think you might be

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.479 
in Rome I think you might be
misinterpreting<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.989> okay<00:02:46.739> now<00:02:46.980> by<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.310> way

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
misinterpreting that okay now by the way

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.699 
misinterpreting that okay now by the way
there<00:02:47.730> are<00:02:47.760> some<00:02:48.269> Southeast<00:02:48.989> Asian<00:02:49.380> cultures

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.470 
there are some Southeast Asian cultures

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
etcetera where it's not the best of

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.390 
etcetera where it's not the best of
ideas<00:02:54.780> though<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.650> does<00:02:55.799> spread<00:02:56.040> disease

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
