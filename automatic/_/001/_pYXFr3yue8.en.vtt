 welcome to my classroom here in 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.860
 Japan and will give you a mini tour of my area 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.600
 where I give my classes here is where 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.060

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.830
 flannels when the sun has to clean 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 it's a little dark so let me 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.210
 turn on the lights so the room has 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.640
 better lighting I just had a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.430
 class and turned off the lights to conserve 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.780
 good energy this is the television and the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.930
 for computer use 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.060

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100
 other things to teach classes and these 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.400
 things always help to give a better 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.240

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.080

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.800
 I really enjoy teaching and it has been 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.909
 one of the best experiences in my 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.679
 life teaching classes here in japan 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.409

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:18.479
 lessons we have two recesses as of 20 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.240
 minutes each and some of my 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.009
 students come to the classroom during 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.439
 their recess because they want to talk 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.719

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.750
 with my students and my students are 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:33.209
 very important to me those are my 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.250
 walt here in the schools we wear a 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.289

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.000
 I met a person who told me that 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.489
 foreigners who teach English do not 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.640
 we have an important role that we only give 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:58.679
 classes we practice a little bit with the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.789
 students and we go and that's it 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:05.640

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.039
