00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 it is inevitable not to think about the bronze and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.410
 the neon pink together in the summer that's why 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.210
 today I'm going to show you how to do this 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.210
 simple and summery makeup 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.189
 first as always is recommendable 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.800
 use a pre-base for shadows to 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.829
 that adhere better and lasts longer and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.470
 more for this perfect time then 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.989
 we take a flat brush we spray it with 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.930
 a little water and we take a little 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.360
 pigment bronze and we apply it in everything 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.780
 the eyelid mobile from the inside up 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.210
 the outside to taps doing this to him 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.939
 the pigment now the color is even more 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.839
 intense and gives a metallic touch and still 

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.839
 brighter 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.379
 perfect 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.899
 ok we apply our compact powder or 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.600
 shadow matte color skin on the bone of the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.060
 eyebrow to the fold apart that we 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.220
 will help blur the next shadows 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.399
 It gives us a cleaner appearance and we 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.649
 gives light subtly in this area with 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.930
 our bronzer blush or brown shadow 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.330
 quality first we mark the area where 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.640
 we want the color to go by following the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.280
 line the tabs outward and 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.310
 then we continue through the fold towards 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.460
 in now we will be much more 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.190
 easy to apply the rest of the color 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.710
 perfect okay we take a little more of the 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.350
 same color and we passed it exactly by 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.780
 the guide that we already did to love him and in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.929
 the fold we simply blur towards 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.090
 the sides and up this heat here 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:52.100
 it will give warmth to the eyes want it 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.100
 the lips look more intense 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.560
 so perfect ok now we take a little bit of 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.810
 dark brown shadow if it has shines 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.060
 dorados better and we apply it in the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.960
 second half of the mobile eyelid towards 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.149
 outside 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.489
 this will intensify us gently the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.799
 makeup and I say soft because only 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.610
 we apply a little bit over the shadow 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:18.140
 bronze what takes away intensity 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.420
 just now we blur a little 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.500
 the edges of the shadow brown things of 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.620
 that we are so marked 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.630
 so now we take a cream shadow 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.630
 pearly and apply it to the lacrimal 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.820
 all over the lower eye this shadow 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.470
 here it will give us light but it will also give 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.570
 freshness makeup 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.080
 you will see the eye as charged as if 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.240
 we would have used the dark shadow here 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.400
 with a soft brown pencil we delineate the 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.980
 water line to define but without being 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.420
 very strong I am using an eyeliner 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.870
 of cesc but anyone can 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.870
 function 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.250
 perfect but delineated superior and we 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.560
 we go straight to the mask we apply 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.570
 a lot up and down to get us 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.570
 a lot of volume and life to the eyelashes 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.230
 perfect sheets ready for the face 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.150
 we take our bronzer and define 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.459
 a little bit the face at the same time we give 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.590
 warmth this will give us an appearance 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.700
 much more tanned and lips 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.340
 they will highlight even more what they will see 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.319
 for blush 1 coral is perfect because 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.319
 It is fresh natural and warm at the same time 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.120
 time of lips pink neon I like 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.370
 this lipstick because it is vibrant but at 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.330
 smooth creamy and shiny 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.690
 i 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.690
 ah 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.610
 for the final touch we illuminate the story 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.750
 of the nose and the cheek bone 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.300
 for this summer light 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.880
 and we are already sad and rocking lips 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:03.930
 neon pink I hope you liked it and we 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.930
 we see in the next 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.870
 ah
