but<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.470> order<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:30.890> get<00:01:31.010> a<00:01:31.040> tight<00:01:31.370> corner<00:01:31.790> I

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
but in order to get a tight corner I

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.219 
but in order to get a tight corner I
will<00:01:33.260> use<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.530> small<00:01:33.710> pair<00:01:34.220> of<00:01:34.250> pliers<00:01:34.940> now<00:01:38.229> the

by<00:02:31.760> wrapping<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:34.150> can<00:02:35.150> start<00:02:35.480> my<00:02:35.690> design<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.790> line

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
by wrapping I can start my design a line

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.980 
by wrapping I can start my design a line
at<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.060> time<00:02:38.440> once<00:02:39.440> again<00:02:40.360> pliers<00:02:41.360> are<00:02:41.660> helpful

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
at a time once again pliers are helpful

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.800 
at a time once again pliers are helpful
for<00:02:43.240> bending<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:44.800> for<00:02:45.800> pressing<00:02:46.250> down<00:02:46.810> those

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
for bending and for pressing down those

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.170 
for bending and for pressing down those
pesky<00:02:48.170> little<00:02:48.380> edges<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.670> can<00:02:49.820> be<00:02:49.940> very

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
pesky little edges that can be very

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:59.220 
pesky little edges that can be very
sharp

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.590 

let's<00:03:00.230> wrap<00:03:00.530> another<00:03:00.890> wire<00:03:01.360> go<00:03:02.360> in<00:03:02.510> the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
let's wrap another wire go in the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:11.270 
let's wrap another wire go in the
opposite<00:03:03.140> direction

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.190 

and<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.580> can<00:03:12.760> see<00:03:13.000> we've<00:03:13.180> got<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.599> start<00:03:13.930> of<00:03:14.080> a

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
and you can see we've got the start of a

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.380 
and you can see we've got the start of a
very<00:03:14.489> simple<00:03:15.489> basic<00:03:16.269> design<00:03:18.030> another<00:03:19.030> way<00:03:19.330> to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
very simple basic design another way to

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.839 
very simple basic design another way to
create<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.989> square<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:22.300> make<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.480> shape<00:03:22.750> first

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
create a square is to make a shape first

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.270 
create a square is to make a shape first
now<00:03:24.849> I<00:03:25.209> have<00:03:25.450> created<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:26.050> star<00:03:26.440> out<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.769> soft

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
now I have created a star out of soft

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.170 
now I have created a star out of soft
pliable<00:03:27.849> aluminum<00:03:28.629> wire<00:03:29.069> it<00:03:30.069> fits<00:03:30.940> right

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
pliable aluminum wire it fits right

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.199 
pliable aluminum wire it fits right
inside<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.780> square<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.920> order<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.670> secure<00:03:34.030> to

inside the square in order to secure to
the<00:03:34.239> edges<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.930> could<00:03:35.110> use<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> little<00:03:35.470> more<00:03:35.709> wire

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
the edges I could use a little more wire

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.740 
the edges I could use a little more wire
or<00:03:37.269> as<00:03:37.959> I've<00:03:38.170> started<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.650> do<00:03:38.799> here<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:39.750> tie

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
or as I've started to do here just tie

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.380 
or as I've started to do here just tie

recommend<00:03:52.360> using<00:03:52.599> this<00:03:52.840> with<00:03:53.049> older<00:03:53.440> artists

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
recommend using this with older artists

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.740 
recommend using this with older artists
