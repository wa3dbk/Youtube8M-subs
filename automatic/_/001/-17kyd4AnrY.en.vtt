by 4 and Deon Chang sticklers five by
five<00:00:09.349> now<00:00:10.349> i<00:00:10.380> got<00:00:10.889> these<00:00:11.040> cues<00:00:11.429> because

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
five now i got these cues because

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.910 
five now i got these cues because
they're<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> few<00:00:12.620> stickerless<00:00:13.620> four

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
they're one of the few stickerless four

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.140 
they're one of the few stickerless four
by<00:00:14.070> four<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.340> five<00:00:14.519> high<00:00:14.670> fives<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.030> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
by four and five high fives on the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.939 
by four and five high fives on the
market<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.839> like<00:00:16.170> stickerless<00:00:16.560> cubes

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
market and I like stickerless cubes

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.620 
market and I like stickerless cubes
because<00:00:18.080> stickers<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.939> left<00:00:20.939> my<00:00:21.090> other<00:00:21.240> cubes

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
because stickers on left my other cubes

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.370 
because stickers on left my other cubes
always<00:00:22.260> get<00:00:22.529> damaged<00:00:23.279> as<00:00:24.859> you<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:26.039> see<00:00:26.310> on

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
always get damaged as you can see on

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.800 
always get damaged as you can see on
this<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.340> lot<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.550> other<00:00:29.730> ones<00:00:29.970> anyway

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
this one and a lot of other ones anyway

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.970 
this one and a lot of other ones anyway
um<00:00:31.969> these<00:00:32.969> cubes<00:00:33.450> overall<00:00:34.230> i'm<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.800> give

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
um these cubes overall i'm going to give

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.619 
um these cubes overall i'm going to give
both<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> them<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:36.079> 6<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.290> 10<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.059> like<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
both of them a 6 out of 10 I like them I

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.639 
both of them a 6 out of 10 I like them I
get<00:00:40.170> much<00:00:40.590> better<00:00:40.860> times<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.110> 4<00:00:43.110> by<00:00:43.320> 4

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
get much better times with this 4 by 4

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.270 
get much better times with this 4 by 4
then<00:00:45.379> my<00:00:46.379> other<00:00:46.649> four<00:00:46.980> by<00:00:47.160> fours<00:00:48.230> which<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.559> my

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
then my other four by fours which are my

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.520 
then my other four by fours which are my
V<00:00:50.520> Cube<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:53.449> wherever<00:00:54.449> my<00:00:54.660> rubiks<00:00:55.020> 4<00:00:55.199> by<00:00:55.320> 4

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
V Cube for and wherever my rubiks 4 by 4

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.860 
V Cube for and wherever my rubiks 4 by 4
is<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.149> definitely<00:00:57.149> don't<00:00:57.390> get<00:00:57.570> your<00:00:57.660> time

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
is but I definitely don't get your time

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.799 
is but I definitely don't get your time
so<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.670> my<00:00:59.670> 5<00:00:59.910> by<00:01:00.090> 5<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.539> actually

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
so that one and my 5 by 5 is actually

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.039 
so that one and my 5 by 5 is actually
only<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.079> second<00:01:01.469> 5<00:01:01.620> by<00:01:01.829> 5<00:01:02.480> which<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:03.809> other

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
only my second 5 by 5 which my other

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.480 
only my second 5 by 5 which my other
five<00:01:04.500> by<00:01:04.710> five<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.450> rubik<00:01:06.450> 5<00:01:06.659> which<00:01:06.869> sucks<00:01:07.490> but

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
five by five is rubik 5 which sucks but

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.050 
five by five is rubik 5 which sucks but
these<00:01:09.479> cubes<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.340> actually<00:01:11.340> think<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.909> pretty

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
these cubes I actually think are pretty

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.570 
these cubes I actually think are pretty
good<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.570> heard<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.650> were<00:01:13.710> knockoff<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
good I heard they were knockoff of the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.700 
good I heard they were knockoff of the
Rubik's<00:01:14.939> brand<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.810> don't<00:01:16.350> believe<00:01:16.650> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
Rubik's brand but I don't believe that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.170 
Rubik's brand but I don't believe that
and<00:01:17.100> even<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.369> they<00:01:17.490> are<00:01:17.640> they<00:01:17.850> certainly

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and even if they are they certainly

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.760 
and even if they are they certainly
improved<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> mechanism<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:22.110> works

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
improved the mechanism because it works

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.749 
improved the mechanism because it works
a<00:01:22.979> lot<00:01:23.100> better<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:24.229> anyway<00:01:25.229> um<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.729> other

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
a lot better now anyway um the other

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.200 
a lot better now anyway um the other
nice<00:01:27.030> thing<00:01:27.060> about<00:01:27.270> these<00:01:27.509> cubes<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:29.150> they<00:01:30.150> do

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
nice thing about these cubes is they do

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.819 
nice thing about these cubes is they do
at<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.570> correct<00:01:30.930> color<00:01:31.079> scheme<00:01:31.439> when<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> saw

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
at the correct color scheme when I saw

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.660 
at the correct color scheme when I saw
crazy<00:01:32.159> bad<00:01:32.400> cuber<00:01:32.939> review<00:01:33.900> them<00:01:34.310> he<00:01:35.310> said<00:01:35.549> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
crazy bad cuber review them he said that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.219 
crazy bad cuber review them he said that
the<00:01:35.700> color<00:01:35.939> scheme<00:01:36.119> was<00:01:36.390> wrong<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.869> he<00:01:37.049> must

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the color scheme was wrong but he must

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.450 
the color scheme was wrong but he must
have<00:01:37.290> gotten<00:01:37.500> an<00:01:37.650> earlier<00:01:37.950> model<00:01:38.100> because

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
have gotten an earlier model because

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.390 
have gotten an earlier model because
these<00:01:39.170> do<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> correct<00:01:40.680> color<00:01:40.979> scheme

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
these do have the correct color scheme

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.130 
these do have the correct color scheme
now<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> will<00:01:42.030> say<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.600> red<00:01:42.810> orange

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
now I will say that the red orange

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.620 
now I will say that the red orange
contrast<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.070> little<00:01:45.470> hard<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.710> see

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
contrast is a little hard to see

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.310 
contrast is a little hard to see
although<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> blue<00:01:50.240> green<00:01:51.240> contrast<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.110> very

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
although the blue green contrast is very

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.620 
although the blue green contrast is very
good<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> yellow<00:01:54.180> white<00:01:54.829> um

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
good and so with the yellow white um

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.569 
good and so with the yellow white um
overall<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.009> way<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.310> two

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
overall I really like the way the two

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:07.160 
overall I really like the way the two
moves<00:02:00.409> um<00:02:02.990> no<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.369> use<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.399> very<00:02:05.640> quickly<00:02:06.170> it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
moves um no I can use it very quickly it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.240 
moves um no I can use it very quickly it
has<00:02:09.140> good<00:02:10.140> corner<00:02:10.590> cutting

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
has good corner cutting

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.170 
has good corner cutting
and<00:02:13.250> reverse<00:02:13.640> corner<00:02:14.060> cutting<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:20.090> know

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
and reverse corner cutting and you know

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
and reverse corner cutting and you know
overall<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.570> think<00:02:20.690> these<00:02:20.840> are<00:02:20.900> pretty<00:02:21.140> good

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
overall I think these are pretty good

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.290 
overall I think these are pretty good
cubes<00:02:21.560> now<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.800> few<00:02:22.280> bad<00:02:22.640> things<00:02:22.910> about<00:02:23.030> them

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
cubes now a few bad things about them

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.910 
cubes now a few bad things about them
number<00:02:23.570> one<00:02:23.600> they<00:02:23.960> did<00:02:24.140> take<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.320> while<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.740> come

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
number one they did take a while to come

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.000 
number one they did take a while to come
but<00:02:25.640> because<00:02:26.060> they<00:02:26.330> were<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.630> cheap<00:02:26.960> this<00:02:27.770> came

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
but because they were so cheap this came

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.940 
but because they were so cheap this came
in<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.220> set<00:02:28.460> of<00:02:28.640> four<00:02:29.230> these<00:02:30.230> two<00:02:30.470> along<00:02:30.800> with

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
in a set of four these two along with

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.320 
in a set of four these two along with
the<00:02:31.040> stick<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.250> list<00:02:31.490> three<00:02:31.700> by<00:02:31.850> three<00:02:32.150> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the stick a list three by three and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.060 
the stick a list three by three and
stick<00:02:32.600> of<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:32.840> two-by-two<00:02:33.140> from<00:02:33.560> different

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
stick of this two-by-two from different

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.880 
stick of this two-by-two from different
company<00:02:34.900> they<00:02:35.900> were<00:02:35.960> only<00:02:36.110> like<00:02:36.350> thirty<00:02:36.680> five

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
company they were only like thirty five

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.520 
company they were only like thirty five
dollars<00:02:37.340> which<00:02:37.550> with<00:02:38.210> no<00:02:38.420> shipping<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:39.500> I

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
dollars which with no shipping so I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.960 
dollars which with no shipping so I
think<00:02:39.830> that's<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.190> pretty<00:02:40.340> good<00:02:40.490> deal<00:02:40.670> because

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
think that's a pretty good deal because

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.180 
think that's a pretty good deal because
if<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.420> bought<00:02:41.720> even<00:02:42.470> if<00:02:42.560> i<00:02:42.650> had<00:02:42.770> bought<00:02:42.890> just

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
if I bought even if i had bought just

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.880 
if I bought even if i had bought just
these<00:02:43.490> two<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:45.170> stickerless<00:02:45.470> two<00:02:45.680> by<00:02:45.830> two

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
these two and the stickerless two by two

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.380 
these two and the stickerless two by two
we're<00:02:46.100> already<00:02:46.250> would<00:02:46.460> have<00:02:46.490> been<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.970> lot<00:02:47.180> more

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
we're already would have been a lot more

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.490 
we're already would have been a lot more
expensive<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:48.110> buy<00:02:48.230> these<00:02:48.290> two<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.130> then<00:02:49.880> I

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
expensive to buy these two and then I

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.090 
expensive to buy these two and then I
get<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.650> soon<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:53.150> anyway<00:02:53.450> um<00:02:53.860> few<00:02:54.860> problems

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
get this soon but anyway um few problems

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.820 
get this soon but anyway um few problems
with<00:02:55.250> these<00:02:55.430> cubes<00:02:55.790> number<00:02:56.510> one<00:02:56.750> they<00:02:57.530> didn't

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
with these cubes number one they didn't

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.290 
with these cubes number one they didn't
come<00:02:57.950> packaged<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.610> best<00:02:58.820> they<00:02:59.120> were<00:02:59.180> all

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
come packaged the best they were all

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.720 
come packaged the best they were all
kind<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.540> stuffed<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.110> one<00:03:00.260> tiny<00:03:00.470> box<00:03:00.800> that<00:03:01.130> was

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
kind of stuffed in one tiny box that was

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.290 
kind of stuffed in one tiny box that was
shoved<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.360> my<00:03:02.390> mailbox<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.240> the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
shoved in my mailbox and one of the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.840 
shoved in my mailbox and one of the
pieces<00:03:05.510> actually<00:03:05.750> came<00:03:06.110> not<00:03:06.980> broken<00:03:07.370> but<00:03:07.550> it

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
pieces actually came not broken but it

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.800 
pieces actually came not broken but it
was<00:03:08.920> kind<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:10.010> out<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.190> position<00:03:11.380> it's<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:14.450> the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
was kind of out of position it's you the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.220 
was kind of out of position it's you the
two<00:03:16.180> plastic<00:03:17.180> pieces<00:03:17.630> were<00:03:17.870> not<00:03:17.989> stuck

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
two plastic pieces were not stuck

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.370 
two plastic pieces were not stuck
together<00:03:18.410> correctly<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.760> this<00:03:20.090> piece<00:03:20.870> was<00:03:21.110> not

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
together correctly so this piece was not

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.699 
together correctly so this piece was not
together<00:03:22.660> however<00:03:23.660> wasn't<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.080> hard<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.440> fix

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
together however wasn't that hard to fix

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.400 
together however wasn't that hard to fix
it<00:03:25.310> was<00:03:25.760> however<00:03:26.480> hard<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:26.959> get<00:03:27.080> back<00:03:27.200> together

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
it was however hard to get back together

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.780 
it was however hard to get back together
so<00:03:27.739> i<00:03:27.770> wouldn't<00:03:28.100> recommend<00:03:28.160> taking<00:03:28.550> these

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
so i wouldn't recommend taking these

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.820 
so i wouldn't recommend taking these
part<00:03:29.150> unless<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.660> have<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:29.989> good<00:03:30.380> reason<00:03:30.560> to

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
part unless you have a good reason to

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.170 
part unless you have a good reason to
like<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.340> mod<00:03:31.610> or<00:03:31.760> something<00:03:32.090> um<00:03:33.760> now<00:03:34.760> i'll

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
like do a mod or something um now i'll

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.830 
like do a mod or something um now i'll
do<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:36.200> solve<00:03:36.440> on<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.650> 4<00:03:36.980> by<00:03:37.100> 4<00:03:37.690> i'm<00:03:38.690> not

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
do a to solve on the 4 by 4 i'm not

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.509 
do a to solve on the 4 by 4 i'm not
gonna<00:03:38.959> do<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.170> five<00:03:39.410> by<00:03:39.560> five<00:03:39.739> saw<00:03:39.980> because

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
gonna do a five by five saw because

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.190 
gonna do a five by five saw because
that'll<00:03:41.030> take<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.300> long<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.810> it'll<00:03:41.989> be

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
that'll take you long and it'll be

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.290 
that'll take you long and it'll be
really<00:03:42.350> boring<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:43.340> just<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.940> get<00:03:44.090> an<00:03:44.209> idea

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
really boring but just to get an idea

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.720 
really boring but just to get an idea
how<00:03:44.510> this<00:03:44.810> cube<00:03:45.110> moves<00:03:45.350> i'm<00:03:46.190> going<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:46.550> give<00:03:46.700> it

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
how this cube moves i'm going to give it

00:03:46.730 --> 00:04:50.360 
how this cube moves i'm going to give it
a<00:03:46.850> self<00:03:47.060> all<00:03:47.930> right

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:05:41.650 

centers<00:04:51.370> done<00:04:52.169> took<00:04:53.169> too<00:04:53.560> long

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.790 

okay<00:05:42.660> i<00:05:44.509> am<00:05:45.509> using<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.960> double<00:05:46.259> edged<00:05:46.380> herring

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
okay i am using the double edged herring

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.740 
okay i am using the double edged herring
method<00:05:47.070> so<00:05:47.220> i<00:05:47.250> can<00:05:47.460> do<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:47.940> edge<00:05:48.090> pairs<00:05:48.389> at<00:05:48.539> once

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
method so i can do to edge pairs at once

00:05:48.750 --> 00:06:16.890 
method so i can do to edge pairs at once
which<00:05:49.740> does<00:05:50.039> save<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.280> lot<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.520> time

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:08:06.560 

edge<00:06:17.900> pairing<00:06:18.349> complete<00:07:18.219> Oh<00:07:19.219> a<00:07:19.310> little<00:07:19.580> Perry

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:06.570 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.430 

alright<00:08:07.570> as<00:08:07.690> you<00:08:07.780> can<00:08:07.990> see<00:08:08.110> I'm<00:08:08.230> not<00:08:08.350> the

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 
alright as you can see I'm not the

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.960 
alright as you can see I'm not the
fastest<00:08:08.890> with<00:08:09.070> the<00:08:09.100> four-by-four<00:08:09.550> but

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:09.970 
fastest with the four-by-four but

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.820 
fastest with the four-by-four but
overall<00:08:10.480> it's<00:08:10.720> pretty<00:08:10.810> good<00:08:11.200> moving<00:08:11.350> cube<00:08:11.680> and

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:11.830 
overall it's pretty good moving cube and

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.080 
overall it's pretty good moving cube and
if<00:08:11.890> you're<00:08:12.010> looking<00:08:12.220> for<00:08:12.250> a<00:08:12.400> good<00:08:12.580> six<00:08:12.880> less

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.090 
if you're looking for a good six less

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.580 
if you're looking for a good six less
four<00:08:13.120> by<00:08:13.390> four<00:08:13.570> and<00:08:13.630> five<00:08:13.810> by<00:08:13.960> five<00:08:14.110> I<00:08:14.320> would

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:14.590 
four by four and five by five I would

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.990 
four by four and five by five I would
recommend<00:08:14.860> these<00:08:15.070> cubes<00:08:15.400> thanks<00:08:15.910> for

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 
recommend these cubes thanks for

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.060 
recommend these cubes thanks for
watching
