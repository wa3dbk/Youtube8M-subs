00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.549
 how about friends today we are going to fortify the 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.969
 call of duty advanced warfare in its mode 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.280
 campaign and we will have the speed 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.410
 unlimited the unlimited sprint rather and 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.740
 the global speed to shoot very 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.140
 fast and move very fast in general 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.040
 As a first step we have to have a 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.509
 game saved in our usb as 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.309
 can see and I have it direct if 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.380
 you have it on your hard drive 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:36.130
 it would be a matter of just passing it on 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.560
 preference in chapter 2 of the game 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.760
 we also need the seib editor that 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.330
 is what we are seeing now in 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.740
 screen and oryzon to bring our 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.740
 departure to the desk 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.500
 and right now I'm opening the horizon 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.179
 he asks me for an update, I'll say no 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.179
 and well we drag the game 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.920
 and here we have it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.430
 well now we open the editor we give 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.619
 administrator permissions and we open the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.140
 departure to which we just ended 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.450
 drag 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.210
 and ready we will open all the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.030
 algorithms that the editor has believe me 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.640
 that this editor is not a common editor 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.330
 completely modifies the campaign 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.360
 call of duty both colors of it 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.759
 mission of the same chapter as how 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.800
 times modify all the times for 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.310
 type of reaction to exploit a 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.229
 grenade time recharge time 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.119
 jump 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.189
 distances modifies absolutely everything 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.719
 but for the same reason it is very complicated 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.880
 know what algorithm does what function 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:54.539
 what we are going to do now would be 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.409
 modify two only two we're going to 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.909
 start with the global speed 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.880
 which is the one I 'm looking for in this 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:06.770
 moment we will look like the letter g 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:10.509
 a script under speed this will help us 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.170
 shoot very fast fast recharge 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.810
 and good the global fast movement with 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.079
 both of characters and weapons since 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.180
 we give you subway to change the value that 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:28.730
 I change it from 120 to 300 and we keep 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.680
 comes out and we're going to modify a last value 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.200
 it's going to be called 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.879
 in the sprint of limited but then what 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.879
 we will look with the letter p 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.500
 and here you can find it through 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.390
 your keyboard they put the letter t and then 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.760
 looking and here he puts us sprint 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.770
 delimited zero is deactivated 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.440
 to activate it, we just have to put it on 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:56.660
 the number one we give on facebook and 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.160
 we keep going out alone just these two I'm going to 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.410
 edit you can edit those that 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.510
 be without going over the limits because 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.210
 if they will not corrupt your departure 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.360
 I'm already here for the one I already had 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:14.260
 and live the one that we just 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.300
 modify applied in my profile we closed 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.300
 horizon and we go to the console 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.560
 well here we are already on the menu and good 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.030
 I'm going to load the game from the usb 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.200
 As I was telling you friends, try 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.829
 not to put more over limit 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.610
 example if you put in speed 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.890
 unlimited you put a few nines or a 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.440
 rank outside of what the editor accepts 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.599
 you are going to cause that they are given 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.879
 and the game that gets stuck in the 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.799
 missions that freeze the console 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.079
 it has happened to me that they have told me 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.269
 previous editors then with this what 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.580
 prevent you from trying to increase 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.340
 values ​​little by little 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.270
 and you this invent try to see 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.010
 what does each thing do and apply it and good 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.810
 and here I started the mission is already 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.000
 modified 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.290
 how can you see 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.930
 the ammunition comes out faster than normal 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.180
 and good the sprint 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.759
 well, good, even more, can not 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.669
 so good the editor as I say 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.650
 it's very very very complete would matter 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.560
 to be checking several values 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.820
 different play a little with the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.300
 algorithms of the life of the ammunition of 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.150
 the pons sexes that do not say checando 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.850
 several and see which one which one is ideal 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.100
 because we do not want to play all the 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.979
 completely moderate game because no 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.650
 it's going to be comfortable but good up here 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.700
 I leave the tutorial and good in 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.800
 Any comment leave me 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.800
 and good still the video comes out 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.940
 total 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.140
 yes 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.110
 I
