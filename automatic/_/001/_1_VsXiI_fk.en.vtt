station

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.019 
station
it's<00:00:25.380> called<00:00:25.590> spider<00:00:26.039> station<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.609> for

it's called spider station it's for

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269 
it's called spider station it's for
beginners<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.740> don't<00:00:28.920> have<00:00:29.070> space

have after launch the unique features of
black<00:00:36.750> prophecy<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.219> modular<00:00:39.030> ship

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
black prophecy is the modular ship

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.260 
black prophecy is the modular ship
system<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.770> change<00:00:41.010> near<00:00:41.670> everything

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
system so I can change near everything

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.810 
system so I can change near everything
and<00:00:42.629> every<00:00:43.260> change<00:00:43.559> will<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> direct

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and every change will have a direct

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.490 
and every change will have a direct
impact<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> appearance<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.960> my<00:00:46.110> spaceship

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
impact on the appearance of my spaceship

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.880 
impact on the appearance of my spaceship
so<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.550> now<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.870> add<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.140> new<00:00:49.559> cockpit

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
so right now I I can add in new cockpit

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
shield pull explosives are a different

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.550 
shield pull explosives are a different
kind<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.220> methods<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:48.000> black<00:01:48.810> rockets<00:01:49.290> or

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
kind of methods like black rockets or

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.100 
kind of methods like black rockets or
cannibal<00:01:50.399> class<00:01:50.640> some<00:01:50.820> results<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
cannibal class some results and the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.920 
cannibal class some results and the
ninth<00:01:52.290> gear<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:53.009> tactics<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.930> techniques

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
ninth gear is for tactics and techniques

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.280 
ninth gear is for tactics and techniques
is<00:01:55.350> pretty<00:01:56.040> interesting<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.930> you<00:01:57.930> can

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
is pretty interesting because you can

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.789 
is pretty interesting because you can
unlock<00:01:58.890> new<00:01:59.130> maneuvers<00:01:59.640> for<00:02:00.000> your<00:02:00.799> spaceship

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
unlock new maneuvers for your spaceship

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.920 
unlock new maneuvers for your spaceship
for<00:02:02.399> example<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.450> double<00:02:03.840> you

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
for example if we have to double you

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.880 
for example if we have to double you
twice<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.890> will<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:06.409> speed<00:02:07.409> boots<00:02:07.649> for

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
twice you will get in speed boots for

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.300 
twice you will get in speed boots for
five<00:02:08.670> seconds<00:02:09.090> we<00:02:09.840> also<00:02:10.020> will<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.379> things

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
five seconds we also will have things

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.050 
five seconds we also will have things
like<00:02:11.760> twists

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
like twists

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.770 
like twists
loop's<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:14.860> tough<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.550> based<00:02:15.849> on<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.180> combo

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
loop's and all tough is based on a combo

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.770 
loop's and all tough is based on a combo
system<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.590> always<00:02:18.099> have<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.400> hit<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:19.030> ace

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
system so you always have to hit the ace

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.540 
system so you always have to hit the ace
a<00:02:20.319> s<00:02:20.680> DW<00:02:21.310> keys<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.330> do<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:22.989> maneuver<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:24.370> also

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
a s DW keys to do a maneuver we also
