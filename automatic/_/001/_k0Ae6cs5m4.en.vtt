00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.510 
shell actually just fell right out I'm
sure<00:01:18.380> once<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:18.680> foul<00:01:18.920> it<00:01:18.950> up<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.220> little<00:01:19.369> bit

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
sure once you foul it up a little bit

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.429

it's<00:01:19.640> not<00:01:19.759> going<00:01:19.939> to<00:01:20.000> do<00:01:20.150> that<00:01:20.329> it<00:01:21.049> seems<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.350> be

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
it's not going to do that it seems to be

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
it we'll see how we can do with that to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.550 
it we'll see how we can do with that to
give<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:32.810> some<00:01:32.990> idea<00:01:33.290> of<00:01:33.350> what<00:01:33.530> the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
like that if I had to guess and we'll

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.860 
like that if I had to guess and we'll
just<00:02:47.110> see<00:02:47.200> how<00:02:47.260> she<00:02:47.320> does<00:02:48.240> so<00:02:49.240> hang<00:02:49.420> tight<00:02:49.450> guys

see<00:05:31.960> what<00:05:32.050> we<00:05:32.110> got<00:05:32.140> on<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.410> back<00:05:32.590> side<00:05:32.860> of<00:05:32.890> the

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
see what we got on the back side of the

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.540 
see what we got on the back side of the
board<00:05:33.220> here<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:34.030> this<00:05:34.600> is<00:05:34.780> again<00:05:35.190> about<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.220> one

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
probably not okay it looks like it might

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.860 
probably not okay it looks like it might
be<00:05:43.750> maple<00:05:45.330> but<00:05:46.330> anyway<00:05:46.630> it's<00:05:46.960> a<00:05:47.050> piece<00:05:47.170> of<00:05:47.320> hard

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
be maple but anyway it's a piece of hard
