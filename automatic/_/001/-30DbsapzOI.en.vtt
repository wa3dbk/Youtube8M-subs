make him dance and move in and firing

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.340 
make him dance and move in and firing
his<00:01:56.880> missiles<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.390> exposes<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.840> recoil

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
his missiles so exposes that recoil

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.289 
his missiles so exposes that recoil
action<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.610> would<00:01:59.729> see<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.210> were

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
action that you would see if you were

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.190 
action that you would see if you were
firing<00:02:00.570> any<00:02:01.079> probably<00:02:01.380> big<00:02:01.500> weapon<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.020> that's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
firing any probably big weapon so that's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.660 
firing any probably big weapon so that's
pretty<00:02:04.500> much<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> buttoned<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.460> can

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
pretty much all the buttoned as you can

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.969 
pretty much all the buttoned as you can
take<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.060> off<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> stand<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.840> wish<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
take it off the stand if you wish and

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.889 
take it off the stand if you wish and
then<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.879> fire<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> buttons<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.750> need

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
then to fire the buttons you just need

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.800 
then to fire the buttons you just need
to<00:02:10.110> push<00:02:11.069> from<00:02:11.280> beneath<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.849> sta<00:02:12.300> PA<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
to push from beneath the sta PA but I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.580 
to push from beneath the sta PA but I
think<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.050> looks<00:02:13.170> good<00:02:13.290> on<00:02:13.349> this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
think it looks good on this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.559 
think it looks good on this
then<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.459> when<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.700> display<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.120> next<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.480> you

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
then and when you display it next to you

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.600 
then and when you display it next to you
your<00:02:15.930> battle<00:02:16.170> tank<00:02:16.410> or<00:02:16.800> your<00:02:17.069> other<00:02:17.160> vehicles

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
your battle tank or your other vehicles

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.850 
your battle tank or your other vehicles
that<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.060> probably<00:02:18.239> have<00:02:18.510> here<00:02:19.200> he<00:02:19.709> looks

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
that you probably have here he looks

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.940 
that you probably have here he looks
