00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.750
 the same 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.530
 hello good and eat all you people 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.200
 Here I leave the intro of the dog and have 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.620
 I put it in Spanish and then what 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.620
 we analyze 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.829
 it's enough to walk 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.390
 we will finish here 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:44.020
 in case you have forgotten the world is 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:48.010
 fucked well fucked 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:51.490
 the dead are loose and what is left 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.100
 of civilization depends on forces 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.050
 that we will have to understand them 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.199
 what makes you think that in this site 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.940
 we will find something different I do not know what 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:06.940
 we will find 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:11.350
 but we will be sure and sure of what 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:16.180
 no their memory is lost again you 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:21.220
 flames rahman rahman 's name or 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.260
 last name we do not know the dry hands 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.690
 the fact is that you are a former agent of 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.240
 broken arrow you have been wandering around 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.240
 since the incident 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:41.030
 I think I remember the town that's there 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.030
 you found us 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.009
 still drag your puppy more 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.990
 lapdog puppy is the only one that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.990
 know what to do, do not say 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.150
 nonsense is you only know what you 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.610
 says german 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.130
 you are not in a position to ridicule the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.180
 sir is your liniers especially having 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.210
 consider your inclinations is something of 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.110
 what you regret I will remember 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.110
 because we have come 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.080
 If we do pass caritas for reasons 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.070
 that we do not understand at all 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.800
 where everything goes for reasons that are not 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.640
 we understand 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.140
 the case is to continue moving forward 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.470
 struggling 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.470
 is what we do of grace 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.680
 if you really need is a reason we 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.380
 I will give 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.250
 and we do it because we do something 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.150
 and whatever 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.150
 why not do anything 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.020
 the fissure is less than a day 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.590
 we will leave 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.590
 and there are no answers because we will have 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.130
 as I alice you in my previous video 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.350
 it seems that they come walking all the way 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.370
 now they are beginning to remember all 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.420
 the things that had happened to him 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.180
 above and above all the man that 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.490
 It hides great secrets just like 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.460
 others but great emphasis is placed on 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.910
 Why will it be 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.820
 his memory is coming and now I want 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.640
 that you remember for a moment the voices 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.780
 of dair television is when he speaks 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.780
 the man of the hunt 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.420
 but our past we have not found 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.430
 trace of that 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.150
 is broken date is not a viable site for 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.150
 the new base 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.079
 records seem to have been destroyed 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.069
 in an infection inside the invasion 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.069
 of the facilities 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.459
 we believe that the staff provoked it by 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.459
 in 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.840
 right from the start 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.390
 in the distance and safe 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.459
 I just heard him not before he was not 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.310
 they drew nothing in conclusion to this from the 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.909
 hunting we did not know what that arrow was 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.359
 nobody's broken understood anything now yes 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.030
 we know that ras man is a former agent of 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.580
 broken Arrow 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.210
 we still do not understand well some 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.830
 things but it does say that of the fighter that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.740
 the records were destroyed in a 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.560
 fire prior to the invasion of 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.380
 facilities and it is believed that what 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.700
 provoked the staff to destroy the 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.060
 tests that involved us in the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.139
 epidemic 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.900
 cashman worked in that place 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.060
 and who knows if he was involved in 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.669
 all that and why he was involved in 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.610
 all that must also be taken into account 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.680
 there in that conversation in the hunt that 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.470
 is saying they are looking for a 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.140
 secure base 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.190
 but that's not where he came from 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.550
 where is that base people remember in 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.760
 that radio 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.550
 and let's not forget 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.820
 they say that the fissure is less than 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.090
 day the fissure you remember when you 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.410
 he said closing the gap closing the gap 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.410
 that they only said we roasted 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:29.330
 will have a link with that I think I am 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:32.280
 people I think so but assmann says 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.760
 we will have to ask if they do not know what 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.850
 ask who are they going to ask we already know 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.240
 that together they form a group of four 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.920
 people but in reality they are 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.500
 divided 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.169
 when the whole fissure burst is at 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.620
 less than a day 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:57.090
 Who would you choose to maxis or rector? 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.090
 until the next video
