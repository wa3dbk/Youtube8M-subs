00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
but naturally it's not you know perfect

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.250 
but naturally it's not you know perfect
graphics<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:06.900> 2d<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.680> isometric<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.260> they

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
graphics it's 2d it's isometric and they

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.920

actually<00:01:10.409> even<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.390> user<00:01:12.390> interface<00:01:12.900> looks

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
actually even the user interface looks

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.030 
actually even the user interface looks
fine<00:01:13.850> but<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.570> does<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.290> little<00:01:16.500> touches

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
fine but it does have little touches

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.140 
fine but it does have little touches
here<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.250> there<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.520> make<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> game<00:01:17.970> look

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.749 
here and there that make the game look
really<00:01:18.420> nice<00:01:18.860> now<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.130> course<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.580> had<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
really nice now of course they had to

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.660 
really nice now of course they had to
contrast<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.630> graphics<00:01:22.110> by<00:01:22.320> having<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
contrast the graphics by having kind of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.539 
contrast the graphics by having kind of
dumb<00:01:24.270> sound<00:01:24.570> effects<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.619> granted<00:01:26.250> the

the<00:04:41.360> highlighted<00:04:42.320> section<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.919> what<00:04:43.130> level

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
the highlighted section is what level

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.330 
the highlighted section is what level
you're<00:04:43.580> on<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:44.320> when<00:04:45.320> that<00:04:45.470> level<00:04:45.800> turns<00:04:46.010> grey

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
you're on and when that level turns grey

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.010 
you're on and when that level turns grey
it<00:04:46.520> means<00:04:46.699> you've<00:04:46.849> completely<00:04:47.419> cleared<00:04:47.840> the

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
it means you've completely cleared the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.700

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
level of enemies so when it turns red

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.379 
level of enemies so when it turns red
again<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:52.520> means<00:04:52.729> it's<00:04:52.970> something<00:04:53.270> to

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
again that means it's something to

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.330 
again that means it's something to
respond<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:54.050> need<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.259> go<00:04:54.349> back<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:55.160> it's

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
it doesn't happen fast enough because

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.409 
it doesn't happen fast enough because
they<00:05:03.020> decided<00:05:03.320> to<00:05:03.500> make<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.490> respawn<00:05:05.120> times

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.370 
they decided to make the respawn times
on<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.780> wizard<00:05:06.110> towers<00:05:06.440> faster<00:05:07.010> than<00:05:07.370> on<00:05:07.699> the

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
on the wizard towers faster than on the

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.830 
on the wizard towers faster than on the

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.760 
but anyway the environments do get a
little<00:05:54.160> repetitive<00:05:54.540> is<00:05:55.620> considering<00:05:56.620> that

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
little repetitive is considering that

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.490 
little repetitive is considering that
they<00:05:57.640> have<00:05:57.910> the<00:05:58.060> same<00:05:58.240> like<00:05:58.780> textures<00:05:59.290> and

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
they have the same like textures and

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.100 
they have the same like textures and
everything<00:05:59.770> for<00:05:59.980> all<00:06:00.310> of<00:06:00.640> the<00:06:00.760> environments

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
everything for all of the environments

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.590 
everything for all of the environments
rather<00:06:02.110> than<00:06:02.440> me<00:06:02.710> just<00:06:03.070> like<00:06:03.580> each<00:06:04.060> individual

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
rather than me just like each individual

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.540 
rather than me just like each individual
tower<00:06:05.430> so<00:06:06.430> if<00:06:06.910> they<00:06:07.300> do<00:06:07.360> get<00:06:07.660> repetitive<00:06:08.020> the

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
tower so if they do get repetitive the

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.480 
tower so if they do get repetitive the
rooms<00:06:09.550> themselves<00:06:09.730> are<00:06:10.240> different<00:06:10.360> that

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
rooms themselves are different that

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.650 
rooms themselves are different that
everything<00:06:12.490> else<00:06:12.640> looks<00:06:12.940> the<00:06:13.030> same<00:06:13.180> so<00:06:13.390> that

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
everything else looks the same so that

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.480 
everything else looks the same so that
does<00:06:13.840> get<00:06:14.020> a<00:06:14.050> little<00:06:14.260> annoying<00:06:14.410> and<00:06:14.980> the

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
does get a little annoying and the

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.450 
does get a little annoying and the
game's<00:06:15.700> almost<00:06:16.030> too<00:06:16.300> easy<00:06:17.250> you<00:06:18.250> can<00:06:18.370> get

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
game's almost too easy you can get

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.280 
game's almost too easy you can get
through<00:06:18.700> it<00:06:18.760> in<00:06:18.850> a<00:06:18.910> couple<00:06:19.090> hours<00:06:19.510> without<00:06:19.810> any

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
through it in a couple hours without any

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.710 
through it in a couple hours without any
real<00:06:20.650> difficulty<00:06:21.250> at<00:06:21.400> all<00:06:21.550> there<00:06:22.330> are<00:06:22.450> a<00:06:22.540> few

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
real difficulty at all there are a few

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.270 
real difficulty at all there are a few
moments<00:06:23.140> where<00:06:23.260> you'll<00:06:23.380> be<00:06:23.500> more<00:06:23.740> challenges

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
moments where you'll be more challenges

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.190 
moments where you'll be more challenges
than<00:06:24.400> others<00:06:24.640> but<00:06:24.820> those<00:06:25.000> that<00:06:25.420> it's<00:06:25.750> really

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
than others but those that it's really

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.810 
than others but those that it's really
not<00:06:26.590> a<00:06:26.650> hard<00:06:26.920> game<00:06:27.100> at<00:06:27.280> all

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
not a hard game at all

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.820 
not a hard game at all
so<00:06:28.330> it<00:06:28.480> is<00:06:28.600> actually<00:06:29.050> we're<00:06:29.230> checking<00:06:29.470> out<00:06:29.680> if

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
so it is actually we're checking out if

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.870 
so it is actually we're checking out if
you<00:06:29.920> don't<00:06:30.100> like<00:06:30.280> card<00:06:30.610> games<00:06:32.190> you<00:06:33.190> know<00:06:33.310> not

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
you don't like card games you know not

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.900 
you don't like card games you know not
too<00:06:34.270> hard<00:06:34.540> it's<00:06:34.870> a<00:06:35.190> little<00:06:36.190> bit<00:06:36.280> too<00:06:36.430> easy<00:06:36.460> but

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
too hard it's a little bit too easy but

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.650 
too hard it's a little bit too easy but

and stuff like that but overall it's a

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.940 
and stuff like that but overall it's a
good<00:06:48.130> game<00:06:48.400> I<00:06:48.700> wouldn't<00:06:49.120> say<00:06:49.330> it's<00:06:49.780> amazing<00:06:50.560> or
