used a very large softbox I use a

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.120 
used a very large softbox I use a
reflector<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:13.450> send<00:03:13.750> back<00:03:14.020> some<00:03:14.320> light<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.890> the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
reflector to send back some light in the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.750 
reflector to send back some light in the
shadow<00:03:15.370> area<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.410> use<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.680> hair<00:03:17.920> light<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.610> do

shadow area I use the hair light to do

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.160 
shadow area I use the hair light to do
that<00:03:19.000> blow<00:03:19.390> into<00:03:19.660> hair

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
that blow into hair

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.320 
that blow into hair
and<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.560> line<00:03:20.800> here<00:03:21.370> on<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.730> arm<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.209> the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
and the line here on the arm and the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.640 
and the line here on the arm and the
shoulder<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.940> that's<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.480> that's<00:03:25.690> as<00:03:26.020> simple

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
shoulder and that's it that's as simple

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.550 
shoulder and that's it that's as simple
as<00:03:26.800> this<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.910> light<00:03:28.120> has<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.750> be<00:03:28.780> controlled

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
as this the light has to be controlled

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.120 
as this the light has to be controlled
this<00:03:30.220> is<00:03:30.400> about<00:03:30.610> 17<00:03:31.180> wax<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.380> about<00:03:32.560> 40

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
this is about 17 wax this is about 40

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.550 
this is about 17 wax this is about 40
watts<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.730> back<00:03:33.910> it's<00:03:34.570> very<00:03:35.050> low<00:03:35.320> power

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
watts in the back it's very low power

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.000 
watts in the back it's very low power
this<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:35.980> only<00:03:36.430> possible<00:03:36.910> with<00:03:37.810> Aurora<00:03:38.380> fusion

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
this is only possible with Aurora fusion

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.780 
this is only possible with Aurora fusion
flashes<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:40.090> go<00:03:40.270> as<00:03:40.720> low<00:03:41.260> in<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:42.040> steady<00:03:42.520> and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
flashes to go as low in a steady and

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.440 
flashes to go as low in a steady and
sure<00:03:43.510> way<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.020> control<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.890> power<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:46.270> let's

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
sure way to control the power so let's

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.230 
sure way to control the power so let's
go<00:03:46.600> on<00:03:46.750> actually

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240
