00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
enough right but is it safe what

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.999 
enough right but is it safe what
wouldn't<00:01:54.729> be<00:01:54.880> safe<00:01:55.180> about<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:55.539> would<00:01:56.109> be<00:01:56.320> if<00:01:56.829> it

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
wouldn't be safe about it would be if it

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.389 
wouldn't be safe about it would be if it
pulled<00:01:57.280> out<00:01:57.399> some<00:01:57.579> hair<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.710> all<00:02:00.100> in

pulled out some hair and that's all in
the<00:02:00.490> technique<00:02:00.909> if<00:02:01.509> you<00:02:01.689> put<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.140> bonds<00:02:02.500> too

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
the technique if you put the bonds too

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.800 
the technique if you put the bonds too
close<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.159> scalp<00:02:03.399> they<00:02:03.939> here<00:02:04.149> with<00:02:04.299> pull

right<00:02:04.990> out<00:02:05.020> from<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.439> loop<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.899> far<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.259> been

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
right out from the loop so far it's been

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.169 
right out from the loop so far it's been
two<00:02:08.709> hours<00:02:08.739> let's<00:02:09.609> see<00:02:09.789> how<00:02:09.940> she's<00:02:10.149> doing
