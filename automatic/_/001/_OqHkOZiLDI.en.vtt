00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello youtube in this video I will show you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.140
 some of the curiosities of the eye 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.550
 human but this video will have a 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.470
 second part 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.140
 good we begin 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.330
 about one in 30 people is 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.130
 blind for the color so much mica and not 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.610
 they distinguish well the green colors and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.250
 red 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.230
 the people with the sad eyes in 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.360
 reality its natural color is blue 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.010
 but its color is so weak and clear that 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.470
 tend to be covered with a layer 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.079
 protective gray 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.239
 people with green eyes 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.980
 strong tend to have a personality 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.530
 remarkable 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.460
 people with big eyes have 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.950
 higher self-esteem 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.809
 the people of the black skin color more 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.239
 that intense tend to have eyes 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.730
 blue but people of that color of 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.640
 There are very few skin is a mutation 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.649
 the one in the photo is a demonstration of 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.010
 race negritos but they usually exist 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.379
 exaggeratedly very few in the world 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.180
 The red and orange eye exist 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.810
 but those two make a single 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.909
 percentage 03 of 100% of people in 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.310
 the world gets it 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.259
 the color of the changing eyes is 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.869
 lie does not change only the tonalities 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.609
 from light to dark are altered either 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.400
 by emotions or colors that 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.890
 emphasize 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.020
 according to a study of men with eyes 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.270
 blue like more women with 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.400
 blue eyes but women with eyes 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.130
 blue people like men more 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.530
 the dark eyes between the brothers 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.870
 always the hue of the color of the eye 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.730
 it will be different even if some are not very 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.560
 remarkable will always be different in 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.079
 exception of morochos or genres 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.659
 a person can be born with green eyes 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.100
 or blue without the need for your family 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.270
 they have the same color 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.939
 this happens a lot and it is no longer strange 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.460
 stretch your eyes little by little if you are 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.200
 Western eye so soft and how 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.719
 the letters move and stretch 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.030
 is a protective effect because when 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.159
 you see a striking image you move away 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.140
 little to observe it contrary to the 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.020
 glued that can observe the is more 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.420
 close if they want 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.340
 the people who are blind have 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.470
 dreams with the images that you have already lived 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.750
 and people who are blind from 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.510
 birth they have dreams like in their life 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.670
 real involve the touch the smell does not 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.920
 They need the view although in some 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.629
 Sometimes it is so strong his desire to 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.549
 want to see that they involve lights 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.310
 different colors without having seen it 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.800
 before 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.260
 Asians do not really have the 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.790
 slanted eyes that's just an illusion 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.099
 optics 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.650
 the orientals have eyes without 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.659
 upper eyelid only the inside that 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.970
 focuses deeper in the eye while 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:47.550
 that the western is the opposite 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.800
 the idis pathologically without pigment 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.930
 the albino people that appears in red 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.180
 it's due to the color of the hemoglobin in the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.080
 blood that circulates through the iris itself and 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.390
 at the bottom of the eye 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.140
 well that's just the first part of 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.790
