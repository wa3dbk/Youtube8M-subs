00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:19.769 
modem in this video I have at the vital

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.640 
modem in this video I have at the vital
tiny<00:00:20.130> router<00:00:20.480> which<00:00:21.480> has<00:00:21.690> a<00:00:21.720> lower<00:00:21.990> throughput

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
tiny router which has a lower throughput

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.640 
tiny router which has a lower throughput
rate<00:00:23.520> but<00:00:23.910> still<00:00:24.240> very<00:00:24.660> high<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:27.470> on<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
rate but still very high and on the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.519 
rate but still very high and on the
front<00:00:28.830> there<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> USB<00:00:29.640> cable<00:00:30.630> just

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
front there you have a USB cable just

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.659 
front there you have a USB cable just
going<00:00:31.859> out<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> modem

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
going out to the modem

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.760 
going out to the modem
and<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.750> reason<00:00:33.989> why<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.170> running<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> cable

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and the reason why I'm running the cable

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.130 
and the reason why I'm running the cable
is<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.600> tilt<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> motor<00:00:36.960> around

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
is just so I can tilt the motor around

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.380 
is just so I can tilt the motor around
find<00:00:37.620> what<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> best<00:00:38.039> angle<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.850> for<00:00:39.210> the

meter<00:01:00.559> installed<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.679> computer<00:01:02.129> which<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
meter installed on computer which is a

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.570 
meter installed on computer which is a
nice<00:01:03.209> feature<00:01:03.569> called<00:01:03.929> stopwatch<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.920> that

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
nice feature called stopwatch and that

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.910 
nice feature called stopwatch and that
stopwatch<00:01:06.570> will<00:01:06.900> show<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> maximum

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
stopwatch will show you the maximum

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620 
stopwatch will show you the maximum
transfer<00:01:08.310> rate<00:01:08.430> which<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.180> always<00:01:09.330> good<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
transfer rate which is always good to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
transfer rate which is always good to
have<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.860> then<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.130> course<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.460> current

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
have and then of course the current

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.590 
have and then of course the current
transfer<00:01:12.150> rate<00:01:12.300> which<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.660> most<00:01:12.900> interesting

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
transfer rate which is most interesting

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.410 
transfer rate which is most interesting
so<00:01:15.770> let's<00:01:16.770> take<00:01:16.980> a<00:01:17.010> 1<00:01:17.340> gigabyte<00:01:17.760> file<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.300> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so let's take a 1 gigabyte file of a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.750 
so let's take a 1 gigabyte file of a
public<00:01:18.750> FTP<00:01:19.200> server<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.300> we'll<00:01:21.300> download<00:01:22.760> the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
public FTP server and we'll download the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.470 
public FTP server and we'll download the
file<00:01:24.030> into<00:01:24.450> 8<00:01:25.280> simultaneous<00:01:26.280> streams<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
file into 8 simultaneous streams so it

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.330 
file into 8 simultaneous streams so it
basically<00:01:27.600> chops<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> file<00:01:28.650> into<00:01:28.800> 8<00:01:29.010> min

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
basically chops up the file into 8 min

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.360 
basically chops up the file into 8 min
and<00:01:29.370> downloads<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:31.380> streams<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.890> parallel

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
and downloads and a streams in parallel

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.070 
and downloads and a streams in parallel
and<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> reason<00:01:33.120> why<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.360> want<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.870> is

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
and the reason why we want to do this is

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.800 
and the reason why we want to do this is
sometimes<00:01:34.970> even<00:01:35.970> though<00:01:36.090> you're<00:01:36.360> getting<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
sometimes even though you're getting a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.110 
sometimes even though you're getting a
very<00:01:37.380> high<00:01:37.560> speed<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> certain<00:01:38.580> speed<00:01:38.850> test

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
very high speed on a certain speed test

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.450 
very high speed on a certain speed test
we<00:01:39.900> actually<00:01:39.960> download<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> file<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.100> might<00:01:41.310> be

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
we actually download a file it might be

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.170 
we actually download a file it might be
half<00:01:41.760> your<00:01:42.450> potential<00:01:43.050> because<00:01:43.280> at<00:01:44.280> some<00:01:44.580> ISPs

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
half your potential because at some ISPs

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.020 
half your potential because at some ISPs
or<00:01:45.510> some<00:01:45.840> operators<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.560> put<00:01:46.830> up<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.550> speed

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
or some operators they put up a speed

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.660 
or some operators they put up a speed
cap<00:01:48.330> per<00:01:48.810> session<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.190> here<00:01:50.340> we're<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.580> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
cap per session and here we're going to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.060 
cap per session and here we're going to
take<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.390> many<00:01:51.630> sessions<00:01:51.870> as<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.830> fill

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
take as many sessions as we can and fill

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.110 
take as many sessions as we can and fill
up<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> pipe<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.390> max<00:01:54.830> so<00:01:55.830> let's<00:01:56.120> download

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
up the pipe to the max so let's download

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.910 
up the pipe to the max so let's download
the<00:01:57.390> file<00:01:57.800> click<00:01:58.800> OK<00:01:59.510> and<00:02:00.510> we'll<00:02:01.050> turn<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the file click OK and we'll turn on the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.450 
the file click OK and we'll turn on the
speedometer<00:02:02.840> there<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:03.930> go

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
speedometer there we go

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.369 
speedometer there we go
so<00:02:05.750> current<00:02:06.750> transfer<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.409> 59<00:02:08.310> megabits

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
so current transfer is 59 megabits

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.069 
so current transfer is 59 megabits
maximum<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.580> 59.7<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.269> that's<00:02:12.480> at<00:02:12.659> this<00:02:12.840> angle

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
maximum is 59.7 and that's at this angle

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.839 
maximum is 59.7 and that's at this angle
so<00:02:13.469> now<00:02:14.249> I<00:02:14.280> shall<00:02:14.700> rotate<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:16.519> if<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.639> follow

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
so now I shall rotate it if you follow

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:18.410 
so now I shall rotate it if you follow
the<00:02:18.120> current

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the current

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:35.000

but<00:02:41.600> here<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.110> 70<00:02:44.870> 75<00:02:46.610> 72<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:49.380> it's

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
but here we have it's 70 75 72 so it's

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.400 
but here we have it's 70 75 72 so it's
holding<00:02:49.590> very<00:02:50.040> well<00:02:50.250> at<00:02:50.430> these<00:02:50.670> speeds<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.410> at
