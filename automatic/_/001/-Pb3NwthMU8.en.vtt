but hey what you gonna do we've decided
that<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.300> Italians<00:03:02.840> are<00:03:02.989> thin<00:03:03.410> because<00:03:03.830> they

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
that the Italians are thin because they

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.009 
that the Italians are thin because they
walk<00:03:04.280> everywhere<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.660> go<00:03:05.810> up<00:03:05.930> a

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
walk everywhere and have to go up a

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.360 
walk everywhere and have to go up a
million<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.410> one<00:03:06.470> stairs<00:03:06.830> just<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.190> get

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
million and one stairs just to get

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.100 
million and one stairs just to get
around<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.760> city<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.239> we're<00:03:08.720> thinking<00:03:08.989> they

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
around the city so we're thinking they

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.900 
around the city so we're thinking they
must<00:03:09.350> not<00:03:09.590> need<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.920> eat<00:03:10.069> quite<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.519> same<00:03:10.730> as

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
must not need to eat quite the same as

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.280 
must not need to eat quite the same as
we<00:03:11.150> do<00:03:11.300> in<00:03:11.420> America<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.900> as<00:03:11.959> they<00:03:12.110> thin

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
we do in America and as they thin

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.590 
we do in America and as they thin
because<00:03:12.530> our<00:03:12.799> lifestyle<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.549> their<00:03:14.239> portions

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
because our lifestyle and their portions

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.479 
because our lifestyle and their portions
are<00:03:14.750> definitely<00:03:15.140> smaller<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:16.070> could<00:03:16.160> see<00:03:16.370> all

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
are definitely smaller you could see all

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.250 
are definitely smaller you could see all
that<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.910> sizes<00:03:17.329> of<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.570> things<00:03:17.780> let<00:03:18.019> me<00:03:18.049> back

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
that the sizes of the things let me back

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.720 
that the sizes of the things let me back
up<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.470> little<00:03:18.530> bit<00:03:18.829> everything<00:03:19.579> is<00:03:19.700> just

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
up a little bit everything is just

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.190 
up a little bit everything is just
relatively<00:03:20.329> smaller<00:03:20.630> look<00:03:20.810> at<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:20.989> size<00:03:21.170> of

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
relatively smaller look at the size of

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.710 
relatively smaller look at the size of
my<00:03:21.380> hand<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:22.010> package<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:23.329> cookie

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
compared to the size of my hand it's

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.830 
compared to the size of my hand it's
really<00:03:29.480> not<00:03:29.630> exactly<00:03:30.380> huge<00:03:31.090> over<00:03:32.090> here<00:03:32.420> very

from California we've got some fancier
stuff<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:52.140> I'm<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:52.380> gonna<00:03:52.530> kind<00:03:52.830> of<00:03:53.300> circle

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
stuff and I'm just gonna kind of circle

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.699 
stuff and I'm just gonna kind of circle
around<00:03:54.360> here<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.900> can<00:03:55.020> see<00:03:55.200> how<00:03:55.319> big<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.680> is

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
around here so you can see how big it is

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.240 
around here so you can see how big it is
but<00:03:55.980> basically<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:57.050> variety<00:03:58.050> of<00:03:58.080> wines<00:03:58.410> more<00:03:59.160> or

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
but basically a variety of wines more or

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.580 
but basically a variety of wines more or
less<00:03:59.400> reasonably<00:04:00.030> priced<00:04:00.300> at<00:04:00.990> restaurants

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
less reasonably priced at restaurants

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.809 
less reasonably priced at restaurants
we've<00:04:01.770> known<00:04:01.920> this<00:04:02.040> wine<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.520> actually

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
we've known this wine is actually

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.970 
we've known this wine is actually
cheaper<00:04:03.120> than<00:04:03.150> water<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.080> guess<00:04:04.740> maybe

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
cheaper than water so I guess maybe

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.540 
cheaper than water so I guess maybe
that's<00:04:05.250> why<00:04:05.490> it's<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:05.880> easy<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.180> drink<00:04:06.450> it

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
that's why it's so easy to drink it

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.910 
that's why it's so easy to drink it
anyway<00:04:08.550> that's<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.240> for<00:04:09.450> now<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.990> we'll

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
anyway that's it for now and we'll

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.410 
anyway that's it for now and we'll
revisit<00:04:11.160> later<00:04:12.410> thanks
