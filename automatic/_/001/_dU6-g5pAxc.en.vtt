00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
but I guess when I what it comes down to

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.119 
but I guess when I what it comes down to
is<00:00:49.780> really<00:00:50.080> just<00:00:50.549> posting<00:00:51.549> what<00:00:52.449> I<00:00:52.600> think<00:00:53.129> I

years<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.870> get<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.260> where<00:02:21.440> where<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.370> now

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
years to get to where where it is now

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.400

time<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.609> think

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
time to think

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.890 
time to think
I<00:03:12.470> think<00:03:13.040> because<00:03:13.550> I<00:03:13.760> live<00:03:13.940> here<00:03:14.090> i<00:03:14.150> tend<00:03:14.840> to

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
I think because I live here i tend to

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.470 
I think because I live here i tend to
post<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.260> lot<00:03:15.410> about<00:03:15.500> New<00:03:15.800> York<00:03:16.010> events<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.880> as

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
post a lot about New York events and as

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.500 
post a lot about New York events and as
I<00:03:18.470> moved<00:03:18.800> on<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.340> different<00:03:19.490> cities<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:19.940> as<00:03:20.420> I

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
I moved on to different cities and as I

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.530 
I moved on to different cities and as I
move<00:03:20.690> on<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:21.050> LA<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.040> think<00:03:22.400> that'll<00:03:23.150> gradually

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
move on to LA I think that'll gradually

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.170 
move on to LA I think that'll gradually
shift<00:03:23.930> but<00:03:24.590> just<00:03:25.160> like<00:03:25.250> how<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:25.700> post<00:03:26.000> about

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
shift but just like how I post about

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.200 
shift but just like how I post about
events<00:03:26.510> out<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:26.870> LA<00:03:27.110> or<00:03:27.380> in<00:03:27.530> Berlin<00:03:28.100> or<00:03:28.430> or<00:03:28.820> in

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
events out in LA or in Berlin or or in

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.960 
events out in LA or in Berlin or or in
Australia<00:03:29.690> from<00:03:30.530> New<00:03:30.710> York<00:03:30.950> although<00:03:31.580> if<00:03:31.820> it's

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
Australia from New York although if it's

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.940 
Australia from New York although if it's
if<00:03:32.390> it's<00:03:32.510> interesting<00:03:32.780> enough<00:03:32.990> in<00:03:33.260> if<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.680> think

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
if it's interesting enough in if I think

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.760 
if it's interesting enough in if I think
it's<00:03:34.790> worth<00:03:35.090> seeing<00:03:35.540> if<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:36.140> was<00:03:36.470> in<00:03:36.620> those

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
it's worth seeing if I was in those

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.560 
it's worth seeing if I was in those
cities<00:03:36.950> then<00:03:37.490> i<00:03:37.670> would<00:03:37.700> probably<00:03:38.150> post<00:03:38.390> about

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
cities then i would probably post about

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.110 
cities then i would probably post about
it<00:03:38.690> I<00:03:39.340> actually<00:03:40.340> didn't<00:03:40.700> call<00:03:40.850> it<00:03:40.910> with<00:03:41.000> do

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
it I actually didn't call it with do

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.780 
it I actually didn't call it with do
betraying<00:03:41.450> my<00:03:41.690> grandpa<00:03:42.320> did<00:03:42.670> when<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.700> was

younger I used to hang out at my
grandpa's<00:03:46.160> store<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.930> just<00:03:47.930> being<00:03:48.170> younger

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
grandpa's store and just being younger

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.560 
grandpa's store and just being younger
and<00:03:48.620> kind<00:03:48.800> of<00:03:48.890> being<00:03:49.280> foolish<00:03:49.640> i<00:03:49.910> would<00:03:50.420> do

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
and kind of being foolish i would do

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.150 
and kind of being foolish i would do
like<00:03:51.050> a<00:03:51.080> stupid<00:03:51.410> thing<00:03:51.530> here<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:51.830> there<00:03:51.920> he

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
like a stupid thing here and there he

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
like a stupid thing here and there he
would<00:03:52.280> actually<00:03:52.430> call<00:03:52.760> me<00:03:53.620> stupid<00:03:54.620> but<00:03:55.550> with<00:03:56.150> a

very<00:03:56.240> heavy<00:03:56.660> Chinese<00:03:57.620> accent<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.090> actually

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
very heavy Chinese accent so it actually

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.140 
very heavy Chinese accent so it actually
sounded<00:03:59.600> like<00:03:59.720> doobie<00:04:00.050> brain<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:01.030> that's<00:04:02.030> how
