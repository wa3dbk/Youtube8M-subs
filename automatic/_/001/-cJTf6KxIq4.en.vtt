00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
can't go to the side so you use the web

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.969 
can't go to the side so you use the web
of<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:59.670> thumb<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:00.390> index<00:01:01.350> finger<00:01:01.409> and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
you're going to the side

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.310 
you're going to the side
that<00:01:05.059> could<00:01:05.180> be<00:01:05.239> hard<00:01:05.420> even<00:01:05.480> news<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.990> but

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
that could be hard even news to but

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.190 
that could be hard even news to but
you're<00:01:06.470> only<00:01:06.590> doing<00:01:06.770> one<00:01:07.580> stroke<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.240> way<00:01:08.390> so

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
you're only doing one stroke that way so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.650 
you're only doing one stroke that way so
you're<00:01:09.320> going<00:01:09.560> from<00:01:09.800> one<00:01:10.480> traditional<00:01:11.480> hit

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660

you're going from one traditional hit
over<00:01:12.230> to<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.710> rim<00:01:13.550> knock<00:01:13.840> traditional<00:01:14.840> hit<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.830> a

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
over to a rim knock traditional hit to a

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.210 
over to a rim knock traditional hit to a
rim<00:01:16.250> knock<00:01:16.960> now<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.140> transition<00:01:18.890> if<00:01:19.100> you're

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
rim knock now that transition if you're

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.500 
rim knock now that transition if you're
looking<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.490> overhead-cam<00:01:19.790> you<00:01:20.150> just<00:01:20.300> go<00:01:20.390> from

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
looking to overhead-cam you just go from

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.630 
looking to overhead-cam you just go from
here<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.110> move<00:01:21.650> your<00:01:21.830> stick<00:01:22.040> over<00:01:22.160> like<00:01:22.460> this

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
here you move your stick over like this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.010 
here you move your stick over like this
there's<00:01:23.210> really<00:01:23.390> nothing<00:01:24.320> fancy<00:01:25.040> about<00:01:25.070> it

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
there's really nothing fancy about it

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.750 
there's really nothing fancy about it
now<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.050> normal<00:01:27.320> rim<00:01:27.680> knock<00:01:27.920> you'd<00:01:28.490> want<00:01:28.700> to

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
now a normal rim knock you'd want to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.540 
now a normal rim knock you'd want to
find<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.150> sweet<00:01:29.900> spot<00:01:29.960> on<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:31.280> stick

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
find that sweet spot on the stick

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.430 
find that sweet spot on the stick
because<00:01:31.850> depending<00:01:32.060> on<00:01:32.270> where<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.450> hit<00:01:32.690> let's

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
because depending on where you hit let's

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:41.770 
because depending on where you hit let's
go<00:01:33.590> sound<00:01:33.860> different<00:01:34.220> but<00:01:40.509> since<00:01:41.509> we're<00:01:41.690> doing

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
go sound different but since we're doing

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.910 
go sound different but since we're doing
this<00:01:42.020> trick<00:01:43.030> you've<00:01:44.030> got<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.619> hit<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.680> out

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
this trick you've got to hit it out

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.710 
this trick you've got to hit it out
further<00:01:46.220> than<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.640> normally<00:01:46.759> would<00:01:47.030> because

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
further than you normally would because

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.260 
further than you normally would because
we're<00:01:47.990> gonna<00:01:48.080> be<00:01:48.259> hitting<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.680> stick<00:01:48.950> up<00:01:49.270> when

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
we're gonna be hitting the stick up when

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.300 
we're gonna be hitting the stick up when
it's<00:01:50.390> out<00:01:50.540> here<00:01:50.899> you're<00:01:51.410> gonna<00:01:51.500> hit<00:01:51.800> up<00:01:52.040> on<00:01:52.280> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
it's out here you're gonna hit up on the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.930 
it's out here you're gonna hit up on the
stick<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.470> this<00:01:54.470> hand<00:01:54.770> doesn't<00:01:55.310> just<00:01:55.550> let<00:01:55.729> go

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
stick and this hand doesn't just let go

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.790 
stick and this hand doesn't just let go
all<00:01:56.210> together<00:01:57.160> see<00:01:58.160> why<00:01:58.369> a<00:01:59.410> hand<00:02:00.410> kind<00:02:00.710> of

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
all together see why a hand kind of

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.010 
all together see why a hand kind of
keeps<00:02:01.009> this<00:02:01.190> stick<00:02:01.670> under<00:02:01.880> control<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:02.990> that

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
keeps this stick under control so that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.270 
keeps this stick under control so that
you<00:02:03.259> can<00:02:03.410> do<00:02:03.530> it<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:05.030> when<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.240> hit<00:02:05.600> I'm<00:02:05.869> actually

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
you can do it so when I hit I'm actually

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.669 
you can do it so when I hit I'm actually
guiding<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.550> little<00:02:08.030> bit<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.560> know

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
guiding it a little bit so that I know

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.160 
guiding it a little bit so that I know
where<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.040> gonna<00:02:10.100> go

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.470 

alright<00:02:15.170> now<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.380> catch<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.910> have<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.269> catch

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
alright now the catch you have to catch

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.930 
alright now the catch you have to catch
it<00:02:17.720> in<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.110> traditional<00:02:18.830> style<00:02:19.070> in<00:02:19.459> between

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
it in a traditional style in between

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.240 
it in a traditional style in between
your<00:02:20.090> middle<00:02:20.180> finger<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:20.630> your<00:02:20.780> ring<00:02:20.870> finger

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
your middle finger and your ring finger

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.560 
your middle finger and your ring finger
that's<00:02:22.250> probably<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.730> hardest<00:02:23.030> part<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.480> the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
that's probably the hardest part of the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.910 
that's probably the hardest part of the
trick<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.260> got<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.470> get<00:02:24.560> used<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.830> doing

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
trick so you got to get used to doing

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.880 
trick so you got to get used to doing
that<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.580> just<00:02:25.910> sit<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.510> do<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.780> over<00:02:27.230> and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
that I just sit and do this over and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.670 
that I just sit and do this over and
over<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:29.450> sounded<00:02:29.810> weird<00:02:30.459> weird<00:02:31.630> alright

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
over that sounded weird weird alright

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
over that sounded weird weird alright
another<00:02:33.680> way<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:33.920> can<00:02:34.040> practice<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.430> is

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
another way you can practice that is

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.170 
another way you can practice that is
just<00:02:35.000> in<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.780> open<00:02:36.410> air<00:02:36.820> you're<00:02:37.820> just<00:02:38.000> hitting

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
just in the open air you're just hitting

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.039 
just in the open air you're just hitting
it<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.810> catching<00:02:40.330> or<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.450> can<00:02:41.570> practice<00:02:41.870> just

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
it and catching or you can practice just

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.759 
it and catching or you can practice just
throwing<00:02:42.320> it<00:02:42.620> that's<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.459> little<00:02:43.610> harder<00:02:44.769> so

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
throwing it that's a little harder so

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.810 
throwing it that's a little harder so
once<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.040> get<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.700> beat<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.060> 1<00:02:47.420> 2<00:02:48.820> and

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
once you get that the beat is 1 2 and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.340 
once you get that the beat is 1 2 and
then<00:02:50.030> here's<00:02:50.239> where<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.510> got<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.810> rim<00:02:50.989> not<00:02:51.170> so

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
then here's where you got the rim not so

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.960 
then here's where you got the rim not so
let's<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:51.620> take<00:02:51.799> that<00:02:51.980> slowly<00:02:52.489> over<00:02:52.850> and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
let's just take that slowly over and

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.009 
let's just take that slowly over and
over<00:02:53.180> 1<00:02:53.510> &amp;<00:02:53.810> 2<00:02:55.239> traditional<00:02:56.239> hit<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:57.010> 3<00:02:58.010> and

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019

closed hi-hat up for practice that over

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:13.599 
closed hi-hat up for practice that over
