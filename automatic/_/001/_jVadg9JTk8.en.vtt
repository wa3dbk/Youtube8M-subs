00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
hi this is a simple primitive yet very

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.150 
hi this is a simple primitive yet very
interesting<00:00:04.020> math<00:00:04.230> puzzle<00:00:04.650> which<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:04.920> called

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
interesting math puzzle which I called

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.259 
interesting math puzzle which I called
the<00:00:05.400> cube<00:00:05.609> trick<00:00:06.230> how<00:00:07.230> would<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.470> solve<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:08.269> 3x3

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
the cube trick how would we solve a 3x3

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.970 
the cube trick how would we solve a 3x3
cube<00:00:09.510> if<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.019> are<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.200> fill<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.469> with<00:00:10.620> numbers

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
cube if you are to fill it with numbers

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.289 
cube if you are to fill it with numbers
starting<00:00:11.400> from<00:00:11.550> 1<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.360> 9<00:00:13.070> such<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:15.120> sum

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
starting from 1 to 9 such that the sum

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.170 
starting from 1 to 9 such that the sum
of<00:00:15.360> any<00:00:15.780> row<00:00:16.049> or<00:00:16.640> any<00:00:17.640> column<00:00:17.810> is<00:00:18.810> always<00:00:19.230> same

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
of any row or any column is always same

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.429 
of any row or any column is always same
you<00:00:21.180> could<00:00:21.300> just<00:00:21.510> pause<00:00:21.840> for<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.140> couple<00:00:22.380> of

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
you could just pause for a couple of

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.439 
you could just pause for a couple of
seconds<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.890> try<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.119> could<00:00:24.300> give

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
seconds and try it out and I could give

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.300 
seconds and try it out and I could give
you<00:00:24.539> my<00:00:24.660> solution<00:00:27.529> here's<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.650> solution<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
you my solution here's a solution to the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.190 
you my solution here's a solution to the
trick<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.960> basis<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.920> trick<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:33.140> what<00:00:34.140> I

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
trick the basis for this trick is what I

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.770 
trick the basis for this trick is what I
call<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.219> tone<00:00:35.610> rule<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.360> start

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
call the right tone rule so you start

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.979 
call the right tone rule so you start
with<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:44.040> top<00:00:44.070> row<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.329> middle<00:00:45.600> column

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
with the top row and the middle column

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
with the top row and the middle column
and<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:47.100> fill<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.460> with<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.760> first

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and you fill it out with the first

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.590 
and you fill it out with the first
number<00:00:48.649> now<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.710> go<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.090> use<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> right

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
number now you go then you use the right

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.799 
number now you go then you use the right
tone<00:00:51.899> rule<00:00:52.140> go<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:52.949> want<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.090> go<00:00:54.539> right

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
tone rule go up want you and go right

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.910 
tone rule go up want you and go right
and<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.070> find<00:00:56.430> any<00:00:56.670> cube<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.420> here

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
and if you do not find any cube up here

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.680 
and if you do not find any cube up here
then<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.250> drop<00:00:59.489> down<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.510> lowest

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
then you just drop down to the lowest

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.460 
then you just drop down to the lowest
cube<00:01:01.640> available<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.510> write<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.899> next<00:01:04.140> number

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
cube available and write the next number

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.490 
cube available and write the next number
so<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.309> follow<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> right-turn<00:01:06.360> rule<00:01:06.689> you

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
so you follow the right-turn rule you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.130 
so you follow the right-turn rule you
don't<00:01:07.680> find<00:01:07.950> any<00:01:08.220> cube<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.810> go

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
don't find any cube here so you just go

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.609 
don't find any cube here so you just go
all<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> way<00:01:10.729> down<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.060> put<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.420> 3<00:01:12.659> now

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
all the way down here and put in 3 now

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
all the way down here and put in 3 now
you<00:01:13.680> go<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.400> right<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.479> find<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> number<00:01:16.020> if

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you go up and right you find a number if

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.590 
you go up and right you find a number if
you<00:01:16.590> find<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.950> number<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> cube<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:18.420> put

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you find a number of the cube just put

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.679 
you find a number of the cube just put
the<00:01:18.720> number<00:01:18.990> below<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> original<00:01:19.890> number<00:01:20.689> now

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the number below the original number now

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.749 
the number below the original number now
I'll<00:01:21.780> give<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.049> go<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.770> take<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> right

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I'll give you go up and you take a right

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.749 
I'll give you go up and you take a right
you<00:01:24.750> find<00:01:25.020> no<00:01:25.200> number<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.430> fill

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
you find no number here so you just fill

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.410 
you find no number here so you just fill
it<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.330> more<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.290> go<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:29.040> 6<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:30.270> go

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it with a more you go up just 6 you go

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.179 
it with a more you go up just 6 you go
up<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.689> don't<00:01:31.049> find<00:01:31.259> anything<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.740> put<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
up you don't find anything just put a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.190 
up you don't find anything just put a
number<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.210> uh<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.840> don't<00:01:33.960> find

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
number here so uh you don't find

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.609 
number here so uh you don't find
anything<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.729> back<00:01:35.939> no<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:37.380> up

anything here just go back no you go up

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.880 
anything here just go back no you go up
you<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.250> right<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:39.329> find<00:01:39.509> anything<00:01:39.890> go

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
you go right you don't find anything go

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.499 
you go right you don't find anything go
down<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:41.540> if<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> sum<00:01:43.820> any<00:01:44.820> row<00:01:45.149> or

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
down here if you see the sum any row or

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.069 
down here if you see the sum any row or
any<00:01:46.500> column<00:01:49.040> it's<00:01:50.040> 15<00:01:50.689> it's<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.750> pretty<00:01:51.930> simple

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
any column it's 15 it's a pretty simple

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.520 
any column it's 15 it's a pretty simple
trick<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.700> not<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.030> 3x3<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.350> can

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
trick this is just not for 3x3 you can

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.719 
trick this is just not for 3x3 you can
also<00:01:55.649> apply<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.579> 5<00:01:57.270> cross<00:01:57.719> 5<00:01:57.750> or<00:01:58.649> even<00:01:58.729> a

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
also apply it for a 5 cross 5 or even a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.550 
also apply it for a 5 cross 5 or even a
7<00:02:00.000> cross<00:02:00.210> 7<00:02:00.479> cube

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
7 cross 7 cube

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.609 
7 cross 7 cube
it<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.729> takes<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.119> much<00:02:03.270> time<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.170> take

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it just takes as much time as you take

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.520 
it just takes as much time as you take
to<00:02:04.920> write<00:02:05.310> down<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> numbers<00:02:06.380> you're<00:02:07.380> gonna

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
to write down the numbers you're gonna

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:32.130 
to write down the numbers you're gonna
see<00:02:08.600> here<00:02:09.600> I<00:02:09.630> go

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.340 

there<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:32.920> go<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:34.030> all<00:02:34.210> 65<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.140> add
