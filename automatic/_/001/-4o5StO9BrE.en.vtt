the truck will lift it up above the bar
and<00:02:17.500> then<00:02:17.800> we'll<00:02:17.920> spin<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.430> way<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.450> we'll

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
and then we'll spin this way and we'll

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.509 
and then we'll spin this way and we'll
drop<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.050> cylinders<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.769> once<00:02:21.069> it's<00:02:21.280> in
