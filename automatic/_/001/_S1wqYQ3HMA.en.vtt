00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:14.909
 York says hello and welcome to a teeny-tiny struggles 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.169
 By showing you, you will have a desktop background 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.509
 will look like 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.689
 to be able to ask in general reason 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.209
 we have to open the project for that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.370
 All three gates led you must enter the resolution of Pröll's screen 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.710
 So in my case Werdershausen a hundred and twenty brewhouse and 80 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.480
 You can watch it if you stick with gorgeous 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.520
 on the desktop goes under display and you can look elsewhere 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.390
 and of course there are other ways, but that's the easiest 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.170
 and the first episode will take her father Black's background to it 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.270
 this party only modules 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.280
 because as 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.900
 Foreground color black out around we just saved 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.380
 abundant unspectacular 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.400
 then we go right-click on this division level 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.820
 Add layer mask 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 and white demanded strength 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.480
 so then would have behind this black picture as a corner as he box 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.870
 appear 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.260
 and the later still not properly round now we need a new level 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.900
 put 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.950
 the name is perfect, it just has to be the right size 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.330
 and 50 we have to under 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.500
 this level 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.250
 do in this division level and they will now fill with a gradient 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.730
 m so well rewarded beautiful skin here who for example Munich in the case but 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.640
 does not matter now 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 Now we choose the new layer 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.270
 next to the gradient color tool and child once across 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.530
 so that should now be a penalty 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.740
 if we make that look back and forth like that 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.560
 we can sure if you just take full 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.820
 and 14 who tired the first level foreign markets PETA layer mask 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.329
 next to the Daniel Wernitz stuff 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.339
 again people and color black that is important 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.339
 and pick a nice commuter 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.929
 um, if you ask why I have so many commuters from that is simply because 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.569
 that I have never legal administration Donauwörth 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.859
 Eva with dpa there 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.209
 be with it 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.779
 can do that too 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.409
 so that pulls more 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.749
 it looks like this now 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.859
 I have that back but with me now such a stunt beautiful black 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.019
 known 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.849
 that's why we just become the size 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.449
 is the supreme 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:50.629
 far 1 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.129
 a little too much 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.209
 Refer to Russia 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.209
 under there only have to fly 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.879
 and 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:01.869
 to confirm 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.929
 the more moves away from it as it now by quasi 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.729
 go out in the background at a story is over 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.250
 that's exactly the gradient and that was to big groups 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.639
 basically already over 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.390
 Of course you can not yet 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.390
 and floating lettering i beautify up the whole 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.379
 Of course I would do it 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.680
 then you have to save all that 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.399
 where important 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:38.129
 which now also saves years as Jack Black and not as a zoo keeper part 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.129
 otherwise you can not do anything with it 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.150
 around her main point of criticism 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.489
 make the participants 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.059
 you would not believe it 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.749
 and then there spokesmen where it is cloudy at landline the former 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.359
 confirm export 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.349
 and now he does not care and save 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.709
 then you can choose the whole thing and shake it 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:07.669
 On the whole about locally my sinking threatens but 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.029
 the wars already and Pröll the users 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:15.739
 Bayer might be another great too
