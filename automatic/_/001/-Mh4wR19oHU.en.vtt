an<00:02:16.280> earpiece<00:02:17.079> at<00:02:18.079> either<00:02:18.230> piece<00:02:18.500> with<00:02:18.739> a

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
an earpiece at either piece with a

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.190 
an earpiece at either piece with a
microphone<00:02:19.510> that's<00:02:20.510> close<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.840> your<00:02:21.079> mouth

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
microphone that's close to your mouth

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.429 
microphone that's close to your mouth
and<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.680> think<00:02:21.950> that's<00:02:22.159> very<00:02:22.519> important<00:02:23.150> you

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
and I think that's very important you

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.030 
and I think that's very important you
still<00:02:24.439> have<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.790> push<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.970> button<00:02:26.620> here<00:02:27.620> to

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
still have to push the button here to

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
still have to push the button here to
talk<00:02:28.280> but<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.450> microphone<00:02:30.049> is<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.230> lot<00:02:30.409> closer

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
talk but that microphone is a lot closer

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.020 
talk but that microphone is a lot closer
to<00:02:30.950> your<00:02:31.069> mouth<00:02:31.189> so<00:02:31.489> you<00:02:31.519> can<00:02:31.819> actually

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
to your mouth so you can actually

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.319 
to your mouth so you can actually
whisper<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.959> that's<00:02:33.560> important<00:02:34.329> because

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
whisper and that's important because

January<00:03:30.260> during<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.620> rut<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:31.849> Bucks<00:03:32.090> are

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
January during the rut the Bucks are

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.789 
January during the rut the Bucks are
pushing<00:03:32.540> those<00:03:32.750> zones<00:03:32.989> around<00:03:33.199> all<00:03:33.500> over<00:03:33.620> the

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
pushing those zones around all over the

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.469 
pushing those zones around all over the
place<00:03:33.829> so<00:03:34.069> they<00:03:34.190> may<00:03:34.370> not<00:03:34.549> be<00:03:34.819> where<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.120> saw

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.659 
place so they may not be where you saw
them<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:36.290> it's<00:03:36.530> real<00:03:36.680> important<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.069> close<00:03:37.639> a

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.820 
a population of deer here in Arizona a
very<00:04:35.080> very<00:04:35.800> small<00:04:36.840> however<00:04:37.840> we<00:04:38.080> do<00:04:38.290> have<00:04:38.320> very

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
very very small however we do have very

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.420 
very very small however we do have very
very<00:04:39.310> good<00:04:39.460> deer<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:41.680> we<00:04:41.740> have<00:04:41.860> we<00:04:42.040> grow<00:04:42.220> some

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
very good deer and we have we grow some

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.150 
very good deer and we have we grow some
monster<00:04:43.120> mule<00:04:43.300> is<00:04:43.450> here<00:04:43.630> but<00:04:44.410> their

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
monster mule is here but their

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.820 
monster mule is here but their
population<00:04:45.700> is<00:04:45.940> really<00:04:46.150> small<00:04:46.390> so<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:47.680> don't

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
population is really small so you don't

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.920 
population is really small so you don't
get<00:04:48.160> quite<00:04:48.400> as<00:04:48.580> many<00:04:48.730> stalks<00:04:49.120> as<00:04:49.360> you<00:04:49.510> would<00:04:49.750> in

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
get quite as many stalks as you would in

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.180 
get quite as many stalks as you would in
like<00:04:50.370> Wyoming<00:04:51.370> or<00:04:51.880> South<00:04:52.090> Dakota<00:04:52.320> or<00:04:53.320> Colorado

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
like Wyoming or South Dakota or Colorado

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.130 
like Wyoming or South Dakota or Colorado
with<00:04:54.700> what<00:04:55.000> deer<00:04:55.300> populations<00:04:55.870> are<00:04:55.990> much

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
with what deer populations are much

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.660 
with what deer populations are much
larger<00:04:57.720> so<00:04:58.720> you<00:04:58.780> can<00:04:59.050> you<00:04:59.590> know<00:04:59.650> have<00:04:59.950> your

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
larger so you can you know have your

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.710 
larger so you can you know have your
successes<00:05:01.300> more<00:05:02.110> based<00:05:02.380> on<00:05:03.240> how<00:05:04.240> many<00:05:04.300> stocks

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
successes more based on how many stocks

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.020 
successes more based on how many stocks
you<00:05:04.930> do<00:05:05.080> as<00:05:05.230> opposed<00:05:05.590> to<00:05:05.680> how<00:05:06.340> quality<00:05:06.850> the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
you do as opposed to how quality the

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.780 
you do as opposed to how quality the
stocks<00:05:07.300> are<00:05:07.480> so<00:05:08.140> this<00:05:08.770> is<00:05:08.950> a<00:05:08.980> really<00:05:09.400> good<00:05:09.580> tool

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
stocks are so this is a really good tool

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.240 
stocks are so this is a really good tool
use<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:10.900> in<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.080> field

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
use it in the field

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.730 
use it in the field
check<00:05:12.790> with<00:05:12.940> your<00:05:13.000> local<00:05:13.540> laws<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.260> stuff

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
check with your local laws and stuff

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.710 
check with your local laws and stuff
because<00:05:15.040> there<00:05:15.190> are<00:05:15.340> some<00:05:15.640> states<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.570> don't

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
because there are some states that don't

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.130 
because there are some states that don't
allow<00:05:17.050> that<00:05:18.300> but<00:05:19.300> here<00:05:19.480> in<00:05:19.570> Arizona<00:05:19.990> it's

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
allow that but here in Arizona it's

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.860 
allow that but here in Arizona it's
allowed<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.710> we<00:05:21.190> use<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:21.430> it's<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.390> great<00:05:22.630> tool

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
allowed and we use it it's a great tool

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.460 
allowed and we use it it's a great tool
we'll<00:05:23.830> see<00:05:23.980> on<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.280> field
