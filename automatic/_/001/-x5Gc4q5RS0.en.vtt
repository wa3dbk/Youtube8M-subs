because<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.950> using<00:01:53.130> filters<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
because I don't like using filters and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.310 
because I don't like using filters and
it's<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.390> little<00:01:54.539> bit<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.869> extra

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it's just a little bit of extra

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.349 
it's just a little bit of extra
protection<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.369> case<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.759> were<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.909> bang<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
protection in case you were to bang it

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:58.969 
protection in case you were to bang it
up<00:01:57.450> against<00:01:57.810> something<00:01:58.109> or<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> tree<00:01:58.740> branch

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
up against something or a tree branch

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.639 
up against something or a tree branch
it's<00:01:59.700> probably<00:02:00.299> not<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:00.960> inside<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
it's probably not going to get inside to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.219 
it's probably not going to get inside to
the<00:02:01.770> glass<00:02:02.039> now<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:02.999> lens<00:02:03.450> cap<00:02:03.749> is<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
the glass now the lens cap is going to

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.190 
the glass now the lens cap is going to
be<00:02:04.380> Sigma<00:02:04.619> signature<00:02:05.340> pinch<00:02:05.729> caps<00:02:06.689> which<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
be Sigma signature pinch caps which I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.869 
be Sigma signature pinch caps which I
love<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.649> now<00:02:07.770> Canon<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.550> be<00:02:08.670> doing

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
love and now Canon is going to be doing

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.669 
love and now Canon is going to be doing
them<00:02:09.119> which<00:02:09.269> I'm<00:02:09.420> happy<00:02:09.569> about<00:02:09.840> because<00:02:10.470> for

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
them which I'm happy about because for

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.860 
them which I'm happy about because for
years<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.340> was<00:02:11.459> almost<00:02:11.730> impossible<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.569> get<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
years it was almost impossible to get a

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.700 
years it was almost impossible to get a
canon<00:02:13.290> lens

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
canon lens

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.910 
canon lens
off<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.250> lens<00:02:14.430> with<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.300> lens<00:02:15.510> hood<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:16.020> but

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
off the lens with the lens hood on but

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.500 
off the lens with the lens hood on but
this<00:02:17.160> one<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> little<00:02:17.790> bit<00:02:18.060> different<00:02:18.420> from

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
this one is a little bit different from

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.360 
this one is a little bit different from
the<00:02:18.600> other<00:02:18.840> Sigma's<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.470> I've<00:02:19.620> owned<00:02:19.830> this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
the other Sigma's that I've owned this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
the other Sigma's that I've owned this
one<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> little<00:02:21.000> bit<00:02:21.270> thicker<00:02:21.600> it's<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
one is a little bit thicker it's a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.650 
one is a little bit thicker it's a
little<00:02:22.560> bit<00:02:22.710> better<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.430> feels<00:02:23.760> beefier<00:02:24.510> and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
little bit better it feels beefier and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.780 
little bit better it feels beefier and
it's<00:02:24.960> much<00:02:25.260> easier<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.800> put<00:02:26.130> on<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.520> lens

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
it's much easier to put on the lens

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.640 
it's much easier to put on the lens
without<00:02:27.120> feeling<00:02:27.750> like<00:02:27.780> you're<00:02:28.110> just<00:02:28.350> kind<00:02:28.440> of

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
without feeling like you're just kind of

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.080 
without feeling like you're just kind of
wiggling<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.160> on<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.760> might<00:02:29.910> be

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
wiggling it on there and you might be

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.390 
wiggling it on there and you might be
hitting<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.480> glass<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:31.070> can't<00:02:32.070> say<00:02:32.250> enough

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
hitting the glass I can't say enough

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.640 
hitting the glass I can't say enough
about<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.880> construction<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:34.020> lens<00:02:34.380> it

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
about the construction of this lens it

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.220 
about the construction of this lens it
is<00:02:35.060> unbelievable<00:02:36.060> unmatched<00:02:36.630> by<00:02:36.930> almost

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
is unbelievable unmatched by almost

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
this lens now obviously what matters

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.260 
this lens now obviously what matters
most<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.160> what<00:03:05.190> happens<00:03:05.670> when<00:03:05.790> we<00:03:05.910> put<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.180> on

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
most is what happens when we put it on

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.620 
most is what happens when we put it on
the<00:03:06.360> camera<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.410> far<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.830> pictures<00:03:08.160> has<00:03:08.370> been

the camera so far the pictures has been

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.620 
the camera so far the pictures has been

unbelievably sharp even at f-14 that's

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.210 
unbelievably sharp even at f-14 that's
what's<00:03:12.840> gonna<00:03:12.990> matter<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.740> is<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.100> be

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
what's gonna matter this is going to be

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.640 
what's gonna matter this is going to be
a<00:03:14.250> great<00:03:14.640> inside<00:03:15.270> lens<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:16.020> little<00:03:16.200> bit<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.530> a

areas those are going to be some of the

areas those are going to be some of the
advantages<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.080> now<00:03:22.650> Canon<00:03:23.070> just<00:03:23.340> put

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
advantages to this now Canon just put

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.320 
advantages to this now Canon just put
out<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> 35<00:03:24.420> millimeter<00:03:24.960> f2<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:26.280> that's<00:03:27.060> their

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
replacement it's about the same price as

f-14 instead of f/2 you lose the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.460 
f-14 instead of f/2 you lose the
stabilization<00:03:35.340> but<00:03:35.880> you're<00:03:36.060> gonna<00:03:36.210> gain<00:03:36.600> one

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
stabilization but you're gonna gain one

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.770 
stabilization but you're gonna gain one
heck<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:38.040> lens<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.490> build<00:03:38.700> quality<00:03:38.970> now<00:03:39.630> let

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
heck of a lens and build quality now let

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.270 
heck of a lens and build quality now let
me<00:03:39.900> show<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.380> size<00:03:40.650> difference<00:03:41.190> between

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
me show you the size difference between

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.570 
me show you the size difference between
these<00:03:41.730> two<00:03:42.030> it's<00:03:42.540> absolutely<00:03:43.410> massive<00:03:43.740> these

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
these two it's absolutely massive these

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.090 
these two it's absolutely massive these
are<00:03:44.850> just<00:03:45.270> no<00:03:45.570> comparison<00:03:46.020> between<00:03:46.470> these<00:03:46.860> two

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
are just no comparison between these two

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.170 
are just no comparison between these two

this<00:03:52.050> is<00:03:52.200> definitely<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.860> heavy<00:03:53.360> well-built

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
this is definitely a heavy well-built

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.080 
this is definitely a heavy well-built
piece<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.500> glass<00:03:55.740> on<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.220> one<00:03:56.460> where

piece of glass on this one where

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.400 
piece of glass on this one where
something<00:03:57.480> like<00:03:57.600> this<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:58.020> going<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.380> a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
something like this is going to be a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.990 
something like this is going to be a
little<00:03:58.650> bit<00:03:58.860> lighter<00:03:59.100> this<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.520> their<00:03:59.640> 50

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000

millimeter<00:04:00.450> 1/4<00:04:01.020> by<00:04:01.290> canon<00:04:01.770> and<00:04:01.890> it's<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.820> great

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
millimeter 1/4 by canon and it's a great

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.260 
millimeter 1/4 by canon and it's a great
lens<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.780> get<00:04:03.990> 1/4<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.830> 50<00:04:05.220> millimeter<00:04:05.430> it's

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
lens you get 1/4 on a 50 millimeter it's

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.540 
lens you get 1/4 on a 50 millimeter it's
a<00:04:06.510> very<00:04:06.840> inexpensive<00:04:07.200> lens<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.370> get

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
a very inexpensive lens and you get

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.280 
a very inexpensive lens and you get
great<00:04:08.760> quality<00:04:08.940> but<00:04:09.240> it's<00:04:09.660> not<00:04:10.020> going<00:04:10.230> to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
great quality but it's not going to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.770 
great quality but it's not going to
compete<00:04:10.740> as<00:04:10.950> far<00:04:11.790> as<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.090> build<00:04:12.300> quality<00:04:12.510> of

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
compete as far as the build quality of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.140 
compete as far as the build quality of
something<00:04:13.080> like<00:04:13.350> that<00:04:13.640> now<00:04:14.640> once<00:04:14.850> again<00:04:15.000> I

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
something like that now once again I

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.120 
something like that now once again I
said<00:04:15.450> we're<00:04:15.930> gonna<00:04:16.020> compare<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.770> canons

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
said we're gonna compare this to canons

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.190 
said we're gonna compare this to canons
L<00:04:17.280> lines<00:04:17.609> because<00:04:18.480> even<00:04:18.840> though<00:04:19.020> it's

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
L lines because even though it's

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.900 
L lines because even though it's
actually<00:04:19.410> splitting<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.400> difference<00:04:20.520> in

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
actually splitting the difference in

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.670 
actually splitting the difference in
price<00:04:21.239> between<00:04:21.270> something<00:04:22.169> like<00:04:22.320> this<00:04:22.470> in

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
price between something like this in

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.010 
price between something like this in
canons<00:04:23.070> L<00:04:23.190> lens<00:04:23.460> it's<00:04:24.030> going<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.360> be<00:04:24.480> much<00:04:24.750> more

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
canons L lens it's going to be much more

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.530

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
comparative to canons L lenses so

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.360 
comparative to canons L lenses so
gonna<00:04:27.690> get<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:27.900> full<00:04:28.200> in-depth<00:04:28.650> comparison<00:04:28.860> on

gonna get a full in-depth comparison on

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.740 
gonna get a full in-depth comparison on
that<00:04:29.550> but<00:04:29.670> I<00:04:29.730> wanted<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.060> give<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.330> guys<00:04:30.360> my

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
it on the camera for a couple days it's

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.430 
it on the camera for a couple days it's
been<00:04:35.250> great<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.820> comes<00:04:36.450> in<00:04:36.630> this<00:04:36.720> pouch<00:04:37.020> which

been great it comes in this pouch which
is<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.860> little<00:04:38.820> bit<00:04:39.000> better<00:04:39.480> than<00:04:39.810> canons<00:04:40.650> in

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
is a little bit better than canons in

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.560 
is a little bit better than canons in
one<00:04:41.100> sense<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.760> is<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.060> provides<00:04:42.150> a

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
one sense and that is it provides a

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.720 
one sense and that is it provides a
little<00:04:42.840> bit<00:04:42.960> more<00:04:43.170> cushion<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.770> padding<00:04:44.190> can

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
little bit more cushion and padding can

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.820 
little bit more cushion and padding can
is<00:04:44.910> typically<00:04:45.300> put<00:04:46.140> them<00:04:46.290> in<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.470> kind<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.740> a

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
is typically put them in a kind of a

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.100 
is typically put them in a kind of a
sleeve<00:04:47.280> pouch<00:04:47.880> that's<00:04:48.150> it's<00:04:48.510> very<00:04:48.630> nice
