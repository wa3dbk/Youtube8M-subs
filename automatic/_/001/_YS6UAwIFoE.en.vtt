00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
was very good at competing with the Xbox

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.230 
was very good at competing with the Xbox
in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> way<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.610> blu-ray<00:01:09.060> was

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
in the way of it you know blu-ray was

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.539 
in the way of it you know blu-ray was
and<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.479> was<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> very<00:01:10.049> good<00:01:10.470> addition<00:01:11.430> I

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and it was a very good addition I

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.090 
and it was a very good addition I
thought<00:01:11.820> obviously<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.810> whole<00:01:13.020> media<00:01:13.380> works

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
thought obviously the whole media works

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.219 
thought obviously the whole media works
really<00:01:14.310> well<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.790> always<00:01:15.119> watch<00:01:15.720> your<00:01:15.869> movies

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and stuff like that on it's just a good

did find out that is pretty powerful and
that's<00:02:29.370> much<00:02:29.610> more<00:02:29.790> powerful<00:02:30.060> than<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.390> what

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
are they going to change gaming because

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.100 
are they going to change gaming because
right<00:02:49.650> now<00:02:49.680> console<00:02:50.280> gaming<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.810> it's<00:02:51.810> really

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
right now console gaming is it's really

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.170 
right now console gaming is it's really
not<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.560> its<00:02:52.860> best<00:02:53.160> because<00:02:53.520> obviously<00:02:53.700> right

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
not in its best because obviously right

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.270 
not in its best because obviously right
now<00:02:54.240> it's<00:02:54.690> really<00:02:54.900> hit<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.140> max<00:02:55.830> point<00:02:56.160> in

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
now it's really hit a max point in

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.010 
now it's really hit a max point in
physics<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.760> graphics<00:02:57.210> I<00:02:57.330> mean<00:02:57.810> basically

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
physics and graphics I mean basically

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.540 
physics and graphics I mean basically
I'm<00:02:58.470> sure<00:02:58.620> they<00:02:58.710> can<00:02:58.860> do<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.040> slightly<00:02:59.340> better

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
I'm sure they can do is slightly better

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.920 
I'm sure they can do is slightly better
but<00:02:59.700> really<00:03:00.210> at<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.420> moment<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.840> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
but really at the moment this is the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.920 
but really at the moment this is the
best<00:03:01.110> we'll<00:03:01.290> see<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.620> while<00:03:01.830> but<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.970> 2013's

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
best we'll see in a while but in 2013's

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.660 
best we'll see in a while but in 2013's
maybe<00:03:04.200> 2014<00:03:04.830> not<00:03:05.130> sure<00:03:05.280> when<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.490> going<00:03:05.610> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
maybe 2014 not sure when it's going to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.490 
maybe 2014 not sure when it's going to
be<00:03:05.730> released<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.240> reckon<00:03:06.840> gaming<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.290> going<00:03:07.440> to

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
be released I reckon gaming is going to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.200 
be released I reckon gaming is going to
go<00:03:07.650> much<00:03:08.100> much<00:03:08.370> bigger<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:08.910> going<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> go

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
go much much bigger it's going to go

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.300 
go much much bigger it's going to go
huge<00:03:09.630> because<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.110> mean<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.860> one<00:03:11.010> thing<00:03:11.160> is

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
huge because I mean the one thing is

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.260 
huge because I mean the one thing is
it's<00:03:11.490> going<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.640> cost<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.970> lot<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.150> money

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
it's going to cost a lot of money

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.240 
it's going to cost a lot of money
probably<00:03:12.690> about<00:03:12.930> seven<00:03:13.350> hundred<00:03:13.380> maybe<00:03:13.980> a

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
probably about seven hundred maybe a

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.860 
probably about seven hundred maybe a
thousand<00:03:14.880> dollars<00:03:15.150> or<00:03:15.270> so<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:15.600> for<00:03:15.780> this

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
thousand dollars or so just for this

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.380 
thousand dollars or so just for this
hour<00:03:16.080> ps4<00:03:16.860> but<00:03:17.040> nonetheless<00:03:17.190> game<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.180> going

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
hour ps4 but nonetheless game is going

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.730 
hour ps4 but nonetheless game is going
to<00:03:18.480> become<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.720> whole<00:03:19.050> lot<00:03:19.290> better<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.590> know<00:03:19.710> a

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
to become a whole lot better you know a

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.010 
to become a whole lot better you know a
whole<00:03:19.920> new<00:03:20.400> platform<00:03:20.910> developers<00:03:21.810> going<00:03:21.960> to

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
whole new platform developers going to

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.480 
whole new platform developers going to
be<00:03:22.080> making<00:03:22.230> much<00:03:22.620> better<00:03:22.890> games<00:03:23.100> as<00:03:23.310> much

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
be making much better games as much

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.040 
be making much better games as much
better<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.940> know<00:03:24.060> physics<00:03:24.570> all<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.840> kind<00:03:24.990> of

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
better you know physics all that kind of

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.720 
better you know physics all that kind of
stuff<00:03:25.110> it's<00:03:25.830> just<00:03:26.010> going<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.160> be<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.340> really

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
stuff it's just going to be a really

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.550 
stuff it's just going to be a really
interesting<00:03:27.150> period<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.990> see<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.260> know<00:03:28.380> how

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
interesting period to see you know how

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.740 
interesting period to see you know how
well<00:03:28.890> games<00:03:29.220> are<00:03:29.400> going<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.580> how<00:03:30.120> games<00:03:30.450> just

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
well games are going to how games just

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.300 
well games are going to how games just
going<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.930> go<00:03:31.200> much<00:03:31.500> better<00:03:31.770> because<00:03:32.130> right

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
going to go much better because right

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.460 
going to go much better because right
now<00:03:32.340> obviously<00:03:32.910> everyone<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.960> a<00:03:33.990> little<00:03:34.110> bit

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
now obviously everyone is a little bit

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.050 
now obviously everyone is a little bit
sick<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.890> know<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.160> new<00:03:35.310> cod<00:03:35.580> it's<00:03:35.820> always

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
sick of you know the new cod it's always

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.790 
sick of you know the new cod it's always
the<00:03:36.180> same<00:03:36.210> you<00:03:36.660> know<00:03:36.750> console<00:03:37.290> thing<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.710> then

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
the same you know console thing and then

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.710 
the same you know console thing and then
there's<00:03:37.980> obviously<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.790> new<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.600> the

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
there's obviously the new this and the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.020 
there's obviously the new this and the
new<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.410> right<00:03:41.220> now<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.430> think<00:03:41.640> we're<00:03:41.880> all

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
new that and right now I think we're all

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.430 
new that and right now I think we're all
just<00:03:42.240> waiting<00:03:42.390> for<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> new<00:03:42.720> console<00:03:43.200> it's<00:03:43.320> just

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
just waiting for a new console it's just

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.780 
just waiting for a new console it's just
going<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.590> brighten<00:03:44.040> up<00:03:44.100> everything<00:03:44.580> in<00:03:44.670> terms

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
going to brighten up everything in terms

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.580 
going to brighten up everything in terms
of<00:03:44.940> gaming<00:03:45.360> now<00:03:45.840> i'm<00:03:45.990> not<00:03:46.110> talking<00:03:46.290> about<00:03:46.320> pc

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
of gaming now i'm not talking about pc

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.870 
of gaming now i'm not talking about pc
game<00:03:46.860> because<00:03:47.190> that's<00:03:47.340> completely<00:03:47.760> different

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
game because that's completely different

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.480 
game because that's completely different
right<00:03:48.300> now<00:03:48.330> pc<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.140> basically<00:03:49.860> Incan<00:03:50.250> charge

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
right now pc is basically Incan charge

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.190 
right now pc is basically Incan charge
of<00:03:50.640> its<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.910> control<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.420> itself<00:03:51.690> because<00:03:52.050> as

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
of its in control of itself because as

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.860 
of its in control of itself because as
long<00:03:52.680> as<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:52.980> know<00:03:53.330> they<00:03:54.330> keep<00:03:54.510> making<00:03:54.720> new

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
long as you know they keep making new

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.500 
long as you know they keep making new
graphics<00:03:55.290> cards<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.770> updating<00:03:56.130> their

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
graphics cards and updating their

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.510 
graphics cards and updating their
machines<00:03:57.510> then<00:03:58.110> games<00:03:58.380> will<00:03:58.620> keep<00:03:58.890> being<00:03:59.190> you

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
machines then games will keep being you

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.250 
machines then games will keep being you
know<00:03:59.610> good<00:03:59.880> on<00:04:00.060> PC<00:04:00.450> this<00:04:00.660> is<00:04:00.780> more<00:04:00.960> just<00:04:01.080> about

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
know good on PC this is more just about

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.050 
know good on PC this is more just about
console<00:04:01.770> so<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.190> want<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.730> know<00:04:02.790> what<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.000> guys

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.840 
ps4 is going to change gaming and how
much<00:04:10.440> it's<00:04:10.650> going<00:04:10.740> to<00:04:10.860> have<00:04:11.250> an<00:04:11.340> impact<00:04:11.459> on

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
much it's going to have an impact on

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.790 
much it's going to have an impact on
gaming<00:04:12.360> it's<00:04:12.510> really<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.020> think<00:04:13.230> it's<00:04:13.560> really

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
gaming it's really I think it's really

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.320 
gaming it's really I think it's really
going<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.010> change<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.430> way<00:04:14.520> games<00:04:14.820> play<00:04:15.150> out

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
going to change the way games play out

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330 
going to change the way games play out
so<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.530> interesting<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:16.920> know<00:04:17.070> just<00:04:17.310> how

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
so it is interesting to know just how

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.770 
so it is interesting to know just how
much<00:04:17.580> it's<00:04:17.730> going<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.880> cost<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.420> was<00:04:18.570> doing

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
much it's going to cost and I was doing

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.539 
much it's going to cost and I was doing
rid<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:18.989> research<00:04:19.350> they<00:04:19.859> are<00:04:19.980> estimating

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
rid of research they are estimating

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.360 
rid of research they are estimating
seeing<00:04:20.790> as<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.970> ps3<00:04:21.510> was<00:04:21.690> about<00:04:21.870> 600<00:04:22.590> or<00:04:22.710> 700

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
seeing as the ps3 was about 600 or 700

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.210 
seeing as the ps3 was about 600 or 700
or<00:04:23.669> so<00:04:23.850> they<00:04:24.660> are<00:04:24.780> estimating<00:04:25.350> about<00:04:25.410> 800<00:04:26.040> just

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
or so they are estimating about 800 just

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.170 
or so they are estimating about 800 just
because<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:26.580> going<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.790> have

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
because it's going to have

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.180 
because it's going to have
see<00:04:27.300> with<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:27.720> new<00:04:27.900> economy<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.979> all<00:04:29.039> that

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
see with the new economy and all that

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.439 
see with the new economy and all that
stuff<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.580> probably<00:04:29.789> going<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:29.970> change<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.330> bit

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
stuff is probably going to change a bit

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.820 
stuff is probably going to change a bit
and<00:04:30.600> it's<00:04:30.990> obvious<00:04:31.169> going<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.380> have<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.500> much

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
and it's obvious going to have a much

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.430 
and it's obvious going to have a much
much<00:04:32.340> more<00:04:32.669> powerful<00:04:32.970> engine<00:04:33.449> and<00:04:33.630> all<00:04:34.289> that

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
much more powerful engine and all that

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.770 
much more powerful engine and all that
kind<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.680> stuff<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:35.220> ya<00:04:36.090> do<00:04:36.300> last<00:04:36.330> things<00:04:36.630> are

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
kind of stuff so ya do last things are

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.150 
kind of stuff so ya do last things are
