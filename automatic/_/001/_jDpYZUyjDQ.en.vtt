it's really annoying and using an
adhesive<00:05:59.720> pretty<00:06:00.720> much<00:06:01.100> stops<00:06:02.100> that<00:06:02.430> because

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
adhesive pretty much stops that because

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.980 
adhesive pretty much stops that because
it<00:06:02.940> holds<00:06:03.180> your<00:06:03.270> dentures<00:06:03.600> in<00:06:03.750> place

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.670 
and the food doesn't get caught
underneath<00:06:06.090> it<00:06:06.420> you<00:06:07.230> know<00:06:07.290> it<00:06:07.380> still<00:06:07.560> might

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
for you um it might be a little

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.189 
for you um it might be a little
difficult<00:06:49.759> I<00:06:50.060> guess<00:06:50.210> I<00:06:50.300> could<00:06:50.449> use<00:06:50.569> my<00:06:50.720> phone<00:06:50.990> I

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
difficult I guess I could use my phone I

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.680 
difficult I guess I could use my phone I
basically<00:06:51.889> use<00:06:52.190> my<00:06:52.400> web<00:06:53.030> camera<00:06:53.360> on<00:06:53.569> my

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
basically use my web camera on my

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.800 
basically use my web camera on my
computer<00:06:54.229> for<00:06:54.710> my<00:06:54.889> videos<00:06:55.250> or<00:06:55.580> my<00:06:55.789> iPhone<00:06:56.270> for

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
computer for my videos or my iPhone for

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.659 
computer for my videos or my iPhone for
my<00:06:56.900> videos<00:06:57.229> so<00:06:57.919> it<00:06:58.039> might<00:06:58.130> be<00:06:58.190> a<00:06:58.280> little<00:06:58.430> bit

00:06:58.659 --> 00:06:58.669 
my videos so it might be a little bit

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.270 
my videos so it might be a little bit
hard<00:06:58.910> to<00:06:58.970> film<00:06:59.419> those<00:07:00.289> I<00:07:00.560> could<00:07:00.770> use<00:07:00.919> my<00:07:01.069> camera

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
hard to film those I could use my camera

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.730 
hard to film those I could use my camera
I<00:07:01.520> guess<00:07:01.610> but<00:07:01.970> I'm<00:07:02.090> just<00:07:02.270> not<00:07:02.449> um<00:07:02.840> I<00:07:03.289> don't

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
I guess but I'm just not um I don't

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.990 
I guess but I'm just not um I don't
usually<00:07:03.919> do<00:07:04.250> that<00:07:04.400> so<00:07:04.759> anyway<00:07:05.720> um<00:07:06.580> yeah<00:07:07.580> I<00:07:07.880> just

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
usually do that so anyway um yeah I just
