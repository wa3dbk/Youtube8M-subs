00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
pumping out 142 horsepower now you can

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.930 
pumping out 142 horsepower now you can
wind<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.860> up<00:01:30.010> further<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.610> get<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.650> 160<00:01:32.650> but<00:01:33.460> it

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
wind it up further to get to 160 but it

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.620 
wind it up further to get to 160 but it
does<00:01:34.300> check<00:01:35.050> out<00:01:35.230> some<00:01:35.440> black<00:01:35.650> smoke<00:01:35.830> not<00:01:36.280> good

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
does check out some black smoke not good

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.260 
does check out some black smoke not good
and<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:39.400> course<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:39.760> doesn't<00:01:39.940> mean<00:01:40.120> it's

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
and of course that doesn't mean it's

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.020 
and of course that doesn't mean it's
running<00:01:40.570> too<00:01:40.750> hot<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:41.170> I<00:01:41.200> wouldn't<00:01:41.560> recommend

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
running too hot so I wouldn't recommend

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.430 
running too hot so I wouldn't recommend
running<00:01:43.030> them<00:01:43.120> up<00:01:43.240> all<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.540> way<00:01:43.690> far<00:01:44.230> better

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
running them up all the way far better

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.780 
running them up all the way far better
to<00:01:44.500> go<00:01:44.770> for<00:01:44.800> middle<00:01:45.190> of<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.340> road<00:01:45.520> where<00:01:45.760> you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
to go for middle of the road where you

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.770 
to go for middle of the road where you
know<00:01:46.030> it's<00:01:46.210> going<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.480> do<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.600> good<00:01:46.780> job<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:48.780> most

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
know it's going to do a good job so most

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.830 
know it's going to do a good job so most
importantly<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:51.430> well<00:01:51.670> as<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.270> performance

importantly as well as the performance

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.300 
importantly as well as the performance
is<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.740> fact<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.400> it<00:01:55.390> now<00:01:55.750> gets<00:01:56.310> everywhere

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
is the fact that it now gets everywhere
