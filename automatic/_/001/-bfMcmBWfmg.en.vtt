this in my case a ninety nine thousand
bells<00:01:16.979> because<00:01:17.220> I've<00:01:17.310> done<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.460> glitch

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
bells because I've done this glitch

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.289 
bells because I've done this glitch
before<00:01:18.740> but<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.670> you've<00:01:20.939> got<00:01:21.060> thick

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
before but and if you've got thick

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
before but and if you've got thick
sizing<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> works<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.650> know<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:22.950> long<00:01:23.280> as

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
sizing that works you know as long as

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.890 
sizing that works you know as long as
it's<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> thousands<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.450> could<00:01:24.600> even<00:01:24.720> be

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's in the thousands so could even be

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.780 
it's in the thousands so could even be
one<00:01:25.110> thousand<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> would<00:01:25.979> still<00:01:26.189> work<00:01:26.220> so

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
one thousand and it would still work so

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.460 
one thousand and it would still work so
then<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.180> two<00:01:27.360> thousand<00:01:27.840> four<00:01:28.140> thousand

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
then you get two thousand four thousand

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.850 
then you get two thousand four thousand
etc<00:01:28.890> etc<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:30.200> I'm<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> start<00:01:31.619> by<00:01:31.710> putting

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
etc etc so I'm going to start by putting

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.249 
etc etc so I'm going to start by putting
the<00:01:31.979> 100<00:01:32.430> back<00:01:32.520> we're<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.119> eat<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.990> now

like<00:01:36.590> just<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:39.770> then<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
like just like that then this is the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.240 
like just like that then this is the
tricky<00:01:42.450> part<00:01:42.479> I'm<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> take<00:01:43.860> my<00:01:44.070> one

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250

the floor and then as soon as I drop it
on<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> floor<00:01:48.869> I'm<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> put<00:01:49.439> my

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
cardboard box on top of it this needs to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.990 
cardboard box on top of it this needs to
be<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.130> really<00:01:53.310> quick<00:01:53.549> otherwise<00:01:53.759> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
be really really quick otherwise it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.789 
be really really quick otherwise it
won't<00:01:54.149> work<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.689> your<00:01:54.780> 100<00:01:55.380> Bell<00:01:55.500> will<00:01:55.680> just

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
won't work and your 100 Bell will just

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.999 
won't work and your 100 Bell will just
go<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> side<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.520> cardboard<00:01:56.820> box<00:01:57.210> so

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
go to the side of your cardboard box so

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.020 
go to the side of your cardboard box so
I'll<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.369> quickly<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.850> I'll<00:01:59.969> show

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
I'll do it really quickly and I'll show

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.429 
I'll do it really quickly and I'll show
you<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.329> looks<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.659> top<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.229> then

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
you what it looks like on top and then

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.840 
you what it looks like on top and then
I'll<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> glitch<00:02:01.890> again<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
I'll do the glitch again but from the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.449 
I'll do the glitch again but from the
top<00:02:03.030> view<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.560> now<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> done<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.310> saw

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
top view so so now I done that you saw

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.800 
top view so so now I done that you saw
what<00:02:08.610> kind<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.849> screen<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.149> need<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.300> go<00:02:09.629> at

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
what kind of screen you need to go at

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.680 
what kind of screen you need to go at
and<00:02:10.020> weirdly<00:02:10.770> enough<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.310> looks<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.760> that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
and weirdly enough it looks like that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.110 
and weirdly enough it looks like that
so<00:02:13.170> your<00:02:13.440> $100<00:02:14.010> actually<00:02:14.430> flips<00:02:14.700> at<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.940> top

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
so your $100 actually flips at the top

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.670 
so your $100 actually flips at the top
of<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.330> cardboard<00:02:15.570> box<00:02:15.870> even<00:02:16.110> though<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.440> put

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
of the cardboard box even though you put

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.280 
of the cardboard box even though you put
that<00:02:16.860> down<00:02:17.040> first<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:18.420> that's<00:02:18.780> what<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.110> looks

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
that down first so that's what it looks

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.910 
that down first so that's what it looks
like<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:21.450> then<00:02:22.410> you're<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.740> need<00:02:22.830> to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
like and then you're going to need to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.190 
like and then you're going to need to
take<00:02:23.010> your<00:02:23.070> 99,000<00:02:24.000> bells<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.630> you're<00:02:25.080> going

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
take your 99,000 bells and you're going

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.980 
take your 99,000 bells and you're going
to<00:02:25.260> put<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.770> floor<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.990> weirdly

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
to put it on the floor and weirdly

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.070 
to put it on the floor and weirdly
enough<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:28.650> going<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.950> jump<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.370> top<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:30.080> the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
enough it's going to jump on top of the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.220 
enough it's going to jump on top of the
100<00:02:31.560> bales<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.860> your<00:02:31.980> box<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:33.420> now<00:02:33.630> I'm<00:02:33.990> going

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
100 bales on your box so now I'm going

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.080 
100 bales on your box so now I'm going
to<00:02:34.290> exit<00:02:34.590> out<00:02:34.620> my<00:02:34.830> pocket<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.730> I'm<00:02:35.880> going<00:02:36.060> to

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
to exit out my pocket and I'm going to

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.330 
to exit out my pocket and I'm going to
collect<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:37.020> money<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.920> now<00:02:44.040> I'm<00:02:44.130> going<00:02:44.250> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
collect the money so now I'm going to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.950 
collect the money so now I'm going to
walk<00:02:44.520> around<00:02:44.850> I'm<00:02:45.030> going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.240> pick<00:02:45.360> up<00:02:45.390> my<00:02:45.600> 100

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
walk around I'm going to pick up my 100

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.410 
walk around I'm going to pick up my 100
buzz<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> floor<00:02:46.760> I'm<00:02:47.760> going<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.970> pick<00:02:48.210> up

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
buzz on the floor I'm going to pick up

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.210 
buzz on the floor I'm going to pick up
the<00:02:48.840> bag<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.500> sometimes<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.010> doesn't

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
the bag and I sometimes this doesn't

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.000 
the bag and I sometimes this doesn't
work<00:02:50.490> so<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.120> need<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.510> go<00:02:51.690> round<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> corner

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
work so you need to go round to a corner

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.850 
work so you need to go round to a corner
of<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.130> box<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.550> usually<00:02:53.880> works<00:02:54.090> like<00:02:54.510> that

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
of the box that usually works like that

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.290 
of the box that usually works like that
so<00:02:55.860> obviously<00:02:55.950> now<00:02:56.370> you've<00:02:56.670> picked<00:02:56.880> online<00:02:57.180> to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
so obviously now you've picked online to

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.560 
so obviously now you've picked online to
9000<00:02:57.750> bells<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:59.000> there's<00:03:00.000> one<00:03:00.180> one<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.450> nine

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
9000 bells and there's one one to nine

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.720 
9000 bells and there's one one to nine
thousand<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.320> your<00:03:01.620> 100<00:03:02.100> bells<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.430> do<00:03:02.550> lose

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
thousand and your 100 bells you do lose

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.340 
thousand and your 100 bells you do lose
100<00:03:03.090> bells<00:03:03.240> every<00:03:03.510> time<00:03:03.690> but<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:03.930> my<00:03:04.050> case<00:03:04.110> II

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
100 bells every time but in my case II

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.930 
100 bells every time but in my case II
game<00:03:04.710> ninety-nine<00:03:05.160> thousand<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.730> doesn't

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
game ninety-nine thousand so it doesn't

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.520 
game ninety-nine thousand so it doesn't
really<00:03:06.000> matter

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
really matter

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.630 
really matter
then<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.710> need<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.860> pick<00:03:08.070> up<00:03:08.160> your<00:03:08.310> box<00:03:08.490> and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
then you need to pick up your box and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.530 
then you need to pick up your box and
move<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.060> any<00:03:09.270> direction<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.990> want<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:11.540> and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
move it in any direction you want to and

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.500 
move it in any direction you want to and
then<00:03:13.200> pick<00:03:13.440> up<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.980> next<00:03:14.250> bag<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.880> your<00:03:15.300> box

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
then pick up the next bag and your box

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.270 
then pick up the next bag and your box
and<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.350> do<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> glitch<00:03:16.770> all<00:03:16.950> over<00:03:17.190> again

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
and you can do the glitch all over again

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.230 
and you can do the glitch all over again
good<00:03:18.150> ear<00:03:21.170> ok<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:23.280> now<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:23.640> two<00:03:23.790> bags<00:03:23.970> and

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
good ear ok so now I have two bags and
