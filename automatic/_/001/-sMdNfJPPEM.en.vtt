00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 tells crowd beauty is good now we 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.970
 will confer upon 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.260
 I bought this floor that was missing 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.099
 in my car 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.099
 he had broken 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.210
 I found this here on the free market is 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 new but it 's parallel but I liked it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 enough of the Frizzo and he has 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.250
 the original texture even just did not like 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.440
 One thing I'm going to have to do is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.180
 alignment again cool dodo here 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.890
 pierce the car just because he and I do not 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:53.550
 came with correct alignment 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:57.570
 so come on good it came with a 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:03.589
 alignment totally left out 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.840
 so I'm going to have to stick there for them 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.729
 aligned correctly 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.410
 The drill that's here in the car is over 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.330
 down and out 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:22.200
 You can come down here and here. 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:28.259
 going up to God the right people a lot 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:34.550
 he gets up and no people at 1 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.550
 The reason is not good, come on. 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.310
 the little monkey 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:47.610
 you can see what will be more or 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:47.610
 less here the future new car she nÃ© 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.340
 fine 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.550
 have to drop the flow 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:38.500
 Good, my son here and now I am 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.380
 Putting it here to see it. 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.600
 stayed a little bit higher 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.060
 so I'll go back if it's a little more 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.060
 capable beauty 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.310
 ae 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:40.210
 I'll see now that my good 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.150
 it's basically that now that's right 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.110
 how can you see the alignment 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:57.370
 upper alignment was correctly 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:58.240
 also an alignment of the law. 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.430
 out 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.430
 Let's see now here. 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:13.850
 right to paragraph 1 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:16.780
 how can you see good grandma screw 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.780
 Finish here 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:34.520
 with the easy here that disperse wheels 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:03.799
 I have 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:17.699
 good, this is basically from here I'll see 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:21.839
 now correct upper alignment 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:31.749
 they were born here in the lambem rendition 

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:34.359
 You can run out of wheelchairs. 

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:40.779
 because they have not yet been tapped to launch 

00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:44.739
 Here, I took the 

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:47.559
 air here, to stop picking up a little 

00:07:44.739 --> 00:07:51.159
 see if it got better 

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:53.459
 So that's it, guys, thanks.
