00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
of overlords down whoa so I think yellow

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.990 
of overlords down whoa so I think yellow
is<00:00:39.450> at<00:00:39.600> 51<00:00:40.140> /<00:00:40.410> 35<00:00:40.800> population<00:00:41.579> right<00:00:41.730> now<00:00:41.850> he's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
is at 51 / 35 population right now he's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.310 
is at 51 / 35 population right now he's
got<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> get<00:00:42.300> some<00:00:42.450> more<00:00:42.570> overlords<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.230> in

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
got to get some more overlords out in

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.400 
got to get some more overlords out in
the<00:00:43.379> field<00:00:43.620> yeah<00:00:44.399> geez<00:00:45.059> he<00:00:45.899> might<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.230> trying

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the field yeah geez he might be trying

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.139 
the field yeah geez he might be trying
to<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.129> an<00:00:47.190> attack<00:00:47.430> right<00:00:47.670> now<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.030> be

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
to go in for an attack right now but be

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.389 
to go in for an attack right now but be
sooo<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.840> she<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.140> amassing<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.860> ground<00:00:50.190> army

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
sooo be she was amassing a ground army

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.430 
sooo be she was amassing a ground army
so<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.030> think<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.600> build<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.079> actually

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so I think this build is actually

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
so I think this build is actually
working<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.800> him<00:00:53.100> from<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.430> point<00:00:53.640> he<00:00:54.329> has<00:00:54.449> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
working for him from this point he has a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.299 
working for him from this point he has a
ton<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> troops<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> don't<00:00:56.129> think

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
ton of troops out here so I don't think

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.760 
ton of troops out here so I don't think
yell<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.149> able<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.620> handle<00:00:58.620> this

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
yell is going to be able to handle this

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.170 
yell is going to be able to handle this
he<00:00:58.949> doesn't<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.340> his<00:00:59.460> third<00:00:59.670> base<00:00:59.879> he's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
he doesn't have his third base he's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.970 
he doesn't have his third base he's
still<00:01:00.480> stuck<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.350> ten<00:01:01.949> o'clock

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
still stuck it to because at ten o'clock

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.609 
still stuck it to because at ten o'clock
went<00:01:02.550> down<00:01:02.699> rather<00:01:02.969> quickly<00:01:03.120> he<00:01:04.080> could<00:01:04.470> not

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
went down rather quickly he could not

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.340 
went down rather quickly he could not
defend<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.159> oh<00:01:05.630> wow<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.689> course<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.260> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
defend that oh wow the course here is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.929 
defend that oh wow the course here is
coming<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.710> now<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.310> because<00:01:08.729> he<00:01:08.820> was

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
coming in now so I think because he was

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
coming in now so I think because he was
one<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.450> yellow<00:01:09.840> doesn't<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.140> any<00:01:10.320> troops

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
one this yellow doesn't have any troops

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.219 
one this yellow doesn't have any troops
on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.770> ground<00:01:10.860> he<00:01:11.670> has<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.689> control<00:01:13.080> group

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
on the ground he has a one control group

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.289 
on the ground he has a one control group
of<00:01:13.380> hydras<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.890> think<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.400> yeah<00:01:14.880> beasts<00:01:15.119> are

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
of hydras I think but yeah beasts are

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.050 
of hydras I think but yeah beasts are
taking<00:01:15.600> his<00:01:15.720> third<00:01:15.960> base<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.640> this

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
taking his third base you know this

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.789 
taking his third base you know this
would<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.390> noticed<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.869> yellow<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
would have noticed about yellow this is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
would have noticed about yellow this is
what<00:01:19.979> separates<00:01:20.369> him<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:20.640> his<00:01:21.150> brother<00:01:21.420> his

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
what separates him from his brother his

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.380 
what separates him from his brother his
macro<00:01:22.350> sometimes<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:24.180> really

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
macro sometimes is just really really

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.800 
macro sometimes is just really really
crappy<00:01:24.960> well<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.220> wouldn't<00:01:27.090> say<00:01:27.240> crappy<00:01:27.659> is

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
crappy well I wouldn't say crappy is

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.940 
crappy well I wouldn't say crappy is
just<00:01:28.049> very<00:01:28.790> weirdly<00:01:29.790> timed<00:01:30.590> he<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
just very weirdly timed he got that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.880 
just very weirdly timed he got that
third<00:01:32.220> base<00:01:32.430> way<00:01:32.820> late<00:01:33.150> i<00:01:33.180> think<00:01:33.680> when<00:01:34.680> dealing

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
third base way late i think when dealing

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.679 
third base way late i think when dealing
with<00:01:35.009> bc<00:01:35.460> i<00:01:35.490> think<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.850> need<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.240> third<00:01:36.479> base

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
with bc i think you need a third base

why he's tried to get a third base up

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.920 
why he's tried to get a third base up
but<00:02:16.080> he<00:02:16.170> didn't<00:02:16.500> defend<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.920> whatsoever<00:02:17.930> he

by now definitely knows about it by now

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.390 
by now definitely knows about it by now
he<00:02:35.760> put<00:02:36.030> down<00:02:36.270> some<00:02:36.480> pylons<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.020> keep<00:02:37.400> the

he put down some pylons to keep the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280 
he put down some pylons to keep the
troops<00:02:38.670> coming<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.810> didn't<00:02:40.260> last

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
troops coming in but that didn't last

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.740 
troops coming in but that didn't last
too<00:02:40.620> long<00:02:40.850> running<00:02:41.850> all<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.120> his<00:02:42.239> probes<00:02:42.480> away

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
too long running all of his probes away

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.540 
too long running all of his probes away
but<00:02:43.110> i<00:02:43.140> still<00:02:43.620> think<00:02:43.830> he's<00:02:44.010> economically

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
but i still think he's economically

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.460 
but i still think he's economically
ahead<00:02:45.410> Protoss<00:02:46.410> as<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> two<00:02:46.860> bases<00:02:47.310> are

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
ahead Protoss as the two bases are

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.810 
ahead Protoss as the two bases are
economically<00:02:49.470> ahead<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.130> zerg<00:02:50.400> that's<00:02:50.670> only

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
economically ahead of a zerg that's only

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.690 
economically ahead of a zerg that's only
at<00:02:51.000> two<00:02:51.180> phases<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:52.290> luck<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.980> yellow<00:02:53.400> didn't

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
at two phases and luck and yellow didn't

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.100 
at two phases and luck and yellow didn't
have<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:54.000> third<00:02:54.269> base<00:02:54.420> running<00:02:54.690> for<00:02:54.930> long

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
have that third base running for long

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.020 
have that third base running for long
he's<00:02:55.709> going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> take<00:02:56.160> out<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.430> nexus<00:02:56.850> so

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
he's going to take out this nexus so

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.400 
he's going to take out this nexus so
it's<00:02:57.150> definitely<00:02:57.450> gonna<00:02:57.570> put<00:02:57.810> pisu<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.110> little

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
it's definitely gonna put pisu a little

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.600 
it's definitely gonna put pisu a little
bit<00:02:58.500> behind<00:02:59.330> but<00:03:00.330> be<00:03:00.570> soo<00:03:00.890> well<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:02.160> these<00:03:02.459> who

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
bit behind but be soo well if these who

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.009 
bit behind but be soo well if these who
tries<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.880> tackle<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.390> army<00:03:03.660> down<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:03.989> I

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
tries to tackle this army down here I

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.509 
tries to tackle this army down here I
don't<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:04.560> it'll<00:03:04.739> work<00:03:04.830> out<00:03:05.070> too<00:03:05.280> well<00:03:05.310> for

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
don't think it'll work out too well for

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.090 
don't think it'll work out too well for
him<00:03:05.760> but<00:03:05.910> he's<00:03:06.030> going<00:03:06.300> down<00:03:06.420> anyway<00:03:06.950> well<00:03:07.950> he's

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
him but he's going down anyway well he's

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.280 
him but he's going down anyway well he's
backing<00:03:08.489> off<00:03:08.610> now<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:08.940> think<00:03:09.360> would<00:03:09.810> be<00:03:10.050> sooo

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
backing off now I think would be sooo

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.259 
backing off now I think would be sooo
that<00:03:10.560> indecision<00:03:10.980> cost<00:03:11.400> him<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.670> few<00:03:11.820> sellouts

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
that indecision cost him a few sellouts

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.110 
that indecision cost him a few sellouts
right<00:03:12.480> there<00:03:13.340> trying<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.370> go<00:03:14.550> down<00:03:14.760> there<00:03:14.970> with

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
all those lurkers that's just probably

picking<00:04:57.760> off<00:04:57.880> a<00:04:57.910> few<00:04:58.270> troops<00:04:58.510> there<00:04:58.840> and

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
picking off a few troops there and

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.950 
picking off a few troops there and
yellow<00:05:00.130> still<00:05:00.550> at<00:05:00.820> two<00:05:01.000> bases<00:05:01.390> I<00:05:01.510> believe<00:05:01.780> he's

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
yellow still at two bases I believe he's

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.870 
yellow still at two bases I believe he's
getting<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.290> third<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:03.280> he's<00:05:03.400> going<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.640> try<00:05:03.820> to

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
getting a third so he's going to try to

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.400 
getting a third so he's going to try to
keep<00:05:04.030> that<00:05:04.210> third<00:05:04.450> but<00:05:04.690> again<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:04.960> think<00:05:05.110> it<00:05:05.350> was

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
keep that third but again I think it was

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.050 
keep that third but again I think it was
a<00:05:05.470> little<00:05:05.680> bit<00:05:05.860> late<00:05:06.100> be<00:05:06.340> sooo<00:05:06.550> hasn't<00:05:06.940> a

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
a little bit late be sooo hasn't a

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.900
