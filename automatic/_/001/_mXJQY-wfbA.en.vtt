rifle<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:57.040> this<00:02:57.550> one<00:02:57.730> seems<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.420> be<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.690> best

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
rifle and this one seems to be the best

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.600 
rifle and this one seems to be the best
one<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.380> bought<00:02:59.620> this<00:02:59.770> one<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.310> haven't

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
one so I bought this one and I haven't

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.520 
one so I bought this one and I haven't
my<00:03:00.820> favorite<00:03:01.300> soul<00:03:01.450> rifle<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.840> factor<00:03:02.260> so

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
my favorite soul rifle is the factor so

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.380 
my favorite soul rifle is the factor so
well<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:03.130> know<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:05.130> signature<00:03:06.130> vector<00:03:06.610> but

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
well you know the signature vector but

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.570 
well you know the signature vector but
let's<00:03:07.720> give<00:03:07.870> this<00:03:07.960> one<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.170> try<00:03:08.340> again<00:03:09.340> I'm<00:03:09.490> just

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
let's give this one a try again I'm just

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.210 
let's give this one a try again I'm just
gonna<00:03:09.700> hold<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.120> trigger<00:03:10.300> down<00:03:14.220> maybe

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
gonna hold the trigger down maybe

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.860 
gonna hold the trigger down maybe
because<00:03:15.490> as<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.670> silencer<00:03:16.150> has<00:03:16.300> less<00:03:16.600> recoil

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
because as a silencer has less recoil

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.470 
because as a silencer has less recoil
but<00:03:17.530> stored<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.550> you<00:03:18.640> know<00:03:18.760> there's<00:03:19.060> there's

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
but stored that you know there's there's

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.920 
but stored that you know there's there's
still<00:03:19.630> something<00:03:19.810> for<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.340> house<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.520> hold<00:03:21.730> it

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
still something for the house to hold it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.270 
still something for the house to hold it
not<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.080> bad<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:24.430> rate<00:03:24.580> of<00:03:24.700> fire<00:03:24.940> see<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:26.280> same

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
not so bad the rate of fire see the same

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.730 
not so bad the rate of fire see the same
thing<00:03:27.520> I<00:03:27.880> thought<00:03:28.780> it'd<00:03:28.870> be<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.990> little<00:03:29.260> faster

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
thing I thought it'd be a little faster

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.310 
thing I thought it'd be a little faster
but<00:03:29.950> it's<00:03:30.100> just<00:03:33.000> same<00:03:34.000> thing<00:03:34.240> but<00:03:34.930> anyways

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
but it's just same thing but anyways

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.460 
but it's just same thing but anyways
