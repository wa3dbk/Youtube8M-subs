00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.410 

since<00:02:12.459> I'm<00:02:12.579> going<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.760> split<00:02:12.969> this<00:02:13.090> piece<00:02:13.269> in

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
since I'm going to split this piece in

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.880 
since I'm going to split this piece in
half<00:02:13.629> I<00:02:13.959> need<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.290> able<00:02:14.379> to<00:02:14.530> hold<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.799> on

half I need to be able to hold it on

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.699 
half I need to be able to hold it on
each<00:02:15.069> end<00:02:15.329> so<00:02:16.329> the<00:02:16.629> next<00:02:16.810> thing<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.079> turn<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
each end so the next thing is turn a

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.780 
each end so the next thing is turn a

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
chainsaw I'm like okay guys let's get to

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.280 
chainsaw I'm like okay guys let's get to
work<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.310> just<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:09.360> was<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.870> was<00:04:09.989> sort<00:04:10.260> of

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
work and just that was that was sort of

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.050 
work and just that was that was sort of
the<00:04:10.349> atmosphere<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:10.950> Palmer<00:04:11.190> created<00:04:11.819> of

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the atmosphere the Palmer created of

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.670 
the atmosphere the Palmer created of
course<00:04:12.299> he<00:04:12.420> introduced<00:04:12.750> me<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.930> delay<00:04:13.440> the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
course he introduced me to delay the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.259 
course he introduced me to delay the
very<00:04:13.890> first<00:04:14.190> turning<00:04:14.519> demonstration<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.120> ever

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
very first turning demonstration I ever

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.960 
very first turning demonstration I ever
saw<00:04:15.569> was<00:04:16.380> Palmer<00:04:16.650> turning<00:04:17.039> one<00:04:17.160> of<00:04:17.280> these<00:04:17.430> this

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
saw was Palmer turning one of these this

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:30.100 
saw was Palmer turning one of these this
is<00:04:18.120> actually<00:04:18.510> Palmer's<00:04:19.190> work

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.460 

morning<00:04:30.890> everybody<00:04:31.130> I'm<00:04:31.490> Bill<00:04:31.730> Smith<00:04:32.090> and

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
morning everybody I'm Bill Smith and

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.310 
morning everybody I'm Bill Smith and
this<00:04:33.470> is<00:04:33.680> open<00:04:34.040> segmented<00:04:35.200> construction<00:04:36.200> the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
this is open segmented construction the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.710 
this is open segmented construction the
basics<00:04:36.800> I'm<00:04:37.400> going<00:04:37.640> to<00:04:37.730> try<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.090> take<00:04:38.540> you

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
basics I'm going to try to take you

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.240 
basics I'm going to try to take you
through<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:40.070> process<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.940> make<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:43.040> has

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
through the process to make this it has

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.700 
through the process to make this it has
a<00:04:43.280> solid<00:04:43.640> base<00:04:44.030> of<00:04:44.060> maple<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:47.110> there<00:04:48.110> are<00:04:48.320> ten

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
a solid base of maple the there are ten

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.620 
a solid base of maple the there are ten
layers<00:04:49.040> of<00:04:49.870> segments<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.250> each<00:04:52.250> segment<00:04:52.670> each

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
layers of segments and each segment each

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.440 
layers of segments and each segment each
layer<00:04:53.930> has<00:04:53.960> 12<00:04:54.830> segments<00:04:55.610> going<00:04:55.820> around<00:04:56.210> it

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
layer has 12 segments going around it

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.520 
layer has 12 segments going around it
and<00:04:57.040> that<00:04:58.040> 12<00:04:58.400> segments<00:04:59.030> is<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.960> same<00:05:00.230> whether

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
and that 12 segments is the same whether

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.020 
and that 12 segments is the same whether
you're<00:05:00.620> on<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.280> bottom<00:05:01.700> or<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:01.910> top

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
you're on the the bottom or the top

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.580 
you're on the the bottom or the top
layer<00:05:02.570> and<00:05:02.840> then<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.890> top<00:05:04.370> of<00:05:04.580> it<00:05:04.730> is<00:05:05.030> a

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
layer and then the top of it is a

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.370 
layer and then the top of it is a
regular<00:05:06.590> solid<00:05:07.100> segment<00:05:07.640> at<00:05:07.730> ring<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:08.330> you

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
regular solid segment at ring and you

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.140 
regular solid segment at ring and you
can<00:05:09.380> use<00:05:09.620> just<00:05:10.040> a<00:05:10.190> solid<00:05:10.490> piece<00:05:10.610> of<00:05:10.670> wood<00:05:10.820> for

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
can use just a solid piece of wood for

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.050 
can use just a solid piece of wood for
the<00:05:11.210> top<00:05:11.480> I<00:05:11.750> like<00:05:12.020> from<00:05:13.010> a<00:05:13.100> design<00:05:13.550> point<00:05:13.910> I

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
the top I like from a design point I

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.600 
the top I like from a design point I
think<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.330> looks<00:05:14.480> better<00:05:14.540> to<00:05:14.900> have<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.710> glute<00:05:16.460> up

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
think it looks better to have a glute up

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.640 
think it looks better to have a glute up
ring<00:05:16.940> in<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.180> top<00:05:17.450> I<00:05:17.780> have<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.710> drawing<00:05:19.340> and<00:05:20.650> if

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
ring in the top I have a drawing and if

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.090 
ring in the top I have a drawing and if
you<00:05:21.770> divide<00:05:22.070> 12<00:05:22.460> in<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.780> 360<00:05:23.780> degrees<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:24.920> get

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
you divide 12 in the 360 degrees you get

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.200 
you divide 12 in the 360 degrees you get
30<00:05:25.370> degrees<00:05:25.760> so<00:05:26.000> each<00:05:26.150> one<00:05:26.390> of<00:05:26.420> these<00:05:26.630> segments

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
30 degrees so each one of these segments

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:38.290 
30 degrees so each one of these segments
areas<00:05:29.210> takes<00:05:29.540> up<00:05:29.750> 30<00:05:30.050> degrees

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.360
