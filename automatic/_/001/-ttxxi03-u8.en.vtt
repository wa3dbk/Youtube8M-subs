00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.009
 hello and welcome to this episode of 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:16.350
 at the corner of f one for today we 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.090
 let's talk about the big correction 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.460
 angle you know you are doing 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.980
 panoramas suppose it's a bit like 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.590
 to make a panorama can do that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.890
 photo of them photo 3 photos four photos 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.019
 to five pictures or more finally a home 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.059
 concrete see times in hdr finally to 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.700
 once you switch to photoshop 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.040
 you can mount this panorama thanks to 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
 a tool called shit photo and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.210
 which is in script files this 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.469
 name in automation files I tell you 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.460
 always find between the two of you 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.989
 press photos but rj 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.329
 then the shot lightroom Jaunards 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.829
 eat the experts by doing edited 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.809
 in photoshop and above all not hesitate 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.960
 in a pile like that I'm here 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.690
 in photo but rj and I'm doing was added 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.250
 the open files woman adds all 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.590
 open files in photoshop i 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 more than to do ok let's spin 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:10.710
 let's wait a little bit we turn them 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 inches I have great piot then suddenly 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.750
 Well, the episode is not going well 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.080
 stop there obviously since in fact 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.549
 I shit all the layers together and 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.520
 the going does that I want to show you 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.080
 that there is necessarily a small problem you 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.170
 see for yourself that there is a 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.420
 little problem the photo and as with a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.670
 fisheye effect indeed a little weird 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.229
 because the photo is completely 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.850
 rounded as if they were on a 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.490
 globe species so what are we going to do 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.049
 we are going to use the filter 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.939
 adaptive wide angle that you find 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.479
 in adaptive wide-angle filter all 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.149
 simply 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.000
 in fact we will manage the distortions in 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.619
 binding our photo you have the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.590
 work area right in the middle you 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.840
 also have the zoom zone at 100% 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.360
 here what will allow you to click 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.979
 exactly in the right place and you have 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.780
 so here the word taissy so it's for 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.479
 to do the distortion we will not use it 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.369
 here and you see especially here that he 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.329
 find the camera model and the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.649
 goal model 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.080
 so that means it has prices this 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.720
 to integrate here we will use the tool of 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.090
 constraints 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.380
 who the touch is then the tool 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.880
 constrained to polygons to freeze a bit 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.380
 used it can be convenient for 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.090
 walls actually to really have some 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.760
 right polygons you see here that 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.110
 sunwing there is rounded it can pose 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.430
 problem since normally in the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.540
 real life she the time what are we going 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.080
 to make the coup is that we will put it 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.520
 right 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.370
 then you get involved 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.110
 just to help you zoom in on 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.830
 side and you come click here 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.570
 ap / languages and you just click and from 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.670
 the other side then six games before 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.370
 click I showed you that actually 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.740
 you see the rounding that is here 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.780
 why there is this rounding actually because 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.300
 that I was talking about price 7 in fact there 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.890
 know the curvature of your goal and 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.030
 so suddenly he adapts directly to 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.580
 a neutral ground objective he would have 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.490
 curvet differently I come click 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.520
 here try to make very lines 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.350
 long it will allow you a lot 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.890
 more easily manage your photo by 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.450
 example 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.790
 there I made a very dangerous line 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.580
 all right but for this area there that 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.690
 is right is aligned with that I can 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.760
 come click in the corner here in 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.090
 the angle there and we know that these donations 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:24.540
 similarly blow here there this line 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:28.060
 where the far rights but beyond 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.700
 from this cornice here until this 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:37.330
 cornice here in sex and right also 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.680
 because I'm right there and we can 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.019
 also do it and for areas 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.459
 vertical for vertical stresses 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.970
 so we can take this post there they 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.510
 have a right 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:53.640
 finally in my book memories on it 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.640
 leave in peace the same for this post there 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.650
 it is here like that and we can also 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:05.400
 do it here it will serve us if we do it 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:09.660
 did sail line and I just click here 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:15.300
 in water by aiming here these rights is here 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.350
 also his rights now we have a 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.330
 image that is a little straighten you 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.820
 can also do it on the 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.340
 buildings on one side we will not do it 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.350
 there he on this picture because there 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.570
 but I could very well tell me too 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:33.990
 that here his rights for example from the 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.090
 until then they are rare and it is a 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.250
 little bit the same rights actually 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.720
 logically if they were 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:46.490
 cut to the millimeter close sabine glas 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.370
 from the up to the hate on the other side 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.610
 his rights gold is perfect and we have a 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.730
 photo that you see between preview when 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.200
 the displayed before before we already have a 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.390
 photo that is still a lot more 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.160
 beautiful because a lot more right 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.150
 you see that this constraint there she 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.430
 is straight but that it is 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.960
 horizontal no and that's where you 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.430
 have this little circle with its two 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.020
 little circles that will be super helpful 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.780
 it will allow you to say that this 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.050
 line there and horizontal so see you 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.450
 have the degree of the angle right next 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.310
 this line there must be about -1 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.870
 degrees it should be at zero degrees 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.950
 so horizon table I advise you 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.090
 to go as far as possible from 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.620
 expect from where you have 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.320
 clicked for report to control a lot 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.850
 more careful about the angle you 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.850
 go give and you put them on 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.900
 at zero degrees here you do the same 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.730
 blow for all the others 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.080
 if there is one that you leave to a 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.090
 degree and that you put all the 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.980
 other 1 0 it will make supra weird 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:46.520
 but do not forget your 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:50.720
 vertical to put there at minus 90 degrees 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.070
 at 90 or less 90 everything depends on 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.550
 the inclination everything depends on the you 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.550
 are gone 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.700
 yes I draw a lot of language when I 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.150
 apply to me i do ok that calculates that 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:18.550
 generates its adaptation and we have more than 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:21.880
 wait for the big organ application 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:26.350
 adaptive one is ok and if I show you 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.520
 suddenly you see the front after we 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.410
 still a photo that is much more 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.480
 nice a panoramic is much more fun 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.610
 after that it's all for today 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.860
 see you next week for a 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.820
 new corner episode of f1 4 and from here 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.470
 I wish you a good week

 next week for a new episode 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.070
 we go 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.590
 1 of the blow it has selected me a 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.650
 again we click on it 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.290
 selected little crap small 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.810
 Photoshop pity 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.660
 here now he does not want I was worth 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:40.270
 with mouse because I have a little 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:40.270
 polio of the hands to select it
