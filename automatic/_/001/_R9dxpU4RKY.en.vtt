00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
do have front-wheel drive but we're just

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.690 
do have front-wheel drive but we're just
going<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.690> use<00:02:45.840> these<00:02:46.049> as<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> test<00:02:46.590> product<00:02:46.829> I'm

going to use these as a test product I'm
going<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:47.910> go<00:02:48.000> around<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.299> put<00:02:48.420> them<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.599> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
going to go around and put them on the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.330 
going to go around and put them on the
other<00:02:48.810> side<00:02:48.900> you'll<00:02:49.799> be<00:02:49.829> able<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.099> see<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
other side you'll be able to see the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.270 
other side you'll be able to see the
effectiveness<00:02:50.760> when<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:51.720> put<00:02:51.930> them<00:02:52.079> on<00:02:52.280> you

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
effectiveness when you put them on you

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.949 
effectiveness when you put them on you
want<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.519> put<00:02:53.579> them<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:53.910> all<00:02:54.180> about<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.690> exact

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
want to put them on all about the exact

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.130 
want to put them on all about the exact
same<00:02:55.260> area<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:56.359> I'm<00:02:57.359> currently<00:02:57.720> put<00:02:58.019> this

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
same area so I'm currently put this

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.539 
same area so I'm currently put this
right<00:02:58.350> up<00:02:58.500> here<00:02:58.799> at<00:02:59.069> about<00:03:00.200> 230<00:03:01.220> on<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.400> other

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
right up here at about 230 on the other

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.670 
right up here at about 230 on the other
tire<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:02.880> want<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.390> put<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.600> about<00:03:03.810> 230<00:03:04.290> as<00:03:04.440> well

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
tire I want to put it about 230 as well

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.129 
tire I want to put it about 230 as well
so<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.639> when<00:03:05.910> you're<00:03:06.180> actually<00:03:06.389> lifting<00:03:06.810> up

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
so that when you're actually lifting up

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.690 
so that when you're actually lifting up
you're<00:03:07.319> lifting<00:03:07.470> up<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.859> exact<00:03:08.130> same<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.579> all

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
you're lifting up the exact same on all

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:50.580 
you're lifting up the exact same on all
four<00:03:08.970> sides

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.699 

so<00:03:51.590> as<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.430> can<00:03:52.580> see<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.930> track<00:03:54.170> rubber<00:03:54.440> being

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
so as you can see the track rubber being

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.680 
so as you can see the track rubber being
on<00:03:54.860> front<00:03:55.250> allows<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.180> provide<00:03:56.420> some

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
on front allows you to provide some

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.520 
on front allows you to provide some
traction<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:59.120> actually<00:03:59.540> helped<00:03:59.900> kick<00:04:00.319> out

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
traction and it actually helped kick out

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.680 
traction and it actually helped kick out
the<00:04:00.770> dirt<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.550> can<00:04:01.670> actually<00:04:01.819> see<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.390> rough

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
the dirt you can actually see the rough

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.380 
the dirt you can actually see the rough
that<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:03.020> actually<00:04:03.200> caused<00:04:03.590> right<00:04:03.890> here<00:04:04.390> all

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
that it actually caused right here all

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.530 
that it actually caused right here all
the<00:04:05.630> way<00:04:05.720> through<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:07.000> allowed<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.270> lift

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
the way through and allowed you to lift

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.729 
the way through and allowed you to lift
the<00:04:08.690> truck<00:04:08.900> up<00:04:09.160> kick<00:04:10.160> out<00:04:10.340> some<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:11.739> kick

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
the truck up kick out some of the kick

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.680 
the truck up kick out some of the kick
out<00:04:12.890> some<00:04:13.130> of<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.280> mud<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.730> help<00:04:14.480> create

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
out some of the mud and help create

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.229 
out some of the mud and help create
basically<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.319> space<00:04:15.530> for<00:04:15.800> us<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:15.890> go<00:04:16.160> forward

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
basically a space for us to go forward

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.199 
basically a space for us to go forward
go<00:04:17.239> check<00:04:17.660> them<00:04:17.810> out<00:04:17.900> track<00:04:18.290> Robert<00:04:18.709> comm

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
go check them out track Robert comm

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.979 
go check them out track Robert comm
we're<00:04:20.209> going<00:04:20.329> to<00:04:20.389> take<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.540> quick<00:04:20.780> picture

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989

right over here and as you can see the

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.780 
right over here and as you can see the
track<00:04:29.150> grabber<00:04:29.419> is<00:04:29.660> nice<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.080> secure<00:04:30.650> on<00:04:30.830> the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
track grabber is nice and secure on the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.820 
track grabber is nice and secure on the
tire<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:33.400> worked<00:04:34.400> out<00:04:34.580> perfectly<00:04:35.030> for<00:04:35.120> us<00:04:35.830> now

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
tire and worked out perfectly for us now
