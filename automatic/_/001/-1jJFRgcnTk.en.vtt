million<00:01:38.520> now<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:39.060> feet<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.600> gutter<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.020> they

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
million now in feet of gutter and they

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.319 
million now in feet of gutter and they
do<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.350> Stanford<00:01:40.829> University<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.119> hard

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
do like Stanford University so it's hard

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.060 
do like Stanford University so it's hard
to<00:01:42.390> believe<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:42.930> are<00:01:43.110> people<00:01:43.350> who<00:01:43.680> have

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
to believe but there are people who have

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.240 
to believe but there are people who have
it<00:01:44.729> down<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.210> an<00:01:45.450> art<00:01:45.600> that's<00:01:46.380> right<00:01:46.649> okay<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it down to an art that's right okay so

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.830 
it down to an art that's right okay so
the<00:01:47.490> first<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.090> need<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> know<00:01:48.420> is

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the first thing you need to know is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.050 
the first thing you need to know is
don't<00:01:49.560> wait<00:01:49.860> till<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.159> rains<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
don't wait till it rains to do the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.210 
don't wait till it rains to do the
gutter<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.110> when<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.350> easiest<00:01:52.770> when<00:01:53.070> it's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
gutter do it when it's easiest when it's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.760 
gutter do it when it's easiest when it's
dry<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:54.030> once<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> becomes<00:01:54.899> wet<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
dry because once it becomes wet it's a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.350 
dry because once it becomes wet it's a
gutter<00:01:55.979> cleaning<00:01:56.340> nightmare<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:56.969> only<00:01:57.240> is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
gutter cleaning nightmare not only is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.050 
gutter cleaning nightmare not only is
the<00:01:57.509> danger<00:01:57.960> risk<00:01:58.170> increase<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.729> really

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the danger risk increase but it really

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
the danger risk increase but it really
makes<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> messy<00:02:00.990> job<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.950> summertime

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
makes for a messy job in the summertime

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.670 
makes for a messy job in the summertime
when<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.640> dry<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> neat

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
when it's dry like this this is a neat

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.050 
when it's dry like this this is a neat
little<00:02:04.799> thing<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.340> most<00:02:05.490> homeowners<00:02:05.820> don't

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
little thing that most homeowners don't

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.700 
little thing that most homeowners don't
know<00:02:06.299> about<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.719> attaches<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> end<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.619> an

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
know about it attaches on the end of an

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.010 
know about it attaches on the end of an
extension<00:02:08.069> pole<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.239> actually<00:02:09.450> pull

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
extension pole and I can actually pull

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.730 
extension pole and I can actually pull
the<00:02:10.170> debris<00:02:10.349> towards<00:02:10.979> me<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> don't<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
the debris towards me I don't have to

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.380 
the debris towards me I don't have to
the<00:02:11.950> ladder<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.490> don't<00:02:12.640> have<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.910> move<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.270> and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the ladder I don't have to move it and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.200 
the ladder I don't have to move it and
it<00:02:13.840> actually<00:02:14.080> saves<00:02:15.070> latter<00:02:15.490> movements<00:02:16.060> which

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
it actually saves latter movements which

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.330 
it actually saves latter movements which
increases<00:02:16.720> my<00:02:16.870> safety<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:17.710> it<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:17.890> goes<00:02:18.160> on

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
increases my safety so it just goes on

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.620 
increases my safety so it just goes on
the<00:02:18.430> end<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.790> can<00:02:18.970> get<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.180> at<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.480> lot

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
the end of it you can get that at a lot

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.690 
the end of it you can get that at a lot
of<00:02:19.750> window-washing<00:02:20.200> stores<00:02:20.770> but<00:02:21.430> what<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.580> want

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700

its life from 30 years to 18 to 20 and
this<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.210> a<00:02:46.240> fairly<00:02:46.810> significant<00:02:47.560> investment

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040

all this debris while it's dry scooped
out<00:02:53.830> or<00:02:54.460> we<00:02:54.580> can<00:02:54.760> use<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.210> leaf<00:02:55.450> blower<00:02:55.510> here's

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
out or we can use a leaf blower here's

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.740 
out or we can use a leaf blower here's
another<00:02:56.260> tool<00:02:56.560> here<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.270> not<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> real

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
another tool here this is not a real

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.540 
another tool here this is not a real
this<00:02:59.050> is<00:02:59.170> more<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.530> homeowner<00:02:59.950> type<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.400> a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
this is more of a homeowner type of a

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.240 
this is more of a homeowner type of a
device<00:03:01.330> working<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.140> when<00:03:02.260> it's<00:03:02.380> dry<00:03:02.680> it's<00:03:03.070> so

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
device working and when it's dry it's so

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.950 
device working and when it's dry it's so
much<00:03:03.400> easier<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.820> blow<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.240> debris<00:03:04.570> out<00:03:04.600> and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
much easier to blow the debris out and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.030 
much easier to blow the debris out and
then<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.110> kind<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.380> clean<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.590> up<00:03:05.800> on<00:03:05.920> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
then you kind of clean it up on the
