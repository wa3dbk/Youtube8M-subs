00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I want to show you how to change the

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.030 
I want to show you how to change the
ship<00:00:02.610> cable<00:00:03.060> for<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.929> rear<00:00:04.110> derailleur<00:00:04.319> this

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
ship cable for the rear derailleur this

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.070 
ship cable for the rear derailleur this
one<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:05.910> little<00:00:06.150> bit<00:00:06.330> rusty<00:00:06.690> so<00:00:06.899> I'm<00:00:06.960> going

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
one is a little bit rusty so I'm going

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.770 
one is a little bit rusty so I'm going
to<00:00:07.140> go<00:00:07.200> ahead<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.680> change<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.240> first<00:00:09.240> start

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
to go ahead and change it first start

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.629 
to go ahead and change it first start
off<00:00:09.929> by<00:00:10.010> shifting<00:00:11.210> the<00:00:12.620> rear<00:00:13.620> derailleur<00:00:13.980> into

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
off by shifting the rear derailleur into

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:24.019 
off by shifting the rear derailleur into
the<00:00:14.759> smallest<00:00:15.089> cog<00:00:21.199> there<00:00:22.430> now<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:23.490> go<00:00:23.730> ahead

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the smallest cog there now we go ahead

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.359 
the smallest cog there now we go ahead
just<00:00:24.600> go<00:00:24.720> ahead<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.019> cut<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.289> wire<00:00:25.470> right

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
just go ahead and cut the wire right

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.029 
just go ahead and cut the wire right
there<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.109> then<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.170> go<00:00:28.410> ahead<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.890> loosen

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
there and then we go ahead and loosen

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:38.090 
there and then we go ahead and loosen
this<00:00:29.310> little<00:00:29.609> nut<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:36.739> then<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.829> reach<00:00:38.070> up

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
this little nut here then you reach up

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.450 
this little nut here then you reach up
here<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.670> kind<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> pull<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> cable<00:00:39.480> out

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.560 

next<00:00:44.460> we're<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.760> go<00:00:44.820> ahead<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.000> continue

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
next we're to go ahead just continue

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.590 
next we're to go ahead just continue
pulling<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> wire<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.360> we<00:00:48.360> go<00:00:48.450> ahead

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
pulling the wire up here and we go ahead

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.950 
pulling the wire up here and we go ahead
and<00:00:48.690> pull<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:50.250> here

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
and pull this out of here

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:00.529 
and pull this out of here
and<00:00:56.360> here's<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> shifter<00:00:57.899> right<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.539> I'm

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and here's the shifter right here so I'm

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.479 
and here's the shifter right here so I'm
going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:00.840> ahead<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.260> push<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.129> cable

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
going to go ahead and push the cable

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.670 
going to go ahead and push the cable
through<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.239> there's<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> end<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> cable

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
through and there's the end of the cable

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.740 
through and there's the end of the cable
right<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:06.060> I'm<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.330> ahead<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
right there so I'm just go ahead and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:20.320 
right there so I'm just go ahead and
pull<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> cable<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.710> through<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> shifter

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.110 

they're<00:01:21.740> now<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> brand-new<00:01:23.310> shift<00:01:23.580> cable<00:01:23.970> so

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
they're now a brand-new shift cable so

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.460 
they're now a brand-new shift cable so
I'm<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.330> ahead<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.630> slide<00:01:24.870> in<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.140> hole<00:01:25.290> where

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
I'm go ahead and slide in the hole where

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.940 
I'm go ahead and slide in the hole where
the<00:01:25.590> old<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.890> came<00:01:26.070> out<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:28.100> work<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> through

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
the old one came out and work it through

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.469 
the old one came out and work it through
sometimes<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.250> helps<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.729> kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.940> twist<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
sometimes it helps to kind of twist the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.210 
sometimes it helps to kind of twist the
cave<00:01:33.659> spin<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.260> cable<00:01:34.590> around<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.920> little<00:01:35.100> bit

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
cave spin the cable around a little bit

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:46.920 
cave spin the cable around a little bit
to<00:01:35.430> help<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.700> work<00:01:36.080> through

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.719 

OOP

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:03.719 

get<00:01:54.299> through<00:01:54.720> there

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.300 

I'll<00:02:04.729> pull<00:02:04.970> this<00:02:05.119> through<00:02:05.770> here<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:09.310> there

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
I'll pull this through here and there

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.920 
I'll pull this through here and there
got<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.729> through<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.660> got<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:16.870> usually<00:02:17.870> you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
got it through so got that usually you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.920 
got it through so got that usually you
can<00:02:18.020> go<00:02:18.140> through<00:02:18.440> if<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:19.040> Dre<00:02:19.850> ler<00:02:20.030> is<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
can go through if the Dre ler is in the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.559 
can go through if the Dre ler is in the
lowest<00:02:21.290> key<00:02:21.680> or<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.130> smallest<00:02:22.850> cog<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.360> this

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
lowest key or the smallest cog on this

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.670 
lowest key or the smallest cog on this
one

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
one

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.130 
one
then<00:02:25.520> usually<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.300> can<00:02:26.450> just<00:02:26.600> push<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.959> thing

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
then usually you can just push the thing

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.720 
then usually you can just push the thing
through<00:02:27.470> but<00:02:27.620> on<00:02:27.709> this<00:02:27.800> one<00:02:28.010> kind<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.610> head

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
through but on this one kind of head

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.500 
through but on this one kind of head
around<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.060> through<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.270> little<00:02:29.330> bit

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
around it through a little bit

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.870 
around it through a little bit
differently<00:02:29.860> okay<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:30.920> now<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.220> have<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.580> cable

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
differently okay so now I have the cable

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.030 
differently okay so now I have the cable
coming<00:02:32.120> out<00:02:32.239> through<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.840> other<00:02:33.020> side<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
coming out through the other side of the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.210 
coming out through the other side of the
shifter<00:02:35.110> go<00:02:36.110> ahead<00:02:36.319> feed<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:36.920> through<00:02:36.950> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
shifter go ahead feed it through the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:46.260 
shifter go ahead feed it through the
cable

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.970 

repeat<00:02:47.270> PETA<00:02:48.020> through<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.320> cable<00:02:48.620> housing<00:02:48.770> I

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
repeat PETA through the cable housing I

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.940 
repeat PETA through the cable housing I
should<00:02:49.190> say<00:02:49.780> okay<00:02:51.280> fit<00:02:52.280> this<00:02:52.460> in<00:02:52.670> here<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.950> I

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
should say okay fit this in here and I

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:06.070 
should say okay fit this in here and I
got<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.250> route<00:02:55.460> this<00:02:58.750> down<00:02:59.750> here<00:03:04.900> okay<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:05.930> I'm

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
got to route this down here okay so I'm

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.130 
got to route this down here okay so I'm
gonna<00:03:06.200> go<00:03:06.260> ahead<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.850> route<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:08.090> through

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
gonna go ahead and route this through

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.370 
gonna go ahead and route this through
here<00:03:09.140> there's<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.190> little<00:03:11.050> slot<00:03:12.050> on<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.260> side

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
here there's a little slot on the side

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.220 
here there's a little slot on the side
there<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:12.980> kind<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.430> get<00:03:13.550> this<00:03:13.670> all<00:03:14.000> work<00:03:14.960> down

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
there and kind of get this all work down

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.770 
there and kind of get this all work down
or<00:03:15.560> was<00:03:15.800> it<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.070> other<00:03:19.240> there<00:03:20.240> we<00:03:20.330> go<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.750> now
