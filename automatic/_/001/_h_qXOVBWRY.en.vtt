00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
only have 14% left and health so I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.440

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
again so I won't be able to drive let's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.850 
again so I won't be able to drive let's
let's<00:01:42.960> try<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:45.149> try<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.860> survive

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
let's try to this really try to survive

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.639 
let's try to this really try to survive
here<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:48.780> course<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> helps<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> lot<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
here and of course it helps a lot to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.969 
here and of course it helps a lot to
tilt<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> forward<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.970> backward<00:01:51.360> sometimes

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
tilt it forward and backward sometimes

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.109 
tilt it forward and backward sometimes
so<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.310> don't<00:01:53.610> damage<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.090> vehicle<00:01:54.270> too<00:01:54.750> much

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119
