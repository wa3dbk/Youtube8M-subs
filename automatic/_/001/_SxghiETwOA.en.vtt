00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
for Xbox one is here and what we've done

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.640 
for Xbox one is here and what we've done
is<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.390> order<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.780> make<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.080> happen<00:00:25.320> which<00:00:25.560> we

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
is in order to make this happen which we

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.350 
is in order to make this happen which we
didn't<00:00:25.860> think<00:00:25.980> was<00:00:26.160> initially<00:00:26.430> possible<00:00:27.000> we

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
didn't think was initially possible we

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.150 
didn't think was initially possible we
went<00:00:27.540> ahead<00:00:27.600> and<00:00:27.870> actually<00:00:27.990> built<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.620> virtual

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
went ahead and actually built a virtual

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580 
went ahead and actually built a virtual
360<00:00:30.000> all<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.330> entirely<00:00:30.780> in<00:00:30.990> software<00:00:31.290> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
360 all and entirely in software and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.010 
360 all and entirely in software and
then<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.129> take<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.579> three<00:00:32.790> old<00:00:33.000> 360<00:00:33.510> games<00:00:33.719> put

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
then we take the three old 360 games put

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.389 
then we take the three old 360 games put
them<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.379> emulator<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.160> run<00:00:35.280> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
them in the emulator and then we run it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.680 
them in the emulator and then we run it
through<00:00:35.430> emulation<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.390> really

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
through emulation that's really

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.029 
through emulation that's really
interesting<00:00:37.140> because<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.469> mean<00:00:37.559> that's<00:00:37.739> based

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
interesting because I mean that's based

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.579 
interesting because I mean that's based
on<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.339> original<00:00:38.960> architecture<00:00:42.589> we're

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
on the original architecture we're

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.349 
on the original architecture we're
seeing<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.920> happen<00:00:44.249> right<00:00:44.339> now<00:00:44.429> that<00:00:44.999> behind

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
seeing it happen right now that behind

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.790 
seeing it happen right now that behind
us<00:00:45.480> let's<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.749> we've<00:00:45.899> got<00:00:46.019> Borderlands<00:00:46.649> 4

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.469 
we pulled through and as you can see
this<00:00:57.359> is<00:00:57.569> the<00:00:57.749> 360<00:00:58.260> game<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:59.010> complete<00:00:59.819> and

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
all we did was put it through the

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.739 
all we did was put it through the
emulation<00:01:01.979> program<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:03.089> now<00:01:03.179> I'm<00:01:03.329> playing<00:01:03.569> it

all<00:02:53.940> we<00:02:54.210> do<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.630> take<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:55.770> decide<00:02:56.070> are<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
all we do is take what we decide are the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.040 
all we do is take what we decide are the
right<00:02:56.430> games<00:02:56.700> put<00:02:57.420> them<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.720> through<00:02:57.960> the

program<00:02:58.440> package<00:02:58.980> them<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.340> then<00:02:59.430> we<00:02:59.550> can

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
program package them and then we can

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.190 
program package them and then we can
distribute<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.330> catalog<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.870> really

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
distribute it to the catalog and really

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.680

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
the only thing that stops us is getting

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.970 
the only thing that stops us is getting
the<00:03:03.870> legal<00:03:04.050> permissions<00:03:04.500> for<00:03:04.710> things<00:03:04.890> like
