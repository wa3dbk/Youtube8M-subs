00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
who knows yeah I think it's gotta go a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.399 
who knows yeah I think it's gotta go a
little<00:01:36.030> bit<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.329> I'm<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.049> thinking

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
should go a little bit like that um I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.429 
should go a little bit like that um I
should<00:01:39.659> probably<00:01:39.689> looking<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.320> those

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
