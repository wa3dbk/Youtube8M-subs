00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 hi to all the guys then iphone 5 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.630
 don't mind the bubbles because things 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.160
 I put three cases of how 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.929
 they call repsol and honestly they are 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960
 very disappointed with these cases because 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.240
 I don't like the final effect 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.480
 as I have already said I will be a fool who 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.670
 I could not fix them well but a 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.099
 I do not like in fact ordered of 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.449
 zac hd however I don't want to talk about 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.489
 question make a short video why 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.130
 magnetic on the names of people arc 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.210
 what custody I put and what custody 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.710
 councils premises these was less 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.190
 this vote was recommended to me by me 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.230
 they recommended it to de luigi che 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.789
 I greet and thank you because it was 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.190
 really a great tip we talk about 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.829
 of move it 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.570
 this model is called movie time at 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.600
 let's see the focus a little 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.899
 be there and nothing like that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.480
 housing type is very thin 0.35 mm 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.549
 and gives you the possibility apart from that e 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.850
 semitransparent gives you the possibility of 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.310
 have the iPhone not too big 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.300
 a case, however, too thick and 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.360
 I must say that it has a very good grip and that 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.020
 it is therefore incredibly light 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.590
 do not go to add or thickness or weight 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.720
 to the iPhone 5 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.690
 as this iphone also scratches itself 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.000
 if we study above or if simply 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.030
 if we look at it or read it 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.410
 upwind maybe put the case is 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.080
 a setback to its beautiful design but 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.960
 maybe we avoid taking a shot 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.330
 regarding scratches and things 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.590
 kind without doing who knows who and why 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.120
 however the review of the housing 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.340
 it's not that it can be so long and so 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.590
 detailed I want you to be a little fire 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.130
 vera I want to show maybe more 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.260
 close 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.340
 as you see really very much 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:09.110
 thin and is also very much like saying 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.830
 I don't get the terms 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.590
 this morning is how to take it as it is 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.510
 this pseudo review application 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.540
 really very convenient as well 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.720
 flexible does not go like other cases 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.430
 does not go to engage in a strong way 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.070
 to the iPhone while remaining firm and 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.260
 nothing simply sets 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:38.750
 placing it on one side and then doing 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.910
 pressure from this side here in this 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.410
 so you can see that we always come 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:51.280
 with the focus that goes flush with the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:53.690
 front part and which remains slightly 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.110
 discovered the screen for this is 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.450
 You must then enter at least one 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.709
 film which I then immediately did 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.560
 as you can see the designer does not come 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.720
 let's say ruined a lot because 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.100
 on the other side and I don't know if it really is 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.110
 see you can also see a bit in transparency 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.640
 lamela calculated that the housing 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.830
 on the white iPhone the case 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.200
 transparent is creates an effect 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.810
 definitely better than the black one 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.030
 because you see a lot more the apple ho 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.800
 having seen aldo di luigi non 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.930
 I remember though I must say that 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 actually one of those cases 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.890
 that do not spoil the design much 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.080
 discovered all the part with the doors 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.320
 etc. etc. so we don't have 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.150
 db plug problems the above part also 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.890
 remains uncovered behind is completely 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.310
 covered except of course for the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.860
 camera and nothing this was is not a 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.470
 review we say was just to make you 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.480
 see a little bit how to apply the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.980
 custody and how effectively 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.980
 it is perhaps one of the best 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.800
 solutions to avoid ruining a 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.069
 phone so beautiful but so delicate 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.069
 Hello
