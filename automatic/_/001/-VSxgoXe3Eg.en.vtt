00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
segmented into three sections which are

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.770 
segmented into three sections which are
actually<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:14.939> bit<00:01:15.060> too<00:01:15.299> big<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.630> that's

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you're just going to cut around it now I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.219 
you're just going to cut around it now I
like<00:01:23.520> making<00:01:23.670> mine<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.360> longer<00:01:24.750> or

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229

a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.439> bit<00:01:25.680> wider<00:01:26.070> longer<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.990> tiny

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
a little bit wider longer just a tiny

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
a little bit wider longer just a tiny
bit<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.619> each<00:01:28.860> side<00:01:29.159> because<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.610> feel<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
bit on each side because I feel like it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
bit on each side because I feel like it
helps<00:01:30.540> me<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.780> get<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.470> into<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> corners

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
helps me to get up into the corners

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.440 
helps me to get up into the corners
along<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> molding<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> walls<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
along the molding on the walls and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840 
along the molding on the walls and
whatnot<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> take<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
whatnot so then you take this and you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.410 
whatnot so then you take this and you
simply<00:01:36.119> cut<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.840> out<00:01:37.140> okay<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.909> my

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
simply cut it out okay and then I my

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.100 
simply cut it out okay and then I my
other<00:01:39.600> ones<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.020> actually

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110
