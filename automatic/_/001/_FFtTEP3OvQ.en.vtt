lesser<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:24.900> which<00:00:25.769> still<00:00:26.130> works<00:00:26.310> pretty

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
lesser one which still works pretty

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.540 
lesser one which still works pretty
great<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:28.699> lawn<00:00:29.699> mower<00:00:29.910> outside<00:00:30.859> so<00:00:31.859> what

folks attack - canceled is is a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.440 
folks attack - canceled is is a
technique<00:00:38.910> used<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.629> cancel<00:00:40.440> out<00:00:41.450> unneeded

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
technique used to cancel out unneeded

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.040 
technique used to cancel out unneeded
animation<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.800> example<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> shoryuken<00:00:45.050> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
animation for example a shoryuken you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.610 
animation for example a shoryuken you
can<00:00:46.230> cancel<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.680> those<00:00:47.039> frames<00:00:48.620> which

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
can cancel out those frames which

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
can cancel out those frames which
require<00:00:50.039> two<00:00:50.430> super<00:00:50.940> meters<00:00:52.070> um<00:00:53.570> turn-offs

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
require two super meters um turn-offs

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.319 
require two super meters um turn-offs
done<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:56.579> pretty<00:00:56.789> much<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.090> does

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
done here so pretty much what that does

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.799 
done here so pretty much what that does
is<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.510> interrupts<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:59.940> ending<00:01:00.420> there<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
is that interrupts that ending there the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.119 
is that interrupts that ending there the
shoryuken<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.590> also<00:01:01.739> works<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
shoryuken it also works with the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.649 
shoryuken it also works with the
Hadouken<00:01:02.870> like<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:06.030> complete<00:01:06.450> that

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
Hadouken like that and to complete that

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.780 
Hadouken like that and to complete that
move<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.409> would<00:01:07.530> need<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.920> dash<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
move you would need to dash out of it

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.039 
move you would need to dash out of it
double<00:01:09.510> tapping<00:01:09.689> forward<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:10.560> backward<00:01:11.490> in

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
double tapping forward or backward in

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
double tapping forward or backward in
direction<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> want<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.159> I'll<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
direction you want to go so I'll do that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.730 
direction you want to go so I'll do that
here<00:01:17.060> there<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.119> go<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.350> totally

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
here there you go see it just it totally

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.690 
here there you go see it just it totally
bypasses<00:01:20.159> any<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:23.100> animation

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
bypasses any of that the animation

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.719 
bypasses any of that the animation
leaving<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.630> able<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.740> juggling<00:01:26.220> movies

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
leaving you able to do juggling movies

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.940 
leaving you able to do juggling movies
on<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> opponent<00:01:28.200> while<00:01:28.290> he's<00:01:28.500> defenseless

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
on the opponent while he's defenseless

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.039 
on the opponent while he's defenseless
in<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.250> air<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.790> here's<00:01:30.420> an<00:01:30.540> example<00:01:30.840> right

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
in the air so here's an example right

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.220 
in the air so here's an example right
here

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
here

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.780 
here
that's<00:01:34.230> probably<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.070> easiest<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.760> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that's probably like the easiest one to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.020 
that's probably like the easiest one to
do<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:37.470> then<00:01:37.890> there's<00:01:38.130> also<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.520> fit<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
do and then there's also that fit the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.170 
do and then there's also that fit the
famous<00:01:39.800> sure<00:01:40.800> you<00:01:40.920> came<00:01:41.070> into<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.520> trust<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
famous sure you came into all trust if I

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.000 
famous sure you came into all trust if I
can<00:01:42.300> get<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.540> down

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:57.490 

take<00:01:50.010> some<00:01:50.190> crack<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.120> year<00:01:55.400> there<00:01:56.400> we<00:01:56.490> go

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
take some crack this year there we go

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.710 
take some crack this year there we go
this<00:01:58.500> one's<00:01:58.710> uh<00:01:58.890> oh<00:01:59.220> I<00:01:59.700> miss<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.330> guess<00:02:00.510> I<00:02:00.540> did

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
this one's uh oh I miss it I guess I did

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.910 
this one's uh oh I miss it I guess I did
too<00:02:00.750> early

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.040 

there<00:02:08.920> we<00:02:09.039> go<00:02:09.209> that's<00:02:10.740> one<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:11.920> reuse<00:02:13.050> probably

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
there we go that's one of reuse probably

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.380 
there we go that's one of reuse probably
easiest<00:02:14.560> combos<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.730> do<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.030> most<00:02:16.180> damage

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
easiest combos to do the most damage

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.620 
easiest combos to do the most damage
with<00:02:18.150> now<00:02:19.590> doing<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:22.300> control

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
with now doing this on the the control

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.930 
with now doing this on the the control
the<00:02:22.900> Xbox<00:02:23.260> 360<00:02:23.709> controller<00:02:23.740> is<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> little<00:02:24.820> bit

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
the Xbox 360 controller is a little bit

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.440 
the Xbox 360 controller is a little bit
more<00:02:25.090> difficult<00:02:25.510> because<00:02:27.240> depending<00:02:28.240> on<00:02:28.300> how

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
more difficult because depending on how

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.729 
more difficult because depending on how
you<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.690> your<00:02:28.739> button<00:02:29.739> set<00:02:29.920> up<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:31.739> focused

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
you have your button set up the focused

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.860 
you have your button set up the focused
attack<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.160> hard<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.459> get<00:02:33.550> into<00:02:33.760> after<00:02:34.120> you

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.009 

after<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.140> use<00:02:38.739> -<00:02:38.950> shoryuken<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:40.720> also<00:02:40.840> be

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
after you use - shoryuken can also be

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.140 
after you use - shoryuken can also be
done<00:02:41.170> with<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.380> Hadouken<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.700> don't<00:02:42.850> need<00:02:43.030> to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
done with a Hadouken you don't need to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.030 
done with a Hadouken you don't need to
hit<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.390> target<00:02:43.780> with<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.769> one<00:02:48.010> I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
hit the target with that but this one I

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.970 
hit the target with that but this one I
don't<00:02:48.519> find<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:48.850> useful<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.930> that's<00:02:50.769> all<00:02:50.920> I'm

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
don't find as useful but that's all I'm
