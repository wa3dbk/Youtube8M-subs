00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.100 
here for maybe from the 1970s or maybe
the<00:01:46.740> heyday<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> 1980s<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> would<00:01:48.960> say

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the heyday of the 1980s but I would say

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.940 
the heyday of the 1980s but I would say
that<00:01:49.320> jacket

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that jacket

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.399 
that jacket
let's<00:01:50.399> put<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> side<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.479> most<00:01:52.140> likely

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
let's put to the side and most likely

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.039 
let's put to the side and most likely
that<00:01:52.890> needs<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.340> disappear<00:01:53.549> head<00:01:54.149> off<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
that needs to disappear head off to the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.499 
that needs to disappear head off to the
Salvation<00:01:55.680> Army<00:01:55.799> or<00:01:56.159> goodwill<00:01:56.189> all<00:01:57.180> right<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
Salvation Army or goodwill all right the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.550 
Salvation Army or goodwill all right the
other<00:01:57.540> two<00:01:58.049> jackets

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
other two jackets

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.310 
other two jackets

he's got the pinstripe and the light
brown<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> light<00:02:02.670> brown<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.509> probably

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
brown now the light brown is probably

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.410 
brown now the light brown is probably
going<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> jacket<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.399> which<00:02:05.640> you're<00:02:06.149> not

that's more of a day jacket that's
lighter<00:02:09.060> colors<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:10.050> them<00:02:10.229> during<00:02:10.590> the

let's<00:02:17.520> not<00:02:17.640> really<00:02:18.540> go<00:02:18.720> with<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.930> light-brown

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
let's not really go with the light-brown

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.230 
let's not really go with the light-brown
although<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.130> that's<00:02:20.310> your<00:02:20.490> best<00:02:20.850> fitting

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
although if that's your best fitting

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.570 
although if that's your best fitting
jacket<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.020> it's<00:02:22.590> gonna<00:02:22.710> let's<00:02:23.130> say<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.460> an

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
jacket and it's gonna let's say be an

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
jacket and it's gonna let's say be an
early<00:02:24.150> date<00:02:24.980> maybe<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.400> consider<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.000> but

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
early date maybe you can consider it but

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.880 
early date maybe you can consider it but
I'm<00:02:27.930> gonna<00:02:28.110> lean<00:02:28.410> towards<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.460> pinstripe<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
I'm gonna lean towards the pinstripe and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.350 
I'm gonna lean towards the pinstripe and
normally<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.100> pinstripe<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.820> would<00:02:33.030> say<00:02:33.180> no

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
normally on a pinstripe I would say no

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.650 
normally on a pinstripe I would say no
because<00:02:33.510> pinstripes<00:02:34.320> signify<00:02:35.250> business<00:02:35.820> but

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
because pinstripes signify business but

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.180 
because pinstripes signify business but
it<00:02:36.870> sounds<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.530> very<00:02:37.560> light

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
it sounds like it's a very light

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.580 
it sounds like it's a very light
pinstripe<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.300> if<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.660> pinstripe<00:02:40.200> isn't

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
pinstripe and if that pinstripe isn't

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.900 
pinstripe and if that pinstripe isn't
really<00:02:40.800> jumping<00:02:41.220> out<00:02:41.370> at<00:02:41.580> you

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
really jumping out at you

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.900 
really jumping out at you
it<00:02:42.330> may<00:02:42.780> come<00:02:43.050> across<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.650> most<00:02:43.860> as<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.340> solid

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
it may come across to most as a solid

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.030 
it may come across to most as a solid
darker<00:02:45.810> colored<00:02:46.140> suit<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.530> assuming<00:02:46.920> that

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
darker colored suit so assuming that

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.250 
darker colored suit so assuming that
you've<00:02:47.250> got<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.640> fit<00:02:47.910> right<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.930> style

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
you've got the fit right that the style

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.750 
you've got the fit right that the style
is<00:02:49.530> not<00:02:49.740> landish<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.310> don't<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.520> really

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
is not landish you don't have really

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.640 
is not landish you don't have really
wide<00:02:51.030> lapels<00:02:51.270> or<00:02:51.780> anything<00:02:51.990> like<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.320> and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
wide lapels or anything like that and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.520 
wide lapels or anything like that and
again<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> fit<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.240> good<00:02:54.480> I'm<00:02:55.170> going<00:02:55.470> to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
again that the fit is good I'm going to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.140 
again that the fit is good I'm going to

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
advise you to go with the pinstripe suit

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.660 
advise you to go with the pinstripe suit
