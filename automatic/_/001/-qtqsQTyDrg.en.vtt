00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:22.320
 there is an evil one year ago since 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.310
 we tested a 4k tv for the first time 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.439
 here infolab 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.960
 but our reaction to these images is always 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.060
 the same absolute admiration 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.490
 something else that has changed little since then 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.210
 is the scarcity of content recorded in 4k 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.320
 how are you watching now? 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.719
 for video signals with resolution 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.559
 was smaller than that of the two 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.899
 video game 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.039
 TV processes the image to suit the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
 ultra hd 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.780
 the result is excellent the distance but 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.879
 whoever gets too close to the screen will 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 to notice some defects 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.350
 It may be that the audio from this TV does not 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.239
 impress as much as the 4k 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.100
 but she does a good job for a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.100
 model that hides the speakers 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.150
 before it performed very well on video 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.610
 r 9,000 is an almost flawless smart tv 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.229
 full of applications and fine adjustments 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.030
 audio picture 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.430
 if traditional control was not the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 enough to access so many options 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.950
 TV can also be controlled by 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.950
 gestures 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:34.630
 and by voice commands more apps was the 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.630
 islate siv powder 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.009
 the built-in camera can also be used 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.920
 to sign in to samsung account 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.110
 without having to type semdes until the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.869
 remote control won a futuristic side 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.450
 thanks to a touch- sensitive interface 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.479
 just draw the number on the surface 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.640
 to change channels for example more 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.470
 most practical feature is actually a 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.319
 small independent bar he predicts 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.959
 this long connect that brings together almost all 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.149

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:11.239
 the life of one who has a living room 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.120
 congested by electronics while the 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.459
 content in 4k does not become popularize the sum 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.340
 of R $ 19 thousand will remain a 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.380
 heavy investment but af 1 9 thousand is 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.360
