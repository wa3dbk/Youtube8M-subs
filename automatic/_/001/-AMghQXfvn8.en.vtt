00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.660
 pass the second round so it was 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.480

 Tindouf Towers I manage to hold a short 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.570
 behind him pretty much after bronchi 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.130
 isolates twice I can re doubled 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.750
 in a web so there any public 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.290
 was to encourage me so it's really 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.440

 yeah compared to the other years it's 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.150
 really well finds that the plot there is 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.010
 not bad 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.200
 after his arrival there is a chain 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.910
 there are three different combinations 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.460
 the hawks are not too hard but there are 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.050
 a new and long series no 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.740
 it's not bad even the earth she 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.870
 is not too bad 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.430
 there is now putting it back compared 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.650
 to other years at the shocked camp because if 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.370

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.130
 wake of cisco 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.440
 Well, that's for sure since so far 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.200
 bercy I never shined I did not feel 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.970
 not much I even hurt my warned 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.060
 so this is the first year where 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.670
 I manage to intrigue to roll to the rhythm 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.619
 one of the best what so that's true 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.759
 that my moment is a great memory 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.180
 for now it's the best Breton 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.040
 after there is jason and the session there we 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.489

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.440
 no it goes well and there is a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.140
 good young atmosphere and costs the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.519
 correction of my base is great 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.099
 to be we are the only brothers 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.760
 crossed this year so it's nice 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:41.910
 but hey he's there they do not arrive 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.900
 spend the evening program but hey 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.940
 after at the same time he did not 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.640
 the training that I have now 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.870
 he's a little he's working beside he 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.830
 can not do everything and already what he 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.830
 done is already a lot 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.720
 yes this year I managed 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.280
 all alone after the adventurous jesse 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.390
 where I spent two years and bruno it was 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.850
 really it went very well 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.800
 today he is still always the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.850
 given form some little tips but I 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.860
 always show a little bit with 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.320
 him and so on but no it's me who 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.180
 manages alone who manages my life from my 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.340
 small structure and I want to thank 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.230

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.430

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.220

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.810
 the six towers europe supercross and 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.610

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.200
 Germany who will have me there I do that 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.310

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.730
