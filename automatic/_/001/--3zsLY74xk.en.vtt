00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.560
 two 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.330
 ah 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.300
 to 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.920
 do not 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.920
 yes 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.450
 this is the river that fills us was realized 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.030
 in a stage of transition in the cinema 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.520
 global the film was dying the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.280
 digital was starting as an option 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.350
 quite interesting we see the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.620
 movie with a format camera 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.910
 digital in a photography camera that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.900
 it allowed us to make high-quality videos 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.670
 definition with a cinema lens for 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.680
 be able to have the field opportunity that 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.360
 We were looking for additionally think I'm going to do 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.830
 a movie from a camera and to the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.140
 principle seemed like a super crazy option 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.180
 but then we saw that he had great 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.940
 advantages at that time the proposal 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.770
 photography came to condense in a 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.450
 premise that was that we wanted 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.180
 that the camera and the light change 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.890
 according to Jorge's trip and the movie 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.170
 has three very marked moments that are 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.130
 removed the Ecuadorian garrison and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.560
 when you read in Peru then 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.270
 we build the aesthetics and look of the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.229
 movie according to those three moments 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:37.840
 and we started with a camera rather 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:40.000
 classic fixed tripod after he goes 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.159
 to the jungle and we decided to go by the 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.490
 camera on his shoulder and he gets to be in 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.590
 Peru again the proposal changed a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.360
 little and we wanted to pick up a maybe what 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.670
 mix both languages ​​that we had 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.330
 had because he also starts to 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.930
 change us 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.930
 nothing 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.190
 it's nobody
