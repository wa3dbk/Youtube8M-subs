00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.910
 so welcome to a new one 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.580
 video of sugar android DE we want 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.830
 Get closer to the hui p6 today 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.859
 bring and, more precisely, a few 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.390
 Problem where the device brings 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.680
 ansich we already know from the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.789
 television advertising or even out 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 information from the internet 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.130
 that the device is pretty well equipped 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.500
 is it has a 10 5 ghz quad-core 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.309
 processor an ips hd screen 2 gb ram 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.570
 and you should actually order one 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.940
 The whole thing should then play 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.590
 pretty good but see that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.190
 that is not really the case 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.480
 because even though the raw performance exists 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.260
 is the device initiates 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.690
 have translation problems and moreover 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.469
 Some developers do not have their games yet 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.870
 adapted for the chipset the k 3 v 2 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:05.270
 from the house of cuba but we are only looking 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.270
 times a tutor on so 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.070
 at an tut will be synonymous then 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.189
 notice the phenomenon that just 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.700
 should have spoken here 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:25.460
 because the device tends in a fairly short time 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.009
 time to heat up very much what 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.420
 presumably save on the housing is because 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:35.539
 the hubi 6 is only 61 8 millimeters 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.369
 Thick so it is kept fairly compact 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.259
 even the aluminum housing makes you 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.509
 very high quality impression the whole 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.360
 but brings nothing at all if 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.310
 the process is not enough for him 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.340
 can derive waste heat and 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.709
 must clock down accordingly 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.509
 is too hot then is then the 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:58.220
 whole fun of the quad core processor 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.750
 there even if the k3 v2 is not a high end 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.649
 chipset he is now with one 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.860
 snapdragon s4 or a snapdragon 600 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.140
 or 800 could keep up with it 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.399
 quite enough for current and 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.630
 probably also most of the coming ones 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.940
 to be able to theoretically create a game 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.989
 even in comparison turbo 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.060
 benchmark seen that the device is one 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.400
 So gpu has a graphics chip 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.959
 faster than the tkg ship set 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:35.299
 in the example evonik has power he 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.620
 So enough available but I'm waiting 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.650
 still insisting that this is great 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.100
 Overheating message comes as we do 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.200
 know 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:48.079
 The lake was in for effect as well 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.829
 the device should not have the device 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.030
 stop them from owning soon 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.670
 now we do have a go just yet 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.519
 because that is something I for android 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.100
 have never seen it before 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.810
 really a pop up message with the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.260
 message that the device is getting too hot 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.150
 and you run the application my 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.799
 fall here is that the request nevertheless 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:16.670
 then the stuff should really end 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.580
 from a technical problem and whether 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.280
 something by software 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.100
 optimization by huber 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.690
 I have strong doubts about that 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.980
 So you could really do it so hard 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.680
 sounds more like a misconstruction 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.350
 Talking about the device you would have some 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.690
 design details probably reconsider precisely 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:42.040
 should be as you see now, for example 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.250
 the frames per second where the back 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.960
 are faded in the vp 6 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.540
 not that bad and that too 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.090
 Result as you will see immediately is 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.950
 quite presentable from there is the whole 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.900
 really pretty stupid because of 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.890
 that would be a very interesting 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.680
 product above all the surface 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.820
 is very successful offers useful 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.920
 features like a real one's land 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.709
 asks which app can access what 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.160
 and here we already see 13,400 13 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.170
 Points 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.859
 that is really not bad and can 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.859
 be truly proud 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.040
 and now we're going to do it again 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.580
 that was the device to his 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.580
 bring limits
