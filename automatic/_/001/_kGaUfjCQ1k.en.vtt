00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.010
 hi today i teach you the dead command 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.050
 for the dog this is one of those 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.810
 exercises that gratify us more than the 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.169
 dog but that nevertheless enriches his 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.210
 heritage of experiences and helps him to 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.800
 solve a problem to receive a 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:37.360
 prize the dead command passes from the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.360
 command sitting I ask the dog to land 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.449
 then he went over with the bite above his nose 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:53.570
 of the dead dog and I wait for the dog to 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:58.089
 I lay you down I show you one more 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:03.019
 time the cav is lying on the ground 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:05.089
 he ran his hand over his nose looking like that 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.650
 the dog lies down here in this case has 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:16.120
 did something else he did on the roll 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:21.410
 down dead dead 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.960
 this is the dead command is a profit 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.090
 exercise also because it focuses 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.590
 the dog's attention on our hands 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.230
 dead and allows him to trust 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.270
 even when we push it to the ground 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.550
 which is not a position exactly 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.800
 comfortable for our dog because it is 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.690
 however an act of trust because 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.320
 when the dog is lying on the ground and 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.330
 presents the belly is in a situation 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.340
 of total reliance with the 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.140
 owner 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.820
 I hope I have been helpful hello a 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.820
