00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello all and all that such as 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.009
 We are welcome to one that I employed 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.200
 for textile 4 this time I bring you 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.719
 a gameplay like that as a guide like the 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.669
 previous I had brought and well let's go 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.630
 to talk about a new weapon of course 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:20.600
 let's talk about the sar 21 this rifle 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.850
 of assault of the assault class of 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.490
 doctor logically what good is the 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.650
 fourth in unlocking headquarters of this class 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.800
 of weapons we already know that we started with the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.230
 here 12 then we will unblock Ã£ scar hy 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.929
 then the one of the m 4 16 and then you are at 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.210
 21 and well now let's see a little 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.280
 accessories as it is embodied in the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.469
 game in terms of stability accuracy 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.079
 edge that we put the bars these and 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.120
 you know and good since in this accessory 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.879
 just put the look for two we're going to 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.859
 put it though now it does not take it and good 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.469
 we have removed the little things to see how 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.909
 you see there is very very stable weapon already 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.039
 I say it has very little cadence what 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.449
 I will comment now it is very very stable 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.359
 so good me in the canyon os 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.820
 I recommend that being so stable 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.800
 you put the pipe a heavy that good 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.790
 will subtract some stability as you see 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.110
 there enough 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.810
 but precision and good will be added 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.580
 to combat that loss of stability 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.200
 what we can do is put a handle 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.240
 at an angle that would go up a bit 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.760
 stability or if you do not put the handle 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.100
 gross 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.160
 that will add a little more precision 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.280
 even preserving the stability of the 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.610
 heavy cannon penalty that's what 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.130
 just at your choice I am both 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.740
 configurations that I would recommend 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.680
 Heavy cannon always to add 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.920
 precision and then the ssa angled to 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.410
 keep some stability or the ssa 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.580
 of potato to add a tad more than 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.020
 precision even to the heavy barrel the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.060
 truth is that I tell you it's both 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.890
 configurations that I recommend because 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.729
 good is a very stable weapon has a 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.710
 very low cadence are 600 bullets per 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.130
 minute those who have this weapon that 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.170
 It really is the lowest rate of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.300
 this kind of assault rifles even 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.990
 below the carache that has 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.820
 620 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.550
 and what good courts to look for action 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.690
 more damage than any other rifle like that 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.670
 How good I say are the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.260
 configurations that I recommend that if 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.940
 there is a heavy one I recommend you to put it 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.340
 forever 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.070
 and well it said has 600 bullets 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.140
 minute is a very low nilva cadence the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.300
 lowest of the class has modes of 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.460
 single shot and full auto this weapon 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.470
 has no burst mode, either 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.570
 you need because another one is very very stable 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.760
 and in full auto mode you can leave the 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.460
 pressed trigger they're going to go almost 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.650
 all the bullets to the target is the good thing 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.740
 what it has to have to be very stable and 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.720
 have little cadence is very very manageable 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.720
 but his family has not really gone away 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.630
 wrong with them there are much better weapons in 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.850
 this class of course for me but 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.980
 good the times that the used that 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.680
 well it has been enough I think it's my 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.330
 second common weapon with more casualties because 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.680
 uses a lot when you unlock 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.260
 because good the truth I tell you is very 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.610
 stable is very easy to handle that yes to 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.650
 short distance so good if you 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.290
 you find the case things like that 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.530
 is really fucked again short 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.490
 distance but it already takes you half a long 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.890
 it's very, very good 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.460
 and well already speaking the damage is a typical 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.440
 25 damage until low until 18 the 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.450
 typical damage from assault rifles 18 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.600
 50 meter match is kept there in the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.810
 18 the charger is also typical of 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.959
 30 plus one 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.010
 the recharge here yes that good could be 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.010
 I think a tad more 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.940
 shorter but good to have little 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.909
 cadence the ammunition management is 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.830
 quite is quite easy 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.519
 the recharge with bullets in the charger are 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.980
 23 seconds and no bullets in the charger 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.940
 totally empty are 34 you see that goes up 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.460
 a second and a tenth plus taking no 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.350
 having bullets in the charger 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.470
 and good as far as the recoil the truth 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.250
 is that it is very manageable also has 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:17.060
 0.2 on each left and right side and the 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.900
 vertical recoil is 0 18 increasing 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.609
 in the first shot 18 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.040
 so good the truth is that ya 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.110
 I say is a very handy weapon very 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.370
 stable has little cadence so 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.979
 the recoil is very very manageable and 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.460
 I say it will not be the best weapon but yes that 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.370
 It is very easy to use 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.120
 and well nothing up here is this 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.680
 gameplay is this game and I do not know if 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.740
 You want me 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.690
 to speak in some upcoming video like that 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.129
 love of her from some specific weapon 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.259
 then leave it in the comments 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.089
 and we have said nothing I hope that it has 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.800
 liked and see you in the next the 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.509
 videos l'express whatever friends a 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.349
 I greet everyone and see you guys later 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.349
 goodbye
