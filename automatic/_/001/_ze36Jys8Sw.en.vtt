00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello there are ideas for you again 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.259
 the editorial 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.830
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.830
 look at 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.599
 I'll show you the basic pattern now 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.939
 I just show you the basic pattern 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.890
 in two different colors and indeed 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.890
 Can you change the color at the end of 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.309
 show off 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.500
 then a kind of herringbone pattern is created 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.020
 If you take him at the beginning of the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.550
 row in front of a clear 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.610
 I show it at the end of the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.300
 Now this additional air mesh 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.120
 you need to change already with 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:00.620
 work the new color and then how 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.620
 crochet as usual 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.510
 the journey also with this color 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.510
 work 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:11.350
 and the color change again in yellow 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:11.350
 work and travel 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.260
 you can be beautiful now 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.750
 recognize how these stripes 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.750
 alternate these vertical and sometimes the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:01.140
 yellow rides and malta or rides 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:03.060
 above is Tunisian crocheting there 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.650
 there are many different patterns 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.750
 the possibilities are infinite to whom 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.700
 this topic is of interest to ours 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.880
 visit facebook group 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:21.780
 that means crocheting or stretching Tunisian 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.470
 There are many ideas for this 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.470
 theme 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.000
 and so on then always one way 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.170
 and a return trip with the same 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.170
 thread work 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.030
