00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.950
 in the men quote this the oil of 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.930
 shower that is actually an oil that 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.760
 in contact with the water it becomes like 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.500
 Accredited as twins and whitish 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.030
 although I do not really know anything white and 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.100
 I bought it more than what I do so 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.780
 How about the smell because it is that 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.810
 it's my favorite line is that we can not 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.259
 it's a smell it's amazing I love this 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.759
 smell and I like it so much that I buy this 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.499
 super packet that is to fill the 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.589
 another and here it takes half a liter of 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:34.469
 product if already half a liter of the product 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.870
 and here it takes 250 milliliters every 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.480
 constituted three cans of these and wash 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.039
 of filling there is a smell the only thing that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.600
 I do not feel that they persist in the skin 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.219
 very good indeed it is therefore if 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.090
 applied a moisturizer and such as 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.090
 it's not from the same line though because 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.590
 to do this 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.790
 on the skin but at the time of 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:04.470
 shower is like that makes you enjoy 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:07.300
 very much and I have some things before 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.220
 teach them the first one would be this 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.220
 lipstick of the collection 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.440
 that is easy so there are in places 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.020
 pretty truth and enzymes and rough mucus the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.000
 I really like it a lot 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:27.670
 the father appreciate but yes and is super 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.640
 super super subtle 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.409
 it is a very beautiful organ that for the day 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.060
 a day I love there was another color that 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.320
 also that I loved it but when 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.270
 I went to buy in the returned state 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.149
 exhausted then said that this did not come 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.590
 I also like it a lot and it is not 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.229
 or if behind the collections that 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.399
 coming out that is this month is 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.320
 as after you can stop pulling 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.420
 collections that I'm going to ruin but 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.170
 I bought this shadow that is very pretty 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:57.600
 that is the buff is velux ppl and it is because it is 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.600
 of the style of the dress 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.360
 It is very clarita 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.360
 I see it as well as to illuminate 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.610
 the princess who is very rosita clarita 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.680
 that I think it 's all about is to use 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.870
 illuminator in the face and finally I 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.250
 take this pigment pressed call 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.570
 black grade 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:25.200
 what is wonderful is that these 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:28.480
 products has a texture a shine in 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:34.480
 the eyes with this color I think 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.220
 precious indeed if convinced that I will 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.190
 to do tonight is that I think 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.090
 precious and now let's move on to the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.910
 little things already from the cinema collection candles 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.860
 without seeing in Cinderella 3 good the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.590
 grace is that when I saw that collection 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.040
 it was how I need everything is that I 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.350
 like everything is that I want everything is everything 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.910
 precious degrease towards you that neither 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.989
 I do not even know if there has been a collection 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.989
 of mac that said 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.420
 I want everything because I usually bought myself 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.760
 something like to have a thing of 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.950
 each collection but it is that this is 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.470
 that everything is good and I'm going to start 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.720
 for example with the labial the labial is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:21.620
 the one I'm wearing right now is in the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:25.690
 royal bank tone is good today and is a 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.700
 rosita the most natural thing in the world 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.290
 that really is that the hand I do not know if 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.740
 you are going to see what I carry in the 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.740
 lips 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:45.870
 and accepted the brightness over the limits 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.870
 what is the tone 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:54.000
 A) Yes 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:58.080
 the ever after debris and is with thousands 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.370
 of flashes in blue of facts that 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.380
 they see the flashes in beige blue 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.960
 there's like you take just a little blue 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.560
 I hope you can see it because 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.560
 the truth is that it is 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.799
 these products products together I 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:23.690
 they seem ideal and others that also very 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.690
 nice but for pinoso 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.900
 physically he knows it as happy 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.129
 look at them and this one already discusses yes that is a 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.029
 dust and learner 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:39.679
 it's like that and it has a lot a lot of 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:39.679
 glitter particles 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.510
 good better on the finger 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.099
 is that the skin has not been noticed here yes 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:01.740
 but the truth is that it's cute and that 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:04.910
 It has a lot of particles 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.910
 of principles 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.289
 it's terrific great very much now 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.479
 that summer is coming I do not know if I 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.310
 I would put it all over my face but in 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.530
 I no longer have any problem with winter 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.020
 bring your well-lit face this way 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.560
 thing I bought it out of curiosity that is the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.460
 athlete in the study calculations that in 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.280
 theory because this is like giving you a 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.880
 as if with gloss eye but 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.840
 I really did not know that this thing was going 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.970
 to be so sticky if it's that when 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.970
 they brought the finger 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:54.460
 super sticky and it's really nice 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.460
 but 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.250
 I had to wash my hands five times 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.250
 to remove everything from them 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:12.360
 has many but the truth is that since 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:14.400
 two days ago I tried all the rest 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.300
 of things that I have tried all but this 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.810
 not because I did not see the moment of 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.039
 I try it because it makes me very curious 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.900
 but when I believe that the only 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.370
 product that could not have 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.409
 bought that they will charge two to nine 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.770
 victims did not have their fixed line 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:33.560
 desired 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.330
 in the competition or we go to my caring 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.340
 this collection arrived and online I was 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.560
 all exhausted also then I the 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.500
 conselleria my sister barcelona but 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.120
 that I could not see things burned me 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.099
 for all the others that people went up and 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.139
 everything and finally I think that one of the 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:51.560
 the prettiest things the collection has 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:53.720
 is the palette has six shadows that do not 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.389
 I know if they are of the fixed ideal or not because 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:00.289
 example the omega I do that I already have 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:01.909
 from the friend who said the number you're going to 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.190
 red doing them a lot so the 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:05.870
 I have normal but good the truth is that 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.449
 the rest of the shadows seemed to me 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.650
 precious then I did not care that 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:11.960
 was repeated because it is also 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.940
 good is that liked and like everything 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.520
 the eyelid mobile and I think a shadow 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.259
 precious and you look at facts that 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.720
 they are quite natural colors that 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.580
 I hope you can talk well I'm here 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.530
 is a white one that I like a lot 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.169
 to illuminate the eye of the eyebrow is by 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.690
 the tear looks beautiful to me then 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:32.659
 is there are both for transitions 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.490
 are they are perfect then this is 

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:36.259
 the seat and everything and this is a black woman 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.569
 I do not know if they can be appreciated but 

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:40.789
 it has as a few described a tad red 

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:42.139
 and the truth is that it is the collection that 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:44.000
 I liked all the connections 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:45.740
 seen as turned a little crazy buying 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.139
 that collection but it's that has 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.000
 delighted everyone and the leader is here 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:53.860
 and I hope you liked it and see you 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.860
 in the next thanks for watching me
