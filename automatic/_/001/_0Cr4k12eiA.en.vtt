00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:12.179
 please wait much a click 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.809
 yes it was the same figure since then 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.250
 you will have to call the number I will be common 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.279
 sir not from us of the exact common 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.890
 because it's not a trophy you're not shoulder 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.800
 the telephone pole is the line 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.309
 telephone line on the wires of the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.350
 bottom we do not mind they threw not 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.440
 it is a problem the clash goes from the municipality 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.719
 flower then call to them which expired 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.930
 interrupted the telephone line there 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 think of the common and of keyboards this 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.489
 sorry but who told you the line 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.239
 phone belongs to whom to take to 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:57.350
 home the municipality of roma not always nothing 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:00.480
 with the various telephone numbers and it is not yours 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.480
 your tarabella telecom will not be that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.309
 long live the rented service 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.170
 you met working telecom that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.470
 technically manages this line 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 I don't know it seems we can't go out 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.979
 to fix the foul he will have to go out 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.270
 those from the very common the municipality does not 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.020
 has nothing to do with those evils 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.570
 economy 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.400
 now the institutional phone seen 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.320
 that to vote but we cannot wait 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.670
 that the pole falls because the interior does not 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.930
 more features today spoke curiosity 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.299
 who told them this thing 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.290
 the municipality of Rome whose telephone numbers 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.320
 with light poles 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.979
 ok like that when i left it in 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.990
 waiting for what we have to clear them 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.290
 say he asked door did not say 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.909
 this thing that is not your problem 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.500
 I misunderstood 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.130
 sorry but clean with quarrels with 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.380
 of alitalia from abroad here therefore 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.500
 evidently he is responding from 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.150
 Romania 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.460
 I don't think he wants to start like 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.340
 the laws in Italy work if you 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.650
 breaks the gas pipe is not that we are the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.610
 common that I love the company that runs the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.930
 gas 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.760
 if there is a problem with the light pole 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.840
 let's give the company and the light pole 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.590
 we give the company that manages 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.450
 electricity 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.220
 if there is a problem with the telephone pole 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.380
 we are the company that manages the phone 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.720
 it is not that the municipality of Rome manages 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.920
 they too therefore the municipality that has to do with it 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.660
 excuse foreigners for fastweb then 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.040
 eventually I have to make a complaint 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.480
 of software through your response 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.540
 so to be a little disappointed 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.850
 husband said this remains to the project 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.410
 the whole defense can't do anything yes 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.030
 it is understood but you are giving yourself a 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.040
 service I'm telling you it's going to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.989
 drop the phone phone pole with 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.420
 some telephone wires so 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.940
 someone has to fix the pole first 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.040
 which otherwise falls apart over 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.650
 doing damage the pole will go away the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.660
 line however having to intervene engines 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.790
 or the company that manages from which then 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.780
 restore the problem but certainly not 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.780
 the municipality of Rome 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.640
 however, the seizure was the fig 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.640
 I did n't jump anymore but I have to call 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.950
 just nothing useless that repeats me of 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.640
 call the municipality the municipality is saying 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.430
 of Rome should not be that a 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.340
 let's start this by doing this 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.799
 I understand you only as referents 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.760
 so I can't call anyone else e 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.230
 I say she tells me I have to 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.000
 call someone the common why 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.120
 common not 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.290
 nothing in Italy with the telephone pole 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.360
 so that she tells me she can't do 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.060
 nothing to report 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.620
 I'm telling you as a fastweb customer 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.720
 to make a report he wants in 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.600
 consideration of the low face one 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.670
 reporting for what I'm doing 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.830
 ok now i still have to treat this 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.900
 called our paper zaia said 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.010
 I don't believe this problem anyway 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.170
 that to see what i 'm doing 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.520
 protesting against fastweb 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.890
 so I wish you would do now 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.340
 a report from a customer 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.650
 who is complaining about the service not 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.350
 went down to the clubs because what 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.930
 lady the only real one therefore must open a 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.820
 claim to find out what the lidio feels 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:37.380
 nothing and then also gives me the number of the 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:42.900
 generation like that romeo the number of 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:45.090
 what but I think he wants clarified then 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.380
 then he tells me the report number 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.890
 that open practice role if I want 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:56.280
 be sure the ball came yes 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.229

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.250
 customer declaims against 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.250
 password service 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:28.860
 and since it is rejected 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:32.330
 rejected an intervention request for 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.970
 a telephone pole about to fall 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:46.650
 for a foul phone pole that is 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:49.740
 to fall if it is returned to the municipality 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:55.250
 of Rome and makes one think that comes from a 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.250
 breath to the municipality of Rome 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:16.750

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.750
