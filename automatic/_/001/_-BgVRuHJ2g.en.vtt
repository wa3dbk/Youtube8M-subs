00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.320
 hello everyone in today's video like 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.360
 you see in the title it's going to be super 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.020
 quickie but it's to show you how I 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.380
 I apply the sensual kevin skin 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.380
 aucoin 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.689
 kevin or how much 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.540
 whatever is 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.309
 that is good has brought patri de de 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.680
 new york I do not know how to say I do not know exactly 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.110
 I think that when you change about 35 euros 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.850
 approximately 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.180
 come 18 grams and well then the texture 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.180
 is 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.100
 It reminds me of the first passion of the two 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.580
 face I had to be a good white more or 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.240
 less is a texture as well as very very 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.240
 as very light but has a coverage 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 brutal 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.289
 and good thing is that I have been told that in 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.659
 crazy Spain to find up to 60 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.569
 euros that a barbarity 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.579
 so nothing I do not know what to tell you is the one 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.520
 I case I bought it in a store what 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.039
 I'm reading on your blog it seems to me that 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.420
 online I do not know how to investigate a bit because 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:31.030
 maybe what you find 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.799
 a post from a long time ago of her 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.860
 I saw that he mixed it and it's a little 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.110
 application that I do and good is 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.399
 I just put on a loop and you 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.200
 I leave the others in makeup so that 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.939
 see the type of coverage that has more 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.259
 or less I put on the eyecup and a 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.630
 little bit this area here that's where 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.399
 I have more redness always so 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.039
 nothing if you want to see a little 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.530
 explanation and how it is then we are left to 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.680
 see it well then well with the skin more 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.689
 natural every wash that I notice more 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.760
 dark circles and imperfections over 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.970
 all dark circles because 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.870
 it's night and it's when I worse here 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.920
 I see it's when I get home 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.780
 let's see how I use it as 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.080
 I am using myself that as you know me 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.380
 you asked but I really have 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.320
 read the makeup reviews are more or 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.730
 less as I'm doing the sensual 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.680
 skin of kevin aucoin kevin or how in 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.250
 serious all my life I've always done that 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.350
 came coin I have the tone s x 05 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.930
 and what I do is mix it with the 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.480
 mineral ice concealer and I use the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.210
 tone nw 20 I do not know if you are going to see it is 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.540
 very tiny 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.670
 what I do is deposit a bit of 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.790
 product that the hand for the back of the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.790
 hand 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.270
 and now with a brush to blur this 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.880
 is of evans and titles but not any 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.890
 brush so it has to blur from 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.220
 little hairs loose as you see is a 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.420
 cream texture totally simply 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.420
 he supported the brush 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:17.210
 with very little amount of enough 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.210
 that little bit and I mix my hand 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.190
 and I 'm going to apply it as if I were 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.190
 blurring on the skin 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.790
 I work it pretty well because despite 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.730
 of being mixed with the mineral ice 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.140
 it really is a super fatty product 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.930
 so I want to blur it well for 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.860
 that does not generate folds afterwards 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.860
 long day and so on 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.130
 and well in this way you can see the 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.520
 difference to me the mineral there is only no 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.470
 it makes me absolutely nothing does not bring me 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.270
 no type of coverage and you see that 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.370
 good are going a little bit even 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.610
 towards the cheek that is usually my zone 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.140
 with more redness and is that you have seen the 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.800
 amount of host products that is 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.830
 very little 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.670
 and you can see it 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.830
 the difference totally from one eye to 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.720
 another great little what I wanted to show you 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.640
 that has a great coverage 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.800
 then it is a product that is very expensive 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.570
 I thank my patrimono friend has 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.070
 brought from new york because if not here 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.890
 in spain I think it's a 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.600
 barbarity devote so nothing 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.390
 I just wanted to make you this 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.310
 demonstration since as I tell you I 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.800
 you asked for instagram as soon as 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.190
 Did you see the photo you said please? 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.190
 as he likes it is really I have three 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.920
 uses because I already tell you I just had it 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.290
 give or that is not given me to prove it 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.790
 a lot does not generate me folds along 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.070
 of the day although you know that I always 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.280
 tinged the eyecup for my skin type that 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.440
 It is a tendency to fat and little more than 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.330
 say any questions you ask me 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.400
 you know it takes a little while to answer 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.840
 generally are looking for a while the 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.400
 Sundays but not every Sunday 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.410
 find a time to answer the 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.790
 comments if not then you can 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.620
 write an email that is a little 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.920
 more attentively by instagram mind in your 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.330
 always answer at the moment but good 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.409
 whether you have the product as always 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.419
 I tell you tell me 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.979
 our experience how you use it 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:16.499
 you and well then any doubt 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:18.389
 I'll wait to solve it because as 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:21.409
 I tell you I am testing the product and not 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:23.699
 I know very well if I'm going to know how to respond 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.279
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:30.239
 this comparison to the terminal 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:33.360
 make up and I'm going to record a couple of 

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:35.840
 things more and nothing else no more we see the 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.810
 next video 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:44.320
 well then with the most natural skin 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.320
 I will use them as I will use
