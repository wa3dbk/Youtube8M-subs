00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.929
 experience dangerous adventures 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.790
 I have to ask why it is 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.160
 could be so incredibly mannered yet 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.559

 thumb is 10,000 kilometers what 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.570
 How long have you been there? 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.129
 new on the way so if you are now 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.420
 Full throttle would drive all the time and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.859
 the easiest route would choose if 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.789
 Maybe in two weeks though 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.469
 Of course we also want one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.120
 see something and then drive 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.710
 a few detours and think three 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.380
 come weeks as well as I want now 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.450

 you because about Tajikistan one short 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.600
 summarized in three sentences 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.939
 Tajikistan is the highest 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 land of the world it is quite far away 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.640
 nobody knows that is light north of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.200
 afghanistan and west of china yes he 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.270
 is there to say yes you have 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.000
 already prepared google 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.150
 earth looked up or big in the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.520
 national language still occupies national language 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.970
 not google that is definitely in demand 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.710
 been 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.170
 we know that about the last 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.549
 4000 kilometers of gravel road are the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.070
 is our preparation so far 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.689
 but you do not just make fun 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.329
 because he be completely crazy because or 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.280
 but you also collect donations 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.350
 go the exact for Vienna is that one 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.119
 collect donations before you start 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.649
 for the Hansel and Gretel Foundation 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.259
 ensures that children are not lost 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.579
 go and for habitat for humanity the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.619
 also on the spot in tajikistan 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.540
 implement projects for clean 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.280
 drinking water and so on and ours 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.899
 cars or all cars arriving there 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.729
 All rally teams will be on site 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.290
 also auctioned for the good cause 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.240
 that means I can feel fine 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.190
 imagine 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.380
 would not mind if 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.840
 there are still donors and sponsors reporting 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.760
 which is definitely what we are looking for 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.530
 even a car actually work in the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.510
 the moment we are three and a half cars 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.940
 yes eight people around one like half 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.550
 just that has only 60 euros cost of 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.380
 Outbreak is missing the doors do not close 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.290
 a dent in the roof and the brake pipe 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.970
 is therefore to seven one author we 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.630
 want to drive 10,000 kilometers us 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.850
 come 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.350
 So if someone wants to support it 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.090
 then you should always be on your website 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.080
 namely the following addresses 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.540
 www.hotel.de there you can of course 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.010
 also during the race on the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.410
 stay running and have fun once 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.450
 stranded since but i hope you 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.980
 maybe you'll be on the way then 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.870
 Report again or in any case 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.490
 then I would probably prepare 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.050
 come back to visit his room 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.100
 to tell more or make up 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.930

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.260
