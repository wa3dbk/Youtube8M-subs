00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.410

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.820
 my 27 a magazine with system 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.920
 team positions pull power and 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.469
 my coworkers want the first 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.279
 block spirit toughness tactics and mask 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.369
 a nice primary grenade itself 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:23.600
 splinter grenade calls so on this 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.820

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.609
 first time played where is 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.349
 was called black ops 23 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.800
 what a great rein should that really be 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.620
 his 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.809
 I do not think so but that was easy 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.379
 my first map I said where 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.649
 black ops 2 the beast came out and got there 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.809
 also the one or other nice celebration on 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.079
 start gave one or the other could 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.670
 maybe remember all about it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.140
 there which I had in there 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.719
 this four helicopter radio-controlled 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.079
 damn thing that flies around d'antoni 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.870
 copter and brightest or somehow a 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.420
 rigmarole 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.340
 I know if there is always a case I have 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.619
 now completely thought quite you have to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.740
 I just thought of moss I pack 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.409
 just today as a little tidbit one 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.790
 the ton helicopter download store and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.610
 how awesome a really nice one 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.240
 shitty absurd someone so actually 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.350
 new 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.939
 you can play them but you never have to 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:34.920
 and of course higher subscriptions 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.030
 I'm starting one or the other 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.530
 maybe know is reached 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.290
 actually his dinger or me 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.850
 try it as connystark but well well so 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 I could say a little bit now that is 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.240
 the cancellations would have been planned 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.729
 tour but the happened to be in it with yes 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.700
 my team can so to speak so 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.380
 they do not have the round before 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:01.710
 deducted until the last have 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.960
 dingens vital unity and hôpital 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.880
 picture you sneaked out that you can 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.530
 do not imagine I have me 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.090
 then looked at it three times 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.600
 every round had the same shit 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.090
 written on the start so harmless 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.380
 yes I want your lobby because I want 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.060
 I also know how to win 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.310
 and there they invited us in the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.860
 ficc skin makes babbelt quite funny 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.930
 Colleagues and here we are 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.180
 first round that all first down yes 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.030
 and since now we have fresh 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:41.459
 chosen because with my on 27 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.680
 buckles made then died harmony 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.060
 seen a lot but what we see now 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.190
 is the mp 7 with magazine extension 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.610
 at least no matter I sat globally 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.940
 simple and he had thought with that 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.010
 Things are not getting better, well, look 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.140
 we and you have already heard it or 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.090
 seen friendly orbital satellite at 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.750
 diesel that means left this 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.790
 funny red things are the enemies 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.769
 and then he becomes very happy 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.560
 So in my opinion appear in 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.850
 basement ball away for arms but hey 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.890
 cleans 20 and yes well his song out 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.420
 then you are right on a map 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.090
 It's so rough here I had to 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.700
 actually be part of it and me 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.880
 ' m a win that I equal to 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.320
 have made an advantage yes that 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.340
 one or another kill had studied 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.340
 before everyone has already done 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.940
 just as God wanted then I have 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.769
 then after one or the other fan 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.709
 my great nice new graduation 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.440
 achieved and indeed the donnelley copter 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.880
 if the mails somewhere 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.299
 then he can find the cash register 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.239
 because first of all , according to the pace of 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.769
 You have to have pop and then yes 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.250
 the hottest hiding chosen by 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.630
 everything and the beast cut out like that 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.880
 that actually has to wait until 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.709
 who can kill one or the other 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.780
 you have to take one you can 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.900
 thereby also any marks of 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.840
 or exit colleagues 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.479
 or you are aggressive and 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.020
 Destroyed enemies so much 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.870
 that then a horny woodstock 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.410
 or is it never reached grass as standing 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.419
 actually never have where is mine 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.979
 First of all you can get over it 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.090
 happy and the vita unit also clear 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.000
 and I have to think about that first 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.810
 I use the 54 for the key 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.789
 a help then he is the 3 but 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.110
 since I block myself with 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.350
 a mobile scheiß copperfield previously 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.780
 Issues whether the mast magath makes it is 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.260
 naturally rather not beneficial and 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.830
 Immediately set that's just easy 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.490
 there 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.560
 what would like to cut at this beautiful 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.919
 it could just be that 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.199
 yes, just do not hit anything because the 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.729
 Web simple and effective is just like 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.370
 My darling hides what then fully 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.630
 in osch goes or will be like 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.270
 follows comments 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.729
 is no matter translated I met eight 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.680
 I do not even have to 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:24.979
 so its not meet only once to go 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:27.870
 have and yes you see what comes out 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.250
 Rocket stealthily hit like that 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.590
 did not hit a rocket there 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:38.070
 met and then give even from the 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:40.530
 Fiscal equalization should be so much louder 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.449
 be or jacket about behavior and 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:49.639
 now you are too if i used it 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:53.699
 Find out is one of the pit tomorrow 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.949
 I already have it this morning 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.740
 a great team player and then you get 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.449
 baked at the cinema mode 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.270
 somehow in any way and 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.729
 Somehow somehow often take 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.250
 the sound is being looped up 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:15.380
 So I think it hackt black ops 2 wants 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.380
 licked me and so on 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.380
 nevertheless I have they reached 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.849
 that necessarily counts for me 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.590
 always be the kills you do with it 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.979
 No choice to enjoy the view from 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.840
 up here 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.590
 do one or two hit tomorrow 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.180
 or cologne 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.980
 okay okay is completely must have one 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.770
 So you always know how it is 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.110
 you have your cancellation you are pleased 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.030
 then you are easy on his 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.530
 guess between map on his view 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.730
 or just does not work at all and 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.950
 Here I speak we are a young one 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:48.540
 can nails in mid-summer what in spring 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.770
 was born and since not reached 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.980
 but that does not matter 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:57.440
 and now he hears the movie again 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.440
 a weapon but you have the hit max 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:06.660
 completely free, so to speak 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.550
 the match is so grossly done and 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:12.180
 write times in your opinion the 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.340
 Comments write me in the opinion 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.650
 your comments 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.790
 as you found the gameplay so i found 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.190
 not so bad for mine now 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.410
 At least it was not 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.440
 very bad 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:30.360
 rudi this sense, I would say am 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.580
 I'll go out and say it to the next one 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.030
 times 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.030
