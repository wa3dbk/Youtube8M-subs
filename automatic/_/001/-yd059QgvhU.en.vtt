00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.370 
being stitching the embroidery machine I
remember<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:05.939> watching<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> kind<00:01:07.350> of

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
remember just watching it kind of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.590 
remember just watching it kind of
impressed<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:08.040> its<00:01:08.700> accuracy<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> laying

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
down fiber and thinking oh my gosh I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820 
down fiber and thinking oh my gosh I
mean<00:01:11.729> maybe<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:12.720> could<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.110> 2d<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.680> don't

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
mean maybe we could do this 2d we don't

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.200 
mean maybe we could do this 2d we don't
need<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.430> three<00:01:14.640> dimensions<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
just drawing down Kevlar and it's really

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
just drawing down Kevlar and it's really
super<00:01:38.220> thin<00:01:38.520> thread<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.180> could<00:01:39.329> run

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
super thin thread so we could run

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
super thin thread so we could run

through our embroidery machine we broke

through our embroidery machine we broke
so<00:01:41.610> many<00:01:41.670> needles<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.119> can't<00:01:42.329> tell<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.630> we

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
so many needles I can't tell you we

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.690 
so many needles I can't tell you we
wrapped<00:01:43.170> Kevlar<00:01:43.619> around<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.890> spindles<00:01:44.430> we

had to get chisel to chiseled off and we

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.569

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
was never designed to be used for but we

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.340 
was never designed to be used for but we
wanted<00:01:51.390> something<00:01:51.570> strong<00:01:51.930> enough<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.290> we

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
wanted something strong enough that we

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.469 
wanted something strong enough that we
could<00:01:52.470> run<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.520> takes<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.790> snorer<00:01:54.030> lab<00:01:54.270> in

thankies for a research lab and put

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.190 
thankies for a research lab and put
under<00:01:56.189> high-speed<00:01:56.549> footage<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.030> see<00:01:57.869> what

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
under high-speed footage and see what

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
under high-speed footage and see what
was<00:01:58.320> happening<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:59.159> could<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.549> that<00:02:00.030> these

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
was happening we could see that these

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.510 
was happening we could see that these
were<00:02:00.390> moving<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.049> skin<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.369> go

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
were moving with the skin and if I go

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.039 
were moving with the skin and if I go
like<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:02.939> my<00:02:03.090> hand<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.689> see<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
like this with my hand you can see the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.370 
like this with my hand you can see the
skin<00:02:04.290> tight<00:02:04.500> number<00:02:04.740> my<00:02:04.860> knuckle

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
skin tight number my knuckle

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.560 
skin tight number my knuckle
go<00:02:06.009> pitney<00:02:06.310> relax<00:02:06.640> your<00:02:06.939> foot<00:02:07.090> does<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.390> same

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
go pitney relax your foot does the same

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.080 
go pitney relax your foot does the same
thing<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:08.979> suddenly<00:02:09.459> we<00:02:09.580> saw<00:02:09.729> something

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
thing and so suddenly we saw something

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.390 
thing and so suddenly we saw something
was<00:02:10.179> performing<00:02:10.929> like<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.140> skin<00:02:11.560> or<00:02:11.770> your<00:02:12.040> skin

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
was performing like a skin or your skin

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.740 
was performing like a skin or your skin
we've<00:02:12.970> never<00:02:13.060> seen<00:02:13.270> anything<00:02:13.480> like<00:02:13.599> that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
we've never seen anything like that

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.140 
we've never seen anything like that

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.040 
senior researcher in the Nike sport
research<00:02:18.130> lab<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.940> advantage<00:02:19.269> of<00:02:19.390> flywire<00:02:19.810> is

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
research lab the advantage of flywire is

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.110 
research lab the advantage of flywire is
that<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.560> gives<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.099> conforming<00:02:21.880> fit

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
that it gives you that conforming fit

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.220 
that it gives you that conforming fit
but<00:02:22.599> it's<00:02:22.720> also<00:02:22.900> very<00:02:23.680> very<00:02:23.830> strong<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:24.910> know

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
but it's also very very strong we know

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.199 
but it's also very very strong we know
the<00:02:26.230> force<00:02:26.500> loads<00:02:26.800> on<00:02:27.069> each<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.730> these<00:02:27.849> threads

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
the force loads on each of these threads

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.140 
the force loads on each of these threads
and<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.569> we<00:02:28.690> know<00:02:28.870> exactly<00:02:29.489> how<00:02:30.489> many<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.910> place

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
and so we know exactly how many to place

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.320 
and so we know exactly how many to place
and<00:02:31.420> how<00:02:31.540> far<00:02:31.780> apart<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.160> be

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
and how far apart for it to be

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.910 
and how far apart for it to be
comfortable<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.540> also<00:02:34.840> give<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.709> the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
comfortable but also give you the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.130 
comfortable but also give you the
retention<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.239> need<00:02:37.480> we<00:02:37.900> found<00:02:38.049> a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
retention that you need we found a

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.900 
retention that you need we found a
better<00:02:38.290> fiber<00:02:38.620> which<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.010> Vectren<00:02:39.459> didn't

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
better fiber which is Vectren didn't

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.729 
better fiber which is Vectren didn't
degrade<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.269> sunlight<00:02:40.630> had<00:02:41.260> actually<00:02:41.709> a

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
degrade in the sunlight had actually a

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.509 
degrade in the sunlight had actually a
better<00:02:41.920> flex<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.120> holding<00:02:43.480> its<00:02:43.599> strength<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
better flex and holding its strength and

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.280 
better flex and holding its strength and
really<00:02:45.519> was<00:02:46.180> stronger<00:02:46.599> than<00:02:46.780> Kevlar

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
really was stronger than Kevlar

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.960 
really was stronger than Kevlar
considering<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.459> violence<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.910> the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
considering the violence of the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.820 
considering the violence of the
stitching<00:02:49.330> process<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.080> then<00:02:50.170> how<00:02:50.349> much<00:02:50.470> flex

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
stitching process and then how much flex

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.259 
stitching process and then how much flex
actually<00:02:51.250> occurs<00:02:51.459> enough<00:02:51.790> pair<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.090> footwear

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
actually occurs enough pair of footwear

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.449 
actually occurs enough pair of footwear
it<00:02:53.049> was<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> perfect<00:02:53.440> fiber<00:02:53.799> choice<00:02:54.069> for<00:02:54.340> us

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
it was the perfect fiber choice for us

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.180 
it was the perfect fiber choice for us
it's<00:02:54.940> pretty<00:02:55.120> quick<00:02:55.360> that<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.690> say<00:02:55.870> well

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
it's pretty quick that you say well

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.350 
it's pretty quick that you say well
maybe<00:02:57.190> we<00:02:57.370> can<00:02:57.400> make<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:57.610> basketball

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
maybe we can make a basketball

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.850 
maybe we can make a basketball
maybe<00:02:58.660> we<00:02:58.720> can<00:02:58.870> make<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.019> tennis<00:02:59.380> shoe<00:02:59.410> out<00:02:59.769> of

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
maybe we can make a tennis shoe out of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.770 
maybe we can make a tennis shoe out of
this<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.329> just<00:03:01.360> was<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.690> natural

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
this so that just was a natural

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.080 
this so that just was a natural
extension<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.769> project<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.430> think<00:03:03.849> what's

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
extension of the project I think what's

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.729 
extension of the project I think what's
really<00:03:04.150> interesting<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.810> it<00:03:04.989> opens<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.590> whole

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
really interesting is it opens a whole

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.910 
really interesting is it opens a whole
new<00:03:05.769> realm<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.670> opportunities<00:03:07.329> for<00:03:07.920> building

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
new realm of opportunities for building

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.410 
new realm of opportunities for building
lightweight<00:03:09.250> products<00:03:09.700> we're<00:03:10.239> working

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
lightweight products we're working

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.930 
lightweight products we're working
already<00:03:11.109> on<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.400> maybe<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.549> third<00:03:12.760> generation

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
already on a maybe the third generation

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.210 
already on a maybe the third generation
of<00:03:13.390> this<00:03:13.569> and<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:14.470> going<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.739> continue<00:03:15.069> to

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
of this and it's going to continue to

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.449 
of this and it's going to continue to
refine<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:15.970> get<00:03:16.209> get<00:03:16.859> more<00:03:17.859> optimally

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
refine and get get more optimally

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.430 
refine and get get more optimally

supportive and lighter at the same time
I<00:03:20.739> never<00:03:21.340> got<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.639> meet<00:03:21.760> Bill<00:03:22.030> Bowerman<00:03:22.209> and

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
I never got to meet Bill Bowerman and

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.629 
I never got to meet Bill Bowerman and
but<00:03:23.560> we<00:03:23.650> study<00:03:23.920> them<00:03:24.040> all<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.280> time<00:03:24.430> we're

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
but we study them all the time we're

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.770 
but we study them all the time we're
always<00:03:24.790> working<00:03:25.030> with<00:03:25.269> his<00:03:25.389> things<00:03:25.600> were

always working with his things were

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.120 
always working with his things were
always<00:03:25.930> pulling<00:03:26.109> his<00:03:26.290> archive<00:03:26.620> pieces<00:03:26.980> out

always pulling his archive pieces out

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.590 
always pulling his archive pieces out
and<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.639> were<00:03:27.760> loved<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.120> have<00:03:28.209> seen<00:03:28.359> what<00:03:28.510> his

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
and I were loved to have seen what his

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.759 
and I were loved to have seen what his
reaction<00:03:28.989> was<00:03:29.109> to<00:03:29.290> something<00:03:29.590> like<00:03:29.709> this

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
reaction was to something like this

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.160 
reaction was to something like this
because<00:03:30.160> I'm<00:03:30.340> sure<00:03:31.150> in<00:03:31.299> his<00:03:31.450> day<00:03:31.600> building<00:03:32.019> the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
because I'm sure in his day building the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.280 
because I'm sure in his day building the
materials<00:03:32.530> he<00:03:32.590> was<00:03:33.090> he<00:03:34.090> more<00:03:34.660> or<00:03:34.720> less<00:03:34.930> had

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
materials he was he more or less had

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.009 
materials he was he more or less had
things<00:03:36.160> that<00:03:36.430> were<00:03:36.790> minimal<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.420> don't<00:03:37.840> know

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
things that were minimal I don't know

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.660 
things that were minimal I don't know
what<00:03:38.200> his<00:03:38.319> lightest<00:03:38.680> pieces<00:03:39.040> were<00:03:39.220> I'd<00:03:39.579> have

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
what his lightest pieces were I'd have

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.430 
what his lightest pieces were I'd have
to<00:03:39.850> go<00:03:39.940> back<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.120> into<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.750> archives<00:03:41.079> and<00:03:41.230> see

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
to go back and into the archives and see

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.039 
to go back and into the archives and see
how<00:03:41.590> light<00:03:41.799> he<00:03:41.829> actually<00:03:42.130> got<00:03:42.489> but<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.389> think

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
how light he actually got but I think

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:52.980 
how light he actually got but I think
we'd<00:03:44.200> give<00:03:44.380> him<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.530> run<00:03:44.620> for<00:03:44.680> his<00:03:44.829> money

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.020 

Oh
