00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
to do at first what I done

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.070 
to do at first what I done
first<00:00:22.380> thing<00:00:22.560> off<00:00:22.710> I've<00:00:22.949> got<00:00:23.250> four<00:00:23.699> time

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
first thing off I've got four time

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.859 
first thing off I've got four time
transformer<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.320> there<00:00:26.070> Lee<00:00:26.279> has<00:00:26.750> but<00:00:27.750> I'm

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
transformer that there Lee has but I'm

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.210 
transformer that there Lee has but I'm
using<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> Select<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> give<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.099> more

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
using it for the Select to give it more

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.450 
using it for the Select to give it more
power<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:30.090> amp<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.840> decoder<00:00:31.679> three<00:00:32.219> amps

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
power one amp to the decoder three amps

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.740 
power one amp to the decoder three amps
to<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> trap<00:00:32.880> that's<00:00:33.270> good<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:35.270> how<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> me

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
to the trap that's good and how to me

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.139 
to the trap that's good and how to me
the<00:00:36.989> wire<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.829> my<00:00:38.219> fingers<00:00:38.910> width

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the wire is like my fingers width

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.569 
the wire is like my fingers width
literally<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.040> gonna<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.250> enough

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
literally and that's not gonna be enough

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
literally and that's not gonna be enough
to<00:00:41.760> get<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.930> big<00:00:43.110> layout

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to get if you have a really big layout

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.810 
to get if you have a really big layout
from<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.940> put<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> wires<00:00:45.239> into<00:00:45.510> there<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
from the put the wires into there to

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.920 
from the put the wires into there to
here<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.329> I'd<00:00:48.450> um<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:49.760> got<00:00:50.760> these<00:00:50.969> terminal

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
here so what I'd um I got these terminal

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.450 
here so what I'd um I got these terminal
connectors<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:52.710> whatever<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.100> want<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> call

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
connectors or whatever you want to call

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.250 
connectors or whatever you want to call
them<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.440> I<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:56.300> wired<00:00:57.890> them<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.100> red

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
them and I actually wired them in red

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.330 
them and I actually wired them in red
black<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.649> green<00:01:01.859> they're<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.100> different

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
black and green they're all different

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880 
black and green they're all different
but<00:01:02.699> once<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.480> actually<00:01:03.660> y<00:01:04.170> them<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:04.739> has

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
but once it actually y them up there has

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
but once it actually y them up there has
to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.489> cure<00:01:06.030> after<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.390> won't<00:01:06.540> work

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
to be a cure after it won't work

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.730 
to be a cure after it won't work
and<00:01:08.270> basically<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.390> tried<00:01:09.659> down<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.080> works<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and basically I tried down it works and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.640 
and basically I tried down it works and
she<00:01:11.310> works<00:01:11.580> fine<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.380> what<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> done<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.390> got

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
she works fine and what I done I got

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.429 
she works fine and what I done I got
three<00:01:16.650> weeks<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> colors<00:01:17.420> got<00:01:18.420> black<00:01:19.729> red<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
three weeks of colors got black red and

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.870 
three weeks of colors got black red and
wherever<00:01:22.439> my<00:01:22.680> green<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.250> can't<00:01:23.460> find<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
wherever my green is I can't find it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.910 
wherever my green is I can't find it
right<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.110> green<00:01:25.409> wire<00:01:25.650> like

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
right now but I have a green wire like

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.890 
right now but I have a green wire like
these<00:01:26.159> they're<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.090> 10<00:01:27.420> meters<00:01:27.780> long<00:01:29.900> and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
these they're all 10 meters long and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.620 
these they're all 10 meters long and
basically<00:01:31.939> they're<00:01:32.939> gonna<00:01:33.060> come<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.360> handy

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
basically they're gonna come in handy

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.010 
basically they're gonna come in handy
and<00:01:35.090> what<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.780> do

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and what that what they do

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.249 
and what that what they do
red<00:01:37.950> wire<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:38.939> from<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.920> okay<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:40.950> red<00:01:41.340> wire

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
red wire out from here okay so red wire

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.260 
red wire out from here okay so red wire
say<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.890> comes<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.549> black<00:01:44.909> way<00:01:45.119> out

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
say it comes out of here black way out

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.810 
say it comes out of here black way out
of<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.600> green<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:46.560> out<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:47.100> but

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
of here green my out of here but

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.530 
of here green my out of here but
obviously<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.720> side<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:50.540> goes

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
obviously on this side and that goes

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.069 
obviously on this side and that goes
into<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> decoder<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:53.149> programmed<00:01:54.149> onto

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
into the decoder then programmed onto

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.749 
into the decoder then programmed onto
there<00:01:55.290> my<00:01:55.680> programs<00:01:56.130> 96<00:01:57.200> 96<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:59.390> 99<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:01.020> 96<00:02:01.759> 96

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
there my programs 96 96 to 99 be 96 96

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.020 
there my programs 96 96 to 99 be 96 96
to<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> hundred<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.780> meant<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:05.640> cuz<00:02:05.880> there's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
to a hundred I meant that cuz there's

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.949 
to a hundred I meant that cuz there's
four<00:02:06.360> point<00:02:06.899> rotors<00:02:07.580> zoom<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:09.270> two<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
four point rotors zoom in one two and

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.010 
four point rotors zoom in one two and
two<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> back

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
two on the back

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.890 
two on the back
and<00:02:12.110> it's<00:02:13.040> been<00:02:13.250> not<00:02:13.490> passage<00:02:14.000> trying<00:02:14.750> to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
and it's been not passage trying to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.470 
and it's been not passage trying to
screw<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.070> I'm<00:02:16.160> quite<00:02:16.310> tired<00:02:16.640> from<00:02:17.060> actually

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
screw and I'm quite tired from actually

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.250 
screw and I'm quite tired from actually
doing<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.930> because<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.230> took<00:02:18.350> me<00:02:18.410> about<00:02:20.260> took

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
doing it because it took me about took

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.960 
doing it because it took me about took
me<00:02:21.440> like<00:02:21.530> two<00:02:21.770> hours<00:02:21.800> but<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.460> actually<00:02:22.730> prefer

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
me like two hours but I actually prefer

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.850 
me like two hours but I actually prefer
because<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.780> could<00:02:24.020> have<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:24.290> soldered<00:02:24.740> the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
because I could have just soldered the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.520 
because I could have just soldered the
wires<00:02:24.890> but<00:02:25.430> I'm<00:02:25.790> really<00:02:26.450> bad<00:02:26.810> with<00:02:26.840> soldiering

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
wires but I'm really bad with soldiering

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.400 
wires but I'm really bad with soldiering
and<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.740> don't<00:02:27.920> want<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.130> get<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.370> wrong<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.990> I

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
and I don't want to get it wrong so I

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.290 
and I don't want to get it wrong so I
just<00:02:31.100> preferred<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.790> easy<00:02:31.970> way<00:02:32.300> around<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.980> I

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
just preferred the easy way around it I

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.240 
just preferred the easy way around it I
mean<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.960> can<00:02:36.110> do<00:02:36.230> whatever<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.620> want<00:02:36.830> what<00:02:37.010> I

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
mean you can do whatever you want what I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.510 
mean you can do whatever you want what I
chose<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:37.910> way<00:02:38.090> because<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.690> think<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:40.340> will

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
chose this way because I think it will

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.290 
chose this way because I think it will
be<00:02:41.060> much<00:02:41.300> better<00:02:41.510> for<00:02:41.900> me<00:02:42.020> as<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.910> don't<00:02:44.000> want<00:02:44.210> to

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
be much better for me as I don't want to

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.320 
be much better for me as I don't want to
go<00:02:44.390> into<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.690> complex<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:46.070> that's<00:02:46.820> basically

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
go into the complex and that's basically

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.620 
go into the complex and that's basically
all<00:02:47.960> I<00:02:47.990> have<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.820> I'm<00:02:49.820> really<00:02:50.150> going<00:02:50.330> anything

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
all I have and I'm really going anything

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.800 
all I have and I'm really going anything

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810
