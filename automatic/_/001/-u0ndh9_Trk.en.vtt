when<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.430> stick<00:04:37.849> a<00:04:37.880> tortilla<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:38.660> in<00:04:38.870> a

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
when I stick a tortilla and it in a

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.930 
when I stick a tortilla and it in a
sizzling<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:40.190> I<00:04:40.250> like<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.430> do<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.580> three<00:04:40.820> at<00:04:40.880> a

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
sizzling so I like to do a three at a

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.500 
sizzling so I like to do a three at a
time

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
time

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.339 
time
1<00:04:42.039> 2<00:04:43.039> 3

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.820 

because<00:04:47.349> I<00:04:47.559> always<00:04:47.860> have<00:04:48.279> a<00:04:48.580> family<00:04:48.789> to<00:04:49.089> feed

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
because I always have a family to feed

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.100 
because I always have a family to feed
so<00:04:50.830> I've<00:04:51.129> developed<00:04:51.520> methods<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:52.629> this<00:04:52.869> goes

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
so I've developed methods so this goes

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.420 
so I've developed methods so this goes
down<00:04:53.349> really<00:04:53.680> fast

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
down really fast

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.350 
down really fast
it's<00:04:54.759> on<00:04:54.999> high<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:55.889> the<00:04:56.889> coldness<00:04:57.339> of<00:04:57.460> those

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
it's on high and the coldness of those

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.089 
it's on high and the coldness of those
tortillas<00:04:58.869> is<00:04:59.110> bringing<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.889> temperature

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
tortillas is bringing the temperature

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.399 
tortillas is bringing the temperature
down<00:05:00.610> so<00:05:00.849> it's<00:05:00.999> not<00:05:01.119> too<00:05:01.300> high<00:05:01.509> I'm<00:05:01.899> going<00:05:02.289> to

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
down so it's not too high I'm going to

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.409 
down so it's not too high I'm going to
turn<00:05:02.619> down<00:05:02.649> my<00:05:02.860> meat<00:05:03.279> now<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.580> low<00:05:04.089> because

great<00:05:09.279> too<00:05:09.599> this<00:05:10.599> is<00:05:10.839> the<00:05:10.990> dangerous<00:05:11.379> part<00:05:11.469> of

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
great too this is the dangerous part of

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.029 
great too this is the dangerous part of
the<00:05:11.770> recipe<00:05:11.979> so<00:05:12.669> be<00:05:12.909> careful<00:05:13.770> stay<00:05:14.770> way<00:05:15.009> away

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
the recipe so be careful stay way away

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.179 
the recipe so be careful stay way away
from<00:05:15.309> that<00:05:15.550> hot<00:05:15.849> oil<00:05:16.379> so<00:05:17.379> my<00:05:17.499> method<00:05:17.710> is<00:05:17.949> to

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:18.189 
from that hot oil so my method is to

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.429 
from that hot oil so my method is to
have<00:05:18.339> this<00:05:18.520> bubbling<00:05:19.089> up<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:19.449> really<00:05:20.020> hot<00:05:20.229> and

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
have this bubbling up and really hot and

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.730 
have this bubbling up and really hot and
as<00:05:21.399> one<00:05:21.729> side<00:05:21.999> is<00:05:22.120> kind<00:05:22.240> of<00:05:22.389> done<00:05:22.629> then<00:05:23.349> I'm

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
as one side is kind of done then I'm

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.139 
as one side is kind of done then I'm
going<00:05:24.039> to<00:05:24.129> flip<00:05:24.339> it<00:05:24.370> it's<00:05:24.669> been<00:05:24.879> in<00:05:24.999> there

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:25.149 
going to flip it it's been in there

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:27.329 
going to flip it it's been in there
about<00:05:25.240> 30<00:05:25.659> seconds<00:05:26.229> and<00:05:26.319> I<00:05:26.830> can<00:05:27.009> feel<00:05:27.279> that

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:27.339 
about 30 seconds and I can feel that

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.399 
about 30 seconds and I can feel that
they're<00:05:27.639> getting<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:28.059> little<00:05:28.419> harder<00:05:29.139> to<00:05:29.289> the

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
they're getting a little harder to the

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.529 
they're getting a little harder to the
touch<00:05:29.649> and<00:05:29.919> that's<00:05:30.399> the<00:05:30.610> perfect<00:05:30.939> time<00:05:31.210> to

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
touch and that's the perfect time to

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.629 
touch and that's the perfect time to
turn<00:05:31.779> stick<00:05:32.289> a<00:05:32.319> fork<00:05:32.620> in<00:05:32.830> it<00:05:32.889> and<00:05:33.309> we're<00:05:33.550> going

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
turn stick a fork in it and we're going

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.179 
turn stick a fork in it and we're going
to<00:05:33.699> kind<00:05:33.939> of<00:05:34.029> shape<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.680> so<00:05:35.680> that<00:05:35.860> one's<00:05:36.039> going

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:36.189 
to kind of shape it so that one's going

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.989 
to kind of shape it so that one's going
to<00:05:36.219> sit<00:05:36.490> there

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:36.999 
to sit there

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:39.649 
to sit there
this<00:05:37.809> one<00:05:38.020> gets<00:05:38.199> turned<00:05:38.559> and<00:05:38.740> slipped<00:05:38.979> as<00:05:39.189> well

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
this one gets turned and slipped as well

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.429 
this one gets turned and slipped as well
and<00:05:40.659> now<00:05:41.169> this<00:05:41.379> one<00:05:41.649> too<00:05:42.779> to<00:05:43.779> do<00:05:43.959> three<00:05:44.289> at<00:05:44.379> a

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:44.439 
and now this one too to do three at a

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.159 
and now this one too to do three at a
time<00:05:44.819> you've<00:05:45.819> got<00:05:46.029> a<00:05:46.059> really<00:05:46.360> maneuver<00:05:46.990> in
