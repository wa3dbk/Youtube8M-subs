00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
is a new camera I think it's better

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.429 
is a new camera I think it's better
quality<00:01:49.890> than<00:01:50.280> my<00:01:50.430> flip<00:01:50.670> video<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
quality than my flip video and it's a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.899 
quality than my flip video and it's a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
lot better than my flip video right now

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.969 
lot better than my flip video right now
because<00:01:54.060> my<00:01:54.420> flip<00:01:54.659> video<00:01:54.960> isn't<00:01:55.320> actually

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
because my flip video isn't actually

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.100 
because my flip video isn't actually
functioning<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.469> tried<00:01:59.219> restarting<00:01:59.430> it

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
functioning and I tried restarting it

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.149 
functioning and I tried restarting it
Cisco<00:02:02.110> isn't<00:02:02.380> making<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.650> flip<00:02:02.890> videos

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
Cisco isn't making the flip videos

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.730

get it fixed and stuff so I have a new

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.499 
get it fixed and stuff so I have a new

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
because maybe the videos will be behind

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.930 
because maybe the videos will be behind
