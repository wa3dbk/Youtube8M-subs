00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.380
 the student the 2014 school year 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.299
 I'm a teacher, and we'll do it. 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.550
 now a follow-up to the issues of 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.260
 history of enem of 2014 and the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.230
 comments from these two 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.260
 story aloísio bruno caesar with you 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.849
 hello students this science test 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.539
 human or we are hoping 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.669
 that you did very well on her and she 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.340
 corresponded to a thematic diversity 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.710
 it 's not we realized it's in 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 general history in this brazil is in the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.879
 sociology just a little bit but in the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.030
 she also integrated a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.829
 diversity of themes that generally 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.329
 people see the inim always inclining a 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.370
 bit more for questions of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.430
 equity and one more proof 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.190
 similar to some vestibular and we 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.079
 also understands that it is when people 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.640
 speaks of announced in this enem 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.520
 of the joint statement and neither in the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.680
 Human were very long right people via 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.270
 issues and hard-working people. 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.600
 he did not notice the long utterances 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.400
 so we realize that there are few 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.860
 long texts in the alternatives were 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.750
 rather lean rather short but 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.240
 enem continues in that idea to use 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.909
 A lot of images so we can 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.049
 understand interpret by associating theme 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.509
 studied right? 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.240
 so much so that there was an issue that fell 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.890
 in the proper image alternatives 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.810
 another similar issue that year 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.150
 previous cultural heritage has fallen 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.280
 material and immaterial by iphan 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.590
 it is not another important thing that in 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.049
 relation to that matter of size is that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.210
 subtitles made a lot of difference in 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.000
 interpretation of the issues in some 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.939
 important dates to understand 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.399
 this idea is good and in relation to the question 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.229
 history proof exactly if you 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.720
 to get a thematic diversity 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.640
 multiple in the general history we saw 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.009
 issues that spoke of Greek democracy 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.020
 is an interesting topic when people 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.729
 talk about history in greece 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.009
 we saw a centenary of the first war 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.570
 world this year 100 years of 1914 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.149
 appeared a question about the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.649
 imperialism in neo-colonialism 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.900
 First World War so I guess 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.920
 with time the opponent as he is 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.959
 always watchful 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.910
 the great navigations that 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.280
 expected from america was also assisted by 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.040
 by the test and also a matter of 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.050
 scientific evolution of the 17th century is 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.620
 It did not break with the 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.569
 philosophy is now the enem although 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.060
 brought this profile of questions itself 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.980
 vestibular also brought the idea of 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.080
 enemy issues 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.150
 if you are to compare the proof of the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.350
 enem had identity issues 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.620
 which is the first purchase to be made 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.209
 first is the matrix is when you see there 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.370
 the first assignment of the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.590
 competence to understand the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.080
 cultural identities both in brazil 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.600
 how much in france then enem did not leave 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.910
 inaugurated this theme and was 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.110
 and it is important that he made mention of 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.230
 black culture 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.660
 thus reaffirming the idea that 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.790
 African-American culture to continue 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.250
 evidence of indigenous culture that is also 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.980
 part of this heritage is also us 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.610
 we saw is current issues in the test 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.080
 of enem 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.340
 I find it interesting to observe is the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.180
 issue that spoke of Brazilian policy 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.739
 we primarily think of the idea of 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.359
 manifestations as you can manipulate the 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.329
 population does not manipulate as the issue 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:31.260
 where it was quoted until the goal tea né 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:33.030
 In this case, but I'm going to spend 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.920
 my impression also teacher swear 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.620
 Why did you also find the evidence? 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.609
 the dressing is okay, actually 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.859
 When we talk about the history of 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.829
 brazil for example some themes not 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.480
 very recurrent appearances is the proof 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.180
 I was commenting now a little too. 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.220
 she had a degree of difficulty a little 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.780
 higher than in previous years 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.519
 we will not say that the proof was 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.380
 impossible but that she was more 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.700
 difficult than in previous years. 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.739
 it's fact 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.069
 with some issues that even left 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.150
 some questions for you to is 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.010
 decide which would be the correct alternative 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.069
 but takes for example how the issues 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.690
 that appeared a coup de 64 né 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:18.329
 agent business birthdays then 64 50 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.970
 years old this year then ended up falling for the 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.610
 question about the military coup 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.080
 is a recurring theme but it is very 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.750
 time we did not see a proof a 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.430
 question about the beginning of the republic 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.690
 so we have, for example, a 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.580
 talking on campus about the politics of 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.100
 governors and another who called 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.660
 attention of people with a charge is that 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.610
 It speaks of how much the program 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.650
 national integration affonso feather in 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.990
 1910 only a long time we did not see 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.870
 appear evidence values another 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.400
 interesting about is a set of 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.830
 articles of the 1988 constitution is finally 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.540
 proof and a very interesting people 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.370
 even played with his friend, Minas Gerais, who 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.950
 soon appear for you too 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.880
 When you say cheese bread 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.460
 turned into 4 cultural world 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.630
 Brazilian, that 's if she made a good 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.480
 material equity ratio 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.520
 Intangible heritage is very 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.960
 interesting question some well 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.180
 interesting image very much 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.860
 people as always feature 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.870
 fundamental of enem in the end 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.640
 Even now, say a little bit to them. 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.610
 in relation to sociology and 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.070
 Philosophy new impressions is actually 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.140
 in the case of sociology appeared only 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.690
 one issue is that it showed a charge 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.669
 To talk about work relationship with 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.890
 technology that can make the connection 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.110
 with geography with history as well 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.720
 but philosophy had a very 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.150
 strong in this test with moderate questions 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.400
 which were not only interpretive were that 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.830
 deserved attention of every thinker fell 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.690
 a question of epicureus discussing the 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.270
 matter of pleasure for Epicurus but 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.370
 philosophy in ancient platon philosophy 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.080
 appears also in the race including the 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.390
 question that showed in the school board of 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.100
 athens together with the finger up doing 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.990
 allusion to the world of ideas as people 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.640
 generally discuss platoon and people 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.680
 was even talking too 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.290
 during the reading of the test that 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.180
 No way, I was not good for you. 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.580
 proving that the statement 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.590
 could help you in the biggest issue 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.440
 part of the issues with rare exceptions 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.660
 requires you to know the content 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.340
 concerning that particular philosopher is 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.660
 a test 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.750
 the degree of difficulty as agents was 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.970
 higher than in previous years, this is 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.910
 still contributing in philosophy but fell 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.680
 The question of karting then is 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.540
 rational philosophy and also the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.950
 interdisciplinarity is something that the 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.200
 people expected from enem there was a 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.510
 little this story is philosophy 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.370
 sociology but above all with the 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.060
 on the issue of scientific revolution 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.129
 Galilean 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.719
 but we really believe that we 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.249
 Let's be prepared that we have 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:47.939
 seen then that the proof is enough 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:51.269
 when Julius comments here and it is 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:53.039
 not tiring, but when 

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:55.800
 we looked at the evidence 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:58.409
 also distributed in size and this was 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.119
 very curious and an addendum still 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:02.429
 issue of the constitution is that 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:04.229
 Constitution that appears is 88 is 

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:06.029
 usually fell for example is 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:08.610
 constitutions in evidence appeared in 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:11.279
 other times but it appeared that way in the 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.319
 case of Brazil in the history of Brazil 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:14.939
 the discussion of autonomy federalism 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:16.740
 central government appeared in two 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:19.139
 questions did not appear in second 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.809
 reign and also of the old republic I 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.939
 I found it rather curious that this proof 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:26.580
 they distributed enough but he has is 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:29.369
 We can then validate these 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.019
 that you will certainly have there 

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:33.509
 function of all this plurality that 

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:36.839
 the other vestibular clinics is also 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:38.249
 that there is only close to us was 

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:40.199
 commenting also a classic thing 

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:43.079
 many vestibular ever used again 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:45.300
 enem to charge that black soldier 

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:46.679
 returned in the Paraguayan war and saw the 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.149
 his mother being punished and make a 

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:50.729
 question about black citizenship 

00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:53.969
 also there in the late 19th century 

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:55.229
 good varela leaves hope you have 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:55.949
 well in this test also from the area of 

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:59.149
 humanities 

00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:59.149
 thank you very much for the audience
