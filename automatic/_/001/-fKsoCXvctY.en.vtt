00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
have to be really busy act with it in

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.529 
have to be really busy act with it in

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
fact if you're too exact with it it ends

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:47.969 
fact if you're too exact with it it ends
up<00:00:46.600> sounding<00:00:46.899> that<00:00:47.289> way<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.589> you<00:00:47.680> want<00:00:47.800> it<00:00:47.949> to

up sounding that way and you want it to
sound<00:00:48.280> free<00:00:48.699> so<00:00:49.449> don't<00:00:49.719> worry<00:00:49.870> about<00:00:49.989> hitting

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
sound free so don't worry about hitting

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.959 
sound free so don't worry about hitting
all<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:50.739> notes<00:00:50.769> when<00:00:51.250> you're<00:00:51.399> do<00:00:51.519> yours<00:00:51.699> trim

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
all the notes when you're do yours trim

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.279 
all the notes when you're do yours trim
just<00:00:52.210> strum<00:00:52.750> whatever<00:00:53.079> comes<00:00:53.350> out

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.020 

and<00:00:57.679> this<00:00:57.829> is<00:00:57.980> where<00:00:58.160> it's<00:00:58.280> important<00:00:58.789> to<00:00:58.879> kind

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
and this is where it's important to kind

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.250 
and this is where it's important to kind
of<00:00:59.120> get<00:00:59.269> that<00:00:59.390> flick<00:00:59.750> motion<00:01:00.199> with<00:01:00.379> your<00:01:00.410> wrist

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.500 

some<00:01:06.560> are<00:01:06.860> movement<00:01:07.550> and<00:01:07.730> then<00:01:07.820> I've<00:01:07.940> got<00:01:08.150> some

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
some are movement and then I've got some

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.960 
some are movement and then I've got some
wrist<00:01:08.840> movement<00:01:09.440> here

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.440 

and<00:01:16.390> now<00:01:16.660> when<00:01:16.840> you<00:01:16.870> play<00:01:17.140> your<00:01:17.290> C<00:01:17.620> chord

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and now when you play your C chord

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.820 
and now when you play your C chord
you've<00:01:19.450> got<00:01:19.690> two<00:01:19.930> different<00:01:20.080> ways<00:01:20.350> you<00:01:20.470> can

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
you've got two different ways you can

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.310 
you've got two different ways you can
strum<00:01:21.160> on<00:01:21.370> this<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:22.420> can<00:01:22.570> either<00:01:22.750> use<00:01:23.050> bass

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
strum on this you can either use bass

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.430 
strum on this you can either use bass
notes<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:23.980> five<00:01:24.400> and<00:01:24.760> six<00:01:25.150> or<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:25.990> can<00:01:26.200> use

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
notes of five and six or you can use

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.890 
notes of five and six or you can use
baton<00:01:26.890> up<00:01:27.040> bass<00:01:27.280> notes<00:01:27.550> of<00:01:27.700> five<00:01:27.910> and<00:01:28.150> four<00:01:28.450> if

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
baton up bass notes of five and four if

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.250 
baton up bass notes of five and four if
you<00:01:29.230> use<00:01:29.470> five<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.070> six<00:01:31.020> then<00:01:32.020> you're<00:01:32.170> going

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
you use five and six then you're going

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.900 
you use five and six then you're going
to<00:01:32.320> have<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.620> be<00:01:32.740> moving<00:01:33.040> your<00:01:33.190> ring<00:01:33.430> finger

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
to have to be moving your ring finger

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.880 
to have to be moving your ring finger
here<00:01:33.940> you<00:01:34.420> can<00:01:34.600> also<00:01:34.750> use<00:01:35.080> your<00:01:35.230> pinky<00:01:35.710> but

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
here you can also use your pinky but

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.860 
here you can also use your pinky but
since<00:01:36.130> we<00:01:36.280> didn't<00:01:36.520> talk<00:01:36.670> about<00:01:36.730> that<00:01:37.030> we're

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
since we didn't talk about that we're

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.540 
since we didn't talk about that we're
going<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.050> say<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.680> you<00:01:38.770> can<00:01:38.920> just<00:01:39.130> move<00:01:39.310> this

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
going to say that you can just move this

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.360 
going to say that you can just move this
so<00:01:39.760> it<00:01:39.880> would<00:01:40.030> be<00:01:40.180> fine

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.890 

and<00:01:47.370> then<00:01:47.730> if<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.910> don't<00:01:48.120> want<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.480> rotate

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
and then if you don't want to rotate

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:57.090 
and then if you don't want to rotate
that<00:01:49.080> finger<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.620> can<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.920> five

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.789 

and<00:01:57.250> then<00:01:57.820> when<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.090> go<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.270> your<00:01:58.420> D<00:01:58.689> chord

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and then when you go to your D chord

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.200 
and then when you go to your D chord
your<00:01:59.799> base<00:02:00.040> notes<00:02:00.369> are<00:02:00.520> going<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.729> be<00:02:00.850> four<00:02:01.180> and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
your base notes are going to be four and

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.979 
your base notes are going to be four and
five<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.590> it'd<00:02:02.710> be<00:02:02.890> four

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.720 

so<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.289> point<00:02:10.649> you'll<00:02:11.190> need<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.549> make

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
so at this point you'll need to make

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.430 
so at this point you'll need to make
sure<00:02:11.760> when<00:02:12.209> you're<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.659> to<00:02:12.840> your<00:02:13.049> G<00:02:13.409> chord

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
sure when you're going to your G chord

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.059 
sure when you're going to your G chord
and<00:02:14.129> your<00:02:14.370> C<00:02:14.730> chord<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:16.260> your<00:02:16.440> ring<00:02:16.620> fingers

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
and your C chord that your ring fingers

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.100 
and your C chord that your ring fingers
the<00:02:17.250> first<00:02:17.459> finger<00:02:17.849> down<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.090> those<00:02:18.420> chords<00:02:18.959> if

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
the first finger down on those chords if

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.259 
the first finger down on those chords if
you<00:02:19.230> can't<00:02:19.440> put<00:02:19.620> them<00:02:19.739> all<00:02:19.860> down<00:02:19.890> at<00:02:20.190> once

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
you can't put them all down at once

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.520

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
rotate them after you get used to

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.640 
rotate them after you get used to
changing<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:12.360> for<00:03:12.630> instance<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.050> we<00:03:13.110> did<00:03:13.349> four

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
changing so for instance if we did four

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:36.030 
changing so for instance if we did four
beats<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.099> each<00:03:14.250> one<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.760> could<00:03:14.910> do

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:04:03.150 

and<00:03:37.040> then<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.310> have<00:03:37.460> start<00:03:37.820> running<00:03:38.270> here

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.400 

and<00:04:03.700> then<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.120> can<00:04:04.270> speed<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.720> up<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.050> put

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
and then you can speed that up and put

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.890 
and then you can speed that up and put
it<00:04:05.470> with<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.620> song
