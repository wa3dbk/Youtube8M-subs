 looking at mickey mouse his ears 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.420

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.320

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.000

 conditions at the end of the chapter

 first moment that was going to be called di 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.760
 tito 'another name that was proposed for the 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.190
 put and on the other hand mickey mouse was going 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.140
 to be called mortimer mouse however the 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.880
 Donald Duck has always had the same 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.210
 name from the beginning although its 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.340
 full name is donald funter today dan 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.380
 5 disneyworld is probably the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.600
 most famous theme park every

 the city of san francisco 6 many 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.960
 Sometimes disney includes great characters 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.009
 as extras in movies that do not 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.660
 they are protagonists 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.520
 for example repulsion and flynn of 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.740
 tangled appear in a scene from 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.300
 frozen the same happens in another scene 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.690
 with mickey mouse the lady and the vagabond 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.430
 can be found in 101 Dalmatians 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.100
 mickey the donald duck and goofy appear 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.990

 and pumba have also been found in a 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.009
 scene of the hunchback of notredame by 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.890
 last we see that pinocho appears in a 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.370
 tangled scene and there's a lot 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.020
 more examples 7 walt disney was frozen 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.850
 with the idea of ​​being thawed in a 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.920
 future when the advances of medicine 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.720
 let him cure his lung cancer 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.150
 This is one of the most widespread myths 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.280
 about disney that came up because of a 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.500
 series of misunderstandings really walt 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.570
 disney was cremated and his ashes were 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.180
 they find in the mausoleum of his family 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.070
 8 those who may like the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.110
 critics are you probably have read 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.300
 sometime about theme parks of 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.400
 disney and abandoned this really is 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.850
 true the first one is called discovery 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.950
 island and was closed in 1999 the other one 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.620
 called the river country and it was closed in 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.750
 2001 both parks have been abandoned 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.030
 instead of demolished and unknown 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.590
 exactly why they closed years 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.269
 then some brave people have 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.160
 adventurous within the parks for 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.410
 Take photos and record videos that show 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.420
 how both places are taken by the 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.690
 vegetation and they are deteriorating little to 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.580
 little 9 and 10 many disney movies 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.500
 have been accused of containing some 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.390
 form of hidden sexual messages 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.910
 some of these accusations do not have 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.350
 sense or are too convoluted but 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.370
 there are others that have put disney in 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.560
 real trouble 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.540
 for example in a scene of the lion king 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.549
 it is observed how some stars form the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.159
 word sec although it has been speculated that 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.470
 what really puts ss fx a 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.569
 special effects abbreviation what 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.099
 which sounds much more logical in the 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.140
 little mermaid it seems that one of the 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.819
 characters have an erection during 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.040
 a scene this was changed 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.720
 later and later disney 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.940
 defended by revealing that the only thing 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.310
 happened was that the priest had some 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.230
 very pointed knees last in 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.269
 the ski movie vers appears 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.910
 for two frames a naked woman 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.500
 because they spent 20 years between 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.299
 release of the movie and the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.269
 discovery of that image has been 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.650
 impossible to find the responsible 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.069
 obviously in later versions of 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.989
 the movie the photo was deleted that 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.590
 it was everything as always thanks for watching 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.590
 And until next time
