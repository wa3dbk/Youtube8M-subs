so sure with the conflict or what the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.609 
so sure with the conflict or what the
controversy<00:01:36.210> was<00:01:36.240> between<00:01:36.600> Ziggler<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.259> or

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
exchange of it but I'm betting to think

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.310 
exchange of it but I'm betting to think
that<00:01:42.150> maybe<00:01:42.329> rain<00:01:42.630> don't<00:01:42.840> probably<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.259> the

that maybe rain don't probably get the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.810 
that maybe rain don't probably get the
best<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.829> I'm<00:01:44.100> sure<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.670> not

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
best of it and I'm sure that is not

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.550 
best of it and I'm sure that is not
going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> sit<00:01:45.240> well<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.750> WWE<00:01:46.350> higher
