I<00:00:11.639> will<00:00:11.940> be<00:00:12.059> teaching<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.450> on<00:00:12.780> how<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> add

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
I will be teaching you on how to add

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.330 
I will be teaching you on how to add
water<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.280> your<00:00:14.549> map<00:00:15.410> first<00:00:16.410> off<00:00:16.710> we're<00:00:17.100> going

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
water to your map first off we're going

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.380 
water to your map first off we're going
to<00:00:17.460> need<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.480> three<00:00:18.900> things<00:00:19.260> about<00:00:19.470> water

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
to need to know three things about water

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.960 
to need to know three things about water
water<00:00:21.390> needs<00:00:21.779> three<00:00:22.350> components<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.699> fully

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
water needs three components to be fully

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.390 
water needs three components to be fully
functioning<00:00:24.570> you're<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.619> need<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.920> mash

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
functioning you're going to need a mash

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.120 
functioning you're going to need a mash
which<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.029> going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.890> visually<00:00:28.890> represent

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
which is going to visually represent

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.380 
which is going to visually represent
eight<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:30.890> ocean<00:00:31.890> or<00:00:32.189> water<00:00:32.759> source

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
eight your ocean or water source

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.840 
eight your ocean or water source
you're<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.350> need<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.710> water<00:00:35.430> or<00:00:35.760> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
you're going to need a water or a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.479 
you're going to need a water or a
physics<00:00:36.540> volume<00:00:37.050> which<00:00:37.680> will<00:00:37.860> tell<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> game

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
physics volume which will tell the game

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
physics volume which will tell the game
that<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.820> are<00:00:38.940> currently<00:00:39.300> within<00:00:40.290> water<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that you are currently within water and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.530 
that you are currently within water and
that<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.070> should<00:00:41.280> start<00:00:41.610> swimming<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that you should start swimming that the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.900 
that you should start swimming that the
game<00:00:42.719> should<00:00:42.750> start<00:00:43.590> make<00:00:43.770> splashing<00:00:44.460> sounds

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
game should start make splashing sounds

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.430 
game should start make splashing sounds
and<00:00:46.789> yeah<00:00:47.789> that's<00:00:48.030> basically<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.320> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and yeah that's basically it on what it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.950 
and yeah that's basically it on what it
does<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.829> our<00:00:50.250> last<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
does and our last of all you're going to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
does and our last of all you're going to
need<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> post<00:00:52.469> processing<00:00:53.100> volume<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.969> that

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
need a post processing volume what that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.229 
need a post processing volume what that
does<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> tell<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> game<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:58.160> add

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
does it's going to tell the game to add

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
does it's going to tell the game to add
blue<00:01:00.239> effects<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> camera<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.070> depth

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
blue effects to the camera and at depth

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.750 
blue effects to the camera and at depth
blur<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.270> all<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.409> kinds<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> stuff<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
blur and all that kinds of stuff so so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.490 
blur and all that kinds of stuff so so
like<00:01:06.000> purely<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.979> visual<00:01:08.180> underwater

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
like purely the visual underwater

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.320 
like purely the visual underwater
representation<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:11.189> currently<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> small

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
representation I currently have a small

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.940 
representation I currently have a small
test<00:01:12.570> scene<00:01:12.750> set<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.439> an<00:01:13.560> island

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
test scene set up here with an island

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.080 
test scene set up here with an island
and<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.310> dirt<00:01:14.850> plane<00:01:16.369> because<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.700> will<00:01:17.970> make

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and a dirt plane because that will make

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.780 
and a dirt plane because that will make
it<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.330> lot<00:01:18.509> easier<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.229> show<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.340> how<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it a lot easier to show you on how it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.929 
it a lot easier to show you on how it
works<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.990> first<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:23.430> mode<00:01:23.640> tab

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
works so first of all your mode tab

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.200 
works so first of all your mode tab
you're<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> type<00:01:24.869> B<00:01:25.439> P<00:01:26.000> underscore<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
you're going to type B P underscore and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.440 
you're going to type B P underscore and
you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.259> already<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.790> Island<00:01:29.790> water<00:01:30.119> plane

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you can already see Island water plane

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.469 
you can already see Island water plane
you're<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.110> drag<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.439> onto<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:32.040> map

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
you're going to drag that onto your map

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.300 
you're going to drag that onto your map
as<00:01:33.479> soon<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:33.780> you've<00:01:33.930> done<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.320> you'll<00:01:34.979> see

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
as soon as you've done that you'll see

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.480 
as soon as you've done that you'll see
that<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.970> scale<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.869> me<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.320> been<00:01:37.470> set<00:01:37.680> 250

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that the scale for me it's been set 250

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.609 
that the scale for me it's been set 250
150<00:01:39.290> 150<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:40.770> sure<00:01:41.009> yours<00:01:41.430> has<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.150> well

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
150 150 make sure yours has that as well

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.870 
150 150 make sure yours has that as well
probably<00:01:43.619> when<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> add<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> first<00:01:44.640> time

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
probably when you add it the first time

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.520 
probably when you add it the first time
it's<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:45.930> bit<00:01:46.140> different

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it's going to be a little bit different

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.910 
it's going to be a little bit different
so<00:01:46.829> make<00:01:47.220> sure<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.520> change<00:01:47.759> those<00:01:48.030> settings

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
so make sure you change those settings

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.600 
so make sure you change those settings
next<00:01:49.920> up<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:52.229> standard<00:01:52.649> water<00:01:52.920> plane<00:01:53.250> has

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
next up the standard water plane has

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
next up the standard water plane has
some<00:01:53.850> holes<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.659> because<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
some holes in it this is because of the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.069 
some holes in it this is because of the
case<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.770> they<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.070> created<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.240> what<00:01:58.049> I

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
case that they have created so what I

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.990 
case that they have created so what I
have<00:01:58.350> done<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.770> I've<00:01:58.890> created<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.369> solid<00:01:59.820> match

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
have done is I've created a solid match

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.389 
have done is I've created a solid match
which<00:02:00.450> does<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.259> any<00:02:01.530> holes<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.159> so

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
which does not have any holes in it so

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.880 
which does not have any holes in it so
I'm<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> type<00:02:03.000> SM<00:02:03.570> ocean<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.320> I'm

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
I'm going to type SM ocean and I'm

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.570 
I'm going to type SM ocean and I'm
quickly<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.610> replace<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
quickly going to replace the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.880 
quickly going to replace the
standard<00:02:08.360> match<00:02:08.539> with<00:02:08.899> my<00:02:09.050> closed<00:02:09.350> one<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.830> as

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
standard match with my closed one and as

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.360 
standard match with my closed one and as
you<00:02:10.009> can<00:02:10.160> see<00:02:10.220> there<00:02:10.729> is<00:02:10.850> no<00:02:11.090> holes<00:02:11.360> anymore

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
you can see there is no holes anymore

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.949 
you can see there is no holes anymore
that<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.459> basically<00:02:13.760> if<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.390> water<00:02:14.600> plane

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
that is basically if for the water plane

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.010 
that is basically if for the water plane
now<00:02:15.470> I'm<00:02:15.800> gonna<00:02:16.040> go<00:02:16.190> over<00:02:16.370> towards<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.020> water

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
now I'm gonna go over towards the water

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.980 
now I'm gonna go over towards the water
volume<00:02:18.319> I've<00:02:18.800> already<00:02:19.190> created<00:02:19.430> one<00:02:19.870> if<00:02:20.870> you

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
volume I've already created one if you

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.600 
volume I've already created one if you
wanted<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.350> create<00:02:21.560> one<00:02:21.800> yourself<00:02:21.920> here<00:02:22.580> in

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
wanted to create one yourself here in

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.550 
wanted to create one yourself here in
the<00:02:22.760> modes<00:02:22.970> tab<00:02:23.209> you're<00:02:23.480> gonna<00:02:23.600> type<00:02:23.870> physics

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
the modes tab you're gonna type physics

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.980 
the modes tab you're gonna type physics
and<00:02:25.060> there<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.150> have<00:02:26.209> it<00:02:26.330> physics<00:02:26.870> volume

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
and there you have it physics volume

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.960 
and there you have it physics volume
drag<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.680> onto<00:02:27.860> your<00:02:28.130> map<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.459> I<00:02:28.850> would

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
drag that onto your map and I would

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.880 
drag that onto your map and I would
suggest<00:02:29.120> scaling<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.020> with<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.380> brush<00:02:30.620> shape

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
suggest scaling it with the brush shape

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.780 
suggest scaling it with the brush shape
and<00:02:31.130> not<00:02:31.580> with<00:02:32.000> your<00:02:32.180> scaling<00:02:32.480> tool<00:02:33.790> because

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
and not with your scaling tool because

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.660 
and not with your scaling tool because
that<00:02:34.970> could<00:02:37.030> mess<00:02:38.030> some<00:02:38.720> things<00:02:38.989> up<00:02:39.670> anyway

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
that could mess some things up anyway

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.190 
that could mess some things up anyway
once<00:02:41.090> we've<00:02:41.239> got<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.480> one

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
once we've got that one

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.810 
once we've got that one
once<00:02:42.530> you've<00:02:42.650> dragged<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.160> onto<00:02:43.280> your<00:02:43.550> map<00:02:43.670> you

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
once you've dragged it onto your map you

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.540 
once you've dragged it onto your map you
want<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.060> change<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.420> fluid<00:02:44.810> friction<00:02:45.019> to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
want to change the fluid friction to

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.550 
want to change the fluid friction to
0.95<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.880> check<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.900> waterfall<00:02:48.350> you

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
0.95 and check the waterfall you

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.370 
0.95 and check the waterfall you
obviously<00:02:49.550> also<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:50.600> want<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.930> make<00:02:51.350> sure

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
obviously also you want to make sure

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.350 
obviously also you want to make sure

swimmable area because if you do not as
soon<00:03:01.880> as<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.120> leave<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.630> water<00:03:02.870> volume<00:03:03.380> your

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
the game is going to be thinking that

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.690 
the game is going to be thinking that
you're<00:03:05.690> on<00:03:05.810> land<00:03:06.140> again<00:03:06.350> so<00:03:06.920> if<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.190> would<00:03:07.370> cross

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
you're on land again so if I would cross

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.540 
you're on land again so if I would cross
this<00:03:07.910> line<00:03:08.180> right<00:03:08.209> here<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.980> game<00:03:10.130> would<00:03:10.340> just

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
this line right here the game would just

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.699 
this line right here the game would just
put<00:03:11.480> me<00:03:11.600> on<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.870> ground<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.380> would<00:03:12.530> just

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
put me on the ground and I would just

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.289 
put me on the ground and I would just
start<00:03:12.920> walking<00:03:13.100> again<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.700> doesn't<00:03:13.850> matter<00:03:14.060> if

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
start walking again it doesn't matter if

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.110 
start walking again it doesn't matter if
I'm<00:03:14.420> underwater<00:03:14.870> or<00:03:15.079> not<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:16.579> last<00:03:16.790> but<00:03:16.970> not

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
I'm underwater or not and last but not

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.360 
I'm underwater or not and last but not
least<00:03:17.420> you're<00:03:17.870> going<00:03:18.079> to<00:03:18.170> need<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.470> post

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
least you're going to need a post

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.640 
least you're going to need a post

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
that onto your map as well and i've

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.150 
that onto your map as well and i've
already<00:03:26.570> created<00:03:26.900> one<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:30.620> settings<00:03:31.010> of

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
already created one and the settings of

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.880 
already created one and the settings of
this<00:03:31.340> are<00:03:31.870> quite<00:03:32.870> detailed<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:33.590> I'm<00:03:33.680> just

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
this are quite detailed so I'm just

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.319 
this are quite detailed so I'm just
going<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.160> slowly<00:03:35.380> take<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:36.530> guys<00:03:36.620> through<00:03:36.680> it

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
going to slowly take you guys through it

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.850 
going to slowly take you guys through it
but<00:03:38.329> first<00:03:38.540> I'm<00:03:38.690> going<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.959> explain<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.590> the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
but first I'm going to explain it the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.400 
but first I'm going to explain it the
post<00:03:40.130> processing<00:03:40.700> volume<00:03:41.239> as<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.660> can<00:03:41.959> see<00:03:42.200> it

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
post processing volume as you can see it

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.370 
post processing volume as you can see it
adds<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.920> nice<00:03:43.299> underwater<00:03:44.299> blur<00:03:44.690> as<00:03:44.930> soon<00:03:45.260> as

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
adds the nice underwater blur as soon as

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.170 
adds the nice underwater blur as soon as
I<00:03:45.470> leave<00:03:45.650> this<00:03:45.799> area<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.519> can<00:03:46.670> see<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:47.030> turns

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
I leave this area you can see it turns

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.380 
I leave this area you can see it turns
into<00:03:47.480> nothing<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.610> definitely<00:03:49.850> want<00:03:50.299> to

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
into nothing so you definitely want to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.750 
into nothing so you definitely want to
have<00:03:50.570> this<00:03:50.780> in<00:03:51.079> your<00:03:51.290> map<00:03:51.500> otherwise<00:03:52.040> your

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
have this in your map otherwise your

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.030 
have this in your map otherwise your
water<00:03:52.970> will<00:03:53.180> just<00:03:53.209> look<00:03:53.540> pretty<00:03:54.350> crappy<00:03:54.799> in<00:03:54.920> my

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
water will just look pretty crappy in my

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.930 
water will just look pretty crappy in my
opinion<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.650> settings

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
opinion so to the settings

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.360 
opinion so to the settings
you<00:03:59.510> want<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.810> be<00:03:59.930> sure<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.650> your<00:04:00.830> saturation

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
you want to be sure that your saturation

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.950 
you want to be sure that your saturation
