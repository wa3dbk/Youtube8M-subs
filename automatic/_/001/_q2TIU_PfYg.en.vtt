00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.780 

hey<00:00:00.420> everyone<00:00:00.900> here's<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.469> project<00:00:01.770> that<00:00:02.220> built

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hey everyone here's a project that built

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.730 
hey everyone here's a project that built
a<00:00:02.909> while<00:00:03.090> back<00:00:03.360> that<00:00:03.389> resurfaced<00:00:04.230> recently

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
a while back that resurfaced recently

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.249 
a while back that resurfaced recently
this<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> liquid<00:00:06.029> level<00:00:06.480> controller<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.200> I

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
this is a liquid level controller that I

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.919 
this is a liquid level controller that I
originally<00:00:07.500> built<00:00:07.980> for<00:00:08.069> my<00:00:08.519> aquarium<00:00:09.179> so<00:00:09.840> let

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
originally built for my aquarium so let

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.540 
originally built for my aquarium so let
me<00:00:09.990> show<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.200> how<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.440> works<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:11.099> probe<00:00:11.370> is

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
me show you how it works the probe is

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.110 
me show you how it works the probe is
here<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.150> when<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> probe<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.500> water<00:00:14.120> you

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
here and when the probe is in water you

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.730 
here and when the probe is in water you
can<00:00:15.240> see<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.509> status<00:00:15.929> light<00:00:16.139> has<00:00:16.289> gone<00:00:16.529> off

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
can see the status light has gone off

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
can see the status light has gone off
over<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:18.029> soon<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> probe<00:00:18.600> is

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
over here and as soon as the probe is

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.450 
over here and as soon as the probe is
removed<00:00:19.080> from<00:00:19.260> water<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.740> light<00:00:19.949> comes<00:00:20.220> back

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
removed from water the light comes back

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.029 
removed from water the light comes back
on<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> idea<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.800> plug

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
on and so the idea is that you can plug

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.609 
on and so the idea is that you can plug
a<00:00:23.100> water<00:00:23.400> pump<00:00:23.699> into<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.269> electrical<00:00:25.199> outlet

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
a water pump into this electrical outlet

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.099 
a water pump into this electrical outlet
and<00:00:25.830> when<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.970> light<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.720> pump<00:00:27.960> will

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and when the light is on the pump will

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.990 
and when the light is on the pump will
be<00:00:28.230> running<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.250> will<00:00:29.340> pump<00:00:29.640> water<00:00:29.849> into

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
be running so it will pump water into

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.330 
be running so it will pump water into
the<00:00:30.480> aquarium<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.170> when<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> level<00:00:32.160> gets

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the aquarium and when the level gets

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.580 
the aquarium and when the level gets
high<00:00:32.489> enough<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.820> shuts<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> pump<00:00:33.420> off<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
high enough it shuts the pump off so

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.020 
high enough it shuts the pump off so
this<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.860> handy<00:00:35.160> because<00:00:35.340> aquariums

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
this is handy because aquariums

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.930 
this is handy because aquariums
evaporate<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> lot<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.960> water<00:00:37.640> surprisingly<00:00:38.640> of

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
evaporate a lot of water surprisingly of

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.150 
evaporate a lot of water surprisingly of
the<00:00:39.420> high<00:00:39.600> amount<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.440> reef<00:00:40.590> aquariums

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the high amount so for reef aquariums

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.880 
the high amount so for reef aquariums
that<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.430> high<00:00:42.239> intensity<00:00:42.570> lighting<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.710> can

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that have high intensity lighting it can

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.680 
that have high intensity lighting it can
be<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> cup<00:00:44.280> or<00:00:44.399> two<00:00:44.460> per<00:00:44.879> day<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.629> is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
be a cup or two per day so this is

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.500 
be a cup or two per day so this is
actually<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.140> nice<00:00:46.350> time<00:00:46.620> saver<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.420> as

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
actually a really nice time saver so as

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.700 
actually a really nice time saver so as
you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.079> part<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you can see this part of it at the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.959 
you can see this part of it at the
bottom<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> commercially<00:00:50.940> available

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
bottom here is a commercially available

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.450 
bottom here is a commercially available
unit<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.170> got<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.530> surplus<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.280> Hall

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
unit and I got this one surplus at Hall

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.850 
unit and I got this one surplus at Hall
Ted<00:00:53.750> but<00:00:54.750> later<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.020> needed<00:00:55.320> more<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.559> these<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
Ted but later I needed more of these and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.920 
Ted but later I needed more of these and
got<00:00:56.010> them<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.250> eBay<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.670> fairly<00:00:57.239> cheap<00:00:57.270> in

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
got them on eBay for fairly cheap in

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.270 
got them on eBay for fairly cheap in
fact<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.379> got<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.559> whole<00:00:58.829> brick<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.160> them

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
fact I have got a whole brick of them

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.549 
fact I have got a whole brick of them
but<00:00:59.370> I'll<00:00:59.460> talk<00:00:59.579> about<00:00:59.640> these<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> minute

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
but I'll talk about these in a minute

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.939 
but I'll talk about these in a minute
this<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> Kean's<00:01:02.340> fSV<00:01:03.120> 11<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.799> got

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
this is a Kean's fSV 11 and it's got

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.050 
this is a Kean's fSV 11 and it's got
this<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.159> thing<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:05.729> there's<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
this little thing here there's the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
this little thing here there's the
nameplate<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.470> idea<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.130> this

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
nameplate and the idea is that this

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.390 
nameplate and the idea is that this
thing<00:01:08.549> generates<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.360> light<00:01:09.990> signal<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.710> sends

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thing generates a light signal and sends

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.550 
thing generates a light signal and sends
the<00:01:11.520> light<00:01:11.549> out<00:01:11.909> via<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.240> plastic<00:01:12.840> fiber-optic

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the light out via a plastic fiber-optic

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.039 
the light out via a plastic fiber-optic
and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> light<00:01:14.909> returns<00:01:15.150> via<00:01:15.780> another

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and then the light returns via another

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.630 
and then the light returns via another
plastic<00:01:16.380> fiber<00:01:16.830> optic<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.460> thing

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
plastic fiber optic and this thing

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.719 
plastic fiber optic and this thing
measures<00:01:17.939> how<00:01:18.119> much<00:01:18.270> light<00:01:18.540> comes<00:01:18.570> back<00:01:19.729> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
measures how much light comes back so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.789 
measures how much light comes back so
when<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> probe<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.479> water<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:22.049> low<00:01:22.500> amount

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
when the probe is in water a low amount

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
when the probe is in water a low amount
of<00:01:22.950> light<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.310> coming<00:01:23.640> back<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.150> when<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
of light is coming back and when the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.170 
of light is coming back and when the
probe<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.140> out<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.350> water<00:01:25.799> much<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:26.759> light

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
probe is out of water much more light

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.300 
probe is out of water much more light
comes<00:01:27.479> back<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.049> then<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.650> thing<00:01:28.860> uses<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
comes back and then this thing uses the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.770 
comes back and then this thing uses the
difference<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> decide<00:01:30.150> whether<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.509> throw<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
difference to decide whether to throw a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.469 
difference to decide whether to throw a
switch<00:01:31.079> or<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.880> what's<00:01:32.880> pretty<00:01:33.090> cool<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.450> that

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
switch or not what's pretty cool is that

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.510 
switch or not what's pretty cool is that
the<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:34.500> controller<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.310> very

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the little controller here is very

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
the little controller here is very
configurable<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.630> use<00:01:36.780> these<00:01:36.930> up/down

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
configurable so I can use these up/down

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.260 
configurable so I can use these up/down
keys<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.920> set<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:38.340> my<00:01:38.460> threshold<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.090> going

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
keys to set what my threshold is going

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.749 
keys to set what my threshold is going
to<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:40.500> dial<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.890> thing<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.310> down<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
to be can dial this thing up and down I

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.550 
to be can dial this thing up and down I
think<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.180> has<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> resolution<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.990> 0<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> about

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
think it has a resolution of 0 to about

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.850 
think it has a resolution of 0 to about
4,000<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:45.390> when<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> probe<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
4,000 and so when the probe is in the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.020 
4,000 and so when the probe is in the
water<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.520> we're<00:01:47.700> getting<00:01:47.790> an

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
water you can see we're getting an

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.139 
water you can see we're getting an
arbitrary<00:01:48.810> value<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.530> 70<00:01:50.070> back<00:01:50.310> or<00:01:50.579> 65

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
arbitrary value of like 70 back or 65

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.200 
arbitrary value of like 70 back or 65
and<00:01:52.020> when<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.380> air<00:01:52.560> we're<00:01:52.799> getting<00:01:53.210> 650

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and when it's in air we're getting 650

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.389 
and when it's in air we're getting 650
so<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.200> could<00:01:55.320> set<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> threshold<00:01:56.070> anywhere

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
so we could set the threshold anywhere

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.069 
so we could set the threshold anywhere
between<00:01:56.729> those<00:01:56.880> values<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.570> get<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> work

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
between those values and get it to work

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.740 
between those values and get it to work
and<00:01:58.549> then<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.700> thing<00:01:59.880> has<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.299> whole<00:02:00.479> bunch<00:02:00.659> of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and then this thing has a whole bunch of

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.649 
and then this thing has a whole bunch of
other<00:02:00.930> modes<00:02:01.200> too<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.790> set<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.450> can

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
other modes too you can set it can

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.240 
other modes too you can set it can
output<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> pulse<00:02:04.409> or<00:02:04.619> something<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.189> you

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
output like a pulse or something and you

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.459 
output like a pulse or something and you
can<00:02:05.369> check<00:02:05.610> whether<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.540> Reta<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.079> output

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
can check whether the Reta the output

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.499 
can check whether the Reta the output
switch<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.890> beyond<00:02:08.190> when<00:02:08.910> there's<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.239> lot<00:02:09.420> of

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
switch to beyond when there's a lot of

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.180 
switch to beyond when there's a lot of
light<00:02:09.690> coming<00:02:10.020> back<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.440> vice-versa<00:02:10.739> when

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
light coming back or vice-versa when

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.920 
light coming back or vice-versa when
it's<00:02:11.310> not<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> lot<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.760> light<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.780> gets

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
it's not a lot of light and it gets

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.020 
it's not a lot of light and it gets
fairly<00:02:13.260> complicated

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
fairly complicated

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.010 
fairly complicated
one<00:02:15.030> thing<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.450> thing<00:02:15.660> does<00:02:15.810> which<00:02:15.990> is

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
one thing that this thing does which is

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.410 
one thing that this thing does which is
pretty<00:02:16.319> nifty<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.520> actually<00:02:17.880> outputs<00:02:18.330> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
pretty nifty is it it actually outputs a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.449 
pretty nifty is it it actually outputs a
pulse<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.870> light<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.380> then<00:02:19.920> measures<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
pulse of light and then measures the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.790 
pulse of light and then measures the
return<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.240> then<00:02:21.750> subtracts<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.470> return

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
return and then subtracts the return

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.100 
return and then subtracts the return
from<00:02:23.130> when<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.790> when<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.240> pulse<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.690> not<00:02:24.870> on

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
from when and when the pulse is not on

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.250 
from when and when the pulse is not on
so<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:25.920> sort<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.220> differential<00:02:26.670> sensor<00:02:27.330> if

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
so it's sort of a differential sensor if

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.870 
so it's sort of a differential sensor if
this<00:02:28.470> thing<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.830> outputs<00:02:29.220> steady<00:02:29.490> steady

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
this thing just outputs steady steady

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.150 
this thing just outputs steady steady
light<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.480> then<00:02:30.959> measure<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.410> return<00:02:31.680> value

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
light and then measure the return value

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.040 
light and then measure the return value
if<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.760> wave<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.209> around<00:02:33.510> near<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> light

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
if I wave this around near a light

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.500 
if I wave this around near a light
source<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.580> value<00:02:35.910> would<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.060> going<00:02:36.390> up

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
source the the value would be going up

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.170 
source the the value would be going up
and<00:02:36.660> down<00:02:37.280> it's<00:02:38.280> changing<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.730> little<00:02:38.910> bit<00:02:39.030> now

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
and down it's changing a little bit now

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.610 
and down it's changing a little bit now
because<00:02:39.420> if<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.600> bend<00:02:39.810> these<00:02:39.989> fibers<00:02:40.470> you'll

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
because if you bend these fibers you'll

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.330 
because if you bend these fibers you'll
get<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:41.070> difference<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> return<00:02:42.800> but<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
get a a difference in the return but the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.699 
get a a difference in the return but the
susceptibility<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.239> ambient<00:02:46.110> light<00:02:46.410> would<00:02:46.590> be

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
susceptibility to ambient light would be

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.650 
susceptibility to ambient light would be
much<00:02:46.890> worse<00:02:47.100> if<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.459> didn't<00:02:47.700> pulse<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.239> output

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
much worse if it didn't pulse the output

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.170 
much worse if it didn't pulse the output
and<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:49.200> do<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.380> differential<00:02:49.940> reading<00:02:50.940> just

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
and then do a differential reading just

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.820 
and then do a differential reading just
so<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.510> only<00:02:51.810> seeing<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.380> light<00:02:52.620> from

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
so that it's only seeing the light from

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.910 
so that it's only seeing the light from
its<00:02:53.040> output<00:02:53.519> pulse<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.900> sensor<00:02:55.290> itself<00:02:55.470> is

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
its output pulse the sensor itself is

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.070 
its output pulse the sensor itself is
made<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.400> piece<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.730> acrylic<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.720> turned

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
made of a piece of acrylic that I turned

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.670 
made of a piece of acrylic that I turned
on<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.410> lathe<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.700> just<00:02:59.910> cut<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.440> 45<00:03:01.440> degree

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
on the lathe and I just cut a 45 degree

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.650 
on the lathe and I just cut a 45 degree
half<00:03:02.040> angle<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.730> total<00:03:03.000> thing<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.300> ninety

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
half angle so the total thing is ninety

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.800 
half angle so the total thing is ninety
here<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.110> then<00:03:04.950> drilled<00:03:05.250> some<00:03:05.459> holes<00:03:05.810> farther

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
here and then drilled some holes farther

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.900 
here and then drilled some holes farther
up<00:03:07.050> where<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.350> could<00:03:07.560> push<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.980> plastic<00:03:08.489> fibers

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
up where I could push the plastic fibers

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.390 
up where I could push the plastic fibers
into<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.510> sort<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.590> conical<00:03:10.980> prison

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
into this sort of a conical prison

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.970 
into this sort of a conical prison
almost<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.870> light<00:03:13.050> comes<00:03:13.350> out<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.709> one

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
almost so the light comes out of one

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.060 
almost so the light comes out of one
fiber<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.760> can<00:03:14.820> almost<00:03:15.060> see<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.980> see<00:03:16.980> it

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
fiber you can almost see it see it

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.060 
fiber you can almost see it see it
coming<00:03:17.340> out<00:03:17.430> there<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.380> reflects<00:03:19.380> internally

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
coming out there and reflects internally

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.460 
coming out there and reflects internally
to<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.700> other<00:03:20.850> face<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.510> cone<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.049> then

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
to the other face of the cone and then

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.340 
to the other face of the cone and then
back<00:03:22.709> out<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.250> receiving<00:03:23.820> fiber<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:25.200> when

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
back out this receiving fiber so when

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.319 
back out this receiving fiber so when
this<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.590> dunked<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.100> water<00:03:26.130> or<00:03:26.880> almost<00:03:27.090> any

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
this is dunked in water or almost any

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.949 
this is dunked in water or almost any
liquid<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.410> light<00:03:29.180> scatters<00:03:30.180> off<00:03:30.390> into<00:03:30.840> the

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
liquid the light scatters off into the

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.860 
liquid the light scatters off into the
into<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.500> liquid<00:03:31.709> when<00:03:32.579> it's<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.880> air<00:03:33.180> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
into the liquid when it's in air the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.900 
into the liquid when it's in air the
light<00:03:34.079> is<00:03:34.290> reflected<00:03:34.950> due<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.190> total<00:03:35.340> internal

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
light is reflected due to total internal

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.440 
light is reflected due to total internal
reflection

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
reflection

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.160 
reflection
so<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:37.860> sensor<00:03:38.390> makes<00:03:39.390> use<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.930> fact

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
so this sensor makes use of the fact

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.630 
so this sensor makes use of the fact
that<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.440> love<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.950> properties<00:03:41.459> at<00:03:41.610> the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
that the love that the properties at the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.400 
that the love that the properties at the
surface<00:03:42.120> between<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.510> plastic<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
surface between the plastic and the

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.800 
surface between the plastic and the
water<00:03:43.620> change<00:03:44.329> optically<00:03:45.329> because<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
water change optically because of the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.319 
water change optically because of the
index<00:03:46.079> of<00:03:46.230> refraction<00:03:46.260> there<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.880> it's<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.120> very

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
index of refraction there so it's a very

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.539 
index of refraction there so it's a very
robust<00:03:49.049> sensor<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:49.709> actually<00:03:50.040> hard<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.340> fool

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
robust sensor it's actually hard to fool

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.660 
robust sensor it's actually hard to fool
this<00:03:50.820> because<00:03:51.440> it's<00:03:52.440> it's<00:03:52.829> sort<00:03:53.070> of<00:03:53.190> sensing

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
this because it's it's sort of sensing

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.509 
this because it's it's sort of sensing
in<00:03:53.790> this<00:03:53.940> entire<00:03:54.269> area<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.930> cone<00:03:55.200> here<00:03:55.590> so

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
in this entire area of the cone here so

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.220 
in this entire area of the cone here so
the<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.120> level<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.660> water<00:03:57.840> has<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.200> come

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
the the level that the water has to come

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.319 
the the level that the water has to come
up<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.739> make<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.040> light<00:03:59.220> diminish<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.090> the

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
up to to make the light diminish to the

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.620 
up to to make the light diminish to the
threshold<00:04:00.870> value<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.320> very<00:04:01.530> repeatable<00:04:02.040> and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
threshold value is very repeatable and

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.850 
threshold value is very repeatable and
there's<00:04:03.630> no<00:04:03.750> moving<00:04:03.989> parts<00:04:04.410> in<00:04:04.530> here<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.769> this

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
there's no moving parts in here and this

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.039 
there's no moving parts in here and this
thing<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.130> essentially<00:04:05.579> sealed<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:06.810> there's

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
thing is essentially sealed so there's

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.259 
thing is essentially sealed so there's
it's<00:04:07.350> it's<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.650> very<00:04:07.829> high<00:04:08.430> quality<00:04:08.489> robust

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
it's it's a very high quality robust

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.610 
it's it's a very high quality robust
sensor<00:04:11.600> you<00:04:12.600> might<00:04:12.780> notice<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.170> little<00:04:13.350> bit<00:04:13.530> of

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
sensor you might notice a little bit of

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.680 
sensor you might notice a little bit of
crud<00:04:13.890> here<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:14.730> was<00:04:14.940> installed<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:15.570> my

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
crud here this was installed in my

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.750 
crud here this was installed in my
aquarium<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.289> so<00:04:16.440> there's<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.680> lot<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:16.979> calcium

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
aquarium and so there's a lot of calcium

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.940 
aquarium and so there's a lot of calcium
deposits<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.750> sort<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:18.989> dead<00:04:19.169> algae<00:04:19.350> on<00:04:19.680> there

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
deposits and sort of dead algae on there

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.529 
deposits and sort of dead algae on there
surprisingly<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:21.030> doesn't<00:04:21.299> even<00:04:21.419> affect

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
surprisingly that doesn't even affect

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.719 
surprisingly that doesn't even affect
the<00:04:21.870> sensor<00:04:22.200> very<00:04:22.349> much<00:04:22.620> because<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.220> algae

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
the sensor very much because the algae

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.379 
the sensor very much because the algae
in<00:04:23.940> the

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
in the

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.290 
in the
calcium<00:04:25.319> deposits<00:04:25.889> don't<00:04:26.669> cause<00:04:26.909> the<00:04:27.120> light

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
calcium deposits don't cause the light

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.420 
calcium deposits don't cause the light
to<00:04:27.449> be<00:04:27.569> scattered<00:04:27.960> away<00:04:28.139> like<00:04:28.379> the<00:04:28.530> water<00:04:28.740> so

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
to be scattered away like the water so

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.679 
to be scattered away like the water so
it<00:04:29.580> doesn't<00:04:29.849> cause<00:04:29.999> the<00:04:30.180> sensor<00:04:30.539> to<00:04:30.659> be

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
it doesn't cause the sensor to be

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.309 
it doesn't cause the sensor to be
sensitive<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.650> false<00:04:31.979> positives<00:04:33.169> so<00:04:34.169> this

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
sensitive to false positives so this

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.050 
sensitive to false positives so this
type<00:04:34.529> of<00:04:34.560> fiber-optic<00:04:35.039> has<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.550> one<00:04:35.849> millimeter

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
type of fiber-optic has a one millimeter

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.140 
type of fiber-optic has a one millimeter
diameter<00:04:36.509> acrylic<00:04:37.469> core<00:04:37.800> it's<00:04:38.069> PMMA<00:04:38.669> poly

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
diameter acrylic core it's PMMA poly

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.420 
diameter acrylic core it's PMMA poly
methyl<00:04:39.389> methacrylate<00:04:39.689> and<00:04:40.409> then<00:04:41.159> it<00:04:41.279> has<00:04:41.400> a

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
methyl methacrylate and then it has a

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.159 
methyl methacrylate and then it has a
jacket<00:04:41.849> on<00:04:41.909> the<00:04:42.060> outside<00:04:42.449> that's<00:04:42.659> some<00:04:43.020> other

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
jacket on the outside that's some other

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.260 
jacket on the outside that's some other
kind<00:04:43.439> of<00:04:43.499> plastic<00:04:44.039> but<00:04:44.610> it's<00:04:44.729> very<00:04:44.849> easy<00:04:44.969> to

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
kind of plastic but it's very easy to

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.879 
kind of plastic but it's very easy to
snip<00:04:45.569> this<00:04:45.719> with<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:45.960> pair<00:04:46.199> of<00:04:46.229> scissors<00:04:46.529> and

snip this with a pair of scissors and

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.360 
snip this with a pair of scissors and

there's<00:05:07.469> a<00:05:07.529> much<00:05:07.680> fatter<00:05:08.750> outer<00:05:09.750> rubber

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
there's a much fatter outer rubber

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:11.959 
there's a much fatter outer rubber
jacket<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:10.949> then<00:05:11.039> inside<00:05:11.490> it's<00:05:11.729> basically

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969 
jacket and then inside it's basically

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.360 
jacket and then inside it's basically
the<00:05:12.150> same<00:05:12.330> as<00:05:12.569> the<00:05:12.779> stuff<00:05:13.590> that<00:05:13.770> I've<00:05:13.860> got<00:05:14.069> here

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
the same as the stuff that I've got here

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.159 
the same as the stuff that I've got here
at<00:05:14.460> this<00:05:14.580> point<00:05:14.789> it's<00:05:15.029> kind<00:05:15.240> of<00:05:15.839> the<00:05:15.960> same

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
at this point it's kind of the same

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.119 
at this point it's kind of the same
thing<00:05:16.589> and<00:05:18.500> for<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.589> money<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.830> mean<00:05:20.039> you

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
thing and for the money I mean you

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.179 
thing and for the money I mean you
really<00:05:20.310> can't<00:05:20.639> beat<00:05:20.849> it<00:05:20.879> this<00:05:21.449> is<00:05:21.569> what<00:05:21.719> the

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:22.189 
really can't beat it this is what the

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.409 
really can't beat it this is what the
Toslink<00:05:23.189> end<00:05:23.430> looks<00:05:23.669> like<00:05:23.909> and<00:05:24.120> if<00:05:24.180> you<00:05:24.270> just

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
Toslink end looks like and if you just

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:25.640 
Toslink end looks like and if you just
chop<00:05:24.629> that<00:05:24.810> off<00:05:24.960> that's<00:05:25.199> what<00:05:25.319> you've<00:05:25.469> got

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
chop that off that's what you've got

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.579 
chop that off that's what you've got
inside<00:05:26.039> I<00:05:26.810> don't<00:05:27.810> know<00:05:28.020> if<00:05:28.110> these<00:05:28.199> are<00:05:28.379> still

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:28.589 
inside I don't know if these are still

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.579 
inside I don't know if these are still
available<00:05:28.620> on<00:05:29.189> eBay<00:05:29.580> but<00:05:30.360> for<00:05:31.199> a<00:05:31.229> while<00:05:31.379> these

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:31.589 
available on eBay but for a while these

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.829 
available on eBay but for a while these
are<00:05:31.770> fairly<00:05:32.009> cheap<00:05:32.159> on<00:05:32.550> there<00:05:32.759> -<00:05:33.000> and<00:05:33.270> what<00:05:33.750> you

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:33.839 
are fairly cheap on there - and what you

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.149 
are fairly cheap on there - and what you
do<00:05:33.930> is<00:05:34.050> you<00:05:34.110> just<00:05:34.169> open<00:05:34.589> this<00:05:34.710> thing<00:05:34.919> up<00:05:35.039> and

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
do is you just open this thing up and

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.369 
do is you just open this thing up and
push<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.550> fibers<00:05:35.969> in<00:05:36.180> here<00:05:36.659> and<00:05:36.839> then<00:05:37.110> clamp

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
push the fibers in here and then clamp

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.920 
push the fibers in here and then clamp
it<00:05:37.589> shut<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.129> set<00:05:39.120> your<00:05:39.240> threshold<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:39.839> you

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
it shut and set your threshold and you

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.600 
it shut and set your threshold and you
do<00:05:40.169> all<00:05:40.319> kinds<00:05:40.589> of<00:05:40.620> interesting<00:05:40.710> sensing<00:05:41.490> with

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
do all kinds of interesting sensing with

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.700 
do all kinds of interesting sensing with
these<00:05:41.819> so<00:05:42.659> for<00:05:42.839> example<00:05:43.199> you<00:05:43.289> can<00:05:43.439> have<00:05:43.469> the

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
these so for example you can have the

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.010 
these so for example you can have the
two<00:05:43.860> fibers<00:05:44.389> aiming<00:05:45.389> out<00:05:45.539> in<00:05:45.719> the<00:05:45.839> same

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
two fibers aiming out in the same

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.189 
two fibers aiming out in the same
direction<00:05:46.259> and<00:05:46.800> then<00:05:47.370> if<00:05:47.460> you've<00:05:47.580> got<00:05:47.759> like<00:05:47.909> a

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
direction and then if you've got like a

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.110 
direction and then if you've got like a
an<00:05:49.199> automated<00:05:49.669> production<00:05:50.669> line<00:05:50.909> or

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
an automated production line or

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.480 
an automated production line or
something<00:05:51.449> like<00:05:51.599> that<00:05:52.189> and<00:05:53.189> you<00:05:53.279> want<00:05:53.370> to

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
something like that and you want to

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.040 
something like that and you want to
sense<00:05:53.729> whether<00:05:53.939> an<00:05:54.120> object<00:05:54.210> is<00:05:54.509> going<00:05:54.689> by<00:05:54.990> you

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
sense whether an object is going by you

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.469 
sense whether an object is going by you
on<00:05:55.409> the<00:05:55.439> conveyor<00:05:55.800> belt<00:05:55.919> when<00:05:56.639> the<00:05:56.849> reflection

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
on the conveyor belt when the reflection

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:58.969 
on the conveyor belt when the reflection
hits<00:05:57.689> the<00:05:57.839> receiver<00:05:58.139> fiber<00:05:58.469> you<00:05:58.710> can<00:05:58.830> have

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
hits the receiver fiber you can have

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.149 
hits the receiver fiber you can have
this<00:05:59.159> trigger<00:05:59.639> something<00:06:00.149> if<00:06:00.710> you<00:06:01.710> do<00:06:01.889> want<00:06:02.099> to

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159 
this trigger something if you do want to

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:04.459 
this trigger something if you do want to
prep<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.610> end<00:06:02.759> of<00:06:02.939> one<00:06:03.060> of<00:06:03.180> these<00:06:03.270> fibers<00:06:03.599> one

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
prep the end of one of these fibers one

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:05.839 
prep the end of one of these fibers one
thing<00:06:04.680> that<00:06:04.800> helps<00:06:05.039> a<00:06:05.129> lot<00:06:05.250> you<00:06:05.460> can<00:06:05.580> just<00:06:05.729> cut

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
thing that helps a lot you can just cut

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.850 
thing that helps a lot you can just cut
it<00:06:05.969> with<00:06:06.000> a<00:06:06.120> pair<00:06:06.210> of<00:06:06.419> scissors<00:06:06.689> and<00:06:07.139> then<00:06:07.770> if

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
it with a pair of scissors and then if

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.769 
it with a pair of scissors and then if
you<00:06:07.979> make<00:06:08.129> a<00:06:08.159> polishing<00:06:08.789> puck<00:06:09.089> like<00:06:09.330> this<00:06:09.569> what

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:09.779 
you make a polishing puck like this what

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:12.019 
you make a polishing puck like this what
you<00:06:09.899> can<00:06:10.020> do<00:06:10.139> is<00:06:10.289> put<00:06:10.500> the<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:11.399> fiber<00:06:11.669> through

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
you can do is put the the fiber through

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.119 
you can do is put the the fiber through
the<00:06:12.149> polishing<00:06:12.659> puck<00:06:12.930> so<00:06:13.110> that<00:06:13.229> it's<00:06:13.349> coming

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:14.129 
the polishing puck so that it's coming

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:16.670 
the polishing puck so that it's coming
out<00:06:14.310> the<00:06:14.490> other<00:06:14.520> end<00:06:14.879> just<00:06:15.089> slightly<00:06:15.629> and<00:06:15.990> then

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
out the other end just slightly and then

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.350 
out the other end just slightly and then
put<00:06:16.919> that<00:06:16.949> down<00:06:17.310> onto<00:06:17.490> a<00:06:17.610> piece<00:06:17.849> of<00:06:18.000> sandpaper

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
put that down onto a piece of sandpaper

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.619 
put that down onto a piece of sandpaper
and<00:06:18.870> with<00:06:19.020> water<00:06:19.789> move<00:06:20.789> the<00:06:20.939> puck<00:06:21.120> around<00:06:21.240> like

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:21.629 
and with water move the puck around like

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.809 
and with water move the puck around like
this<00:06:21.839> to<00:06:22.139> polish<00:06:22.649> the<00:06:22.830> end<00:06:23.009> of<00:06:23.159> the<00:06:23.250> fiber<00:06:23.520> and

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
this to polish the end of the fiber and

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.579 
this to polish the end of the fiber and
the<00:06:23.879> puck<00:06:24.539> will<00:06:24.719> make<00:06:24.870> sure<00:06:25.080> that<00:06:25.229> the<00:06:25.379> fiber

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:25.589 
the puck will make sure that the fiber

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:27.709 
the puck will make sure that the fiber
stays<00:06:25.949> perpendicular<00:06:26.789> to<00:06:26.819> the<00:06:27.120> surface<00:06:27.539> of

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:27.719 
stays perpendicular to the surface of

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:29.600 
stays perpendicular to the surface of
the<00:06:27.810> sandpaper<00:06:28.259> and<00:06:28.620> you<00:06:29.310> can<00:06:29.460> use<00:06:29.580> just

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
the sandpaper and you can use just

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.459 
the sandpaper and you can use just
standard<00:06:30.120> wet/dry<00:06:30.509> sandpaper<00:06:30.839> probably

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:31.469 
standard wet/dry sandpaper probably

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:33.019 
standard wet/dry sandpaper probably
start<00:06:31.740> with<00:06:31.830> something<00:06:32.039> fairly<00:06:32.519> coarse<00:06:32.759> like

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
start with something fairly coarse like

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:34.820 
start with something fairly coarse like
320<00:06:33.659> because<00:06:34.169> when<00:06:34.319> you<00:06:34.379> cut<00:06:34.529> this<00:06:34.649> with<00:06:34.769> a

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
320 because when you cut this with a

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.700 
320 because when you cut this with a
scissor<00:06:35.129> you'll<00:06:35.339> have<00:06:35.459> a<00:06:35.519> very<00:06:35.729> rough<00:06:35.940> edge

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
scissor you'll have a very rough edge

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.180 
scissor you'll have a very rough edge
and<00:06:36.800> then<00:06:37.220> work<00:06:37.760> your<00:06:37.910> way<00:06:38.000> all<00:06:38.030> the<00:06:38.300> way<00:06:38.330> up<00:06:38.510> to

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
and then work your way all the way up to

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.950 
and then work your way all the way up to
1500<00:06:40.190> or<00:06:40.310> even<00:06:40.520> 600<00:06:40.820> these<00:06:41.450> things<00:06:41.690> are<00:06:41.810> not

super high optical quality the fact that

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.420 
super high optical quality the fact that
the<00:06:44.990> fiber<00:06:45.200> is<00:06:45.440> a<00:06:45.470> whole<00:06:45.680> millimeter<00:06:46.220> in

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
the fiber is a whole millimeter in

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.550 
the fiber is a whole millimeter in
diameter<00:06:46.930> means<00:06:47.930> that<00:06:48.140> you<00:06:48.200> don't<00:06:48.290> have<00:06:48.470> to

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
diameter means that you don't have to

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.720 
diameter means that you don't have to
get<00:06:48.680> very<00:06:48.950> good<00:06:50.530> and<00:06:51.530> kind<00:06:51.710> of<00:06:51.800> see<00:06:51.980> when<00:06:52.100> I<00:06:52.130> aim

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730 
get very good and kind of see when I aim

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.400 
get very good and kind of see when I aim
the<00:06:53.000> fiber<00:06:53.210> up<00:06:53.420> the<00:06:53.630> fluorescent<00:06:54.110> light<00:06:54.260> on

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
the fiber up the fluorescent light on

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.600 
the fiber up the fluorescent light on
the<00:06:54.500> ceiling<00:06:54.830> you<00:06:54.950> can<00:06:54.980> kind<00:06:55.250> of<00:06:55.280> see<00:06:55.490> it

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
the ceiling you can kind of see it

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.370 
the ceiling you can kind of see it
coming<00:06:56.270> out<00:06:56.360> the<00:06:56.570> end<00:06:56.600> there

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.990 

these<00:07:00.380> Qian's<00:07:00.800> devices<00:07:01.310> have<00:07:01.550> an<00:07:01.670> open

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 
these Qian's devices have an open

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.270 
these Qian's devices have an open
collector<00:07:02.300> output<00:07:02.960> so<00:07:03.710> what<00:07:03.860> I<00:07:03.890> did<00:07:04.070> is<00:07:04.190> I

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
collector output so what I did is I

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.160 
collector output so what I did is I
wired<00:07:04.550> this<00:07:04.730> up<00:07:04.910> with<00:07:05.060> a<00:07:05.090> solid-state<00:07:05.720> relay

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.170 
wired this up with a solid-state relay

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.200 
wired this up with a solid-state relay
and<00:07:06.440> the<00:07:07.010> relay<00:07:07.340> just<00:07:07.580> triggers<00:07:07.970> this

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
and the relay just triggers this

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.390 
and the relay just triggers this
electrical<00:07:08.750> outlet<00:07:09.140> here<00:07:09.440> and<00:07:09.650> inside<00:07:10.160> here

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
electrical outlet here and inside here

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.070 
electrical outlet here and inside here
there's<00:07:10.580> a<00:07:10.640> low-voltage<00:07:11.090> power<00:07:11.330> supply<00:07:11.870> these

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
there's a low-voltage power supply these

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.180 
there's a low-voltage power supply these
things<00:07:12.290> will<00:07:12.410> run<00:07:12.590> 12<00:07:13.460> to<00:07:13.610> 24<00:07:14.060> volts<00:07:14.390> DC<00:07:14.570> and

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.190 
things will run 12 to 24 volts DC and

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.420 
things will run 12 to 24 volts DC and
the<00:07:16.190> solid-state<00:07:17.090> relay<00:07:17.450> can<00:07:18.050> accept<00:07:18.410> 3<00:07:19.010> 230

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 
the solid-state relay can accept 3 230

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.580 
the solid-state relay can accept 3 230
volts<00:07:19.820> on<00:07:19.940> its<00:07:20.090> input<00:07:20.270> side<00:07:20.720> so<00:07:21.410> there's

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.590 
volts on its input side so there's

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.840 
volts on its input side so there's
really<00:07:21.740> very<00:07:21.830> little<00:07:22.190> circuitry<00:07:22.730> inside

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:22.850 
really very little circuitry inside

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.720 
really very little circuitry inside
there<00:07:23.330> there's<00:07:23.870> just<00:07:24.110> an<00:07:24.200> AC<00:07:24.350> power<00:07:24.650> cord<00:07:25.100> and

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:25.730 
there there's just an AC power cord and

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.460 
there there's just an AC power cord and
then<00:07:25.940> the<00:07:26.120> fiber<00:07:26.810> optics<00:07:28.840> alright<00:07:29.840> hope<00:07:30.290> that

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.470 
then the fiber optics alright hope that

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.150 
then the fiber optics alright hope that
was<00:07:30.590> helpful

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 
was helpful

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.660 
was helpful
see<00:07:31.520> you<00:07:31.700> next<00:07:31.910> time<00:07:32.120> bye
