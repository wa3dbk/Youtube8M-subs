00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
now

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.590 
now
and<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.039> know<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.250> 2006<00:00:17.910> Deering<00:00:18.300> came<00:00:18.480> out

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
and as you know in 2006 Deering came out

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.390 
and as you know in 2006 Deering came out
with<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.810> O<00:00:18.840> six<00:00:19.260> tone<00:00:19.529> ring<00:00:19.830> which<00:00:20.039> they<00:00:20.250> use

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
on all of their models I think they have

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.070 
on all of their models I think they have
the<00:00:22.500> 2010<00:00:22.980> tone<00:00:23.279> ring<00:00:23.519> now<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.570> O<00:00:24.600> six<00:00:24.869> was

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the 2010 tone ring now but the O six was
