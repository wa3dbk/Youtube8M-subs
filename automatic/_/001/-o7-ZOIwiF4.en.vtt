some dehydrated croutons those are great

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.440

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.600 

sometimes<00:03:48.510> it's<00:03:48.690> easier<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.080> cut<00:03:49.440> corn<00:03:49.800> with<00:03:50.580> a

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
sometimes it's easier to cut corn with a

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.160 
sometimes it's easier to cut corn with a
serrated<00:03:51.060> knife<00:03:53.420> just<00:03:54.420> cut<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.630> corn<00:03:54.959> off<00:03:55.140> the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
serrated knife just cut the corn off the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.000 
serrated knife just cut the corn off the
stock<00:03:57.950> not<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.100> cob<00:03:59.480> there<00:04:00.480> we<00:04:00.690> go<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.440> put

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
stock not the cob there we go and put

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.170 
stock not the cob there we go and put
that<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.250> your<00:04:02.280> soup<00:04:02.550> when<00:04:02.700> you're<00:04:02.820> done<00:04:02.940> and

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
that in your soup when you're done and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.750 
that in your soup when you're done and
we<00:04:03.900> mix<00:04:04.080> this<00:04:04.290> together<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.400> can<00:04:05.550> run

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
we mix this together and you can run

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.940 
we mix this together and you can run
your<00:04:05.940> Vitamix<00:04:06.690> for<00:04:07.020> about<00:04:07.200> two<00:04:07.470> minutes<00:04:07.620> and

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
your Vitamix for about two minutes and

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.310 
your Vitamix for about two minutes and
it<00:04:08.010> warms<00:04:08.250> up<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.550> soup<00:04:08.880> but<00:04:09.840> if<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.020> run<00:04:10.200> it

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
it warms up the soup but if you run it

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.140 
it warms up the soup but if you run it
for<00:04:10.530> too<00:04:10.680> long<00:04:10.920> it'll<00:04:11.280> actually<00:04:11.430> boil<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
for too long it'll actually boil the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.820 
for too long it'll actually boil the
soup<00:04:12.360> so<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.840> really<00:04:13.170> don't<00:04:13.290> want<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.560> run<00:04:13.709> it

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
soup so you really don't want to run it

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.710 
soup so you really don't want to run it
that<00:04:14.070> long<00:04:14.370> because<00:04:14.760> you'll<00:04:15.030> destroy<00:04:15.480> them

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
that long because you'll destroy them

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.750 
that long because you'll destroy them
all<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.109> good<00:04:16.260> nutrients<00:04:16.739> in<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:16.950> suit<00:04:17.160> so

all the good nutrients in the suit so
just<00:04:17.970> for<00:04:18.060> about<00:04:18.270> two<00:04:18.480> minutes

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.529
