00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
see what we can do to move it it's only

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:09.230 
see what we can do to move it it's only
me<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> stop<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> camera

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and as you can see as I slide this out

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.880 
and as you can see as I slide this out
as<00:01:16.000> this<00:01:16.210> piece<00:01:16.479> slides<00:01:16.810> out<00:01:17.080> of<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.530> slide

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
as this piece slides out of the slide

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.179 
as this piece slides out of the slide
there's<00:01:18.759> a<00:01:18.880> wedge<00:01:19.540> piece<00:01:19.869> that<00:01:20.500> goes<00:01:20.680> up<00:01:20.860> with

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
there's a wedge piece that goes up with

there's a wedge piece that goes up with
it<00:01:21.369> that's<00:01:21.670> coming<00:01:22.090> out<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.479> have<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.780> make

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
it that's coming out so I have to make

sure<00:01:22.960> that<00:01:23.140> when<00:01:23.799> that<00:01:23.830> goes<00:01:24.070> back<00:01:24.310> in<00:01:24.549> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
sure that when that goes back in that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.310 
sure that when that goes back in that
all<00:01:25.840> slides<00:01:26.170> back<00:01:26.409> in<00:01:26.619> together<00:01:28.140> okay<00:01:29.140> the

all slides back in together okay the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.279 
all slides back in together okay the
next<00:01:29.530> step<00:01:29.619> here<00:01:30.100> will<00:01:30.520> be<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:30.990> rotate<00:01:31.990> this

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
next step here will be to rotate this

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.800 
next step here will be to rotate this
piece<00:01:34.680> rotate<00:01:35.680> this<00:01:35.950> up<00:01:36.759> so<00:01:37.299> I<00:01:37.330> have<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.570> pull

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
piece rotate this up so I have to pull

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.120 
piece rotate this up so I have to pull
up<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:38.110> this<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:41.500> unfortunately
