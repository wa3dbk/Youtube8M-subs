00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.000 
to work if you don't have any sunlight
you<00:02:17.450> can<00:02:17.660> use<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.050> battery<00:02:18.440> mode<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.800> does

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
you can use the battery mode it does

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.490 
you can use the battery mode it does
come<00:02:19.280> with<00:02:19.310> batteries<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:20.540> access<00:02:21.319> those

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
come with batteries to access those

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.070 
come with batteries to access those
batteries<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.280> can<00:02:22.310> unscrew<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.450> your

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
batteries you can unscrew that and your

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.650 
batteries you can unscrew that and your
batteries<00:02:24.500> will<00:02:24.740> be<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:24.980> inside<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:25.849> whatever

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
batteries will be on inside so whatever

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.850 
batteries will be on inside so whatever
the<00:02:27.290> weather<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.920> can<00:02:28.099> still<00:02:28.580> use<00:02:29.090> your

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
the weather you can still use your

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.470 
the weather you can still use your
butterfly<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:30.920> does<00:02:31.160> not<00:02:31.340> matter<00:02:31.580> guys<00:02:31.880> now

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
butterfly it does not matter guys now

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.740 
butterfly it does not matter guys now
you<00:02:32.540> also<00:02:32.900> have<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.620> mushroom<00:02:34.160> at<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.000> back<00:02:35.209> and

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
you also have a mushroom at the back and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.670 
you also have a mushroom at the back and
you<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.200> angle<00:02:36.800> this<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.150> can<00:02:38.360> move<00:02:39.260> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
you can angle this so you can move the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.000 
you can angle this so you can move the
butterfly<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.550> get<00:02:40.819> it<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.180> flutter<00:02:41.510> in

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
butterfly and get it to flutter in

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.220 
butterfly and get it to flutter in
different<00:02:43.010> directions<00:02:43.819> or<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.690> direction

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
different directions or the direction

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.170 
different directions or the direction
you<00:02:45.349> want<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.950> if<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.610> wanted<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.060> go

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
you want it to if you wanted to go

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.840 
you want it to if you wanted to go
circular<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.110> can<00:02:48.320> have<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.190> central<00:02:49.610> like

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
circular you can have it a central like

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.850 
circular you can have it a central like
that<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:50.720> we<00:02:50.990> do<00:02:51.170> have<00:02:51.320> a<00:02:51.380> switch

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
that but we do have a switch

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.310 
that but we do have a switch
it<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.610> in<00:02:52.760> solar<00:02:53.150> panel<00:02:53.540> mode<00:02:53.720> mode<00:02:54.080> at<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
it is in solar panel mode mode at the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.570 
it is in solar panel mode mode at the
moment<00:02:54.370> let's<00:02:55.370> switch<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.300> battery<00:02:56.900> mode

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
moment let's switch it to battery mode

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.880 
moment let's switch it to battery mode
under<00:02:58.580> there<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:58.880> go<00:02:59.110> how<00:03:00.110> awesome<00:03:00.350> is<00:03:00.680> that

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
under there you go how awesome is that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.610 
under there you go how awesome is that
God<00:03:01.100> is<00:03:01.130> going<00:03:01.280> faster<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.060> faster<00:03:02.350> as<00:03:03.350> you

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
God is going faster and faster as you

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.300 
God is going faster and faster as you
can<00:03:03.830> see<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.330> mushroom<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.920> at<00:03:07.160> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
can see with the mushroom in at the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.540 
can see with the mushroom in at the
middle<00:03:07.580> cut<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:07.940> central<00:03:08.450> position<00:03:09.550> the

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
middle cut in central position the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.420 
middle cut in central position the
butterfly<00:03:11.240> will<00:03:11.540> keep<00:03:11.750> flapping<00:03:12.440> around<00:03:12.680> in<00:03:13.160> a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
butterfly will keep flapping around in a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.320 
butterfly will keep flapping around in a
circular<00:03:13.820> motion<00:03:14.240> but<00:03:15.080> now<00:03:15.290> when<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.220> move<00:03:16.670> the

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
circular motion but now when I move the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.570 
circular motion but now when I move the
mushroom<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.900> will<00:03:18.050> see<00:03:18.230> what<00:03:18.380> happens<00:03:18.770> if<00:03:19.430> I

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
mushroom you will see what happens if I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.660 
mushroom you will see what happens if I
move<00:03:19.850> it<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.270> that<00:03:20.930> side<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:22.100> can<00:03:22.310> keep<00:03:22.520> the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
move it to that side you can keep the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.510 
move it to that side you can keep the
butterfly<00:03:23.209> in<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.780> position<00:03:24.400> hovering<00:03:25.400> the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
butterfly in that position hovering the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.160 
butterfly in that position hovering the
way<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.700> want<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.600> have<00:03:26.840> full

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
way you want it to so you have full

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.850 
way you want it to so you have full
control<00:03:27.620> over<00:03:28.480> where<00:03:29.480> your<00:03:29.510> butterfly<00:03:30.230> does

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
control over where your butterfly does

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.790 
control over where your butterfly does
fly<00:03:31.160> as<00:03:31.820> you<00:03:31.880> can<00:03:32.209> see<00:03:32.420> now<00:03:32.630> I've<00:03:32.989> angled<00:03:33.620> it

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
fly as you can see now I've angled it

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.550 
fly as you can see now I've angled it
forwards<00:03:34.459> so<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.480> butterfly<00:03:35.810> will<00:03:36.260> stay

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
forwards so the butterfly will stay

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.970 
forwards so the butterfly will stay
there

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
there

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.820 
there
and<00:03:37.400> if<00:03:37.580> I<00:03:37.700> angle<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.209> this<00:03:38.239> way<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:39.230> should

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
and if I angle it this way it should

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.820 
and if I angle it this way it should
flutter<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.310> right<00:03:40.670> in<00:03:40.910> front<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.420> camera

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
flutter a right in front of the camera

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.420 
flutter a right in front of the camera
there<00:03:42.830> you<00:03:42.860> go

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
there you go

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.330 
there you go
so<00:03:44.090> as<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:44.750> can<00:03:44.930> see<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.260> have<00:03:45.320> four<00:03:45.830> control

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
so as you can see you have four control

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.150 
so as you can see you have four control
over<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.270> awesome<00:03:47.870> butterfly

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
over that awesome butterfly

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.820 
over that awesome butterfly
that's<00:03:50.000> how<00:03:50.150> cool<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.600> that<00:03:50.630> guys<00:03:51.020> it<00:03:51.380> really

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
that's how cool is that guys it really

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.030 
that's how cool is that guys it really
does<00:03:52.010> look<00:03:52.190> cool<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:54.110> can't<00:03:54.410> really<00:03:54.650> see

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
does look cool and you can't really see

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.490 
does look cool and you can't really see
the<00:03:55.340> connecting<00:03:55.880> Y<00:03:56.060> either<00:03:56.390> so<00:03:57.049> it<00:03:57.200> looks<00:03:57.410> like

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
the connecting Y either so it looks like

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.729 
the connecting Y either so it looks like
the<00:03:57.830> butterfly<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:59.239> fluttering<00:04:00.019> around<00:04:00.410> the

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
the butterfly is fluttering around the

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.810 
the butterfly is fluttering around the
pot<00:04:00.950> on<00:04:01.459> its<00:04:01.700> own<00:04:02.860> now<00:04:03.860> don't<00:04:04.160> forget<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.610> can

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
pot on its own now don't forget you can

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.170 
pot on its own now don't forget you can
also<00:04:05.030> accessorize<00:04:06.019> with<00:04:06.860> these<00:04:07.190> or<00:04:07.519> you<00:04:08.000> need

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
also accessorize with these or you need
