00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello very good to all the kids 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.450
 here distinctive and today I bring you 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.110
 found the lack the true lack 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.870
 lack of lime crops is this weapon chunk 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.390
 that I have here I am playing was 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.210
 trying to prove these weapons a 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.849
 it locks in to make it is a new one that 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.489
 it's what they have done for this 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.069
 call of duty groove those rifles 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.079
 precision I think it's called like that and if I 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.059
 they will confirm it I think I think what 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.190
 I said so much of the precision ones are 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.430
 the francs have inside but that gives 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.690
 same 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.750
 and well this is dawn and there is a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.900
 ironed kids is is the real 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.080
 You see here as a wadding is that you can 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.330
 kill from a bullet only the m-14 shoots 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.970
 slower time than I've checked what 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.550
 you can do so you can not go with your finger 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.800
 well here a little fail of was recorded 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.620
 and you're out of bullets but it does not matter 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.660
 I just wanted to tell you this now I think that 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.930
 I take it in a moment of suicide 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.640
 little the weapon to return again would be 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.250
 I also wanted to tell you about the pills 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.259
 the orders that leave you as the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.050
 package on the floor for you to 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.060
 cups and you have to say current 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.040
 Do what the controls tell you 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.410
 now let's see this this part of the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.360
 video and he really explained thomas 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.750
 highlighted the double low with the aguada and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.590
 here it happened with a silver bullet of 16 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.469
 It takes ultra is stuck is the savings 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.929
 m r 28 - the here I think what I got 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.869
 has fallen when the port can be this 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.119
 this one beat 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.429
 there are many people who say that 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.469
 there are haxhi things but only a little bit everything 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.119
 system that tends here if you take it and 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.880
 you do this this wants to go up 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.950
 next is today take three casualties 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.170
 you throwing the package because you can 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.780
 leave whatever it is until one they call me 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.329
 two came out in this game previously 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.399
 I got one that agreed kids or 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.920
 be that I do not know at what price host but 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.860
 yes I thought it was 24 25 casualties depends 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.319
 if you have a ligature, not all 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.209
 these two depends on nothing in agreement 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.280
 kids here a little bit the whole da 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.959
 thanks without wanting to be doing 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.299
 plan being completely is something 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.700
 directly and I still lack in some 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.400
 moment but here decided to throw pack 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.269
 to see who comes out of agreement kids or 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.370
 be that many people if it can be that I 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.620
 have five casualties but it has been highlighted 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.690
 what you tell him briefcase and you can leave him 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.500
 this package because as you have seen 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.800
 there is no reason for 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.960
 of help itself is one of the few 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.510
 help package so you can only 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.450
 take out the help package with this streak 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.060
 there is no other way to get a package 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.080
 of help of agreement kids that is that 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.390
 this weapon state checked if the r28 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.670
 how cool the whole package you see, I think 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.430
 that I just got kissed by an agent and 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.110
 do something but already I already told you 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.630
 this way how do people if you take out 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.870
 atc or more there are already many clichÃ©s on youtube 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.450
 already of 10 the prestige sense and things 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.940
 rare uncle who wanted to not fly what 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.440
 make kids who then ball you know 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.260
 who had spent much in the commission of 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.650
 climb very fast prestige and go 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.560
 camp and of things to find and to leave 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.970
 of prestige weapons if there was one that 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.640
 had like 10 million 10 billion 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.770
 furtive and it is impossible kids are 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.380
 it is fire it may be that it is card 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.540
 useful or both but it is very much the call of 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.600
 duty pin today it is noticeable then I have already 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.590
 seen people prestige 87 can be that 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.260
 some are true 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.720
 It has gotten a really long life 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.540
 but I think it's very unlikely 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.760
 be kids light favorites subscribe 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.080
 if you are and we see them in the next 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.080
 video goodbye kids
