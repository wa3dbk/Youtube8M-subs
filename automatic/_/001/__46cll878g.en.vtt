00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 not to the ministry 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.550
 the Spanish 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.430
 michaÃ«l r 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.430
 rodriguez 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.729
 by 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.029
 then the studio shoots in 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.650
 you have to do it yourself 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 that is the basis 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.770
 just like with people who already have two 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.450
 Cohen also said it was a year earlier 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
 well entered easy mode 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 be heard in the evening 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.820
 it is also for the summer collection of 2011 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.920
 the four children 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 if it's a mockery 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.300
 in the tour this is lower than i would like a little nicer 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.030
 nothing with your own company 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.030
 but I'm guessing summer 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.690
 don't you fancy yourself 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.360
 I love that 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.210
 referee sanders and sonja claes everything decisive manche I came here 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.210
 am 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 win something like that 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.499
 I am supposed to be five 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.499
 at the supermarket 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.829
 I also sat down and braassem you 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.459
 brush brushes 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.649
 mind you stadium 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.349
 both clubs in son's son-in-law 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.689
 well that I see a month earlier 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:48.559
 boston celtics 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.729
 the moving image of it also not true 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:54.729
 also because the song 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.449
 and that is to be precise that you are 429 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.869
 there are clothes 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.419
 really a spill 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.419
 after pronouncing 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
 this is really you know 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.360
 we are not here with us 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.499
 if i do not have instant members here 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.499
 not quite a lot 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.599
 redeem people 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.599
 I don't say yes I don't think so 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.020
 but I have shown on the screen more often 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.569
 but this is a separation 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.800
 dead island 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.020
 can never really be very big 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.129
 with his grandchildren 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:57.309
 seems misplaced and option
