00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
in and i need to pair this stuff but

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.810 
in and i need to pair this stuff but
basically<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:48.040> allows<00:01:48.369> you<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:48.670> show

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
so you can see the screen here this

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.539 
so you can see the screen here this
isn't<00:01:57.430> what<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.729> do<00:01:58.360> for<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.659> final<00:01:59.020> it's<00:01:59.979> I'm

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
isn't what you do for the final it's I'm

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.320 
isn't what you do for the final it's I'm
capturing<00:02:01.090> 1080p<00:02:02.550> but<00:02:03.550> you<00:02:03.670> can<00:02:03.819> also<00:02:03.940> change

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
capturing 1080p but you can also change

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.300 
capturing 1080p but you can also change
that<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.710> configuration<00:02:06.009> settings<00:02:08.310> you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
that in the configuration settings you

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.640 
that in the configuration settings you
can<00:02:09.369> force<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.179> if<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:10.750> want<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.959> do<00:02:11.050> 720<00:02:11.620> or

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
can force like if you want to do 720 or

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.470 
can force like if you want to do 720 or
1080<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:13.540> can<00:02:13.690> capture<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.319> resolution<00:02:15.480> but

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
1080 you can capture that resolution but

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.180 
1080 you can capture that resolution but
you're<00:02:16.690> switching<00:02:17.019> so<00:02:17.350> they'll<00:02:17.739> switch<00:02:17.980> to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
you're switching so they'll switch to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.170 
you're switching so they'll switch to
720

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.910 

and<00:02:21.629> it's<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.079> mimic<00:02:22.379> your<00:02:22.620> TV

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
and it's going to mimic your TV

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.160 
and it's going to mimic your TV
switching<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.609> 720<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.359> you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.629> easily<00:02:24.780> see

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
switching to 720 and you can easily see

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.500 
switching to 720 and you can easily see
what<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.409> looks<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.680> at<00:02:25.859> that<00:02:26.010> resolution

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.550 

so<00:02:29.230> i'll<00:02:29.349> switch<00:02:29.590> back<00:02:29.799> to<00:02:29.830> 1080

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
so i'll switch back to 1080

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.370 
so i'll switch back to 1080
because<00:02:32.160> that's<00:02:32.400> what<00:02:32.459> all<00:02:32.670> these<00:02:32.760> videos

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
because that's what all these videos

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.780 
because that's what all these videos
that's<00:02:34.380> my<00:02:34.530> target<00:02:34.739> video<00:02:35.099> size

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
that's my target video size

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.240 
that's my target video size
and<00:02:37.120> they<00:02:38.079> have<00:02:38.170> different<00:02:38.349> profiles<00:02:38.860> or

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
and they have different profiles or

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.890 
and they have different profiles or
profiles<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.269> inputs

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
profiles and inputs

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.860 
profiles and inputs
and<00:02:42.049> a<00:02:42.730> list<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.909> devices<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.599> can<00:02:44.750> have

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
and a list of devices that you can have

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.530 
and a list of devices that you can have
it<00:02:44.989> work<00:02:45.140> with<00:02:45.970> okay<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.060> it's<00:02:47.209> it's

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
it work with okay and it's it's

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.479 
it work with okay and it's it's
flickering<00:02:47.959> right<00:02:48.170> now<00:02:48.319> probably<00:02:48.799> because<00:02:49.280> my

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
flickering right now probably because my

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.979 
flickering right now probably because my
video<00:02:49.730> capture<00:02:50.530> stuff<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.709> going<00:02:52.099> so<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.870> way

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
video capture stuff is going so the way

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.390 
video capture stuff is going so the way
that<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:54.319> would<00:02:54.470> use<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.769> for<00:02:54.920> your<00:02:54.980> gameplay

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
that you would use it for your gameplay

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.190 
that you would use it for your gameplay
video<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.939> to<00:02:56.120> hit<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.390> record<00:02:56.540> button<00:02:56.810> and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
video is to hit the record button and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.429 
video is to hit the record button and
then<00:02:57.590> record<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.129> a<00:02:58.159> file<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:59.079> then<00:03:00.079> either

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
then record it to a file and then either

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.740 
then record it to a file and then either
with<00:03:00.709> Camtasia<00:03:01.280> or<00:03:01.700> Microsoft<00:03:02.329> Movie<00:03:02.629> Maker

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
with Camtasia or Microsoft Movie Maker

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.530 
with Camtasia or Microsoft Movie Maker
you<00:03:03.109> splice<00:03:03.859> in<00:03:04.099> that<00:03:04.280> edit<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.879> all<00:03:05.000> nice<00:03:05.209> and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
you splice in that edit it all nice and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.710 
you splice in that edit it all nice and
and<00:03:06.310> but<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.430> main<00:03:07.579> thing<00:03:07.609> is<00:03:07.939> that<00:03:08.269> you<00:03:08.689> can

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
and but the main thing is that you can

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.009 
and but the main thing is that you can
capture<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.500> like<00:03:09.950> some<00:03:10.750> Android<00:03:11.750> devices

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
capture it like some Android devices

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.550 
capture it like some Android devices
like<00:03:12.319> my<00:03:12.590> nexus<00:03:13.340> 10<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:14.690> just<00:03:14.720> you'll<00:03:15.379> see<00:03:15.530> a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
like my nexus 10 you just you'll see a

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.379 
like my nexus 10 you just you'll see a
black<00:03:15.829> screen<00:03:16.099> here<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.579> all<00:03:16.760> that<00:03:16.940> means<00:03:17.180> is

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
black screen here that all that means is

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.360 
black screen here that all that means is
that<00:03:17.739> it's<00:03:18.739> sending<00:03:19.129> encrypted<00:03:19.900> hdcp<00:03:20.900> output

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
that it's sending encrypted hdcp output

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.599 
that it's sending encrypted hdcp output
but<00:03:22.370> with<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.239> guys<00:03:24.230> can<00:03:24.470> go<00:03:24.620> out<00:03:24.799> get

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
but with this you guys can go out get

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.479 
but with this you guys can go out get
one<00:03:25.819> capture<00:03:26.569> it<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.019> too<00:03:27.620> awesome<00:03:27.889> gameplay

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
one capture it and too awesome gameplay

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.760 
one capture it and too awesome gameplay
videos<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:32.290> likely

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.710 

I<00:03:35.860> played<00:03:36.580> around<00:03:36.760> with<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:37.000> too<00:03:37.180> much<00:03:37.210> but<00:03:37.570> I'm

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
I played around with it too much but I'm

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.760 
I played around with it too much but I'm
guessing<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.580> hdmi<00:03:39.580> also<00:03:40.060> includes<00:03:40.770> audio

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
guessing that hdmi also includes audio

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.390 
guessing that hdmi also includes audio
output<00:03:42.460> and<00:03:42.700> it'll<00:03:43.090> probably<00:03:43.740> record<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:44.950> game

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
output and it'll probably record of game

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.940 
output and it'll probably record of game
audio<00:03:45.730> there<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.180> go<00:03:46.270> so<00:03:47.080> it's<00:03:47.410> it's<00:03:47.680> going<00:03:47.890> to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
audio there you go so it's it's going to

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.620 
audio there you go so it's it's going to
record<00:03:48.220> not<00:03:48.670> only<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:49.030> video<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.600> audio

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
record not only the video and the audio

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.230 
record not only the video and the audio
right<00:03:50.590> into<00:03:50.830> your<00:03:50.920> video<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.490> digital

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
right into your video and digital

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.970 
right into your video and digital
quality<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.440> you're<00:03:53.590> not<00:03:53.650> going<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.890> get

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
quality so you're not going to get

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.710 
quality so you're not going to get
background<00:03:54.250> noise<00:03:54.940> or<00:03:55.120> whatever<00:03:55.360> it'll<00:03:55.540> be

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
background noise or whatever it'll be

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
background noise or whatever it'll be
like<00:03:55.930> just<00:03:56.650> wait<00:03:56.890> one<00:03:57.870> alright<00:03:58.870> well<00:03:59.410> thanks
