alright<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.190> replication<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.300> Jack's

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
alright this is a replication of Jack's

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.680 
alright this is a replication of Jack's
wooden<00:00:04.230> bowl<00:00:04.500> motor<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.400> ever<00:00:06.000> since<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.450> saw

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
wooden bowl motor and ever since I saw

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.740 
wooden bowl motor and ever since I saw
his<00:00:06.960> videos<00:00:07.379> were<00:00:07.410> used<00:00:08.069> coal<00:00:08.820> wood<00:00:09.120> bowl<00:00:09.360> for

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
his videos were used coal wood bowl for

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.860 
his videos were used coal wood bowl for
the<00:00:10.610> rotor<00:00:11.610> structure<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.269> always<00:00:12.509> wanted<00:00:12.780> to

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the rotor structure I always wanted to

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.450 
the rotor structure I always wanted to
make<00:00:13.049> one<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.410> these<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.130> my<00:00:14.309> little

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
make one of these and this is my little

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.599 
make one of these and this is my little
Bowl<00:00:14.790> motor<00:00:15.320> that<00:00:16.320> I've<00:00:16.590> got<00:00:16.830> running<00:00:17.279> here

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
Bowl motor that I've got running here

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:27.589 
Bowl motor that I've got running here
and<00:00:20.060> she<00:00:21.060> likes<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:22.039> it's<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:25.099> probably<00:00:26.599> coal

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and she likes it it's a probably coal

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.960 
and she likes it it's a probably coal
would<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> believe<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.800> from<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.189> Indonesia

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
would I believe it's from the Indonesia

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.880 
would I believe it's from the Indonesia
I<00:00:30.150> found<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.840> store<00:00:31.140> today<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:31.679> three

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
I found it in a store today for three

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.920 
I found it in a store today for three
dollars<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.759> worked<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.239> good<00:00:33.450> for

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
dollars and it worked really good for

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.430 
dollars and it worked really good for
this<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:35.070> running<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.700> by<00:00:36.149> filer<00:00:36.570> coil

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
this and it's running on a by filer coil

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.580 
this and it's running on a by filer coil
Air<00:00:38.010> Corps<00:00:38.370> coil<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.660> simple<00:00:40.110> circuit

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
Air Corps coil and that simple circuit

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.470 
Air Corps coil and that simple circuit
that<00:00:40.770> I've<00:00:40.950> shown<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> other<00:00:41.670> videos<00:00:42.149> and

that I've shown in the other videos and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.350 
that I've shown in the other videos and
it's<00:00:43.290> got<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.770> flyback<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> the

volts<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.870> take<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> battery<00:00:52.649> away<00:00:53.010> it

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
volts and if I take the battery away it

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
volts and if I take the battery away it
still<00:00:53.640> runs<00:00:55.430> it<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.730> runs<00:00:56.969> at<00:00:57.210> about<00:00:57.300> 30

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
still runs it just runs at about 30

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.790 
still runs it just runs at about 30
milliamps<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.550> charge<00:01:00.329> rate<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
milliamps that's the charge rate but the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.270 
milliamps that's the charge rate but the
little<00:01:01.949> motor<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:03.650> by<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> way<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.010> self

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
little motor is by the way it will self

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.450 
little motor is by the way it will self
oscillate<00:01:05.820> too<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.350> circuit<00:01:07.799> would<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
oscillate too if the circuit would that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.820 
oscillate too if the circuit would that
particular<00:01:08.790> Air<00:01:09.150> Corps<00:01:09.420> coil<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.619> by

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
particular Air Corps coil that's a by

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.550 
particular Air Corps coil that's a by
fighter<00:01:11.159> wound<00:01:11.580> Air<00:01:11.909> Corps<00:01:12.150> coil<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.869> then

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
fighter wound Air Corps coil and then

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890 
fighter wound Air Corps coil and then
you<00:01:13.680> notice<00:01:13.799> she's<00:01:14.520> off<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you notice she's off but it's just a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.350 
you notice she's off but it's just a
little<00:01:16.049> wooden<00:01:16.409> bowl<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.729> thought<00:01:18.000> Jack's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
little wooden bowl and I thought Jack's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.140 
little wooden bowl and I thought Jack's
idea<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.990> doing<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:19.830> ingenious<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.119> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
idea of doing that was so ingenious so I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.539 
idea of doing that was so ingenious so I
finally<00:01:21.659> made<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:22.979> make<00:01:23.310> all

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
finally made one and you can make all

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.230 
finally made one and you can make all
kinds<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.299> motors<00:01:25.520> different<00:01:26.520> circuits<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
kinds of motors different circuits and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.390 
kinds of motors different circuits and
different<00:01:27.570> types<00:01:27.900> using<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.100> little

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
different types using that little

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.179 
different types using that little
structure<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.150> there<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.680> real

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
structure right there and it's just real

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.210 
structure right there and it's just real
simple<00:01:32.490> though<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.420> wooden<00:01:33.689> bowl<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.290> forms

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
simple though the wooden bowl is forms

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.370 
simple though the wooden bowl is forms
the<00:01:35.400> bearings<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.960> drill<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> hole

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the bearings and you just drill a hole

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.190 
the bearings and you just drill a hole
that's<00:01:37.829> very<00:01:38.130> close<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.729> shafts

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
that's very close to your shafts

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.160 
that's very close to your shafts
diameter<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:41.159> uh<00:01:41.509> oily<00:01:42.509> wood<00:01:42.780> from

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
diameter and this uh oily wood from

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.499 
diameter and this uh oily wood from
Indonesia<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.310> think<00:01:44.549> its<00:01:44.700> core<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
Indonesia I think its core would it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.660 
Indonesia I think its core would it
might<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.810> something<00:01:46.079> else<00:01:46.439> works<00:01:47.280> very<00:01:47.579> very

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
might be something else works very very

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.120 
might be something else works very very
good<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> brass<00:01:48.780> shaft<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:50.840> anyway<00:01:52.070> this<00:01:53.070> uh

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
good on a brass shaft and anyway this uh

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.120 
good on a brass shaft and anyway this uh
this<00:01:53.670> works<00:01:54.570> quite<00:01:54.930> nicely<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.829> give<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
this works quite nicely you just give it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.389 
this works quite nicely you just give it
a<00:01:56.219> spin<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> by<00:01:57.210> fighter<00:01:57.540> wound<00:01:57.869> coil<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.619> it

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
a spin on a by fighter wound coil and it

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.719 
a spin on a by fighter wound coil and it
activates<00:01:59.579> right<00:02:00.210> through<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> wood<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.729> in

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
activates right through the wood and in

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.240 
activates right through the wood and in
runs<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:04.740> make<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.100> different

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
runs and you can make all different

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.089 
runs and you can make all different
kinds<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.850> motors<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:07.229> different<00:02:07.590> coils

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
kinds of motors with different coils

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.869 
kinds of motors with different coils
with<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.819> basic<00:02:09.270> structure<00:02:09.840> but

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
with that basic structure but

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.760 
with that basic structure but
Halloween's<00:02:11.879> coming<00:02:12.060> up

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
Halloween's coming up

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.010 
Halloween's coming up
so<00:02:12.890> we're<00:02:13.760> getting<00:02:13.940> ready<00:02:14.180> for<00:02:14.330> Halloween<00:02:14.990> and

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
so we're getting ready for Halloween and

I<00:02:15.350> told<00:02:15.650> Jack<00:02:15.920> he<00:02:16.550> should<00:02:16.790> put<00:02:17.000> some<00:02:17.210> candy<00:02:17.630> in

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
I told Jack he should put some candy in

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.690 
I told Jack he should put some candy in
his<00:02:17.900> bowl<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.370> there's<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.000> bowl<00:02:20.960> with<00:02:21.380> a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
his bowl so there's the bowl with a

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.480

Halloween candy in it I thought Jackie

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.890
