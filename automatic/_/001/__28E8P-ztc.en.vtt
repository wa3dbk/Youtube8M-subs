00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
bias tape around the edge of the fabric

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.220 
bias tape around the edge of the fabric
so<00:00:26.010> first<00:00:26.609> let's<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> quick<00:00:27.420> look<00:00:27.449> just<00:00:27.900> a

double<00:00:30.359> fold<00:00:30.570> bias<00:00:30.840> tape<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.920> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
double fold bias tape but this is just a

reminder of what it is this is when

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.250 
reminder of what it is this is when
you've<00:00:34.170> got<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.680> strip<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> fabric<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:36.809> edges

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
you've got a strip of fabric the edges

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
you've got a strip of fabric the edges
are<00:00:37.559> folded<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.250> toward<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.579> center<00:00:38.969> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
are folded in toward the center and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.819 
are folded in toward the center and
pressed<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.750> then<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> whole<00:00:40.320> thing<00:00:40.620> is

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
pressed and then the whole thing is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.889 
pressed and then the whole thing is
folded<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.520> half<00:00:41.700> that's<00:00:42.390> why<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.780> called

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
folded in half that's why it's called

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.900 
folded in half that's why it's called
double<00:00:43.530> fold<00:00:43.800> bias<00:00:44.100> tape<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:44.730> it's

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
double fold bias tape because it's

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.660 
double fold bias tape because it's
folded<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.750> then<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.140> again<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.399> wrap

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
folded in and then in again and you wrap

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
folded in and then in again and you wrap
this<00:00:48.079> nicely<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> nice<00:00:49.950> way<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
this nicely it can be a nice way to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.270 
this nicely it can be a nice way to
finish<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:51.539> edges<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:52.199> fabric<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.010> fold

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
finish the edges of fabric you just fold

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.869 
finish the edges of fabric you just fold
it<00:00:53.460> over<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> edge<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.590> stitch<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.620> down<00:00:56.010> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
it over the edge and stitch it down so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.000 
it over the edge and stitch it down so
the<00:00:57.059> question<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.510> people<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.870> had<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.469> how

continue this line of sewing from here

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.440 
continue this line of sewing from here
and<00:01:27.450> I'm<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> go<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.549> edge<00:01:29.909> of

and I'm going to go right to the edge of

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.810 
and I'm going to go right to the edge of
where<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.960> fabric<00:01:31.409> stops<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:32.400> very

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
where that fabric stops it's very

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.240 
where that fabric stops it's very
important<00:01:33.329> not<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.600> go<00:01:33.930> past<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.680> edge<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
important not to go past that edge if

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
important not to go past that edge if
you<00:01:35.340> need<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> stop<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> stitch<00:01:36.270> or<00:01:36.390> shoots<00:01:36.630> too

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you need to stop a stitch or shoots too

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
you need to stop a stitch or shoots too
short<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.710> better<00:01:38.130> than<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.549> too<00:01:38.909> far

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
short that's better than going too far

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:54.560 
short that's better than going too far
so<00:01:40.049> we're<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.500> first

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.210 

and<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:55.869> like<00:01:56.049> to<00:01:56.200> back<00:01:56.380> stitch<00:01:56.650> there<00:01:56.920> just<00:01:57.130> to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
and I like to back stitch there just to

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.499 
and I like to back stitch there just to
make<00:01:57.250> sure<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:57.640> it's<00:01:57.790> being<00:01:58.030> held<00:01:58.210> in<00:01:58.360> place

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
make sure that it's being held in place

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.609 
make sure that it's being held in place
then<00:01:59.500> you<00:01:59.650> take<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.040> out<00:02:00.190> of<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.549> machine<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
then you take it out of the machine the

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.750 
then you take it out of the machine the
shorter<00:02:09.899> okay<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.410> next<00:02:11.680> step<00:02:11.800> we're<00:02:12.640> going

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
shorter okay the next step we're going

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.280 
shorter okay the next step we're going
to<00:02:12.819> open<00:02:13.060> up<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.540> fold<00:02:17.940> lay<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.180> bottom<00:02:19.630> you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
to open up this fold lay this bottom you

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.930 
to open up this fold lay this bottom you
can<00:02:20.470> feel<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.250> bottom<00:02:21.550> I'm<00:02:21.700> folding

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
can feel it on the bottom I'm folding

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.070 
can feel it on the bottom I'm folding
that<00:02:22.270> flat<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.830> allows<00:02:24.190> me<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.880> again<00:02:25.300> get

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
that flat that allows me to again get

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.110 
that flat that allows me to again get
this<00:02:26.319> fabric<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.370> I'm<00:02:27.459> going<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.640> set<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.090> down

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
this fabric and I'm going to set it down

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.570 
this fabric and I'm going to set it down
once<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.630> get<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.959> folded<00:02:29.410> into<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:30.160> little<00:02:30.400> point

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
once I get it folded into a little point

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.170 
once I get it folded into a little point
there<00:02:30.910> I'm<00:02:31.810> going<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.050> set<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.380> down<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.910> make

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
there I'm going to set it down and make

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.460 
there I'm going to set it down and make
sure<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.510> I'm<00:02:34.660> getting<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.989> edge<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.410> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
sure that I'm getting the edge of the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.290 
sure that I'm getting the edge of the
fabric<00:02:35.680> right<00:02:36.190> into<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.580> fold<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.060> bias

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
fabric right into the fold of the bias

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.750 
fabric right into the fold of the bias
tape<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.769> can<00:02:38.980> see<00:02:39.160> down<00:02:39.370> here<00:02:39.400> it's

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
tape so you can see down here it's

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.750 
tape so you can see down here it's
folding<00:02:40.090> over<00:02:40.209> neatly<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.930> up<00:02:41.230> here<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.890> need

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
folding over neatly and up here I need

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.820 
folding over neatly and up here I need
to<00:02:42.910> just<00:02:43.120> push<00:02:43.540> my<00:02:43.690> finger<00:02:44.049> in<00:02:44.170> there<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.590> make

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
to just push my finger in there and make

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.020 
to just push my finger in there and make
sure<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.370> get<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> nice<00:02:46.380> neat<00:02:47.700> mitered<00:02:48.700> fold

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
sure that I get a nice neat mitered fold

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.539 
sure that I get a nice neat mitered fold
the<00:02:49.720> trick<00:02:50.049> is<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.530> take<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.160> out<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
the trick is to take it out of the

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.130 
the trick is to take it out of the
machine<00:02:51.670> you're<00:02:52.180> never<00:02:52.450> going<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.720> be<00:02:52.870> able<00:02:52.959> to

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
machine you're never going to be able to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.050 
machine you're never going to be able to
get<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.440> fold<00:02:53.799> with<00:02:54.100> your<00:02:54.280> needle<00:02:54.640> still<00:02:54.880> in

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
get that fold with your needle still in

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.979 
get that fold with your needle still in
there<00:02:55.299> so<00:02:56.110> hold<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.440> all<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.769> place<00:02:57.600> slide<00:02:58.600> it

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
there so hold it all in place slide it

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.020 
there so hold it all in place slide it
under<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.410> presser<00:02:59.950> foot<00:03:02.610> do<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.670> couple<00:03:04.000> of

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
under the presser foot do a couple of

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.270 
under the presser foot do a couple of
back<00:03:04.180> stitches<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.900> secure<00:03:05.049> it<00:03:05.350> at<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.590> front

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
back stitches to secure it at the front

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.510 
back stitches to secure it at the front
end

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.480 

and<00:03:12.520> then<00:03:12.670> just<00:03:12.880> keep<00:03:13.030> sewing<00:03:14.220> pull<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.370> out

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
and then just keep sewing pull it out

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.110 
and then just keep sewing pull it out
and<00:03:15.580> let<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.790> see<00:03:15.970> it

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.310 

snip<00:03:19.120> this<00:03:19.300> off<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.810> can<00:03:19.960> see<00:03:20.140> really

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
snip this off so you can see really

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.340 
snip this off so you can see really
where<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.620> starts<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.070> stops<00:03:24.870> there<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.990> go

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
where it starts and stops there you go

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.280 
where it starts and stops there you go
so<00:03:26.680> it's<00:03:26.860> not<00:03:27.040> sewn<00:03:27.940> down<00:03:28.180> here<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:29.020> could

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
so it's not sewn down here you could

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.620 
so it's not sewn down here you could
actually<00:03:29.880> stick<00:03:30.880> something<00:03:31.090> up<00:03:31.330> underneath

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
actually stick something up underneath

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.140 
actually stick something up underneath
there<00:03:32.020> so<00:03:32.620> if<00:03:32.740> you<00:03:32.860> wanted<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.670> could<00:03:33.880> run

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
there so if you wanted to you could run

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.520 
there so if you wanted to you could run
a<00:03:34.180> little<00:03:34.270> bit<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.660> extra<00:03:34.900> stitching<00:03:35.350> there

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
a little bit of extra stitching there

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.620 
a little bit of extra stitching there
but<00:03:36.130> I<00:03:36.160> don't<00:03:36.460> find<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.790> needed<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.240> never<00:03:37.480> is

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
but I don't find you needed it never is

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.050 
but I don't find you needed it never is
going<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.960> come<00:03:38.140> unfolded<00:03:39.010> there<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.850> let<00:03:40.000> me

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
going to come unfolded there and let me

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.590 
going to come unfolded there and let me
show<00:03:40.210> you<00:03:40.300> from<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.600> back<00:03:41.940> got<00:03:42.940> my<00:03:43.090> thread

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
show you from the back got my thread

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.080 
show you from the back got my thread
tail<00:03:43.840> there<00:03:44.050> still<00:03:44.410> but<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.710> can<00:03:44.890> see<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.670> it

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
tail there still but you can see that it

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.120 
tail there still but you can see that it
just<00:03:46.120> goes<00:03:46.750> right<00:03:47.020> up<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.470> fold<00:03:47.710> there<00:03:47.980> on

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
just goes right up to the fold there on

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.040 
just goes right up to the fold there on
the<00:03:48.250> back<00:03:48.430> too<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.990> continues<00:03:50.410> on<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.870> that's

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
the back too and continues on so that's

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.750 
the back too and continues on so that's
it<00:03:53.260> that's<00:03:53.620> how<00:03:53.770> you<00:03:53.830> get<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.040> nice<00:03:54.310> neat

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
it that's how you get a nice neat

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.910 
it that's how you get a nice neat
mitered<00:03:55.360> corner<00:03:55.810> when<00:03:56.350> you're<00:03:56.500> wrapping

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
mitered corner when you're wrapping

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.190 
mitered corner when you're wrapping
double<00:03:57.280> fold<00:03:57.490> bias<00:03:57.730> tape<00:03:57.910> around<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.960> corner

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
double fold bias tape around a corner

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.160 
double fold bias tape around a corner
the<00:03:59.830> trick<00:04:00.130> is<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.610> sew<00:04:01.120> right<00:04:01.480> up<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:01.990> edge

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
the trick is to sew right up to the edge

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.860 
the trick is to sew right up to the edge
of<00:04:02.650> where<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:02.980> fabric<00:04:03.550> stops<00:04:03.940> inside<00:04:04.600> the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
of where the fabric stops inside the
