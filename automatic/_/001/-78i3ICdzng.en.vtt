00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
ever and that's because they have a

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.560

that inner cortex of the hair follicle

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.179 
that inner cortex of the hair follicle
so<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.049> doesn't<00:01:50.289> get<00:01:50.350> stripped<00:01:50.680> of<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.829> oils
