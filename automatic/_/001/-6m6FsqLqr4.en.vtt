00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
doing a test on it just to see it did

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:55.680 
doing a test on it just to see it did
come<00:00:54.670> out<00:00:54.790> of<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.000> water<00:00:55.150> with<00:00:55.449> some

come out of the water with some

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.229 
come out of the water with some
concretion<00:00:56.229> on<00:00:56.559> it<00:00:56.739> so<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.519> has<00:00:57.760> been<00:00:58.000> there<00:00:58.210> a

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
concretion on it so it has been there a

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.350 
concretion on it so it has been there a
while<00:00:58.619> but<00:00:59.619> I<00:00:59.680> don't<00:00:59.860> believe<00:01:00.010> as<00:01:00.820> long<00:01:01.150> as

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
while but I don't believe as long as

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.119 
while but I don't believe as long as
some<00:01:02.080> of<00:01:02.199> the<00:01:02.260> other<00:01:02.379> coins<00:01:02.680> that<00:01:02.830> are<00:01:02.920> out

some of the other coins that are out
there<00:01:03.159> that<00:01:03.400> are<00:01:03.850> found<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:05.049> was<00:01:05.260> probably

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
there that are found it was probably

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.640 
there that are found it was probably
eroded<00:01:06.970> from<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.299> sandbank<00:01:07.869> and<00:01:08.170> washed<00:01:08.380> into

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
eroded from a sandbank and washed into

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.649 
eroded from a sandbank and washed into
the<00:01:08.890> ocean<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.890> anyway<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:11.920> found<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.760> it

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
the ocean but anyway I found that and it

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.690 
the ocean but anyway I found that and it
could<00:01:13.810> be<00:01:13.930> real<00:01:14.110> could<00:01:14.320> be<00:01:14.470> fake<00:01:14.710> like<00:01:15.040> I<00:01:15.520> said

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
could be real could be fake like I said

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.980 
could be real could be fake like I said
