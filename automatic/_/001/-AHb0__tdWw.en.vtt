hi I'm futon Chang founder of Chang

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.909 
hi I'm futon Chang founder of Chang
concrete<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:26.109> I'm<00:00:26.500> here<00:00:26.619> to<00:00:26.710> talk<00:00:26.859> about

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
concrete and I'm here to talk about

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.519 
concrete and I'm here to talk about
concrete<00:00:27.519> countertops<00:00:28.320> when<00:00:29.320> making

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
concrete countertops when making

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.589 
concrete countertops when making
concrete<00:00:29.769> countertops<00:00:30.399> we<00:00:30.969> often<00:00:31.300> have<00:00:31.570> to

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
concrete countertops we often have to

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.720 
concrete countertops we often have to
polish<00:00:32.320> out<00:00:32.529> our<00:00:32.800> pieces<00:00:33.070> just<00:00:33.460> like<00:00:33.579> you'd

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
polish out our pieces just like you'd

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.899 
polish out our pieces just like you'd
polish<00:00:34.150> out<00:00:34.329> granite<00:00:34.900> or<00:00:35.110> marble<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:36.309> get<00:00:36.760> that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:36.909 
polish out granite or marble to get that

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.600 
polish out granite or marble to get that
high<00:00:37.120> polish<00:00:37.629> or<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.230> expose<00:00:38.620> aggregate<00:00:39.129> and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
high polish or to expose aggregate and

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.360 
high polish or to expose aggregate and
in<00:00:40.390> doing<00:00:40.600> so<00:00:40.720> we're<00:00:41.559> going<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:41.769> produce

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
in doing so we're going to produce

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.149 
in doing so we're going to produce
sediments<00:00:43.300> we're<00:00:44.110> using<00:00:44.320> wet<00:00:44.710> grinding

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
sediments we're using wet grinding

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.270 
sediments we're using wet grinding
process<00:00:45.339> mostly<00:00:46.120> wet<00:00:46.390> polishing<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.280> you'll

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
process mostly wet polishing and you'll

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.189 
process mostly wet polishing and you'll
have<00:00:48.430> sediments<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.360> you'll<00:00:49.479> have<00:00:49.659> affluence

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
have sediments and you'll have affluence

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.110 
have sediments and you'll have affluence
and<00:00:50.379> things<00:00:50.649> that<00:00:50.859> are<00:00:51.429> essentially

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
and things that are essentially

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.919 
and things that are essentially
polluting<00:00:52.539> the<00:00:52.629> water<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:53.109> you're<00:00:53.230> using<00:00:53.500> so

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
polluting the water that you're using so

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.630 
polluting the water that you're using so
rather<00:00:55.929> than<00:00:56.170> just<00:00:56.230> letting<00:00:57.219> this<00:00:57.309> water

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
rather than just letting this water

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.040 
rather than just letting this water
runoff<00:00:57.940> into<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.359> environment<00:00:58.690> the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
runoff into the environment the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.049 
runoff into the environment the
responsible<00:00:59.589> thing<00:00:59.769> to<00:00:59.859> do<00:01:00.010> is<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.609> set<00:01:00.820> up<00:01:00.940> a

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
responsible thing to do is to set up a

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.569 
responsible thing to do is to set up a
filtration<00:01:01.420> system<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:02.350> what<00:01:02.890> we<00:01:03.010> have<00:01:03.219> here

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
filtration system and what we have here

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.930 
filtration system and what we have here
is<00:01:03.730> a<00:01:04.740> moving<00:01:07.380> mobile<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.770> very<00:01:09.670> portable

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
is a moving mobile and very portable

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.350 
is a moving mobile and very portable
water<00:01:10.929> filtration<00:01:11.460> table<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.880> you<00:01:13.210> can

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
water filtration table that you can

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.490 
water filtration table that you can
polish<00:01:13.750> on<00:01:14.110> as<00:01:14.289> well<00:01:14.530> so<00:01:14.830> it<00:01:15.789> is<00:01:16.060> also

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
polish on as well so it is also

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.719 
polish on as well so it is also
self-contained<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:17.950> taking<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.490> water

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
self-contained it is taking the water

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.080 
self-contained it is taking the water
and<00:01:19.500> recycling<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.729> filtering<00:01:21.729> out<00:01:21.850> those

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
and recycling it filtering out those

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.170 
and recycling it filtering out those
effluents<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.049> sediments<00:01:23.590> while<00:01:24.579> you're

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
effluents and the sediments while you're

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.749 
effluents and the sediments while you're
using<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:25.930> polishing<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:27.310> let's<00:01:27.549> take<00:01:27.729> a

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
using it and polishing so let's take a

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.429 
using it and polishing so let's take a
look<00:01:27.939> at<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.619> particulars<00:01:29.619> of<00:01:29.770> this<00:01:30.270> table

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
look at the particulars of this table

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.660 
look at the particulars of this table
well<00:01:32.439> it's<00:01:32.619> made<00:01:32.770> out<00:01:32.979> of<00:01:33.540> tube<00:01:34.540> steel<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
well it's made out of tube steel and it

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.410 
well it's made out of tube steel and it
can<00:01:37.090> roll<00:01:37.329> just<00:01:37.689> like<00:01:37.869> our<00:01:38.049> pour<00:01:38.380> tables<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
can roll just like our pour tables it

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.280 
can roll just like our pour tables it
has<00:01:40.659> a<00:01:40.950> rack<00:01:41.950> where<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:43.259> countertop<00:01:44.259> is

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
has a rack where the countertop is

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.760 
has a rack where the countertop is
placed<00:01:44.740> usually<00:01:45.369> on<00:01:45.640> some<00:01:45.850> foam<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.770> these

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
placed usually on some foam and these

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.920 
placed usually on some foam and these
high<00:01:48.009> sides<00:01:48.340> are<00:01:48.610> removable<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.390> can<00:01:49.539> pull

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
high sides are removable you can pull

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.130 
high sides are removable you can pull
these<00:01:50.079> up<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.759> these<00:01:51.969> are<00:01:52.149> act<00:01:52.420> as<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.689> splash

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
these up but these are act as a splash

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.959 
these up but these are act as a splash
guard<00:01:53.439> essentially<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.520> when<00:01:54.820> the

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
guard essentially so that when the

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.929 
guard essentially so that when the
polisher<00:01:55.960> is<00:01:56.020> spraying<00:01:56.590> water<00:01:57.009> out<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:57.729> not

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
polisher is spraying water out it's not

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.770 
polisher is spraying water out it's not
going<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.390> get<00:01:58.659> you<00:01:58.810> soaked<00:01:59.110> and<00:02:00.180> once<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.420> the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
going to get you soaked and once the the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.620 
going to get you soaked and once the the
water<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.409> collected<00:02:03.159> it<00:02:04.030> goes<00:02:04.299> into<00:02:04.600> a

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
water is collected it goes into a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.380 
water is collected it goes into a
reservoir<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.700> through<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.820> reservoir<00:02:07.119> it's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
reservoir and through the reservoir it's

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.940 
reservoir and through the reservoir it's
pumped<00:02:07.719> into<00:02:09.119> this

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
pumped into this

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.819 
pumped into this
syndra<00:02:11.950> fickle<00:02:12.220> filter<00:02:12.670> here<00:02:13.390> it's<00:02:14.109> a<00:02:14.320> filter

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
syndra fickle filter here it's a filter

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.699 
syndra fickle filter here it's a filter
chamber<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.450> separates<00:02:17.170> out<00:02:17.410> the

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
chamber and it separates out the

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.759 
chamber and it separates out the
effluents<00:02:18.220> with<00:02:18.400> centrifugal<00:02:18.940> force<00:02:19.390> and

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
effluents with centrifugal force and

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.370 
effluents with centrifugal force and
part<00:02:20.769> of<00:02:20.829> it<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.390> shot<00:02:22.390> into<00:02:22.630> this<00:02:22.930> container

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
part of it is shot into this container

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.720 
part of it is shot into this container
and<00:02:23.620> then<00:02:23.920> refill<00:02:24.340> turd<00:02:24.519> out<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:25.209> can<00:02:25.420> take

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
and then refill turd out this can take

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.120 
and then refill turd out this can take
particles<00:02:27.730> out<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.180> 10<00:02:28.419> microns<00:02:28.930> which<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:29.919> of

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
particles out to 10 microns which is of

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.680 
particles out to 10 microns which is of
pretty<00:02:30.579> small

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
pretty small

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.890 
pretty small
and<00:02:31.810> it's<00:02:32.590> that's<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.610> way<00:02:33.820> this<00:02:34.450> machine

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
and it's that's the way this machine

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.310 
and it's that's the way this machine
keeps<00:02:35.820> recycling<00:02:37.050> taking<00:02:38.050> out<00:02:38.170> these

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
keeps recycling taking out these

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.070 
keeps recycling taking out these
effluents<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.070> then<00:02:39.910> you're<00:02:40.390> using<00:02:40.600> nice

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
effluents and then you're using nice

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.220 
effluents and then you're using nice
clean<00:02:41.410> water<00:02:42.330> once<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.480> do<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:44.110> can

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
clean water once you do that you can

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.710 
clean water once you do that you can
