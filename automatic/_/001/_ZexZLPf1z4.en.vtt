00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 And today I show you how you are 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.010
 Just call the skin color might say 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.080
 for example pimples like this one 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.139
 or even whole hair the picture site 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.440
 like this can recommend that is 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.760
 just before the survey after that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.689
 that before and I already have 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.619
 edited and I want to show how 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:30.210
 you come from there for that I do 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.800
 Open it once and go to the log and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.950
 you see them all already 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.879
 repair by added actually 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.120
 reset one piece and sow 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.379
 now here again and now 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.980
 to look at the next one and be 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.820
 for that i take this plant to go and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.180
 on the stock exchange or room spray pixel size 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.460
 were 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.960
 I'll just take the egos that is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.140
 just about the fitness and with one 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.559
 click the pimple away for it 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.539
 just another piece of skin yes to his 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.309
 brother, if we look now 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.260
 once we hide that we see 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.090
 pimple already much less to see 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.920
 as achieve 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.119
 now you can see what new iphone 5 is 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.030
 and entire areas where you go for it 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.479
 Let's make this tool 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.280
 it a little bit smaller and likes it here 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.909
 once the complete h so shows us the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.439
 areas with which wants to build 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.590
 and I like it all so well 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.040
 I do that then I'll do it now 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.470
 couple of other little beers in the area 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.470
 We go so think of the spot 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.470
 expenditure 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:57.440
 you see, that is in comparison to before 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:59.180
 already much better about this symbol 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.790
 ii was able to improve the points 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.140
 hide from all and in the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.810
 comparison sees this is already 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.710
 really better came out so now 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.570
 I want the skin still soft 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.380
 draws that is also very easy 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.800
 give here on the correction brush 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.320
 acts and and concluded with his us plan 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.700
 Just show us how you can treat us once 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.810
 where to play the areas 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.300
 an example of these areas 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.030
 so now we could do it all again 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.330
 and the editing will be done 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.440
 These brand just packets from applied 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.120
 and now we go on the rules 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.460
 clarity and cds negative area and 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.450
 You see the skin is versatile 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.890
 behind than on this page 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.120
 and that's exactly the way I have 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.110
 confirm today and ready now 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.200

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.270
 I will be much more beautiful 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.720
 Niederzier and yes so could us 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.970
 made all my face and struggled for 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.640
 the whole face about 20 minutes 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:21.260
 needs let's see we go 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:24.130
 protocol passed on place two and 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.130
 three 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.060
