00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
of thinking of video game for that's

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.090 
of thinking of video game for that's
where<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.480> draws<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> lot<00:00:16.080> get<00:00:16.619> ready<00:00:16.830> because

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
where it draws a lot get ready because

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.519 
where it draws a lot get ready because

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
this is another bad game okay slower at

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.200 
this is another bad game okay slower at
the<00:00:22.590> main<00:00:22.890> menu<00:00:22.920> screen<00:00:23.580> here<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:26.210> basically

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the main menu screen here and basically

and you play mode you got competition or

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.450 
and you play mode you got competition or
versal<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.960> endurance<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
versal and endurance and right here you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.660 
versal and endurance and right here you
can<00:00:35.579> see<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.630> got<00:00:36.809> your<00:00:37.280> wardrobe<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.309> can

in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> forward<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.719> game<00:00:43.219> but<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.520> said

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
in the forward for this game but I said

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.600 
in the forward for this game but I said
some<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> common<00:00:46.170> look<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.739> great<00:00:47.010> for

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
some of the common look really great for

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.959 
some of the common look really great for
the<00:00:47.789> wardroom<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.890> gameplay<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:51.210> just

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
the wardroom but the gameplay is just

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.459 
the wardroom but the gameplay is just
not<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.719> much<00:00:54.899> anything<00:00:55.649> special<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
not that much anything special so

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.650 
not that much anything special so
basically<00:00:58.550> as<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.030> there's<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> lot

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
basically as you can see there's a lot

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.080 
basically as you can see there's a lot
of<00:01:00.690> weight<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.590> suppose<00:01:01.920> reporter<00:01:02.370> baby<00:01:02.579> you

the<00:01:35.240> record<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.930> easy<00:01:36.290> but<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.880> would

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
the record this is easy but it would

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.660 
the record this is easy but it would
have<00:01:38.180> been<00:01:38.330> better<00:01:38.630> if<00:01:39.350> they<00:01:39.680> had<00:01:40.040> added<00:01:40.280> some

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
have been better if they had added some

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.510 
have been better if they had added some
more<00:01:41.150> stuff<00:01:41.630> into<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:42.800> it<00:01:42.920> does<00:01:43.100> kind<00:01:43.430> of

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
more stuff into it but it does kind of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.430 
more stuff into it but it does kind of
get<00:01:43.640> harder<00:01:43.970> like<00:01:44.120> but<00:01:44.390> yet<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:44.870> holding<00:01:45.229> down

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
get harder like but yet so holding down

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.500 
get harder like but yet so holding down
me<00:01:45.800> about<00:01:46.070> me<00:01:46.540> but<00:01:47.540> it's<00:01:47.920> very<00:01:48.920> easy<00:01:49.510> there's

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
me about me but it's very easy there's

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.390 
me about me but it's very easy there's
this<00:01:50.720> really<00:01:50.960> not<00:01:51.290> most<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.890> game<00:01:52.100> this<00:01:52.220> is

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
this really not most to the game this is

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.090 
this really not most to the game this is
always<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.240> mean<00:01:53.750> was<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:54.650> all<00:01:54.890> they<00:01:55.040> could

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
always to I mean was this all they could

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.410 
always to I mean was this all they could
think<00:01:55.220> of<00:01:57.220> I'm<00:01:58.220> not<00:01:58.399> asking<00:01:58.850> for<00:01:59.060> my<00:01:59.240> like

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
think of I'm not asking for my like

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.510 
think of I'm not asking for my like
American<00:01:59.930> height<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.170> sight<00:02:00.500> spoiler<00:02:01.040> but<00:02:01.280> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
American height of sight spoiler but I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.410 
American height of sight spoiler but I
mean<00:02:01.820> they<00:02:01.940> could<00:02:02.119> have<00:02:02.149> thought<00:02:02.360> of

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
mean they could have thought of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.540 
mean they could have thought of
something<00:02:02.869> better<00:02:03.080> than<00:02:03.410> this<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.890> if

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
something better than this and if

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.400 
something better than this and if
the<00:02:07.700> way<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:07.910> like<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.690> couple<00:02:08.899> of<00:02:09.050> seconds

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
the way is like the couple of seconds

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.070 
the way is like the couple of seconds
before<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:10.100> law<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:11.209> really<00:02:11.510> write<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.870> I'm

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
before a law you really write it I'm

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.360

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
and could have been better than what it

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.759 
and could have been better than what it
was<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.430> got<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.700> be<00:04:17.850> something<00:04:18.780> very

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
Monica I know it's a music game but I

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.150 
Monica I know it's a music game but I

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.690 
think they could have come up something
then<00:04:32.400> better<00:04:33.000> than<00:04:33.419> button<00:04:33.870> mashing<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:35.370> not

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
then better than button mashing and not

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.210 
then better than button mashing and not
