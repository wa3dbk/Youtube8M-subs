 I had read last year and I found 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.029

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.410

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.170
 mixture of meditation and relaxation 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.930
 on the water 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.879
 that's good for the whole body so 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.309
 really from the feet up to the neck 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.980
 muscular and very good 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.469
 the back-end for patients 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.180
 benefit from that very well that we now 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.780
 also our editor sabine super 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.430
 test 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.559
 she does the self-experiment and dares 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.600
 a taster course with sap coach birgit 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.270
 I'm just starting to land 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.130
 theory and a little bit 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.500
 dry exercises just how to paddle 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.939
 Bends someone stops then go 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.840
 we are in the water here at the front 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.340
 Slipway we can go in and 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.220
 only put things on our knees 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.470
 on the board and paddle more like this 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.750
 bit out the front and then practice 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.080
 the paddle strokes and how to trend like that 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.689
 continue 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.490
 and then we slowly get up and then 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.710
 At least we drive at 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.320
 Introductory course now one and a half 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.479
 hours scary exciting so me 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.659
 did not think that I could do it 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.729
 without falling into the water and it 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.820
 is really training all muscles right now 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.979
 So muscle abdominals muscle you have to 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.439
 make a good effort so that you stand 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.570

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.159
