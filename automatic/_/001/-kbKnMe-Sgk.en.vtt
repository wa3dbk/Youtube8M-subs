00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
will have much better call quality and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
will have much better call quality and
it<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.270> feature<00:00:54.480> double<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.140> data<00:00:55.320> speeds

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it will feature double the data speeds

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.560 
it will feature double the data speeds
depending<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.370> which<00:00:56.550> carrier<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
depending on which carrier you have of

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.260 
depending on which carrier you have of
course<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> 4<00:00:58.980> gia<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> data

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
course it's not up to 4 gia but the data

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.540 
course it's not up to 4 gia but the data
speeds<00:01:00.629> are<00:01:00.840> greatly<00:01:01.350> improved<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
speeds are greatly improved now the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.490 
speeds are greatly improved now the
battery<00:01:03.090> life<00:01:03.270> has<00:01:03.300> been<00:01:03.570> greatly<00:01:04.049> improved

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
battery life has been greatly improved

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.370 
battery life has been greatly improved
I'd<00:01:04.920> say<00:01:05.220> by<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.549> 30%<00:01:05.970> over<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.630> iPhone<00:01:07.020> 4

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
I'd say by about 30% over the iPhone 4

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.620 
I'd say by about 30% over the iPhone 4
and<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:08.159> thought<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> iPhone<00:01:08.790> 4<00:01:09.119> had<00:01:09.299> great

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and I thought the iPhone 4 had great

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.210 
and I thought the iPhone 4 had great
battery<00:01:09.840> life<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.530> that's<00:01:10.680> definitely<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
battery life so that's definitely a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.429 
battery life so that's definitely a
really<00:01:11.549> good<00:01:11.670> thing<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.030> me<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.600> use<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.260> iPhone

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
really good thing for me I use my iPhone

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.830 
really good thing for me I use my iPhone
a<00:01:13.680> lot<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.369> now<00:01:15.030> you'll<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.270> able<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.659> listen
