my<00:00:04.440> worst<00:00:04.620> type<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:04.890> job<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.490> skimming<00:00:06.270> over

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
my worst type of job is skimming over

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.480 
my worst type of job is skimming over
all<00:00:06.569> war<00:00:06.810> with<00:00:07.049> all<00:00:07.259> different<00:00:07.440> surfaces<00:00:08.160> and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
all war with all different surfaces and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.589 
all war with all different surfaces and
could<00:00:09.330> have<00:00:09.480> dry<00:00:10.019> their<00:00:10.710> plaster<00:00:11.219> on<00:00:11.400> it

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
could have dry their plaster on it

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.570 
could have dry their plaster on it
painted<00:00:12.599> surface<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.500> some<00:00:13.950> backing<00:00:14.190> coats

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
painted surface and some backing coats

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.180 
painted surface and some backing coats
and<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.660> quite<00:00:15.900> hard<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.590> find<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.949> product

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
and it's quite hard to find a product

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.480 
and it's quite hard to find a product
that<00:00:17.699> will<00:00:18.539> go<00:00:19.080> over<00:00:19.109> all<00:00:19.710> those<00:00:19.920> surfaces

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
that will go over all those surfaces

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.240 
that will go over all those surfaces
this<00:00:20.970> unification<00:00:21.449> I've<00:00:22.109> been<00:00:22.680> using<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.220> for

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
this unification I've been using it for

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.279 
this unification I've been using it for
quite<00:00:23.460> awhile<00:00:23.730> gone<00:00:24.359> over<00:00:24.660> all<00:00:24.930> different

quite awhile gone over all different

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.380 
quite awhile gone over all different
types<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.680> stuff<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.519> would<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> problem

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
types of stuff that would be a problem

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.720 
types of stuff that would be a problem
not<00:00:27.750> one<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.710> areas<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.189> we've<00:00:29.519> covered

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
not one of the areas that we've covered

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.120 
not one of the areas that we've covered
has<00:00:30.269> been<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> problem<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> vicarage<00:00:31.470> with

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
has been a problem at the vicarage with

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.790 
has been a problem at the vicarage with
it<00:00:32.250> being<00:00:32.520> built<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:33.050> 1850<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.680> too

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it being built in 1850 it's not in too

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560 
it being built in 1850 it's not in too
bad<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> condition<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.270> go<00:00:36.420> around

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
bad a condition but as we go around

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.569 
bad a condition but as we go around
we're<00:00:37.110> coming<00:00:37.380> across<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.950> lot<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.250> different

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
we're coming across a lot of different

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.119 
we're coming across a lot of different
problems<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.230> surfaces<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.680> needs

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
problems with the surfaces that needs

00:00:41.129 --> 00:01:04.719 
problems with the surfaces that needs
skimming

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.370 

this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.880> water<00:01:06.090> we're<00:01:06.330> gonna<00:01:06.390> skin<00:01:06.750> today<00:01:06.930> got

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
this is water we're gonna skin today got

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.930 
this is water we're gonna skin today got
three<00:01:07.620> different<00:01:07.979> surfaces<00:01:08.160> you've<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
three different surfaces you've got the

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.210 
three different surfaces you've got the
painted<00:01:09.330> surface<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.080> B<00:01:10.200> okay<00:01:10.590> I've<00:01:10.890> got<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
painted surface and B okay I've got the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.760 
painted surface and B okay I've got the
lime<00:01:11.520> water<00:01:11.700> mix<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.900> gonna<00:01:13.050> dry<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.619> little

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
lime water mix that's gonna dry a little

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.219 
lime water mix that's gonna dry a little
bit<00:01:13.920> quicker<00:01:14.250> than<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.550> paint<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:16.050> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
bit quicker than the paint and then the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.770 
bit quicker than the paint and then the
bottom<00:01:16.500> surface<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.490> hard<00:01:17.700> wall<00:01:17.970> this

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
bottom surface is the hard wall this

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200 
bottom surface is the hard wall this
will<00:01:18.990> need<00:01:19.110> scraping<00:01:19.560> down<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.729> will<00:01:20.970> dry

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
will need scraping down and it will dry

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:31.870 
will need scraping down and it will dry
a<00:01:21.450> lot<00:01:21.660> faster<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.410> than<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.800> opportune

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.430 

biggest<00:01:32.880> challenge<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.480> this<00:01:33.660> wall<00:01:33.960> will

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
biggest challenge of this wall will

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.670 
biggest challenge of this wall will
definitely<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> bottom<00:01:35.760> where<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.680> hard

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
definitely be the bottom where the hard

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.400 
definitely be the bottom where the hard
wall<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:39.240> will<00:01:39.420> drive<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.900> fast<00:01:40.050> on

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
wall is it will drive really fast on

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.330 
wall is it will drive really fast on
that<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.190> I'm<00:01:41.850> gonna<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.330> top<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.720> first

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
that so I'm gonna get the top on first

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.130 
that so I'm gonna get the top on first
and<00:01:44.340> maybe<00:01:44.550> lay<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.330> little<00:01:45.570> bit<00:01:45.750> with

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and maybe lay that in a little bit with

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.130 
and maybe lay that in a little bit with
a<00:01:46.170> second<00:01:46.650> coat<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.160> then<00:01:48.150> put<00:01:48.510> a<00:01:48.540> tight<00:01:48.840> coat

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
a second coat and then put a tight coat

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.020 
a second coat and then put a tight coat
on<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.440> bottom<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.980> then<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.370> might<00:01:50.580> have<00:01:50.760> two

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
on the bottom and then it might have two

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.940 
on the bottom and then it might have two
or<00:01:51.060> three<00:01:51.420> coats<00:01:51.690> on<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.020> bottom<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.530> catch<00:01:52.710> up

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
or three coats on the bottom to catch up

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:15.710 
or three coats on the bottom to catch up
with<00:01:52.980> the<00:01:53.190> top

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.750 

and<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.959> bottom<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.770> where<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.130> hard<00:02:18.550> wall

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
and the bottom is where the hard wall

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.120 
and the bottom is where the hard wall
was<00:02:19.000> he<00:02:19.180> sucked<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.690> quite<00:02:19.959> fast<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:20.830> I've<00:02:20.950> put

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
was he sucked in quite fast but I've put

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.010 
was he sucked in quite fast but I've put
another<00:02:21.400> coat<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.540> give<00:02:22.690> me<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.810> bit

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
another coat on just to give me a bit

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.260 
another coat on just to give me a bit
more<00:02:23.050> time<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.739> get<00:02:24.610> this<00:02:24.730> finish

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
more time to get this finish

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.850 
more time to get this finish
there's<00:02:25.480> been<00:02:25.630> no<00:02:25.810> messing<00:02:26.140> about<00:02:26.260> I've<00:02:26.620> came

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
there's been no messing about I've came

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.430 
there's been no messing about I've came
in<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.160> morning<00:02:27.580> didn't<00:02:28.330> after<00:02:28.599> PVA<00:02:29.020> just

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
in this morning didn't after PVA just

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.220 
in this morning didn't after PVA just
slapped<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:29.890> straight<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:31.720> finishes

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
slapped it straight on and the finishes

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.199 
slapped it straight on and the finishes
come<00:02:32.410> off<00:02:32.530> really<00:02:32.769> silky<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.400> smooth<00:02:33.730> it's

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
come off really silky and smooth it's

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.660 
come off really silky and smooth it's
been<00:02:34.420> great<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:35.080> put<00:02:35.769> on<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.250> same<00:02:36.280> as

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
been great to put on it's the same as

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.910 
been great to put on it's the same as
putting<00:02:36.849> on<00:02:37.090> multi<00:02:37.660> finish<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.319> can<00:02:38.470> move<00:02:38.769> it

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
putting on multi finish you can move it

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.150 
putting on multi finish you can move it
around<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.519> it's<00:02:39.640> workable<00:02:40.239> the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
around and it's workable the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.080 
around and it's workable the
indentations<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.310> get<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> plaster

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
indentations you get in the plaster

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.910 
indentations you get in the plaster
sometimes<00:02:43.540> can<00:02:43.810> easily<00:02:44.200> be<00:02:44.349> filled<00:02:44.590> the
