without<00:01:30.780> having<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.500> unclamp<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.250> from<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
without having to unclamp it from the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.370 
without having to unclamp it from the
table<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.260> important<00:01:34.260> part<00:01:34.500> was<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.030> MDF

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
table the important part was this MDF

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.140 
table the important part was this MDF
frame<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.770> holds<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.430> door<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.880> place

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
frame that holds the door in place

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.540 
frame that holds the door in place
really<00:01:39.600> needs<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.110> flush<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.460> way

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
really needs to be flush all the way

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.700 
really needs to be flush all the way
across<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.210> don't<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:42.960> perfect<00:01:43.410> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
across and you don't have a perfect a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.310 
across and you don't have a perfect a
flush<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.369> couple<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.300> simple<00:01:45.509> playing<00:01:45.899> cards

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
flush a couple of simple playing cards

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.350 
flush a couple of simple playing cards
in<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> corners<00:01:48.590> shim<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.210> very

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
in the corners shim it up so it's very

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.139 
in the corners shim it up so it's very
flush<00:01:51.800> any<00:01:52.800> or<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.490> slide<00:01:53.700> easily<00:01:53.910> over

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
flush any or a little slide easily over

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.800 
flush any or a little slide easily over
that<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:55.860> pretty<00:01:56.009> much<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:57.509> frame

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
that so it's pretty much to the frame

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.320 
that so it's pretty much to the frame
the<00:01:58.110> jig<00:01:58.289> itself<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:59.250> nice<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.970> rig

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
the jig itself it's nice if you can rig

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.260 
the jig itself it's nice if you can rig
up<00:02:00.509> something<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:01.080> your<00:02:01.229> dust<00:02:01.440> collection

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
up something for your dust collection

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.940 
up something for your dust collection
and/or<00:02:03.270> power<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:04.320> hang<00:02:04.560> from<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> ceiling

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and/or power to hang from the ceiling

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.920 
and/or power to hang from the ceiling
keep<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.880> stuff<00:02:06.119> out<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.330> your<00:02:06.420> way<00:02:06.630> because

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
keep that stuff out of your way because

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 
keep that stuff out of your way because
you'll<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.009> building<00:02:08.280> some<00:02:08.459> spinning

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
you'll have to be building some spinning

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.720 
you'll have to be building some spinning
to<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:10.979> what<00:02:11.100> we<00:02:11.340> ended<00:02:11.640> up

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
to get that so this is what we ended up

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.949 
to get that so this is what we ended up
with<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:13.590> old<00:02:13.769> door<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.250> had<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.610> match<00:02:14.959> on

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
with the old door that I had to match on

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.259 
with the old door that I had to match on
this<00:02:16.140> new<00:02:16.560> door<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.760> cut

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
this new door that I cut

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.180 
this new door that I cut
after<00:02:19.080> finding<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> right<00:02:19.590> router<00:02:19.860> for

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
after finding the right router for

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.840 
after finding the right router for
putting<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.299> edge<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.350> next<00:02:22.650> step

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
putting the edge on it is the next step

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.949 
putting the edge on it is the next step
so<00:02:23.850> I'll<00:02:23.970> go<00:02:24.060> ahead<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.330> run<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.480> little<00:02:24.690> bit<00:02:24.810> of

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
so I'll go ahead and run a little bit of

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.729 
so I'll go ahead and run a little bit of
this<00:02:25.130> show<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.190> guys<00:02:26.430> how<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:27.290> work<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.440> if<00:02:28.650> you

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
this show you guys how to work it if you
