00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
let's see we got the that wire and that

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.189 
let's see we got the that wire and that
wire<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:17.180> back<00:00:19.100> there<00:00:20.100> are<00:00:20.760> all<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.660> rear

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
wire and back there are all the rear

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.759 
wire and back there are all the rear
speaker<00:00:22.710> wires<00:00:23.480> which<00:00:24.480> then<00:00:24.810> go<00:00:25.140> under<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
speaker wires which then go under the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.910 
speaker wires which then go under the
carpet<00:00:26.990> where<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.109> can't<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.590> them<00:00:28.769> because

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
carpet where you can't see them because

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.630 
carpet where you can't see them because
that's<00:00:29.130> actually<00:00:29.519> wire<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.300> something<00:00:30.630> else

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
that's actually wire for something else

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.450 
that's actually wire for something else
under<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> carpet<00:00:33.210> underneath<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.460> thing

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
under the carpet underneath the thing

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610 
under the carpet underneath the thing
and<00:00:35.700> then<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> comes<00:00:36.930> out<00:00:37.079> there

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and then you can see it comes out there

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.100 
and then you can see it comes out there
I<00:00:37.649> didn't<00:00:38.010> finish<00:00:38.190> hiding<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.930> goes<00:00:39.930> with

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I didn't finish hiding it goes with

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
I didn't finish hiding it goes with
speakers<00:00:40.850> in<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.600> cardboard<00:00:43.399> thing<00:00:44.399> here

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
speakers in this cardboard thing here

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.430 
speakers in this cardboard thing here
that<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> built<00:00:45.530> out<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:47.840> double<00:00:48.840> corrugated

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
that I built out of double corrugated

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.540 
that I built out of double corrugated
cardboard<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:52.500> box<00:00:52.770> from<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.309> TV<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:55.550> just

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
cardboard the box from my TV and just

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760 
cardboard the box from my TV and just
hot<00:00:57.090> glued<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> together<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.649> actually

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
hot glued it together and it actually

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.450 
hot glued it together and it actually
fits<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.059> well<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> haven't<00:01:02.190> actually

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
fits so well that I haven't actually

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.200 
fits so well that I haven't actually
attached<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.329> anything<00:01:03.750> yet<00:01:03.870> because

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
attached it with anything yet because

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.130 
attached it with anything yet because
the<00:01:06.210> seat<00:01:07.310> here<00:01:08.330> when<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.420> fold<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
the seat here when you fold it all the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.719 
the seat here when you fold it all the
way<00:01:10.229> back<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.979> right<00:01:11.189> now<00:01:11.250> it's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
way back like it is right now it's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.929 
way back like it is right now it's
actually<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.450> against<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:14.189> cardboard<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
actually up against the cardboard and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.280 
actually up against the cardboard and
pushes<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:16.939> pushes<00:01:17.939> out<00:01:18.060> hard<00:01:18.450> enough<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.930> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
pushes it pushes out hard enough that it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.190 
pushes it pushes out hard enough that it
just<00:01:19.590> stays<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.009> place<00:01:20.250> by<00:01:20.549> itself<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
just stays in place by itself so the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.050 
just stays in place by itself so the
only<00:01:22.409> time<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.680> would<00:01:22.950> actually<00:01:23.100> need<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.729> put

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
only time I would actually need to put

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
only time I would actually need to put
anything<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.560> attach<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.220> be

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
anything on there to attach it would be

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.390 
anything on there to attach it would be
if<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.820> folded<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> seat<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:28.070> otherwise<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
if I folded the seat down otherwise I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.550 
if I folded the seat down otherwise I
could<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.700> leave<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.880> back<00:01:30.150> there<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
could just leave it back there like that

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.980 
could just leave it back there like that
and<00:01:31.909> I<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> only<00:01:33.390> problem<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.869> I

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and I think the only problem that I

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.920 
and I think the only problem that I
could<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.570> had<00:01:36.720> like

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
could have with it is that if I had like

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.390 
could have with it is that if I had like
all<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.290> windows<00:01:37.619> rolled<00:01:37.829> down<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.310> know

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
all the windows rolled down you know

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.910 
all the windows rolled down you know
including<00:01:38.880> these<00:01:39.119> ones<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.930> water<00:01:40.590> could

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
including these ones that water could

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.270 
including these ones that water could
get<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> wet<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:43.280> I'll

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
get on it and get it wet but I'll

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.670 
get on it and get it wet but I'll
eventually<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.479> cover<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.020> carpet

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
eventually you know cover it in carpet

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.510 
eventually you know cover it in carpet
or<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:47.369> least<00:01:47.640> paint<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.360> something<00:01:49.520> but

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
or at least paint it or something but

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.580 
or at least paint it or something but
yeah<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.149> works<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.259> figure<00:01:52.409> out

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
yeah it works I just have to figure out

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.670 
yeah it works I just have to figure out
where<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.770> put<00:01:53.009> front<00:01:53.250> speakers<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:54.680> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
where to put front speakers now it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.749 
where to put front speakers now it
sounds<00:01:56.100> pretty<00:01:56.280> good<00:01:57.500> my<00:01:58.500> mp3<00:01:58.829> player<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.460> dead

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
sounds pretty good my mp3 player is dead

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.969 
sounds pretty good my mp3 player is dead
though<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.049> haven't<00:02:01.409> gotten<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.890> just

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
though because I haven't gotten I just

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.700 
though because I haven't gotten I just
what<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.450> installed<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.290> Sunday

I'm<00:02:37.500> almost<00:02:37.890> 24,000<00:02:38.820> miles<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:39.810> noticed

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
I'm almost 24,000 miles I just noticed

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.860
