Jase<00:00:31.850> the<00:00:32.850> idea<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> game<00:00:34.469> 2<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.829> 3<00:00:35.040> we

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
Jase the idea here is game 2 and 3 we

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.670 
Jase the idea here is game 2 and 3 we
need<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.760> aware<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.540> both<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> gate<00:00:37.380> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
need to be aware of both in the gate and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.639 
need to be aware of both in the gate and
ban<00:00:38.219> charm<00:00:38.579> both<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.540> which<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.870> probably<00:00:40.440> in

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
ban charm both of which are probably in

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
our opponents deck at this point and so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.490 
our opponents deck at this point and so
knowing<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.450> safely<00:00:45.629> resolve<00:00:46.170> Jase

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500

knowing that we can safely resolve Jase
is<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:48.170> pretty<00:00:49.170> important<00:00:51.680> on<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.860> turn<00:00:53.129> we

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
is is pretty important on this turn we

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.529 
is is pretty important on this turn we
can<00:00:53.840> try<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> resolve<00:00:55.199> our<00:00:55.530> time<00:00:56.129> sieve<00:00:56.539> but

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
can try to resolve our time sieve but

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
can try to resolve our time sieve but
there<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.920> negate<00:00:59.219> which<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.699> are<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.000> able

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
there is a negate which we are then able

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.260 
there is a negate which we are then able
to<00:01:00.510> dispel<00:01:01.699> basically<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> side<00:01:02.969> boarding

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
to dispel basically the side boarding

and so pilgrims I'll step in the way and

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.259 
and so pilgrims I'll step in the way and
allow<00:02:03.600> us<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.990> keep<00:02:04.170> our<00:02:04.320> tezzeret<00:02:04.799> around<00:02:05.130> a

on<00:03:01.980> clock<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.610> need<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.299> finish<00:03:03.450> my<00:03:03.720> opponent

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
on clock I need to finish my opponent

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.099 
on clock I need to finish my opponent
off<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.590> he's<00:03:05.489> tapped<00:03:05.850> down<00:03:06.120> such<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.870> I

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
off and he's tapped down such that I

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.710 
off and he's tapped down such that I
know<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:07.920> can<00:03:08.190> do<00:03:08.310> whatever<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.639> want<00:03:08.760> on<00:03:09.329> this

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
know I can do whatever I want on this

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.920 
know I can do whatever I want on this
turn<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:11.250> decided<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.329> it's<00:03:12.510> best<00:03:12.569> to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
turn and so I decided that it's best to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.430 
turn and so I decided that it's best to
just<00:03:12.959> push<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.950> try<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:14.880> go<00:03:15.030> off<00:03:15.209> here<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.870> feel

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
just push and try to go off here I feel

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.530 
just push and try to go off here I feel
like<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.799> chances<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.280> being<00:03:17.850> able<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.150> win<00:03:18.329> or

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
like the chances of being able to win or

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.819 
like the chances of being able to win or
are<00:03:18.920> fairly<00:03:19.920> strong<00:03:20.430> being<00:03:21.239> able<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:21.900> have

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
are fairly strong being able to I have

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.370 
are fairly strong being able to I have
an<00:03:23.040> open<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.340> vaults<00:03:23.609> in<00:03:23.730> hand<00:03:23.940> already<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.600> a

an open the vaults in hand already and a

couple of times seif turns in me with

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
vaults here on turn 7 I guess it is my

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.150 
vaults here on turn 7 I guess it is my
turn<00:03:36.810> 7<00:03:37.349> and<00:03:39.019> that's<00:03:40.019> why<00:03:40.170> poems<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.859> be<00:03:40.980> so

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
turn 7 and that's why poems I can be so

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.849 
turn 7 and that's why poems I can be so
good<00:03:41.569> not<00:03:42.569> only<00:03:42.720> did<00:03:43.169> it<00:03:43.200> Chum<00:03:43.470> block<00:03:43.680> and

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
good not only did it Chum block and

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.460 
good not only did it Chum block and
protect<00:03:44.250> Tezzeret<00:03:44.730> but<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.840> fetched<00:03:46.260> just<00:03:46.410> a

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
protect Tezzeret but it's fetched just a

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.960 
protect Tezzeret but it's fetched just a
few<00:03:46.709> lands<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.250> we<00:03:47.340> were<00:03:47.400> able<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.639> make<00:03:47.819> our

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
few lands that we were able to make our

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.780 
few lands that we were able to make our
land<00:03:48.180> drops<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.810> arrive<00:03:49.769> at<00:03:49.799> six<00:03:50.190> lands<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.700> be

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
land drops and arrive at six lands to be

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.530 
land drops and arrive at six lands to be
able<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.180> hard<00:03:51.810> cast<00:03:52.109> with<00:03:52.470> basic<00:03:52.799> lands

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
able to just hard cast with basic lands

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.960 
able to just hard cast with basic lands
open<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.599> vaults<00:03:55.160> once<00:03:56.160> again<00:03:56.310> we<00:03:56.579> don't<00:03:56.669> draw

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
open the vaults once again we don't draw

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.479 
open the vaults once again we don't draw
any<00:03:57.150> action<00:03:57.690> with<00:03:57.930> our<00:03:59.180> time<00:04:00.180> Steve<00:04:00.480> turn<00:04:00.780> and

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
any action with our time Steve turn and

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.599 
any action with our time Steve turn and
so<00:04:02.489> we'll<00:04:02.910> have<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:04.530> see<00:04:04.739> what<00:04:04.859> this<00:04:05.010> term<00:04:05.280> can

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
so we'll have to see what this term can

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.330 
so we'll have to see what this term can
give<00:04:06.239> us<00:04:06.359> here<00:04:06.630> we<00:04:07.380> do<00:04:07.530> draw<00:04:07.769> into<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.100> time

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
give us here we do draw into the time

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.420 
give us here we do draw into the time
warp<00:04:08.609> thankfully<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:10.009> so<00:04:11.009> we're<00:04:11.130> able<00:04:11.250> to

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
warp thankfully and so we're able to

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.700 
warp thankfully and so we're able to
play<00:04:11.609> a<00:04:11.639> border<00:04:11.940> post

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
play a border post

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.420 
play a border post
and<00:04:13.000> cast<00:04:14.000> our<00:04:14.240> time<00:04:14.450> warp<00:04:14.720> we<00:04:15.710> can<00:04:15.860> cycle<00:04:16.220> away

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
and cast our time warp we can cycle away

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.690 
and cast our time warp we can cycle away
one<00:04:16.730> angel<00:04:16.940> song<00:04:17.300> probably<00:04:17.840> at<00:04:17.960> this<00:04:18.110> point

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
one angel song probably at this point

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.970 
one angel song probably at this point
perhaps<00:04:19.700> if<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:21.230> hand<00:04:21.500> looks<00:04:21.710> strong

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
perhaps if the the hand looks strong

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.090 
perhaps if the the hand looks strong
enough<00:04:22.220> you<00:04:22.370> could<00:04:22.550> cycle<00:04:23.330> away<00:04:23.510> both<00:04:23.720> but<00:04:24.100> I'd

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
enough you could cycle away both but I'd

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.160
