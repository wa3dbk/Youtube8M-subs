even though it's touching on such a
hot-button<00:01:26.400> issue<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:27.360> doesn't<00:01:27.750> cover<00:01:27.960> it

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
will not be home and so it's better to

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.110 
will not be home and so it's better to
stay<00:03:17.540> away<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:18.200> preserve<00:03:18.980> your<00:03:19.130> idea<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.910> home

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
not gone back that's really interesting

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.470 
not gone back that's really interesting
to<00:03:28.040> me<00:03:28.190> James<00:03:28.609> Baldwin<00:03:28.970> took<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.209> really<00:03:29.359> big

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
to me James Baldwin took a really big

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.000 
to me James Baldwin took a really big
risk<00:03:29.630> when<00:03:30.019> he<00:03:30.079> decided<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.590> publish<00:03:30.859> this

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
risk when he decided to publish this

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.039 
risk when he decided to publish this
book<00:03:31.069> his<00:03:31.760> publisher<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:32.269> believe<00:03:32.569> said<00:03:32.870> that

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
book his publisher I believe said that

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.840 
book his publisher I believe said that
he<00:03:33.200> should<00:03:33.260> burn<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:33.890> instead<00:03:34.430> because<00:03:34.730> they

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
he should burn it instead because they

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.250 
he should burn it instead because they
were<00:03:34.910> really<00:03:35.209> afraid<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:35.720> he<00:03:36.079> would

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
were really afraid that he would

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.680 
were really afraid that he would
alienate<00:03:36.890> his<00:03:37.340> african-american<00:03:37.880> audience

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
alienate his african-american audience

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.360
