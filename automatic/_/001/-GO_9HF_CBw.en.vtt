last<00:00:48.440> year<00:00:48.650> with<00:00:48.830> the<00:00:48.950> tr7<00:00:49.490> we<00:00:49.970> made<00:00:50.180> some

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
last year with the tr7 we made some

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.250 
last year with the tr7 we made some
pretty<00:00:50.840> major<00:00:51.460> outline<00:00:52.460> changes<00:00:53.060> and<00:00:53.360> this

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
pretty major outline changes and this

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.370 
pretty major outline changes and this
proved<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.710> give<00:00:55.610> us<00:00:55.700> a<00:00:55.790> good<00:00:56.000> effect<00:00:56.380> you'll

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
proved to give us a good effect you'll

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.000 
proved to give us a good effect you'll
increase<00:00:57.650> the<00:00:57.920> range<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.400> sales<00:00:58.700> and<00:01:00.010> you

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
increase the range of the sales and you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.250 
increase the range of the sales and you
know<00:01:01.100> left<00:01:01.460> lengths<00:01:01.760> got<00:01:01.910> shorter<00:01:02.420> chord

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
know left lengths got shorter chord

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.820 
know left lengths got shorter chord
lengths<00:01:03.559> got<00:01:03.770> wider<00:01:04.840> so<00:01:05.840> this<00:01:06.350> year<00:01:06.560> for<00:01:06.770> the

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
lengths got wider so this year for the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.190 
lengths got wider so this year for the
TRA<00:01:07.250> it's<00:01:07.670> been<00:01:08.000> really<00:01:08.479> good<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.930> get<00:01:09.050> the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
TRA it's been really good to get the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.880 
TRA it's been really good to get the
opportunity<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.890> go<00:01:10.460> through<00:01:11.150> all<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.619> sales

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
opportunity to go through all the sales

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.530 
opportunity to go through all the sales
with<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.520> what<00:01:13.820> we've<00:01:13.970> learned<00:01:14.210> from<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
with the what we've learned from the

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.310 
with the what we've learned from the
past<00:01:14.690> season<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.229> racing<00:01:15.410> and<00:01:16.750> further<00:01:17.750> refine

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
past season of racing and further refine

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.249 
past season of racing and further refine
them<00:01:18.619> in<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.670> way<00:01:19.790> that<00:01:19.910> in<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.390> profile<00:01:20.840> just

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
them in the way that in the profile just

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.290 
them in the way that in the profile just
shaped<00:01:21.590> distribution<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.640> also<00:01:22.910> in<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.180> way

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
shaped distribution and also in the way

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.710 
shaped distribution and also in the way
they<00:01:23.450> twist<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:25.250> make<00:01:25.610> like<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.940> next<00:01:26.330> big

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
they twist to make like the next big

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.950 
they twist to make like the next big
step<00:01:27.050> in<00:01:27.350> in<00:01:28.100> range<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:28.970> efficiency<00:01:29.690> of<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
step in in range and efficiency of the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.730 
step in in range and efficiency of the
sales<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.160> in<00:01:31.759> order<00:01:31.910> to<00:01:32.090> improve<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.869> release

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
sales so in order to improve the release

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.060 
sales so in order to improve the release
in<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.160> upper<00:01:34.970> leach<00:01:35.149> of<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.450> sale<00:01:35.720> we<00:01:36.110> found

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
in the upper leach of the sale we found

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.920 
in the upper leach of the sale we found
we<00:01:37.220> needed<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:37.700> stiffen<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.720> patch

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
we needed to stiffen the patch

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.320 
we needed to stiffen the patch
reinforcements<00:01:39.920> in<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.520> upper<00:01:40.820> left<00:01:41.090> sleeve

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
reinforcements in the upper left sleeve

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.740 
reinforcements in the upper left sleeve
and<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:42.410> allowed<00:01:42.680> us<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:43.149> flatten<00:01:44.149> that<00:01:44.300> area

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
and this allowed us to flatten that area

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.180 
and this allowed us to flatten that area
and<00:01:45.020> get<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:46.149> very<00:01:47.149> progressive<00:01:47.710> leech<00:01:48.710> twist

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
and get a very progressive leech twist

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.039 
and get a very progressive leech twist
which<00:01:49.460> extends<00:01:50.090> right<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.659> head<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.960> the

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
which extends right to the head of the

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.320 
which extends right to the head of the
sale<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:51.590> like<00:01:51.799> if<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.100> when<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.090> sale<00:01:53.299> is

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
sale so like if you when the sale is

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.179 
sale so like if you when the sale is
correctly<00:01:53.750> rigged<00:01:54.020> do<00:01:54.260> you<00:01:54.350> look<00:01:54.860> down<00:01:55.040> the

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
correctly rigged do you look down the

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.130 
correctly rigged do you look down the
leader<00:01:55.640> when<00:01:55.880> you're<00:01:56.000> on<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.180> water<00:01:56.330> this<00:01:56.990> is

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
leader when you're on the water this is

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.890 
leader when you're on the water this is
the<00:01:57.320> nice<00:01:57.890> straight<00:01:58.460> even<00:01:58.729> for<00:01:59.270> progressive

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
the nice straight even for progressive

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.499 
the nice straight even for progressive
twisting<00:02:00.350> in<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.880> responds<00:02:02.479> very

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
twisting in that and that responds very

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.660 
twisting in that and that responds very
well<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.200> wind<00:02:03.409> we<00:02:04.040> found<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.369> there<00:02:04.520> was

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
well in the wind we found that there was

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.669 
well in the wind we found that there was
a<00:02:05.530> nice<00:02:06.530> balance<00:02:06.920> between<00:02:07.220> having<00:02:08.679> enough

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
a nice balance between having enough

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.780 
a nice balance between having enough
leech<00:02:09.950> tension<00:02:10.549> to<00:02:10.910> give<00:02:11.239> you<00:02:11.390> optimum<00:02:12.610> low<00:02:13.610> at

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
leech tension to give you optimum low at

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.830 
leech tension to give you optimum low at
low<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.209> mid-range<00:02:14.650> power<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.010> efficiency

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
low and mid-range power and efficiency

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.600 
low and mid-range power and efficiency
but<00:02:17.840> also<00:02:17.900> enough<00:02:18.410> looseness<00:02:18.739> that<00:02:19.459> it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
but also enough looseness that it

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.960 
but also enough looseness that it
releases<00:02:20.299> excessive<00:02:21.290> bling<00:02:21.500> when<00:02:21.739> you're

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
releases excessive bling when you're

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.250 
releases excessive bling when you're
overpowered<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.630> really<00:02:23.900> really

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
overpowered and you know really really

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.560 
overpowered and you know really really
wound<00:02:24.530> up<00:02:24.739> like<00:02:25.040> such<00:02:25.310> as<00:02:25.459> pwa<00:02:26.150> racing

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
wound up like such as pwa racing

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
wound up like such as pwa racing
conditions<00:02:26.750> you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
conditions you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.220 
conditions you
and<00:02:27.709> Gus<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.060> there's<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.510> fine<00:02:29.810> line<00:02:29.840> you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
and Gus so that there's a fine line you

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.860 
and Gus so that there's a fine line you
can<00:02:30.410> make<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.730> open<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.360> lose<00:02:32.569> some

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
can make it to open and lose some

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.780 
can make it to open and lose some
low-end<00:02:33.200> power<00:02:33.500> or<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.129> make<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.400> too<00:02:34.580> tight

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
low-end power or you make it too tight

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.790 
low-end power or you make it too tight
and<00:02:35.060> then<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.239> feels<00:02:35.390> heavy<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.620> high<00:02:36.769> end

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
and then it feels heavy on the high end

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.520 
and then it feels heavy on the high end
so<00:02:37.220> we<00:02:37.370> aim<00:02:37.940> for<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.420> perfect<00:02:38.720> balance<00:02:38.989> where

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
so we aim for that perfect balance where

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.430 
so we aim for that perfect balance where
it<00:02:39.650> feels<00:02:39.879> light<00:02:40.879> in<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.239> hands<00:02:41.840> even<00:02:42.319> when

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
it feels light in the hands even when

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.410 
it feels light in the hands even when
you're<00:02:42.560> really<00:02:42.769> overpowered<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:44.030> still<00:02:44.269> has

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
you're really overpowered but still has

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.509 
you're really overpowered but still has
just<00:02:44.750> enough<00:02:44.989> tension<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.500> give<00:02:46.129> you<00:02:46.280> that

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
just enough tension to give you that

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.119 
just enough tension to give you that
optimum<00:02:47.120> power<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.660> efficiency<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.950> low

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
optimum power and efficiency in the low

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.610 
optimum power and efficiency in the low
and<00:02:49.280> mid<00:02:49.489> range<00:02:49.670> as<00:02:49.940> well<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.840> we<00:02:50.959> did<00:02:51.170> increase

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
and mid range as well so we did increase

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.890 
and mid range as well so we did increase
the<00:02:52.010> camp<00:02:52.819> pressure<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.599> amount<00:02:53.840> of

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900

to<00:03:28.690> facilitate<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:30.290> rotation<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:32.000> you'll

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
to facilitate the rotation so you'll

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.319 
to facilitate the rotation so you'll
find<00:03:32.359> they're<00:03:33.549> going<00:03:34.549> around<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.970> marks

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
overall rig tension we actually use a

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.809 
overall rig tension we actually use a
strain<00:04:01.910> gauge<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.450> measure<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:03.819> tension

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
to not only the field that you get on

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.800 
to not only the field that you get on
the<00:04:18.410> water<00:04:18.849> but<00:04:19.849> also<00:04:20.030> relating<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.750> to

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
the water but also relating that to

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.899 
the water but also relating that to
actual<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:22.160> know

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
actual you know

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.670 
actual you know
quantitative<00:04:23.909> data<00:04:24.659> that<00:04:25.110> we<00:04:25.199> received<00:04:25.590> from

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
quantitative data that we received from

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.029 
quantitative data that we received from
the<00:04:25.949> measurements<00:04:27.020> so<00:04:28.020> as<00:04:28.139> we<00:04:28.319> as<00:04:28.590> we<00:04:28.770> go

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
the measurements so as we as we go

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.360 
the measurements so as we as we go
through<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.430> size<00:04:29.639> range<00:04:29.909> we<00:04:30.569> found<00:04:30.930> that

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
through the size range we found that

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.290 
through the size range we found that
some<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.490> our<00:04:32.610> larger<00:04:32.819> sizes<00:04:34.699> needed<00:04:35.699> a<00:04:35.879> little

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
some of our larger sizes needed a little

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.879 
some of our larger sizes needed a little
bit<00:04:36.389> more<00:04:36.509> attention<00:04:36.599> especially<00:04:37.110> talking

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
bit more attention especially talking

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.360 
bit more attention especially talking
about<00:04:38.190> formula<00:04:38.849> sizes<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:40.099> maybe<00:04:41.099> some<00:04:41.310> of

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
about formula sizes and maybe some of

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.249 
about formula sizes and maybe some of
the<00:04:41.460> larger<00:04:41.789> slalom<00:04:42.389> sizes<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:43.199> we<00:04:43.830> added<00:04:45.259> in

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
the larger slalom sizes so we added in

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.980 
the larger slalom sizes so we added in
adding<00:04:46.889> additional<00:04:47.310> profile<00:04:48.150> shape<00:04:48.479> to<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
adding additional profile shape to the

adding additional profile shape to the
bottom<00:04:49.319> of<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.500> sales<00:04:49.800> we<00:04:50.129> also<00:04:50.280> added

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
bottom of the sales we also added

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.020 
bottom of the sales we also added
overall<00:04:51.240> tension<00:04:52.430> proportionately<00:04:53.430> more<00:04:53.490> in

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
overall tension proportionately more in

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.689 
overall tension proportionately more in
