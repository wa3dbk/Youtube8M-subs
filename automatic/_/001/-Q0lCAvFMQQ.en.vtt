this<00:00:01.079> video<00:00:01.410> just<00:00:01.709> talks<00:00:01.949> through<00:00:02.220> two<00:00:02.550> simple

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
this video just talks through two simple

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.240 
this video just talks through two simple
examples<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:04.230> subtraction<00:00:06.109> now<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.620> my<00:00:08.040> view

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
examples of subtraction now in my view

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.930 
examples of subtraction now in my view
the<00:00:08.400> best<00:00:08.550> way<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.849> subtract<00:00:09.650> is<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.980> write

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the best way to subtract is to write

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.200 
the best way to subtract is to write
down<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.179> two<00:00:12.450> numbers<00:00:12.809> lined<00:00:13.259> up<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.910> first

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
down the two numbers lined up the first

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.710 
down the two numbers lined up the first
number<00:00:17.180> take<00:00:18.180> away<00:00:18.619> the<00:00:19.619> second<00:00:19.949> number

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
number take away the second number

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.029 
number take away the second number
observe<00:00:21.720> how<00:00:21.930> I've<00:00:22.050> got<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.260> unis<00:00:22.619> lined<00:00:22.859> up

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
observe how I've got the unis lined up

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.439 
observe how I've got the unis lined up
the<00:00:23.670> tens<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.470> there's<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> hundreds<00:00:26.240> we<00:00:27.240> then

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the tens and there's a hundreds we then

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.849 
the tens and there's a hundreds we then
work<00:00:27.720> from<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:30.260> that's<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> key

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
work from the right that's the key

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.819 
work from the right that's the key
golden<00:00:32.160> rule<00:00:32.309> here<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.120> 7<00:00:33.630> take<00:00:34.230> away<00:00:34.260> 5<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.420> 2

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
golden rule here so 7 take away 5 is 2

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.190 
golden rule here so 7 take away 5 is 2
that<00:00:37.829> was<00:00:37.920> ok<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:39.120> when<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.540> come<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.930> to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that was ok but when I come to do to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.280 
that was ok but when I come to do to
take<00:00:40.680> away<00:00:40.829> 4<00:00:41.219> before<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.360> too<00:00:42.600> large<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
take away 4 before is too large and

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.590 
take away 4 before is too large and
better<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> 2<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.180> borrow<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:46.399> 1

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
better the 2 so I have to borrow a 1

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.540 
better the 2 so I have to borrow a 1
from<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> 3<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> carry<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:51.329> across<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:53.430> make

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
from the 3 so I carry one across to make

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.470 
from the 3 so I carry one across to make
a<00:00:53.579> 12<00:00:53.960> which<00:00:54.960> leaves<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:56.000> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.059> hundreds

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
a 12 which leaves it to in the hundreds

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.930 
a 12 which leaves it to in the hundreds
column<00:00:58.070> it's<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.280> 12<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.480> away<00:01:00.660> 4<00:01:00.989> which<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
column it's now 12 take away 4 which is

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.560 
column it's now 12 take away 4 which is
8<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.470> take<00:01:05.010> away<00:01:05.299> effectively<00:01:06.299> 0

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
8 and then to take away effectively 0

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.350 
8 and then to take away effectively 0
which<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.619> 2<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.750> answer<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:11.390> 282<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> let's

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
which is 2 so the answer is 282 so let's

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.190 
which is 2 so the answer is 282 so let's
look<00:01:15.450> at<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> second<00:01:15.900> example<00:01:16.880> we<00:01:17.880> line<00:01:18.200> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
look at the second example we line the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
look at the second example we line the
numbers<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.590> carefully<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.369> 4<00:01:20.930> 3<00:01:21.979> 2<00:01:22.979> 7<00:01:23.630> take

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
numbers up carefully so 4 3 2 7 take

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.510 
numbers up carefully so 4 3 2 7 take
away<00:01:25.520> 432<00:01:27.590> 432<00:01:28.590> again<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.100> numbers<00:01:29.340> line<00:01:29.490> up

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
away 432 432 again that numbers line up

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.170 
away 432 432 again that numbers line up
from<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:31.650> take<00:01:32.009> away<00:01:32.189> from

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
from the right and then take away from

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.210 
from the right and then take away from
the<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.799> 72<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.030> that's<00:01:36.210> 5

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
the right so 72 I can do that that's 5

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.830 
the right so 72 I can do that that's 5
but<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.460> free<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.240> larger<00:01:39.659> than<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
but the free there is a larger than the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.469 
but the free there is a larger than the
two<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.259> can't<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:42.000> take<00:01:42.329> away

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
two I can't do really to take away

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.870 
two I can't do really to take away
through<00:01:42.950> without<00:01:43.950> any<00:01:44.009> negative<00:01:44.399> numbers<00:01:44.700> so

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
through without any negative numbers so

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.870 
through without any negative numbers so
I<00:01:45.329> borrow<00:01:45.810> 1<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.619> 3<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:47.070> leave<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
I borrow 1 from the 3 to leave to and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.810 
I borrow 1 from the 3 to leave to and
throw<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.049> across<00:01:49.259> together<00:01:49.619> 12<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.759> 12

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
throw that one across together 12 so 12

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.719 
throw that one across together 12 so 12
take<00:01:51.750> away<00:01:51.930> 3<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.850> 9<00:01:54.770> again<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.579> move

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
take away 3 is 9 again and then move

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.690 
take away 3 is 9 again and then move
left<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.299> take<00:01:57.780> away<00:01:57.960> 4<00:01:58.229> can't<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.340> really

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
left to take away 4 can't do that really

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.649 
left to take away 4 can't do that really
so<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> borrow<00:02:00.600> 1<00:02:01.020> from<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.409> 43<00:02:02.329> throw<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.479> one

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
so I borrow 1 from the 43 throw that one

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.810 
so I borrow 1 from the 43 throw that one
across<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.200> get<00:02:04.320> another<00:02:04.619> 12<00:02:04.920> by<00:02:05.189> chance<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
across to get another 12 by chance and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.430 
across to get another 12 by chance and
12<00:02:06.450> take<00:02:06.780> away<00:02:06.960> 4<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.530> 8<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.670> then<00:02:09.450> finally<00:02:09.840> 3

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
12 take away 4 is 8 and then finally 3

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.280 
12 take away 4 is 8 and then finally 3
take<00:02:10.979> away<00:02:11.120> effectively<00:02:12.120> 0<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
take away effectively 0 is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.830 
take away effectively 0 is
three<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.489> answer<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:17.000> 3895<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.719> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
three so the answer is 3895 so the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.500 
three so the answer is 3895 so the
golden<00:02:19.049> rules<00:02:19.549> right<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.180> numbers<00:02:21.390> down
