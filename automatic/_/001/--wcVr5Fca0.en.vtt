00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.230
 antoni daimiel jorge quiroga and sixto 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.990
 Miguel Serrano, we greet you from the 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.310
 staples center and we hope you enjoy 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.539
 with this nba 2k relay good 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.130
 for me it has been an honor a great 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.280
 satisfaction being part of this 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.410
 phenomenal team that we have worked very 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.150
 at ease these months is the first time 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.940
 that a project of this 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.469
 span that is recorded in Spanish nba 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.780
 2k and for me it has been a satisfaction 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.059
 a tremendous illusion I am very very 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.699
 happy to have collaborated within 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.940
 my modesty with this game that is going to be 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.850
 sure a success a sure win the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.859
 true that since 1985 I had the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.420
 fortunate to be there covering matches 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.789
 covering 'all-star game' covering 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.019
 final and interviewing the majority to 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.420
 all of the good of players of 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.719
 that time is an honor and it is a 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.379
 Illusion is also a beautiful nostalgia 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.720
 even not in some way years lustrums 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.920
 then meet again with 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.869
 those players that I had the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.640
 Fortune to interview Michael Jordan 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.830
 on three occasions I had the fortune of 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.400
 interview magic johnson in 2 hakim 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.680
 Hello 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.480
 david robinson chris mullin clyde 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.280
 drexler the truth is that practically 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.110
 the river with all of them speaks in 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.940
 those times by the way I have 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.800
 to say that yes as players were 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.690
 some cracks as people are still 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.730
 better and they who are also of 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.470
 somehow we go in all the ways 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.320
 in this game because for me it is very 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.360
 exciting to be a teammate of 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.160
 all those great legends to which 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.550
 I had the fortune to interview in his 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.550
 moment 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.400
 if it's going to be fine because if it's going well 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.780
 and good for me has been first a 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.120
 pleasure then share with with 2k games 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.460
 share all those hours of recording 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.640
 with Sixto Miguel Serrano with Jorge 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.740
 Quiroga and above all has been 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.550
 relatively a good surprise then 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.870
 by amount of recording and dubbing 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.989
 that I think is aimed at bringing what 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.970
 maximum possible what is the reality of the 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.760
 game of the living room or the room of 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.610
 each player's house to what is the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.739
 party and at the end, well, I think 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.720
 which is very important the amount of 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.209
 recording when approaching a 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.950
 retransmission to television use and in 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.470
 this case I could not even imagine that 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.190
 there could be as many records codes 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.130
 different recording have been 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.020
 practically 200 hours in the studio and 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.060
 I think it's going to be a big surprise 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.870
 not only for the concrete amateur of 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.819
 nba 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.700
 but for the game enthusiast 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.830
 sports on the game console will be 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.799
 a surprise the dubbing because really 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.069
 how good is always going to be phrases 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.330
 different very precise sentences about what 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.500
 that you are seeing what is 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.970
 occurring at that moment in the game 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.440
 well people claim it a lot and the 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.599
 I really would have liked it, but I 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.640
 I think that at the moment it's not too much 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.489
 possible because good because the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.049
 present of that type is changing 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.260
 constantly there would be many 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.329
 updates for example putting by 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.340
 example the wedding of an nba player 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.019
 Kris Humphries with Kim Kardashian who 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.180
 it lasted a very short time there would be no 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.299
 have updated and everything that has gone 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.579
 happening later so in that case then 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.700
 there will not be too many surprises but 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.920
 yes, well, many own records 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.690
 not people who will identify right away 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.709
 Well, what has been my style of 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.690
 comments 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.530
 nba on television for many years 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.650
 well we have had a great time recording 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.010
 the 3 sixto miguel serrano jorge quiroga 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.940
 and all technicians street 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.130
 I was good at it, I laughed a lot and I 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.470
 I had a good time at specific moments, not 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.020
 all good because I have a profile 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.510
 from outside, especially from 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.530
 commentator more sober and more serious than 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.300
 I have administered during my 17 years of 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.810
 comments I see a lot the 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.250
 very effusive expressions at very 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.950
 concrete people remember for the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.230
 basket of jordan the 98 in the last 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.120
 match of the final then here 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.220
 logically to give variety to the game 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.650
 and so good they can pass 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.210
 great things in the game in with computers 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.930
 different in match moments 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.730
 different 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.830
 I had to record and we had to 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.110
 record consecutively many 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.210
 different expressions with which good 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.310
 it was strange and very funny 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.830
 because we had to improvise 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.430
 exclamations and we laugh a lot in 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.430
 that moment 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.800
 in this way something does not 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.160
 or not been tremendously fun and 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.470
 enriching 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.780
 very different yes to all my 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.660
 work in television and radio we have 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.820
 I've been in the studio for many, many hours 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.230
 saying a lot of phrases with a 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.450
 lots of different intonations for 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.100
 cover the whole range of possibilities 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.160
 that occur in a basketball game 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.630
 of the nba and the result really is 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.990
 amazing 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.270
 I think the most important thing is that I 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.250
 I've realized how obsessive it is 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.990
 2k at the time of taking care of every detail of 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.720
 what you see and also what you hear 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.180
 and the result is a videogame 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.370
 wonderful basically two things what 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.620
 first having helped have belonged 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.210
 to this project to create the first 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.070
 sport video game from the market 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.010
 Spanish with three commentators what 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.480
 makes the second more complete 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.760
 worked having shared hours of 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.070
 I work with two cracks like Antoni 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.480
 daimiel and sixto miguel serrano that 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.520
 they have behaved like friends like 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.080
 colleagues and especially as teachers what 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.670
 that has made the work has been 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.750
 much more complete much more 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:02.720
 enriching and much more fun 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.970
 nba 2k right now you can consider 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.740
 like a virtual reality game but 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.690
 every time he is getting closer 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.120
 to reality and be less virtual the 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.610
 amateur will be able to realize the 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.190
 complicity that the three commentators 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.530
 we have created thanks to so many hours of 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.200
 work but also to a very project 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.270
 exciting and really beautiful is 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.370
 playing in memphis attack there are the 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.320
 grizzlies with gay rudy that leaves mike 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.030
 conley distributes be to the corner for 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.790
 Zach Randolph looks like he's going to throw 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.530
 random basket does not threaten with the shot mete 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.470
 the interior pass of high pole post 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:41.540
 under top marc gasol out gasol go 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:43.640
 matte brand tremendous case if a lot 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.290
 better the grizzlies play the pivots 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.000
 they pass the ball between them and improve the 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.950
 percentage of success of the team of 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.419
 lionel hollins carry a very large 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.950
 season the truth is that they must be 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:53.960
 very happy of the signings that have 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.980
 fact they have created an authentic equipazo 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.980
 great favorite
