00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
right now so let's try and find a base

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.230 
right now so let's try and find a base
that<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> pretty<00:01:58.680> strong<00:02:00.079> I<00:02:01.079> know<00:02:02.000> unless<00:02:03.000> I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that is a pretty strong I know unless I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
that is a pretty strong I know unless I
find<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.600> base<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.079> lot<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.380> louth<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.829> I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
find a base of a lot of louth and I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.169 
find a base of a lot of louth and I
might<00:02:05.070> take<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.570> lot<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:08.179> top

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
might take that one I know a lot of top

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.490 
might take that one I know a lot of top
