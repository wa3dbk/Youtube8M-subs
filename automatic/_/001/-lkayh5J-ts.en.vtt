00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.150
 Welcome to my radical 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.150
 name is i want you today ours 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.160
 demanded two new bulli song 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.269
 although we have developed a story for each other 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.650
 the maillot jaune 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.939
 every zombie is characterized by it 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.520
 that we have no preservatives 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.610
 used and also with real 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.669
 afraid to work at any loot because 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.290
 we both have in the program are there from 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:32.360
 2013 neo pop ups in the case has the 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.420
 natural yellow neo pop up in the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.460
 size of 16 and 20 mm 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.200
 In addition, with a pick-up in glass and 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.149
 there is still a little bit in there 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.039
 that means the body's expensive policies 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.989
 ask directly if you are a bit 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.900
 larger amounts of dip are needed too 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.140
 Of course, there is a suitable one for that 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.570
 Tip in the case a hit with others that 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.620
 aroma matches the ball and that is 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.620
 built on an alcoholic basis 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.920
 liquid dip that's always good 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.449
 if the tip in the bulli 17 should 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.460
 The prey is there for a long time 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.369
 in stock the aroma meters 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.479
 continuously released in the waters 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.250
 Alcohol still has the big one 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.110
 advantage that even at low 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.420
 water temperatures works brilliantly 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.220
 So now in winter 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.920
 temperatures below 800 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.810
 worked much better than alcohol 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.060
 copper-based or oil-based is 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.580
 a from 29 to ring in the radical 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:36.200
 leave our second product 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.090
 ask yourself where the name comes from is the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.020
 pankl the one to attract from 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.179
 Hessian used 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.490
 why is the ball called like that now ? 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.200
 the whole fish pieces 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.759
 so we have not processed 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.700
 just worked with a fresh or 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.030
 a movie but you see it very much 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.530
 Well 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.539
 They are really complete pieces in 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.420
 was then integrated this ball 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.220
 This makes the ground very natural 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.880
 here , too , will not be constant substances 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.229
 used and the surface of these 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.119
 bait is very very big 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.649
 that means how to become ingredients 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.590
 good to the water delivered 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.209
 that too is super fast started too 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.280
 work 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.489
 logically we need it today 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.270
 all the matching ones also cool 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.700
 popup in a muted orange tone 4 16 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.019
 20 kilometers and the ampoule is too 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.019
 with the view with
