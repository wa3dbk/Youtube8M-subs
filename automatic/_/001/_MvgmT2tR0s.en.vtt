00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.869
 A breakdown usually happens when you do not expect it 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.329
 the happier team at such a moment a friend stands by 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.039
 the two want the broken-down vehicle the next workshop 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.949
 It's not so easy to tow away 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.290
 in the boat because modern cars make it more difficult the apprenticeship 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.930
 Tow hooks both front and rear to find here it is usually so 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.530
 that we mean now 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.450
 these files 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.920
 lags there 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.160
 Decking hidden 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.630
 in the bumper in front as well as behind partially the hard ones are to be pointed out 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.380
 screw 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.490
 These types are then usually found in the recipients proved just that 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.250
 should 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.070
 before allowing land to operate under German command 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.140
 the part must be streamlined 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.900
 Of course, proper fixing of the papyrus dots 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.280
 Clear that this fits all the conceding had in the experienced 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.060
 possible to shorten the same way choose 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.780
 and exactly the traffic light or similar when it comes to the whole must be behind the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.190
 front seats 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.400
 in modern vehicles 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.110
 not only take care when towing more than before 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.700
 the vehicles are available today 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.940
 the electronics more support 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.410
 it is so both in the left and in the canteen 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.020
 if not then the engine is no longer liable 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.330
 rather, support this support the helper 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.270
 that is, the fuel is many times higher and many 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.080
 Politicians and many times more difficult 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.070
 this must be written in writing that means it should be teams 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.070
 whenever possible have the band back on the brake 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.350
 early 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.930
 Grab bag is good if you make signals beforehand if you have your kind of 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.330
 Problem is that the backyard writings or left Maren Borman 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.710
 demand can banish immediately 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.250
 if the engine is still running you should tow with the engine running 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.560
 the engine should not 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.100
 "The ignition must be turned on in any case if I can 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.069
 Steering wheel can engage taillight 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.699
 this is the case with automatic vehicles 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:13.479
 walks partly with run 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.379
 and that means everything came very quickly to damage so 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.599
 but four wheel drive or with automatic vehicles are in the 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.729
 operation manual 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.489
 the manufacturer may call times 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.139
 how can I tow these vehicles? 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.139
 without water 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.330
 so far so good 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.850
 because with the new connected exciting driving everywhere and 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.850
 Books estimated by insurance 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.499
 mostly to what we wanted the car manufacturer 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.619
 You can tow that only until the next exit, what you have to do 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.529
 Leaving the highway it's not filling me up on the highway 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.119
 tasks 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.889
 Regarding the case if it is clear that we actually only have one form 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.069
 if that would be enough for me the BAV service sees the money 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.529
 and only one important issue of insurance we are both 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.449
 Vehicles assured to leave both Force One that is when the rear of the 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.589
 strengthened the pre-round game plan on currently best insurance the damage 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:10.680
 otherwise if the train has caused damage it mostly does over 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.679
 which handled for themselves and their vehicle 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.359
 the towing of Paul Schuster 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.430
 It should not be a problem but please do not be cocky so 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.829
 it simply can not go anywhere
