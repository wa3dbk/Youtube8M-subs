and how you change that eraser is very

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.000 
and how you change that eraser is very
simple<00:00:45.360> you're<00:00:45.719> simply<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.230> grasp<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
simple you're simply going to grasp the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.970 
simple you're simply going to grasp the
plastic<00:00:47.579> pull<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.570> eraser<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.770> comes

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
plastic pull the eraser and it comes

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.900 
plastic pull the eraser and it comes
right<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:51.379> like<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> would

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
right out like that and then I would

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.360 
right out like that and then I would
take<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> new<00:00:54.390> eraser<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.860> would<00:00:56.010> simply

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
take the new eraser and I would simply

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
take the new eraser and I would simply
slide<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.050> into<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> chamber<00:00:58.760> twist<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.030> back

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
slide it into the chamber twist it back

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.969 
slide it into the chamber twist it back
in<00:01:02.090> there<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:05.270> I<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.600> keep<00:01:07.159> erasing

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
in there you go and I can keep erasing

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.219 
in there you go and I can keep erasing
and<00:01:10.979> look<00:01:11.909> how<00:01:12.030> cleanly<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.689> erased<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and look how cleanly that's erased that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
and look how cleanly that's erased that
now<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> lead<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.640> same<00:01:14.970> way<00:01:15.090> eventually

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
now the lead is the same way eventually

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.899 
now the lead is the same way eventually
you're<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> run<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.159> lead<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.820> let

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
you're going to run out of lead and let

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.080 
you're going to run out of lead and let
me<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.240> grasp<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.259> pull<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:20.090> now
