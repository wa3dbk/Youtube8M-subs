00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hey guys I just want to do a quick video

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.970 
hey guys I just want to do a quick video
on<00:00:02.700> why<00:00:03.689> it's<00:00:03.840> important<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.440> clip<00:00:04.830> your

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
on why it's important to clip your

on why it's important to clip your
runners<00:00:05.339> now<00:00:05.970> this<00:00:06.210> one<00:00:06.390> here<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:07.020> this

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
runners now this one here this this

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.360 
runners now this one here this this
plant<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:09.210> one<00:00:09.360> that<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.920> that<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:10.980> collected

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
plant is the one that I that I collected

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.310 
plant is the one that I that I collected
the<00:00:11.490> seeds<00:00:11.639> from<00:00:11.820> store<00:00:12.179> bought<00:00:12.360> but<00:00:13.170> when<00:00:13.290> I

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the seeds from store bought but when I

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.880 
the seeds from store bought but when I
first<00:00:13.679> planted<00:00:14.190> these<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:15.240> very<00:00:15.450> next<00:00:16.139> year

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
first planted these the very next year

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.980 
first planted these the very next year
I<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:18.410> strawberries<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.619> them<00:00:20.240> by<00:00:21.240> April<00:00:21.869> they

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
I got strawberries on them by April they

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.279 
I got strawberries on them by April they
are<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.500> now<00:00:22.800> starting<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.510> produce<00:00:24.510> right

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
are just now starting to produce right

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.380 
are just now starting to produce right
here<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.590> these<00:00:25.710> flowers<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.910> I've<00:00:27.180> got<00:00:27.359> I

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
here are these flowers so I've got I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.150 
here are these flowers so I've got I
don't<00:00:27.720> even<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.650> berries<00:00:28.980> yet

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
don't even have the the berries yet

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160 
don't even have the the berries yet
because<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> flowers<00:00:30.090> first<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.660> so

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
because I have the flowers first and so

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.950 
because I have the flowers first and so
what<00:00:31.320> happened<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.600> laid<00:00:33.780> down

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
what happened was the it laid down

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170 
what happened was the it laid down
runners<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.280> laid<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:35.910> here

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
runners here and it laid this one here

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
runners here and it laid this one here
it<00:00:36.300> made<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> new<00:00:37.020> plant<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.309> plant

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it made a new plant here then this plant

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.610 
it made a new plant here then this plant
laid<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> runner<00:00:39.120> down<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.690> made<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> new<00:00:40.350> plant

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
laid a runner down and made a new plant

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.100 
laid a runner down and made a new plant
right<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.210> happened<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.960> put

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
right here so what happened was it put

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.190 
right here so what happened was it put
all<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.320> its<00:00:43.500> energy<00:00:43.980> into<00:00:44.840> producing<00:00:45.840> runners

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
all of its energy into producing runners

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
all of its energy into producing runners
and<00:00:46.379> propagating<00:00:46.950> itself<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.520> less<00:00:48.120> energy

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
and propagating itself and less energy

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.930 
and propagating itself and less energy
into<00:00:48.870> berry<00:00:49.110> production<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.579> should

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
into berry production so what I should

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.310 
into berry production so what I should
have<00:00:50.969> done<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.870> another<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.289> of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
have done and this is another one of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.319 
have done and this is another one of
those<00:00:52.469> beds<00:00:52.739> where<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.699> don't<00:00:53.879> spend<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
those beds where I just don't spend the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.729 
those beds where I just don't spend the
effort<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.690> time<00:00:54.899> weeding<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.350> taking

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
effort in the time weeding and taking

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.209 
effort in the time weeding and taking
care<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
care of it

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.010 
care of it
I<00:00:56.250> should<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.910> once<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> put<00:00:57.480> down<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> runner

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
I should have once it put down a runner

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.439 
I should have once it put down a runner
I<00:00:58.170> should<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.739> clipped<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.850> no<00:00:59.969> more

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
I should have clipped it so that no more

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.270 
I should have clipped it so that no more
energy<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.109> across<00:01:01.739> through<00:01:02.039> here

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
energy was going across through here

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.759 
energy was going across through here
into<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.940> one<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.229> don't<00:01:04.379> want<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> do

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
into this one or if you don't want to do

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.260 
into this one or if you don't want to do
that<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.220> win<00:01:05.400> upstarts<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> lay<00:01:06.060> down<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that you can win upstarts to lay down a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.840 
that you can win upstarts to lay down a
runner<00:01:06.479> clip<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> runner<00:01:07.590> it'll<00:01:08.280> create<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
runner clip the runner it'll create a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.270 
runner clip the runner it'll create a
bigger<00:01:09.479> healthier<00:01:09.960> plant<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.070> bigger

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
bigger healthier plant and and bigger

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310 
bigger healthier plant and and bigger
healthier<00:01:11.640> strawberry's<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:13.110> one

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
healthier strawberry's so that's one

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.359 
healthier strawberry's so that's one
thing<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> keep<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.799> mind<00:01:13.860> when<00:01:14.250> you're

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
thing to keep in mind when you're

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.950 
thing to keep in mind when you're
growing<00:01:14.670> strawberries<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.479> know<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
growing strawberries because I know that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.539 
growing strawberries because I know that
this<00:01:16.080> plant<00:01:16.409> these<00:01:17.130> plants

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
this plant these plants

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.920 
this plant these plants
I<00:01:17.700> mean<00:01:17.850> strawberry<00:01:18.180> plants<00:01:18.450> don't<00:01:18.600> last<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
I mean strawberry plants don't last a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.480 
I mean strawberry plants don't last a
long<00:01:19.110> time<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.590> been<00:01:19.650> my<00:01:19.860> experience<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.340> few

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
long time it's been my experience a few

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.340 
long time it's been my experience a few
years<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.970> they're<00:01:21.119> pretty<00:01:21.540> much<00:01:21.659> spent<00:01:22.110> kind

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
years and they're pretty much spent kind

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.539 
years and they're pretty much spent kind
of<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> chicken<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.280> they'll<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
of like a chicken you know they'll a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.330 
of like a chicken you know they'll a
fruit<00:01:23.900> but<00:01:24.900> yeah<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.530> should<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.860> cut<00:01:26.159> this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
fruit but yeah I should have cut this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.010 
fruit but yeah I should have cut this
and<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.600> its<00:01:27.750> third<00:01:27.990> year

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and so this is going on its third year

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.679 
and so this is going on its third year
here<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.759> I<00:01:29.759> should<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.360> helped<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.630> along

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
here and I should have helped it along

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.649 
here and I should have helped it along
but<00:01:31.380> anyways<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.770> starting<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> flower<00:01:32.310> now

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
but anyways it's starting to flower now

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.210 
but anyways it's starting to flower now
I'm<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.079> ahead<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.380> cut<00:01:34.650> these<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
I'm going to go ahead and cut these and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.950 
I'm going to go ahead and cut these and
then<00:01:35.759> I've<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:36.000> two<00:01:36.180> new<00:01:36.360> plants<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
then I've got two new plants here and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.240 
then I've got two new plants here and
I'll<00:01:37.049> pull<00:01:37.229> these<00:01:37.409> plants<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:37.860> and
