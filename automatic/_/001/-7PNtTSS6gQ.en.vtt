 to play full hd games at 60 hertz 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.949
 Because there are a lot of games there that come 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.619
 accompanied in several forums there both in the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.070
 facebook as well as several others 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.920
 games forums that the crowd has several 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.870
 games there nÃ© give a clear metal example 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.600
 who live and obey and resell and which 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.800
 the two also found another game here 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 also that gives some games there that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.390
 automatically putting you full 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.430
 1920 hd by 1080 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.160
 the game opens with the side edges 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.559
 sit in full hd and rotate at 24 hertz 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.980
 running 24 rest was the game will stay 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.649
 much legacy much legacy same beauty 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.470
 I'll put the video for you to leave 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.510
 a game opening 24 hertz and then back 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.049
 taught to you how you do to 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.119
 leave or leave it at 60 Hz beauty and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.860
 in full hd too guys 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.439
 This is one of the games that have this 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.810
 problem is not so much in univision as 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.909
 Here you give me is doing tutorial of m 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.369
 because what I have here today is not 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.560
 an amd video card and possibly 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.390
 Later on I got an nvidia 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.400
 with some friend could be doing 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.380
 also for you not as you create 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.840
 custom resolutions which is what 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.350
 will do with the beauty emmy 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.079
 you can see the gang's all here to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.070
 at the most is let's brief cost in 1920 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.649
 1080 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.820
 only the game is cutting the sides 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.220
 so it's not in full hd but the game has 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.420
 24 Hz, ne 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.180
 You can see that it's well behaved, I'm going 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.670
 open the game just for you to see 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.860
 quickly when there is about 10 seconds of 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.439
 game you see account as legacy stays 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.470
 in 24 hertz game is not good to play 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.319
 is 24 reais because 24 remains the resolution 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.109
 of it as if it were rotated in 3d 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.409
 so it's not such a smooth resolution to 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:21.810
 who uses who to play in the normal way 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.099
 no 3d mode you do not feel so 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.849
 difference because you will be with 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.560
 glasses and basically the application is 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.889
 making the transition and transformation 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.950
 within the game for you're seeing only then 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:38.750
 I play the game here quickly, just how 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.750
 remains the legacy to 24 rest 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.920
 beauty has no fluidity of the game has been 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.830
 This is being here. 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.870
 the injury has already hit Jorge 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.850
 I 'm going to leave now, I 'll show you 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.020
 how does the beauty tutorial will have 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.420
 huh 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.950
 come on guys is now after you 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.400
 I will show you the game by running 24 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.170
 hatch and 1.080 with the tabs on the sides 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.600
 right and left right 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.470
 sit in full screen even sitting in 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.330
 full screen 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.760
 this happens in some games with the 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.620
 Beauty emi boards so I 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.270
 show you is basically what 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.950
 You have to do it. 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.220
 the troop is putting the game in full hd 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.360
 and is playing at 60 hertz which is much more 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.860
 and the resolution is 1080p 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.450
 the first thing the guys do not have to 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.730

 the garbage screen is basically this 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.670
 It 's quiet here. 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.209
 We will not see it here on my tab. 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.970
 flat panel displays digital beauty 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.350
 and then we'll be selling 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.280
 flat panel monitor properties 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.320

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.640

 have a resolution that is 60 hertz and 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.239
 than the game recognized within the 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.130
 game recognizes the resolution in game and 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.860
 you can apply to play in 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.860

 solve your profile as it is a 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.449
 resolution that you can use 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.370
 usually then you 'll see if I solve it 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.800
 has already been applied if you see 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.080

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.990
 here she'll be right here, 1920 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.580
 by 1080 and 6 quiet this resolution 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.979
 that we will apply within the game is 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.449
 that it stays at 60 Hz and does not use 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.360
 more 1980 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.580
 you will lose 4 474 pixels lei more 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.800
 this does not influence basically nothing 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.889

 there will appear in this part that also 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.979
 Calm down, let's get back to the game. 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.940
 and show you there how we 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:21.659
 applies the resolution 1920 per month from 76 to 67 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.879
 in the game then she came back as I said in 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.500
 the previous part and the video 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.810
 here we will see the resolutions 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.940
 that are customizable and those that are 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.009
 native active relationships are all 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.589
 those that already come with windows in this 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:36.539
 hotels that your monitor supports and that 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:38.550
 windows also give as an option for you 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:41.580
 apply and many hours of work 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.979
 how much inside games then 99% games 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.139
 always pull resolutions are applied and 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:49.259
 added on windows beauty then 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:52.830
 exposed to apply the resolution of 1200 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:54.389
 and 20 per thousand and 40 for example if 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.099
 it works on windows it will not work 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.080
 appear here also inside the game 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:00.419
 beauty and if you apply there in the tasting 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.740
 junk and add resolution sure 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.339
 I always felt that she has to appear 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.289
 Also here 

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:07.120

 you here all but normal and 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.870
 resolutions can see that now 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.520
 seemed less 20 thousand and 76 than the 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.770
 Hot resolution that I back there 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.500

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.870
 It's quiet here and we can 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.820
 now play our game at 60 hertz 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.280
 quietly this can be applied 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:28.500
 for all the games that you have 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.120
 problem and is running at 24 Hz and 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:35.169
 apply that resolution there to play 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.240
 in full hd and 60 hertz which is better 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:40.120
 than twenty-four can send 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.900
 your ideas now the game is much better 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.760
 it does not compare to what it was before 

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.680
