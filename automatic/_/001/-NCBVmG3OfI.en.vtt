essentially<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.050> wii<00:00:01.199> sensor<00:00:01.410> bar<00:00:01.740> is

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
essentially the wii sensor bar is

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.670 
essentially the wii sensor bar is
nothing<00:00:02.250> more<00:00:02.540> than<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.840> group<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.170> elliott<00:00:04.560> of

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
nothing more than a group of elliott of

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.020 
nothing more than a group of elliott of
ir<00:00:05.609> leds<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.589> get<00:00:07.589> nothing<00:00:08.309> from<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.940> Wii

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
ir leds that get nothing from the Wii

ir leds that get nothing from the Wii
Remote<00:00:09.330> except<00:00:09.840> power<00:00:10.639> so<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.670> might<00:00:12.120> be

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
Remote except power so you might be

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.360 
Remote except power so you might be
wondering<00:00:12.300> well<00:00:12.870> David<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.710> don't<00:00:13.799> really<00:00:14.190> want

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
wondering well David I don't really want

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.900 
wondering well David I don't really want
to<00:00:14.460> spend<00:00:14.790> thirty<00:00:15.509> dollars<00:00:15.929> or<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.910> you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
to spend thirty dollars or so on you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.120 
to spend thirty dollars or so on you
know<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.630> essentially<00:00:19.050> nothing<00:00:19.859> more

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
know but it's essentially nothing more

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.950 
know but it's essentially nothing more
than<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.310> couple<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.550> LEDs<00:00:21.000> that's<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.630> rip<00:00:21.779> off

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
than a couple of LEDs that's a rip off

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.560 
than a couple of LEDs that's a rip off
course<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.740> agree<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.189> concur<00:00:23.670> I'm<00:00:24.180> all<00:00:24.359> with

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
course I agree I concur I'm all with

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.830 
course I agree I concur I'm all with
that<00:00:24.779> arm<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> essentially<00:00:27.119> i<00:00:27.269> made<00:00:27.630> my<00:00:27.810> own

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
that arm so essentially i made my own

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.130 
that arm so essentially i made my own
and<00:00:28.880> I<00:00:29.880> figured<00:00:30.240> well<00:00:30.269> what's<00:00:30.660> cheaper<00:00:31.019> than

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and I figured well what's cheaper than

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.040 
and I figured well what's cheaper than
even<00:00:31.410> LEDs<00:00:31.890> by<00:00:32.430> themselves<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:33.690> radio<00:00:33.989> shack

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
even LEDs by themselves at radio shack

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.610 
even LEDs by themselves at radio shack
for<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.500> frys<00:00:34.790> well<00:00:35.790> candle<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.270> amid<00:00:36.510> ir<00:00:36.870> cuz

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
for at frys well candle is amid ir cuz

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.470 
for at frys well candle is amid ir cuz
that's<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.370> heat<00:00:38.610> right<00:00:38.850> well<00:00:39.120> i<00:00:39.149> don't<00:00:39.450> know

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that's like heat right well i don't know

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.270 
that's like heat right well i don't know
i'm<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> software<00:00:39.960> guy<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.980> actually

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
i'm a software guy so this is actually

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.190 
i'm a software guy so this is actually
the<00:00:41.520> first<00:00:41.550> time<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.879> i'm<00:00:42.030> doing<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.360> so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the first time that i'm doing this so

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.750 
the first time that i'm doing this so
I'm<00:00:43.290> gonna<00:00:43.379> give<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> shot<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> uh<00:00:46.340> let's<00:00:47.340> go

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
I'm gonna give it a shot so uh let's go

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.360 
I'm gonna give it a shot so uh let's go
ahead<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.180> watch<00:00:48.420> our<00:00:48.780> driver<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.800> oh

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
ahead and watch our driver here and oh

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.630 
ahead and watch our driver here and oh
crap<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:52.100> okay<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.160> we're<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> go

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
crap is that okay so we're going to go

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.420 
crap is that okay so we're going to go
ahead<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> launch<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.480> WMD<00:00:55.170> driver<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
ahead and launch the WMD driver for the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.270 
ahead and launch the WMD driver for the
Wemo<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:57.090> linux<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.629> case<00:00:57.949> as<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.129> can

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
Wemo for linux in this case as you can

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.360 
Wemo for linux in this case as you can
tell<00:00:59.550> there<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.230> 7.5<00:01:01.230> inches<00:01:01.770> between<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
tell there are 7.5 inches between the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.789 
tell there are 7.5 inches between the
two<00:01:02.520> channels<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.449> less<00:01:03.510> kind<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.110> i<00:01:04.260> put

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
two channels more or less kind of i put

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.109 
two channels more or less kind of i put
it<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:05.220> further<00:01:05.489> distance<00:01:05.939> just

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
it a little further distance just

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.550 
it a little further distance just
because<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> little<00:01:06.900> further<00:01:07.020> away<00:01:07.320> than

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
because it's a little further away than

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.130 
because it's a little further away than
the<00:01:07.619> monitor<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.580> realistically<00:01:09.140> well

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
the monitor so realistically well

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.719 
the monitor so realistically well
actually<00:01:10.290> i<00:01:10.619> got<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.890> backwards<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.549> that's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
actually i got that backwards but that's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.420 
actually i got that backwards but that's
okay<00:01:12.060> though<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.240> it'll<00:01:12.750> still<00:01:12.960> work<00:01:13.430> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
okay though because it'll still work so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.109 
okay though because it'll still work so
let<00:01:14.549> me<00:01:14.610> go<00:01:14.729> ahead<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.909> watch<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> driver<00:01:17.119> we

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
let me go ahead and watch a driver we

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.560 
let me go ahead and watch a driver we
got<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.450> grabs<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:20.240> okay<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.299> before

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
got like grabs and what okay so before

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
got like grabs and what okay so before
everything<00:01:22.110> catches<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.860> fire<00:01:23.100> i'm<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
everything catches on fire i'm going to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.880 
everything catches on fire i'm going to
go<00:01:23.580> ahead<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> demo<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.650> let's<00:01:25.650> go<00:01:25.770> ahead

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
go ahead and demo this let's go ahead

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.289 
go ahead and demo this let's go ahead
and<00:01:25.979> run<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> driver<00:01:28.579> try<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.640> serialize<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and run the driver try to serialize the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.899 
and run the driver try to serialize the
actual<00:01:30.900> emotes<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.799> we<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:35.070> connected

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
actual emotes and we are connected

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.440 
actual emotes and we are connected
ladies<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.390> gentlemen<00:01:37.250> look<00:01:38.250> at<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.700> now

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
ladies and gentlemen look at that now

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
ladies and gentlemen look at that now
usually<00:01:40.110> doesn't<00:01:40.560> acid<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> little<00:01:40.979> bit

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
usually doesn't acid a little bit

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.969 
usually doesn't acid a little bit
trickier<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.880> see<00:01:42.470> now<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.950> have

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
trickier as you can see now that we have

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.240 
trickier as you can see now that we have
a<00:01:44.220> general<00:01:44.729> idea<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.470> where<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.619> screen<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.070> or

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
a general idea of where the screen is or

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.230 
a general idea of where the screen is or
rather<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.700> mouth<00:01:47.880> nose<00:01:48.590> we<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.799> use<00:01:50.240> this

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
rather the mouth nose we can use this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.039 
rather the mouth nose we can use this
thing<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> slightly<00:01:52.740> buzzed<00:01:53.840> maybe<00:01:54.840> not

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
thing as a slightly buzzed maybe not

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.359 
thing as a slightly buzzed maybe not
safe<00:01:55.380> enough<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> drive<00:01:56.450> mouse<00:01:57.450> pointer<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
safe enough to drive mouse pointer and

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.209 
safe enough to drive mouse pointer and
there<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.579> it<00:02:00.259> don't<00:02:01.259> give<00:02:01.649> nintendo

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
there you have it don't give nintendo

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.069 
there you have it don't give nintendo
any<00:02:02.369> more<00:02:02.610> money<00:02:02.820> than<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.240> okay<00:02:03.689> maybe<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
any more money than you okay maybe you

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.630 
any more money than you okay maybe you
might<00:02:04.259> want<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.560> buy<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.340> build<00:02:05.520> an

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
