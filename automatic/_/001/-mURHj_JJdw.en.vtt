00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.140
 Trademark orange ps depending on size 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.320
 between 130 and 240 special feature 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.930
 special brush length between five and 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.630
 eight meters 13 big and ten small 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.430
 Vehicles at the airport the area of 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.410
 the sweeper fleet is being cleaned 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.660
 is alone in front of me since 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.750
 Warning system and taxiways incredible 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.059
 seven million square meters there 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.080
 it needs the suitable vehicles and 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.580
 some of which are pretty special so 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.280
 we have a total of three here 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.820
 different varieties of sweepers 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.290
 once the normal street sweeper 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.750
 then we have the road sweeper 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.880
 with high pressure water and rear suction 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.730
 or areas suction and then again 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.800
 once with a stem magnet though 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.190
 We go to the yet again in detail 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.829
 by 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.200
 there would be the normal street sweeper 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.820
 with right left clarification as they are in 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.740
 the cities used is the dirt 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.390
 on the floor will be without the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.530
 Sweeper by a rolling beings 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.289
 which is exactly under the sweeper 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.600
 also has brooms on the left 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.960
 or to the right of it is also 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.049
 manages to get over the juice he becomes 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.780
 over a slide in protection 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.299
 container that works in 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.350
 like a vacuum cleaner at home only 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.630
 just bigger 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.880
 then there is the street sweeper with 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.009
 stern to clean and high pressure water 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.780
 for strong soiling used with 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.009
 normal cleaning does not eliminate 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.799
 are whopping 240 hp slumbering under the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.780
 hood of tractor the construction engine 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.259
 has another 130 ps 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.289
 The tank holds 600 liters of water when 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.700
 somewhere driveway from construction site 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.869
 Vehicles heavily polluted is the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.509
 normal sweeper can because 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.590
 deadlock then comes 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.299
 This time it seemed to be back 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.979
 she was in charge of the castle around the castle 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.909
 high pressure again loosen the mud and 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.700
 absorb again 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.650
 At 50 bar, the water comes out of the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.120
 high performance pump for the dirt of the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.160
 to replace underground 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.200
 even in winter the hack comes off 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.940
 clean for use, for example when 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.200
 de-icing fluid from the floor 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.870
 should be included 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.120
 the third variant of the sweeper has 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.650
 a very special accessory part 1 gives 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.900
 There are different machines 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.180
 different outliers once this 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.709
 Magnet as a stem will be in public 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.989
 Road traffic not used but only 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.849
 specifically at the airport as we are here 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.890
 also metal parts lying in the apron 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.930
 have to be recorded then 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.600
 Damage to tires on aircraft 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.790
 or to avoid with cars 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.859
 the five brushes are all 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.440
 separately switchable with a joystick 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.930
 Can the drivers of the tools and also 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.180
 increase the receptive container separately 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.040
 Each vehicle has twelve high pressure 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.960
 water jets so it does not care 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.580
 jams have the machines 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.130
 different depending on the size 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.260
 Capacity between four and eight 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.630
 cubic meters of dirt and traffic 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.700
 in the size containers twice a day 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.770
 The machines are emptied in the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.560
 For this purpose we will meet the kalle 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.540
 smallest sweeper she can 15 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.640
 kubikmeter switzerland has two 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.790
 fixed plates brush and one 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.310
 movable arm has the advantage that with 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.340
 the third broom reached a wide 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.020
 is where you also walk away with it 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.940
 can be very important to us because we 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.190
 also foreigners have outside of 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.940
 Airport and the walkways too 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.040
 this includes 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.260
 but not only the dw cleaned the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.360
 Dwarf also in the park positions 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.160
 you can often find him there because the little one 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.590
 manoeuvrable machine a small 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.020
 circle has and clean every angle 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.450
 can rightly guide all sweeper 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.550
 is standard it comes from the normal 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.040
 use as street sweeper here 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.600
 always legally working is there 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.250
 You finally have to see where you are 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.590
 breaks forth 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.070
 Every year , about 1,200 tons are consumed 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.230
 on 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.420
 thanks to the cleaning crew gets 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.420
 the passenger of it, however, little with
