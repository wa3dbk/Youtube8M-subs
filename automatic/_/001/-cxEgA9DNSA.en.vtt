00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
likewise with this year

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:50.500 
likewise with this year
nice<00:02:41.280> new<00:02:41.519> surface<00:02:42.180> that's<00:02:42.810> what

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.330 

when<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.630> engage<00:02:51.780> just<00:02:53.090> bushing<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.210> here

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
when to engage just bushing in here

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.890 
when to engage just bushing in here
if<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.610> bushing<00:02:56.880> likewise<00:02:57.480> also<00:02:57.780> has<00:02:57.870> a

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
if this bushing likewise also has a

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.510 
if this bushing likewise also has a
little<00:02:58.200> burr<00:02:58.350> on<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.770> or<00:02:58.980> if<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.220> forget<00:02:59.460> to

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
little burr on it or if you forget to

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.370 
little burr on it or if you forget to
bend<00:02:59.820> that<00:03:00.000> lock<00:03:00.210> tab<00:03:00.510> over<00:03:00.780> on<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.200> bolt

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
bend that lock tab over on the bolt

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.650 
bend that lock tab over on the bolt
that's<00:03:01.530> right<00:03:01.770> there<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:03.000> won't<00:03:03.300> be<00:03:03.450> good

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
that's right there this won't be good

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.150 
that's right there this won't be good
because<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.260> lock<00:03:04.440> tab<00:03:04.650> will<00:03:04.800> actually<00:03:05.040> hit

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
because the lock tab will actually hit

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.860 
because the lock tab will actually hit
the<00:03:05.250> side<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.610> case<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.690> keep

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
the side of the case and if you keep

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.480 
the side of the case and if you keep
hitting<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.200> starter<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:07.740> going<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.010> jam<00:03:08.280> in

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
hitting the starter it's going to jam in

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.230 
hitting the starter it's going to jam in
there<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.050> need<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.260> be<00:03:10.320> careful<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.710> that

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
there so I need to be careful of that

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.770 
there so I need to be careful of that
make<00:03:12.240> sure<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.690> rotates<00:03:13.650> smoothly<00:03:14.780> we're

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
make sure that it rotates smoothly we're

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.360 
make sure that it rotates smoothly we're
just<00:03:15.930> going<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.230> put<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> little<00:03:16.620> bit<00:03:16.710> of<00:03:16.800> head

the<00:03:23.370> sports<00:03:23.640> just<00:03:23.879> don't<00:03:24.060> have<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.239> jack<00:03:24.540> shaft
