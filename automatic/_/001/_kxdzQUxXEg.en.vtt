00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
well and good but I think that I've got

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.400 
well and good but I think that I've got
a<00:06:16.030> better<00:06:16.300> idea<00:06:16.450> for<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:16.960> ending<00:06:16.990> of<00:06:17.290> this

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
a better idea for the ending of this

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.500 
a better idea for the ending of this
game<00:06:17.650> so<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.370> ship<00:06:18.580> hits<00:06:18.820> the<00:06:18.910> iceberg<00:06:19.090> and

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
game so the ship hits the iceberg and

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:31.959 
game so the ship hits the iceberg and
they<00:06:19.990> all<00:06:20.230> die

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:31.969 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:33.839 

you

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
you

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:41.189 
you
I<00:06:37.289> know<00:06:38.289> that<00:06:38.800> you
