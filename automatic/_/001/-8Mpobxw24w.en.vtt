00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
by having just a little bit too much
hate<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.509> I'm<00:01:27.840> probably<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.070> reforge

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
hate so I'm probably going to reforge

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.800 
hate so I'm probably going to reforge
into<00:01:29.640> expertise<00:01:30.060> maybe<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.570> bit<00:01:30.750> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
into expertise maybe a little bit of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.289 
into expertise maybe a little bit of
crit<00:01:31.020> ah<00:01:31.310> instead<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> haste<00:01:32.640> after<00:01:33.150> this

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
crit ah instead of haste after this

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.690 
crit ah instead of haste after this
because<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.750> did<00:01:33.930> look<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> couple<00:01:34.380> games<00:01:34.700> but

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
because I did look at a couple games but

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.249 
because I did look at a couple games but
the<00:01:36.600> point<00:01:36.930> being<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:38.310> expertise<00:01:38.820> if

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
the point being like with expertise if

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.170 
the point being like with expertise if
you<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.350> writing<00:01:41.009> Sun<00:01:41.250> kick<00:01:41.460> gets<00:01:41.700> parried<00:01:42.030> I

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you know writing Sun kick gets parried I

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.539 
you know writing Sun kick gets parried I
do<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.140> again<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> takes<00:01:43.920> three<00:01:44.189> goebbels

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
do it again and it takes three goebbels

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.889 
do it again and it takes three goebbels
which<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.790> three<00:01:44.909> seconds<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.329> energy<00:01:45.600> region

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
which is three seconds of energy region

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.109 
which is three seconds of energy region
or<00:01:46.020> 45<00:01:46.439> energy<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:47.009> 15<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.909> right<00:01:48.060> now

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
or 45 energy at 15 that I have right now

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.740 
or 45 energy at 15 that I have right now
as<00:01:48.479> opposed<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.590> 30<00:01:50.490> because<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.360> wasted<00:01:51.659> an

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
as opposed to 30 because I wasted an

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
as opposed to 30 because I wasted an
extra<00:01:51.930> global<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.829> more<00:01:53.009> expertise

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
extra global so as I get more expertise

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.959 
extra global so as I get more expertise
potentially<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.530> could<00:01:55.530> need<00:01:55.979> more<00:01:56.310> haste<00:01:56.640> so

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
potentially I could need more haste so

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.399 
potentially I could need more haste so
there's<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> sort<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.750> balancing<00:01:58.079> act<00:01:58.200> there

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
there's a sort of a balancing act there

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.560 
there's a sort of a balancing act there
although<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.890> would<00:01:59.430> say<00:01:59.610> if<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.420> need

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
although I would say if you need

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.270 
although I would say if you need
expertise<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.439> expertise<00:02:01.860> don't<00:02:02.100> worry

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
expertise get expertise don't worry

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.380 
expertise get expertise don't worry
about<00:02:02.490> how<00:02:02.700> much<00:02:02.850> you're<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.119> energy

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
about how much you're going to energy

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.450 
about how much you're going to energy
cap<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.960> need<00:02:04.110> crit<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:05.040> need<00:02:05.189> correct

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
cap if you need crit you need correct

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.999 
cap if you need crit you need correct
that's<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:05.729> sort<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.909> how<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.149> works<00:02:06.360> um<00:02:07.009> but

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
that's just sort of how it works um but

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.410 
that's just sort of how it works um but
if<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.190> look<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.700> pretty<00:02:08.970> good<00:02:09.090> uptime

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
if you look I have pretty good uptime

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.720 
if you look I have pretty good uptime
this<00:02:09.599> game<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.619> energy<00:02:10.979> kept<00:02:11.160> quite<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> bit

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this game and I energy kept quite a bit

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.610 
this game and I energy kept quite a bit
and<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.180> lot<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.360> its<00:02:12.569> not<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.989> hundred<00:02:13.200> percent

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and a lot of its not a hundred percent

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.350 
and a lot of its not a hundred percent
attentional<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:14.370> think<00:02:14.819> it's<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.120> little<00:02:15.209> bit

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
attentional so I think it's a little bit

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.720 
attentional so I think it's a little bit
of<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.540> waste
