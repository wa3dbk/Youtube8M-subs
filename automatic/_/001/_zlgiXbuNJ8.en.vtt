lags and a lot of servers do like I was

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.910 
lags and a lot of servers do like I was
just<00:02:06.450> recently<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.350> server<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.680> just

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
just recently in a server that just

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.010 
just recently in a server that just
closed<00:02:08.129> down<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.030> lags<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.539> much<00:02:09.780> where

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
closed down but it lags so much where

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.170 
closed down but it lags so much where
one<00:02:10.349> guy<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.739> said<00:02:10.830> hello<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.790> spammed
