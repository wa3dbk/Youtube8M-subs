00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
all right as you can see we have a cable

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.230 
all right as you can see we have a cable
hanging<00:00:02.399> out<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.700> front<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:02.909> our<00:00:03.030> truck

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hanging out of the front of our truck

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.249 
hanging out of the front of our truck
yay<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:04.710> block<00:00:05.009> heater<00:00:05.250> engine<00:00:05.670> install<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
yay the block heater engine install and

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.440 
yay the block heater engine install and
alright<00:00:07.490> there<00:00:08.490> was<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> pain<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.059> ass<00:00:09.240> to

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
alright there was a pain in the ass to

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.230 
alright there was a pain in the ass to
get<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:10.519> and<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.730> actually<00:00:11.820> found<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.120> was

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
get to and I actually found it was

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.419 
get to and I actually found it was
easier<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.719> crawl<00:00:13.530> underneath<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.980> truck

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
easier to crawl underneath the truck

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.129 
easier to crawl underneath the truck
but<00:00:14.849> if<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.150> try<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.450> stalling<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.900> from<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
but if you try and stalling it from the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.710 
but if you try and stalling it from the
top<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.920> engine<00:00:17.310> cover<00:00:18.060> works<00:00:18.300> really<00:00:18.570> well

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
top this engine cover works really well

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.480 
top this engine cover works really well
to<00:00:18.840> rest<00:00:18.990> your<00:00:19.109> forehead<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.529> allows<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
to rest your forehead on allows the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.400 
to rest your forehead on allows the
tears<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.880> flow<00:00:21.210> right<00:00:21.300> off<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.869> engine<00:00:22.109> block

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
tears to flow right off the engine block

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.009 
tears to flow right off the engine block
without<00:00:23.279> getting<00:00:23.519> your<00:00:24.320> materials<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.699> items

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
without getting your materials and items

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.679 
without getting your materials and items
soaked<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.170> salt<00:00:28.410> water<00:00:28.580> anyways<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:30.000> couple

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
soaked with salt water anyways a couple

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.939 
soaked with salt water anyways a couple
of<00:00:30.750> tips<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.080> found<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.349> was<00:00:31.410> easiest<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
of tips I found it was easiest to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.860 
of tips I found it was easiest to
actually<00:00:32.189> plug<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.700> cable<00:00:33.149> into<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> block

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
actually plug the cable into the block

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.380 
actually plug the cable into the block
heater<00:00:34.640> while<00:00:35.640> doing<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> install<00:00:36.149> gives<00:00:36.329> you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
heater while doing the install gives you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.700 
heater while doing the install gives you
something<00:00:36.660> else<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> hang<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.290> plus<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
something else to hang on to plus it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.110 
something else to hang on to plus it
prevents<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> thermal<00:00:38.430> grease<00:00:38.610> from<00:00:38.879> getting

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
prevents the thermal grease from getting

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.860 
prevents the thermal grease from getting
into<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.140> terminal<00:00:40.800> pins<00:00:41.010> there<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
into the the terminal pins there and it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.569 
into the the terminal pins there and it
really<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.230> easier<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.649> crawl<00:00:44.280> under<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
really was easier to crawl under the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.000 
really was easier to crawl under the
truck<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.510> wasn't<00:00:45.809> easy<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.800> little

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
truck it wasn't easy but it was a little

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.529 
truck it wasn't easy but it was a little
bit<00:00:47.129> more<00:00:47.520> accessible<00:00:47.730> than<00:00:48.059> coming<00:00:48.360> from

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
bit more accessible than coming from

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.299 
bit more accessible than coming from
this<00:00:48.660> side<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.440> we're<00:00:49.649> gonna<00:00:49.739> zoom<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.160> again

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
this side so we're gonna zoom in again

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:00.139 
this side so we're gonna zoom in again
here<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:52.850> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.120> driver<00:00:54.420> side<00:00:59.149> we're

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
here here are on the driver side we're

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.890 
here here are on the driver side we're
gonna<00:01:00.270> dip<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.840> here<00:01:01.079> if<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.439> see

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
gonna dip in here if we can you can see

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.230 
gonna dip in here if we can you can see
there<00:01:06.900> should<00:01:07.140> be<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:10.640> little<00:01:11.640> closer<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.119> we

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
there should be a little closer if we

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.350 
there should be a little closer if we
can<00:01:13.850> yeah<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.759> red<00:01:17.939> thing<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
can yeah so that's the the red thing and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.609 
can yeah so that's the the red thing and
the<00:01:18.450> silver<00:01:18.780> thing<00:01:18.960> right<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> middle

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the silver thing right in the middle

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.800 
the silver thing right in the middle
there<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.580> engine<00:01:21.030> block<00:01:21.210> heater<00:01:21.240> sticking

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
there the engine block heater sticking

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.620 
there the engine block heater sticking
out<00:01:21.930> my<00:01:22.680> light<00:01:22.890> shine<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:24.150> cable<00:01:24.330> came

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
out my light shine on it the cable came

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.120 
out my light shine on it the cable came
with<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.960> thermal<00:01:25.350> insulation<00:01:25.740> which<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
with this thermal insulation which is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.130 
with this thermal insulation which is
really<00:01:26.400> nice<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.180> right<00:01:27.659> next<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
really nice because it is right next to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.880 
really nice because it is right next to
the<00:01:28.549> exhaust<00:01:29.549> manifold<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:31.439> as<00:01:31.560> far<00:01:31.770> as

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the exhaust manifold so as far as

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.520 
the exhaust manifold so as far as
reading<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> cable<00:01:32.670> goes<00:01:32.900> I'm<00:01:33.900> gonna<00:01:34.259> back

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
reading the cable goes I'm gonna back

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.460 
reading the cable goes I'm gonna back
out<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.220> read<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> cable<00:01:36.140> back<00:01:37.140> in

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
out here I read it the cable back in

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.950 
out here I read it the cable back in
here<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.369> basically<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.479> away<00:01:39.630> from<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
here and basically got away from the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.569 
here and basically got away from the
engine<00:01:40.259> block<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.710> hot<00:01:40.979> components<00:01:41.310> as

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
engine block and the hot components as

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.600 
engine block and the hot components as
fast<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.119> possible<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.979> thermal

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
fast as possible but that thermal

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.370 
fast as possible but that thermal
insulation<00:01:44.909> extends<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.509> quite<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> bit<00:01:45.930> then

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
insulation extends for quite a bit then

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.179 
insulation extends for quite a bit then
zip<00:01:46.619> tied<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> along<00:01:48.290> basically<00:01:49.290> along<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
zip tied it along basically along the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.410 
zip tied it along basically along the
edge<00:01:50.340> behind<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.479> battery

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.800 

and<00:01:56.020> back<00:01:56.260> just<00:01:56.530> through<00:01:56.740> here<00:01:57.510> and<00:01:58.510> out<00:01:58.660> the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
and back just through here and out the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.960 
and back just through here and out the
front<00:01:59.020> grille<00:01:59.230> and<00:01:59.490> zip-tied<00:02:00.490> at<00:02:00.610> many<00:02:00.820> places

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
front grille and zip-tied at many places

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.520 
front grille and zip-tied at many places
along<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.390> way<00:02:01.570> after<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.110> kid<00:02:02.260> actually

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
along the way after the kid actually

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.360 
along the way after the kid actually
comes<00:02:02.740> with<00:02:02.890> some<00:02:03.100> ties<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.450> if<00:02:04.510> we<00:02:04.630> put<00:02:04.900> the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
comes with some ties so if we put the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.270 
comes with some ties so if we put the
cover<00:02:06.370> on<00:02:06.520> here<00:02:06.900> it'll<00:02:07.900> tuck<00:02:08.170> nicely<00:02:08.920> right

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
cover on here it'll tuck nicely right
