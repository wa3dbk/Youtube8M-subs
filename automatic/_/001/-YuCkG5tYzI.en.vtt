00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.510
 I'm going to talk a little bit about 70 200 f 4 l 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.999
 first of all because nothing else to say that they are excellent the entity has a 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:12.509
 very very very very good performance in everything he does 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:19.189
 but especially if you do not need diaphragm opening or if you have plans if not 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.829
 you can use it then you will not have any problem even though you 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:23.880
 increase 4 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.890
 that in addition f4 is considered good neither too slow neither to him nor many I ask 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.910
 it's really common for an intermediate 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.199
 and good is a very very clear lens 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.339
 can capture a great level of detail and also as it is from the series glee the 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:39.440
 board students 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.739
 good color saturation and good contrast behavior 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.790
 images that will also help you to reduce the times when 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.589
 you have to be avoiding the photos 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.220
 because it's going to be a fairly pretty decent direct image 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.430
 from the entity 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.470
 so good in terms of image quality these tremendous ones have a 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.910
 incredible sharpness 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.980
 and then nothing more to say is of wendy's and must the entity 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.250
 and well my first impression was when I took it 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.660
 is an entity that weighs more than 700 grams then it is not really so light 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.490
 We wanted the entity but it is manageable 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.360
 and obviously the one with the stabilizer version stumble over one hundred times 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.140
 one hundred version 2 points 8 with stabilizers of the heaviest 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.280
 what it costs double 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.399
 so 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.849
 is within what fits if one could say that in that range is a lens a 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.639
 little light although she after being louzÃ¡n don I showed 4 5 hours and 

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:34.990
 be loading it if you start to notice a little more weight 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.910
 but nothing really serious 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.960
 and in the construction it also feels very very very solid 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.950
 and it gives you a lot of excellent security because you know what is going to help a lot 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.410
 ipc feels almost indestructible of how well constructed it is and good for 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.470
 there they say that this fact does not 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.860
 nikon falls and breaks and when so dry in devotee 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.310
 so I'm not going to put it to the test but I've read several stories in the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.280
 they say people who have fallen the entity and others 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.470
 specifically and things like that and about the normal level and it does not happen to them 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.870
 really great thing 

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.930
 although there was no mind if it falls from the side of the lens price is likely not to 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.179
 I will survive him the front element or something like that 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:19.910
 but weigh feels very very very solid 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.009
 It has two two rubber rings 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.980
 this one here is the one that will serve you to make are 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.080
 and it is that from here it is for him to focus manually 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.079
 and it is very smooth movement of these rings 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.539
 it does not get stuck it does not have common jumps in how in others I understood nothing 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:43.099
 the focus speed is also very fast and it will work very well 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.029
 in situations where there is action and a lot of movement like sports photography 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:52.379
 and biblical like that as long as you have enough light 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.059
 if there is not so much light 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.329
 because already with the diaphragm bc4 bart will reduce a bit the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.639
 Focus speed 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.839
 but I've never really had so many problems unless they're 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.799
 already very extreme situations in which practically 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.450
 there is no light then and it costs a bit of work to get the point 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:13.150
 what are you 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.499
 focusing 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:20.199
 but if there is light or this is not so extreme the situation then you do not go 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.800
 to have 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.859
 many problems 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.619
 this law that also works for concerts and I used them all 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:28.849
 enough in that 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.849
 but the good one has to have several considerations 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.619
 well present 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:38.979
 once in the concerts in which I have been lae many times the light that 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:39.680
 occupy 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.510
 this is a husband then he gives you 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.330
 so a decent amount of light then you can work a little with that 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.649
 but all these pictures anyway 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:55.029
 salenosko nor its very high are thrown always I am throwing 3200 with six thousand 400 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:56.529
 even 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:00.759
 and then I never had a big problem with that because in the edition 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.549
 can put noise reduction correction disposal if it is a 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:04.490
 little dark 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.409
 and else 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.129
 but neither do I work with a very large investments or anything for the 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.030
 style then that also has to be taken into account 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.019
 because almost all the photos that I use use for the internet and so on 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:16.959
 so 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.230
 there is not so much problem with me with this noise issue and so on 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:23.180
 and good you also have to consider 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.289
 wants to be a 200 millimeters and you're shooting at 212 need 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.640
 pragma speeds 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.500
 as we see about 320 or things like that to ensure that it will not come out shaky 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.940
 the image 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.310
 and then if you are always pulling 70 millimeters and that already reaches you 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.029
 so then 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:45.320
 you're going to win a little hyde 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.460
 from the healthy luzhniki you have so many problems but if you are going to have to 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.699
 sandro smooth 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.200
 the freight handles it quite well in situations of 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.210
 backlit and that I have had very very very few times that I filtered and 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.820
 the 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.560
 the fleni anyway new lion the pretty wings to the images but in 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.090
 general controls it quite well 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.610
 and if not with the parasol 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.120
 since you already have tdt is to help 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.560
 very much these celebrations of soriano the parasol well included with him with the 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.580
 sushi lens 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.419
 they give it to you 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.960
 and good lya finally the buttons that this has 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.330
 excellent are these two 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.740
 well this button is going to say that 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.690
 two options from 1 point 2 meters to infinity and from three meters to infinity 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.889
 this is going to control 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.939
 the distances to the burn are vaz focused 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.360
 if everything is the button like point 2 meters then 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.139
 that is the minimum distance the client can focus the vat is sweeping 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:46.529
 all this 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.210
 all that range of 100 your minimum distance to infinity 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.770
 if you can not at 3 meters then you will talk a little bit of time to the entity 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.020
 because all that first part of 1 point 2 meters to 3 will not lend them 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.830
 attention will be focusing d3m forward 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.650
 then this time all the subjects are going to be far away 2011 is going to be still 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.639
 a little more 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.669
 it's going to be even faster focusing speed 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.869
 with the entity 

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:15.110
 the second button 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.320
 is going to be to activate or turn off the phone that 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.819
 automatic and manual 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.259
 and those are the only buttons he has 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.469
 the body 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.069
 in the opinion that ismael villalba 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.020
 the output of the ship excellent 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.419
 It's pretty pretty 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:39.840
 Obviously Lennon, you are expecting a completely blurred background and humility 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.969
 noemÃ­ lamented so great of your subject 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.659
 because since it's an opening of the c4 there 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.849
 Obviously you will not have the same level of forest as from conselleria to 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:56.210
 his hands at 85 millimeters a point 2 of canon that is barbaric but 

00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:00.599
 still this excellent one continues to give a rather pretty pretty ship is very 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:02.919
 soft very creamy and everything 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:08.400
 I'm also good that he will give you a very good quality because the diaphragm 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.759
 because 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.710
 eight sheets or eight knives not then 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.550
 It will give you a very nice image especially in the lights when you see them in the 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.169
 defocused background I do not even have an example of that but the rows up 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:26.500
 practically round thanks to atlanta 2 lower than it has not 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.680
 and well well and at the end
