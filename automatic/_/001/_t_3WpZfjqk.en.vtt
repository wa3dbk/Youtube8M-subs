comes<00:03:11.430> off<00:03:11.609> as<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.030> stupid<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:13.319> you<00:03:13.410> go

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
comes off as so stupid but if you go

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.530 
comes off as so stupid but if you go
back<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.010> roots<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.400> oh<00:03:14.609> he's<00:03:15.180> kind<00:03:15.450> of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
back to the roots of oh he's kind of

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.020 
back to the roots of oh he's kind of
like<00:03:15.810> he<00:03:16.410> always<00:03:16.590> tries<00:03:17.069> really<00:03:17.099> hard<00:03:17.459> and

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
like he always tries really hard and

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.259 
like he always tries really hard and
sometimes<00:03:18.209> he<00:03:18.540> fails<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.440> he's<00:03:20.430> positive<00:03:21.000> but

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
sometimes he fails and he's positive but

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.879 
sometimes he fails and he's positive but
sometimes<00:03:21.690> he<00:03:21.900> gets<00:03:22.019> kind<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.380> grumpy<00:03:22.739> you

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
sometimes he gets kind of grumpy you

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.349 
sometimes he gets kind of grumpy you
know<00:03:22.980> when<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.190> go<00:03:23.340> more<00:03:23.549> than<00:03:23.579> that<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:23.910> think

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
know when you go more than that I think

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.629 
know when you go more than that I think
it's<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.569> better<00:03:24.690> strategy<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.919> this<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.609> me

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
it's a better strategy so this to me

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.670 
it's a better strategy so this to me
this<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.269> not<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.690> best<00:03:27.810> strategy<00:03:28.049> if<00:03:28.530> they're

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
this is not the best strategy if they're
