 up to a second the laser allows us 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.350
 form corneal incisions with 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.239
 Accurate to the thousandth of a millimeter 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.269
 what lets say really about

 each specific clinical case 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.710
 capabilities of the device are quite wide and 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.720
 he allows against not only similar 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.830

 the place just can't render 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.600
 high-tech assistance 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.270
 microsurgical rely and are treated

 wrench foreign objects injury 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.490
 the gap just a year at the center help 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.110
 an average of 30 thousand patients still so much 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.100
 come to the consultation there 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.580
 unique cases

 infect an organ to get a shard 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.880
 it was necessary to literally highlight the voice
