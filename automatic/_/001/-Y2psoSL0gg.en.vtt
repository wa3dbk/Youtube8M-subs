00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.399
 unbelievable resistance 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.490
 if a normal day turns 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.030

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.699

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.350

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.359

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.260
 break the window 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.880

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.840
 friend has a serious accident with the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.960
 day of leisure 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.050
 then how to escape a brain off in 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.090
 road a shit like this can be fatal 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.800
 if you find yourself mobilized in 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.770
 hospital you would know what to do with crap 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.690
 scary can be hurt or worse 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.390
 when you go down along a shit 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.130
 you need to calibrate each step you verify if 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.380
 to symptoms of anal sex with butter 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.170
 seems okay and do it only if you don't 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.660
 has injuries to the neck to the head but 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:04.650
 you have to grit your teeth until I have it 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.330
 finished i know i know i did from rem e 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.140
 you can tell it to your grandchildren 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.270
 I already have almost finished good plaster I know 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.900
 lando and go to woods and places 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.820
 isolated 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.160
 better to be prepared in your backpack 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.410
 put a water emergency kit with 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.420
 water is an app water now I'll pass 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.940
 multi-purpose knife around the body 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.010
 under the armpits they claim to move 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.810
 wait here and don't move you are 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.909
 tied up who I have to get an idea 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:41.329
 I want you to pass the head and the 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:47.360
 put under the arms 111 are you okay 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:49.429
 you are well everyday life there 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.929
 offers many opportunities to run part 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.189
 when an attacker could 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.899
 run after him 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.939
 in this challenge I will show you that the 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.159
 brain runs more than two samples of 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.780
 free running run blind do not 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.929
 take the challenge to the ground more 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.929
 favorable 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:11.360
 They do not resort to use bovo bolts 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.960
 susceptible to rapid and I look where I go 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.190
 the brain is more complicated than it is 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.260
 I expected 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.220
 the brain beats me in fact but the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.190
 challenge can be decided by an intuition 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.230
 if needed, use an intuition often can 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.840
 make the difference between freedom scale 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.300
 can serve but I want them to use it too 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.550
 them if you have to jump from several meters 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.770
 of height before kakÃ  along the wall 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.630
 then jump to this height 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.860
 better not to look down an attack of 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.860
 vertigo can make you fall 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.660
 if a splinter comes in and you don't have the 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:54.940
 tweezers how do you remove it 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.920
 maybe or torn to pull it out of command 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.700
 life is revisable and can put bars 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.810
 grill in front of the strangest situations 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.640
 we will shoot a scene and mountain bike 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.890
 so there is the risk of falling and 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.360
 accidents 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.280
 nothing better than some wheelbarrows 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.280
 down from the roofs to start the day 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.940
 yes i like doing spider man
