root<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.890> I'm<00:02:20.950> incorporating<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.519> cross<00:02:21.819> bar

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
root and I'm incorporating a cross bar

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.570 
root and I'm incorporating a cross bar
to<00:02:23.080> capture<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.590> natural<00:02:24.010> seventh<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.459> have

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
to capture that natural seventh you have

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.059 
to capture that natural seventh you have
sharp<00:02:24.819> over<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.239> first<00:02:25.420> string<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.860> when<00:02:27.010> I

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
sharp over on the first string so when I

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.140 
sharp over on the first string so when I
delete<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.519> bass<00:02:27.700> note<00:02:29.760> my<00:02:30.760> point<00:02:31.060> of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
delete the bass note my point of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150 
delete the bass note my point of
reference<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.989> G<00:02:32.319> so<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.680> look<00:02:32.920> at<00:02:33.010> that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
reference is this G so I look at that

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.280 
reference is this G so I look at that
and<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.340> say<00:02:33.549> oh<00:02:33.579> well<00:02:33.849> let's<00:02:34.269> see<00:02:34.450> that's<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.110> B

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
and I say oh well let's see that's a B

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.350 
and I say oh well let's see that's a B
minor<00:02:35.530> chord<00:02:35.650> isn't<00:02:36.099> it<00:02:36.160> well<00:02:37.120> when<00:02:37.269> you

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
minor chord isn't it well when you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.750 
minor chord isn't it well when you
examine<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.900> G<00:02:38.049> major<00:02:38.260> seven<00:02:38.709> chord<00:02:38.739> it's<00:02:39.459> one

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
examine a G major seven chord it's one

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.089 
examine a G major seven chord it's one
three<00:02:40.060> five<00:02:40.299> seven<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:41.349> one<00:02:41.560> three<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:41.890> five

three five seven the one three and five

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.220 
three five seven the one three and five
form<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.610> G<00:02:42.819> chord<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.629> three<00:02:43.900> five<00:02:44.200> and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
form the G chord the three five and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.740 
form the G chord the three five and
seven<00:02:44.620> form<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.400> B<00:02:45.549> minor<00:02:45.790> chord<00:02:45.940> they<00:02:46.390> form

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
seven form of B minor chord they form

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.410 
seven form of B minor chord they form
the<00:02:46.959> three<00:02:47.319> chord<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.400> key<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.670> G<00:02:51.420> there

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
the three chord in the key of G there

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.199 
the three chord in the key of G there
I'm<00:02:52.510> just<00:02:52.629> going<00:02:52.930> up<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.230> scale<00:02:53.470> G<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:54.280> minor<00:02:54.849> B

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
I'm just going up the scale G a minor B

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.240 
I'm just going up the scale G a minor B
minor<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:55.840> if<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:55.959> play<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.319> B<00:02:56.500> minor<00:02:56.769> put<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> G

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
minor so if I play that B minor put a G

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.089 
minor so if I play that B minor put a G
bass<00:02:57.459> under<00:02:57.819> I<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:59.170> found<00:02:59.319> another<00:02:59.440> voicing

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
bass under I just found another voicing

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.610 
bass under I just found another voicing
so<00:03:00.790> for<00:03:01.000> our<00:03:01.120> purposes<00:03:01.690> if<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.230> knew<00:03:02.410> where<00:03:02.590> a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
so for our purposes if you knew where a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.949 
so for our purposes if you knew where a
bunch<00:03:02.799> of<00:03:02.950> B<00:03:03.100> minors<00:03:03.519> were<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.510> bass<00:03:04.720> player

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
bunch of B minors were the bass player

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.410 
bunch of B minors were the bass player
is<00:03:05.049> playing<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.410> G<00:03:05.760> together<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:07.000> guys<00:03:07.150> are

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
is playing the G together you guys are

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.180 
is playing the G together you guys are
playing<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.810> G<00:03:07.959> major<00:03:08.200> seven<00:03:08.680> chord

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
playing the G major seven chord

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.340 
playing the G major seven chord
so<00:03:09.459> step<00:03:09.760> one<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.420> see<00:03:10.600> your<00:03:10.750> inversions

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
so step one is to see your inversions

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.050 
so step one is to see your inversions
now<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.590> definition<00:03:11.859> of<00:03:12.340> an<00:03:12.430> inversion<00:03:12.730> is

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
now the definition of an inversion is

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.150 
now the definition of an inversion is
that<00:03:13.269> each<00:03:13.450> note<00:03:13.690> in<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.840> chord<00:03:14.049> moves<00:03:14.680> up<00:03:14.889> or

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
that each note in the chord moves up or

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.550 
that each note in the chord moves up or
down<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.790> next<00:03:16.060> note<00:03:16.239> in<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> chord<00:03:16.840> so

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
down to the next note in the chord so

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.110 
down to the next note in the chord so
let's<00:03:17.739> examine<00:03:17.889> his<00:03:18.250> chord<00:03:18.519> if<00:03:18.670> we<00:03:18.790> just<00:03:18.940> take

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
let's examine his chord if we just take

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.670 
let's examine his chord if we just take
the<00:03:19.269> top<00:03:19.480> three<00:03:19.780> strings<00:03:20.019> for<00:03:20.260> example<00:03:20.349> you

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
the top three strings for example you

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.110 
the top three strings for example you
have<00:03:20.769> B<00:03:20.980> D<00:03:21.370> F<00:03:21.700> sharp

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
have B D F sharp

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.930 
have B D F sharp
that's<00:03:22.780> root<00:03:23.079> flatted<00:03:23.349> third<00:03:23.709> fifth<00:03:23.980> if<00:03:24.280> you

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
that's root flatted third fifth if you

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.000 
that's root flatted third fifth if you
move<00:03:25.150> each<00:03:25.389> note<00:03:25.750> up<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.319> next<00:03:26.620> note<00:03:26.799> in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
move each note up to the next note in

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.009 
move each note up to the next note in
the<00:03:27.099> chord<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.669> get<00:03:27.849> that<00:03:28.299> B<00:03:28.510> minor

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
the chord you get that B minor

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.930 
the chord you get that B minor
this<00:03:29.530> was<00:03:29.709> root<00:03:29.950> position<00:03:30.430> because<00:03:30.609> root<00:03:30.819> was

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
this was root position because root was

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.210 
this was root position because root was
the<00:03:31.030> lowest<00:03:31.329> voice<00:03:31.480> here<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.560> first<00:03:32.859> inversion

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
the lowest voice here is first inversion

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.159 
the lowest voice here is first inversion
because<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.090> flatted<00:03:34.419> third<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.900> lowest

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
because the flatted third is the lowest

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.440 
because the flatted third is the lowest
voice<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:35.650> then<00:03:35.739> your<00:03:35.859> file<00:03:36.130> inversion<00:03:36.700> will

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
voice and then your file inversion will

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.870 
voice and then your file inversion will
be<00:03:37.599> up<00:03:37.690> here<00:03:37.959> now<00:03:38.440> you'll<00:03:38.620> recognize<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.639> as

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
be up here now you'll recognize this as

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.129 
be up here now you'll recognize this as
the<00:03:39.940> top<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.049> a<00:03:41.109> little<00:03:41.319> a<00:03:41.410> minor<00:03:41.680> phone<00:03:41.980> chord

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
the top of a little a minor phone chord

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.289 
the top of a little a minor phone chord
you'll<00:03:44.139> recognize<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.980> as<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.700> top<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.209> an

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
you'll recognize this as the top of an

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.539 
you'll recognize this as the top of an
open<00:03:46.599> B<00:03:46.720> minor<00:03:47.019> chord<00:03:47.319> as<00:03:47.769> far<00:03:47.950> as<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.069> voicing

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
open B minor chord as far as a voicing

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.670 
open B minor chord as far as a voicing
and<00:03:48.730> you'll<00:03:49.209> recognize<00:03:49.660> this<00:03:49.900> B<00:03:50.109> minor<00:03:50.380> as<00:03:50.650> a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
and you'll recognize this B minor as a

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.650 
and you'll recognize this B minor as a
little<00:03:51.069> D<00:03:51.250> minor<00:03:51.459> G<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.120> probably<00:03:52.450> already

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
little D minor G so you probably already

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.140 
little D minor G so you probably already
know<00:03:53.230> if<00:03:53.530> you<00:03:53.560> know<00:03:53.739> a<00:03:53.769> D<00:03:54.010> minor<00:03:54.280> name<00:03:54.669> ironing

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
know if you know a D minor name ironing

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.030 
know if you know a D minor name ironing
minor<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.900> know<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.260> shapes<00:03:56.530> are<00:03:56.769> just<00:03:56.919> off

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
minor you know the shapes are just off

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.170 
minor you know the shapes are just off
the<00:03:57.220> neck<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:57.609> it<00:03:57.700> looks<00:03:57.849> a<00:03:57.910> little<00:03:58.000> different

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
the neck so it looks a little different

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.569 
the neck so it looks a little different
but<00:03:58.540> let's<00:03:59.019> learn<00:03:59.200> these<00:03:59.440> there's<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.459> B

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
but let's learn these there's the B

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.569 
but let's learn these there's the B
minor<00:04:00.819> root<00:04:01.090> position<00:04:02.099> there's<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.250> B<00:04:03.370> minor

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
minor root position there's the B minor

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.059 
minor root position there's the B minor
first<00:04:03.849> inversion<00:04:04.500> there's<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.680> B<00:04:05.799> minor

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
first inversion there's the B minor

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.910 
first inversion there's the B minor
second<00:04:06.549> inversion<00:04:06.819> no<00:04:07.390> trick<00:04:07.629> you<00:04:07.829> got<00:04:08.829> all

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
second inversion no trick you got all

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.320 
second inversion no trick you got all
these<00:04:09.010> different<00:04:09.129> fingerings<00:04:09.700> not<00:04:09.879> playing

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
these different fingerings not playing

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.570 
these different fingerings not playing
it<00:04:10.600> doesn't<00:04:11.380> matter<00:04:11.560> what<00:04:11.860> fingerings<00:04:12.430> you

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
it doesn't matter what fingerings you

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.670 
it doesn't matter what fingerings you
use<00:04:12.820> and<00:04:13.600> that's<00:04:13.870> important<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.410> take<00:04:14.620> a

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
use and that's important you take a

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.620 
use and that's important you take a
chord<00:04:15.100> practice<00:04:15.580> with<00:04:15.730> every<00:04:16.180> possible

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
chord practice with every possible

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.080 
chord practice with every possible
fingering<00:04:17.049> crossbars<00:04:17.709> plan<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.519> know<00:04:18.670> with

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
fingering crossbars plan you know with

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.240 
fingering crossbars plan you know with
you<00:04:19.209> knows<00:04:19.360> whatever<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:19.840> takes<00:04:20.049> because<00:04:20.830> when

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
you knows whatever it takes because when

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.010 
you knows whatever it takes because when
you<00:04:21.340> free<00:04:21.670> up<00:04:21.820> other<00:04:22.000> fingers<00:04:22.540> then<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.870> have

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
you free up other fingers then you have

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.200 
you free up other fingers then you have
other<00:04:23.170> voices<00:04:23.410> available<00:04:23.980> other<00:04:24.130> notes<00:04:24.400> so

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
other voices available other notes so

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.580 
other voices available other notes so
this<00:04:25.510> will<00:04:25.750> serve<00:04:26.050> for<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.440> G<00:04:26.620> major<00:04:26.860> 7<00:04:28.590> you

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
this will serve for the G major 7 you

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.880 
this will serve for the G major 7 you
hear<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.890> took<00:04:30.070> with<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.490> bass<00:04:30.640> note<00:04:34.830> now<00:04:35.830> you

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
hear it took with the bass note now you

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.610 
hear it took with the bass note now you
can<00:04:36.070> hear<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.280> whole<00:04:36.370> tonality
