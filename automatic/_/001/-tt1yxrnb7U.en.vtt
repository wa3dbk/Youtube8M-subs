00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.710
 Congratulations to Joachim Löw 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.330
 and his complete trainer staff to 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.880
 World Cup 2014 in Brazil 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.190
 congratulations from up here and now you 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 both thumbs 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.060
 congratulations thank you say how many 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.490
 Thanks also from me joachim 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.410
 Löw was very moving one has seen 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 So many were also a few 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.830
 tears with joyful tears 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.570
 turn in between maybe 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.490
 at the most, but that is after 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.430
 everything paid out, tell it all 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.719
 hard work today that was us 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.270
 actually always clear that the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.280
 argentinier of course everything somehow 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.620
 mobilize and release all forces 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.270
 at such a final was clear a hard one 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.730
 Piece of work of the player are far over 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.430
 the borders have gone they have today 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.110
 once given so much as never before 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.090
 to achieve what they have never had 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.510
 namely this cup with home 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.160
 to take 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.420
 given all together again and again 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.980
 pointed out it was this 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.710
 great team spirit and also at 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.539
 celebrate just one has the'd seen 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.949
 they say that was created here 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.100
 while in Brazil or was 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.890
 that already created now I believe 55 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.470
 days together but i believe the work 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.810
 started with ten years ago 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.180
 klinsmann back then and we have that 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.549
 we continued to do everything 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.950
 to experience this day and I believe 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.380
 the team has absolutely earned it 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.780
 Nobody deserves it as much as we do 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.820
 You have to say that the team has 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.170
 an incredible team spirit developed 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.090
 in these last weeks 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.150
 she was really a conspirator 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 unit fought for this title 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.630
 Every single one has 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.220
 every single one has somehow too 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.930
 committed to the team all too 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.600
 Give the team everything to do 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.399
 all his energy and that was 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.810
 certainly a key reason that 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.950
 we won today but it was on 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.270
 almost a little something like in the end 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.070
 a family outing i am the pictures 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.049
 I've seen them every single one 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.000
 player woman there too 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.040
 congratulated you have congratulated 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.270
 So there is indeed a lot 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.399
 you can not grow together 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.990
 say differently i just watched in 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.280
 at half-time to extend they are 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.229
 to mario götze can and have him once 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.810
 have short pinched in the chin 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.979
 the last tip 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.660
 somehow I had the feeling that he 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.550
 Something important today 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.640
 can do because 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.080
 player of the games decides and the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.330
 makes extraordinary things and 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.790
 somehow that had the feeling that today 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.350
 the thing comes to an end here as well 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.370
 somehow completely but only in the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.830
 team then they have a bit 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.870
 rescheduled that is something synonymous 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.610
 slowly matured in them are the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.380
 project hard the chapter with 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.150
 Philipp lame only on the six then on 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.350
 the foreign position that's one 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.820
 How difficult it is for them to develop 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.170
 because of the fundamental 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.540
 Brand liked 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.580
 in the beginning it was just that 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.140
 The Schweinsteiger sami khedira not to 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.090
 100 percent were fit and there it was 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.570
 For me it is clear that these two 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.430
 player not tournament with seven games 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.960
 standing by that intensity 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.490
 somehow I realized that one 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.050
 kinda that kind of task 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.370
 have to share and in the beginning what right 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.140
 and to put philipp into the midfield 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.480
 because he is easily on this position 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.070
 class plays france had 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.660
 this game the feeling the team 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.880
 maybe needs new stimulus and 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.140
 khedira and schweinsteiger are now 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.820
 now they have something like that 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.100
 bit of power collected in the first 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.990
 play at the first because khedira has 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.510
 twice not played Schweinsteiger 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.370
 not played and then they were 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.320
 just ready and then this was 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.700
 Measure then actually correct 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.750
 but it always stays that way 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.100
 a development and that occurs 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.020
 He is country coach at the next turn 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.500
 is with his rod who looks who 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.170
 then it is fit at the right moment 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.970
 they would say that was the i 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.530
 the icing on the cake so far 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.520
 But they said ten years ago 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.260
 that is already here 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.360
 They have always been in the ten years 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.060
 at least in the semifinals what was 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.110
 the title was missing 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.209
 that at least facilitates the work 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.010
 or that makes of course that's nice 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.420
 a thing for eternity the first 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.120
 to be european here in south america 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.630
 in maracana in rio in the football land 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.950
 Absolutely then sometimes the first 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.590
 winning titles for the europeans 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.800
 It has been ten years now 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.780
 long hard work clear we got ourselves 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.830
 but in these years continuously 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.230
 we are always better 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.780
 have always believed in us and 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.900
 it was just obvious but me 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.819
 mine too for her personally 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.159
 Of course, that's me as well 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.509
 A great success because I have seen 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.829
 that the team is developing that 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.389
 makes a trainer happy if the 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.590
 team also improved and sure 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.780
 we are playfully in the last 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.539
 years into the world peak we come 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.250
 have us since improved because only 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.900
 German virtues would not be 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.460
 it would not have gone away anymore 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.190
 So we also had to play 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.270
 grow and we did that 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.340
 was of course a big one for me too 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.289
 Satisfaction but that is of course clear 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.639
 Of course that is extreme and 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.080
 the mix of course makes the German 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.630
 virtues like today again 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.400
 but are now in a row with sepp 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.680
 herberger helmut schön franz beckenbauer 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.660
 and joachim löw those are the four the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.310
 got the title and there was 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.380
 some in the first place said so 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.669
 if the wm-title gets more you can 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.539
 not reached but you can 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.070
 You can still do this team 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.330
 evolve you can do that 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.340
 certainly because this team is yes 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.840
 not somehow in the end there's 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.430
 lady was in one or the other player 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.650
 you have to look at miroslav klose 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:11.620
 but otherwise all can be done until 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:16.570
 40 harmless everything would not be 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.830
 Surprised but this team has 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.090
 of course we still have the future 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.520
 some players who were not there 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.520
 günter goods or marco reus etc 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.789
 this team is young khedira and 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.590
 özil as a young player who have 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.440
 certainly something else in front of you that is 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.880
 they're going on tonight 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.120
 to talk about it 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:41.770
 I have a contract but is prepared 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:45.400
 there is no doubt you have to 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.110
 He already said that he is 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.370
 firstly enthusiastic and secondly full 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.900
 convinced that that too 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.340
 it goes on a bit now 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.470
 came here later today 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.430
 because a whole lot has been going on in 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.530
 I heard the cabin 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.539
 in the cabin, of course, is all 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.550
 the dams clearly broke my die 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.199
 Chancellor Wada and the Federal President 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:08.080
 have given short speeches the 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:09.940
 of course, the cheers clear and it 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.770
 there are no more limits to this 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.330
 is fire free today I can only 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.039
 Everyone was very upset with us 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.690
 were exhausting work for the 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.830
 player and I can not do it for you 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.460
 just imagine, but we have 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.289
 also seen 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.310
 we can also look very briefly 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.960
 about the enthusiasm in germany 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.480
 you have a last time always 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.360
 again 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.700
 with experienced there were these pictures 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.930
 Berlin from the fanmeile 500,000 then 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.180
 was the closed 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.370
 there was nothing left and we just did 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.380
 we were actually able to convince ourselves 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.270
 most of them still there so they 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.920
 have little taste for what 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.360
 she expected players on Tuesday 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.160
 In the cabin we drive to Berlin 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.780
 Berlin We are going to Berlin 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.310
 then I would have a good trip there 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.780
 Thanks a lot Joachim Löw 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.780
 Thank you very much
