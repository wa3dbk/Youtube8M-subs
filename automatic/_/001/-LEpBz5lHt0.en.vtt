certain situations and started
developing<00:05:10.240> like<00:05:10.389> okay<00:05:10.660> now<00:05:10.840> these<00:05:11.560> two

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
developing like okay now these two

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.620 
developing like okay now these two
people<00:05:12.010> are<00:05:12.039> here<00:05:12.460> this<00:05:13.090> is<00:05:13.210> what<00:05:13.389> might

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
people are here this is what might

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.690

really<00:05:13.870> play<00:05:14.110> out<00:05:14.289> and<00:05:14.620> this<00:05:14.889> is<00:05:15.010> maybe<00:05:15.430> the

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
really play out and this is maybe the

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.580 
really play out and this is maybe the
directions<00:05:16.150> for<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.360> might<00:05:16.479> go<00:05:16.660> in<00:05:16.870> it's

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
directions for it might go in it's

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.040 
directions for it might go in it's
almost<00:05:17.740> like<00:05:18.060> reshaping<00:05:19.060> parcel<00:05:19.630> story<00:05:19.810> that

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
almost like reshaping parcel story that

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.230 
almost like reshaping parcel story that
we're<00:05:20.229> very<00:05:20.470> how<00:05:20.770> like<00:05:21.190> you<00:05:21.310> said<00:05:21.490> cloudy<00:05:21.789> and

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
we're very how like you said cloudy and

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.410 
we're very how like you said cloudy and
we<00:05:22.750> weren't<00:05:23.020> really<00:05:23.260> sure<00:05:23.410> of

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
we weren't really sure of

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.380 
we weren't really sure of
clear<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:25.770> they've<00:05:26.460> added<00:05:26.790> a<00:05:26.850> lot<00:05:27.000> to<00:05:27.060> the

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
clear and they've added a lot to the

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.530 
clear and they've added a lot to the
story<00:05:27.420> too<00:05:27.870> i<00:05:27.900> just<00:05:28.650> talking<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.090> i

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
story too i just talking to it and i

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.470 
story too i just talking to it and i
think<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:31.050> thing<00:05:31.260> that<00:05:31.320> will<00:05:32.090> take<00:05:33.090> this<00:05:33.330> to

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
think the thing that will take this to

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.120 
think the thing that will take this to
the<00:05:33.510> next<00:05:33.600> level<00:05:33.870> is<00:05:34.290> we'll<00:05:34.590> be<00:05:34.740> doing<00:05:35.100> some

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
the next level is we'll be doing some

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.780 
the next level is we'll be doing some
rehearsals<00:05:35.880> with<00:05:36.030> them<00:05:36.210> which<00:05:36.390> i<00:05:36.510> think<00:05:36.570> will

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
rehearsals with them which i think will

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.680 
rehearsals with them which i think will
flush<00:05:38.790> out<00:05:38.970> these<00:05:39.150> scenes<00:05:39.390> and<00:05:39.600> these

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
flush out these scenes and these

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.780 
flush out these scenes and these
characters<00:05:40.170> even<00:05:40.380> more<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:41.160> we<00:05:41.370> are<00:05:41.520> looking

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
characters even more so we are looking

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.560 
characters even more so we are looking
