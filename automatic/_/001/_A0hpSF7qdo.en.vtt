help and something that would challenge

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
a figure of maps we're not going to use

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.119 
a figure of maps we're not going to use
GPS<00:05:17.830> or<00:05:18.430> any<00:05:19.330> traffic<00:05:19.629> tracking<00:05:20.560> devices<00:05:20.830> to

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
GPS or any traffic tracking devices to

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.459 
GPS or any traffic tracking devices to
aid<00:05:21.400> our<00:05:21.840> navigation<00:05:22.840> so<00:05:22.990> it's<00:05:23.110> all<00:05:23.199> gonna<00:05:23.349> be

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
aid our navigation so it's all gonna be

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.469 
aid our navigation so it's all gonna be
Maps<00:05:23.740> it's<00:05:24.490> gonna<00:05:24.639> be<00:05:24.699> setting<00:05:24.969> out<00:05:25.060> routes<00:05:25.300> in

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
Maps it's gonna be setting out routes in

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.080 
Maps it's gonna be setting out routes in
the<00:05:25.539> day<00:05:26.099> how<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.159> fire<00:05:27.460> we<00:05:27.610> think<00:05:27.759> we<00:05:27.849> can<00:05:27.969> get

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
the day how the fire we think we can get

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.459 
the day how the fire we think we can get
in<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.240> day<00:05:28.389> what's<00:05:28.599> realistic<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.259> do<00:05:29.349> with

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469 
in the day what's realistic to do with

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.909 
in the day what's realistic to do with
bikes<00:05:30.690> small<00:05:31.690> tanks<00:05:32.110> things<00:05:32.289> like<00:05:32.440> that<00:05:32.590> time

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
bikes small tanks things like that time

00:05:32.919 --> 00:06:56.470 
bikes small tanks things like that time
for<00:05:33.099> lunches<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.580> stuff<00:05:33.729> so<00:05:33.909> figured<00:05:34.690> out
