online gaming and video tweaking and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
online gaming and video tweaking and
things<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.680> actually<00:01:04.890> works<00:01:05.460> quite

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
things like that it actually works quite

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.980 
things like that it actually works quite
well<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> interface<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:06.810> i<00:01:06.840> want

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
well so this is the interface but i want

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.420 
well so this is the interface but i want
to<00:01:07.049> show<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> how<00:01:07.320> fast<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
to show you how fast it is now this is

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.280 
to show you how fast it is now this is
probably<00:01:08.909> less<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.110> new

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
probably less to do with the new

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.830 
probably less to do with the new
operating<00:01:11.159> system<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.880> more<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.479> do<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
operating system and more to do with the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.590 
operating system and more to do with the
fact<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.500> dual<00:01:13.950> core<00:01:14.340> processor

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600
