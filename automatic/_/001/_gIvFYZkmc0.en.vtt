00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
an older bush and what we deal with

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.470 
an older bush and what we deal with
versus<00:00:20.100> pruning<00:00:20.400> some<00:00:20.910> younger<00:00:21.090> bushes<00:00:21.449> that

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
versus pruning some younger bushes that

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.240 
versus pruning some younger bushes that
we'll<00:00:21.689> do<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.900> another<00:00:22.080> tank<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
we'll do in another tank but it is a

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.609 
we'll do in another tank but it is a
beautiful<00:00:23.850> spring<00:00:24.510> afternoon<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.350> here<00:00:25.529> in

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
beautiful spring afternoon and here in

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.070 
beautiful spring afternoon and here in
northern<00:00:25.859> Indiana<00:00:26.150> no<00:00:27.150> growth<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.660> started

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
northern Indiana no growth is started

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.689 
northern Indiana no growth is started
there's<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.320> little<00:00:28.529> bit<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.680> slight<00:00:29.189> bud<00:00:29.429> swell

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
there's a little bit of slight bud swell

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.460 
there's a little bit of slight bud swell
so<00:00:29.880> maybe<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.480> too<00:00:31.080> late<00:00:31.260> here

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
so maybe we are a little too late here

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.020 
so maybe we are a little too late here
but<00:00:32.780> we<00:00:34.070> still<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.250> prune<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.670> some<00:00:35.850> good

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
but we still can prune and do some good

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.190 
but we still can prune and do some good
but<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.329> want<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.540> try<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:36.989> pruning

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
but you want to try to get your pruning

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.600 
but you want to try to get your pruning
done<00:00:37.410> before<00:00:37.710> any<00:00:37.860> growth<00:00:38.100> starts<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
done before any growth starts in the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.700

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
here that's not going to produce much

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.630 
here that's not going to produce much
that<00:01:25.259> could<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:25.979> came<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> right

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
that could be if this came in the right

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.130 
that could be if this came in the right
place<00:01:26.880> that'd<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> good<00:01:27.479> came<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> just

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
place that'd be a good came but it just

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.420 
place that'd be a good came but it just
wasn't<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:28.680> place<00:01:30.560> now<00:01:31.560> then<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.280> look

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
wasn't the right place now then we look

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.670 
wasn't the right place now then we look
for<00:01:32.640> some<00:01:32.790> old<00:01:33.030> gnarly<00:01:33.659> branches<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.500> see

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
for some old gnarly branches and I see

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.730 
for some old gnarly branches and I see
one<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.070> side<00:01:36.320> we<00:01:37.320> want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.590> these

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
one on this side we want to get these

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
one on this side we want to get these
pruned<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.420> these<00:01:39.420> generally<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:39.960> have

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
pruned out these generally just have

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.710 
pruned out these generally just have
very<00:01:40.350> short<00:01:40.680> fruiting<00:01:41.490> laterals<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.119> there's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
very short fruiting laterals and there's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
very short fruiting laterals and there's
just<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.350> few<00:01:44.250> Weeke<00:01:44.520> not<00:01:45.240> very<00:01:45.509> happy<00:01:45.810> healthy

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
fruit buds on the end so let's keep

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:00.210 
fruit buds on the end so let's keep
going<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:53.329> keep<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.479> small<00:01:54.750> stuff<00:01:55.079> out

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.219 

here's<00:02:01.220> another<00:02:01.600> crummy<00:02:02.600> old<00:02:02.840> one<00:02:03.050> that<00:02:03.080> we

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
here's another crummy old one that we

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.270 
here's another crummy old one that we
got<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.500> get<00:02:03.560> out<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.560> goal<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.920> thing<00:02:07.190> to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
got to get out the goal is the thing to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.690 
got to get out the goal is the thing to
Bush<00:02:07.460> out<00:02:07.670> quite<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:07.970> bit<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.950> really<00:02:09.979> want<00:02:10.610> to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
Bush out quite a bit you really want to

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.980 
Bush out quite a bit you really want to
get<00:02:10.819> rid<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.150> old<00:02:11.330> canes<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.170> middle

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
get rid of the old canes in the middle

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.030 
get rid of the old canes in the middle
clean<00:02:14.990> off<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.290> middle<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.620> bush<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
clean off the middle of the bush so the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.870 
clean off the middle of the bush so the
light<00:02:16.190> gets<00:02:16.430> in

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
light gets in

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.970 
light gets in
makes<00:02:17.750> for<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.200> better<00:02:18.980> healthier<00:02:19.850> fruit<00:02:22.570> now

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
makes for a better healthier fruit now

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.380 
makes for a better healthier fruit now
that's<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.070> good<00:02:25.250> time<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.459> show<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.790> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
that's a good time to show you the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.479 
that's a good time to show you the
difference<00:02:26.690> between<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:27.260> fruit<00:02:27.800> bud<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.340> a

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
difference between a fruit bud and a

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.040 
difference between a fruit bud and a
leaf<00:02:28.640> button<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:30.020> if<00:02:30.080> we<00:02:30.170> get<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.410> out<00:02:30.590> here

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
leaf button so if we get this out here

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.890 
leaf button so if we get this out here
let's<00:02:33.050> take<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.290> one<00:02:33.440> up<00:02:33.560> here<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:35.720> see

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
let's take this one up here you see

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
let's take this one up here you see
these<00:02:36.050> fruit<00:02:36.290> buds<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.830> end<00:02:37.450> 1<00:02:38.450> 2<00:02:38.690> 3<00:02:39.110> 4<00:02:39.410> 5<00:02:39.590> 6

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
these fruit buds on the end 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
7 8 9 10 11 these are fat

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.560 
7 8 9 10 11 these are fat
big<00:02:44.660> round<00:02:44.900> buds<00:02:45.590> those<00:02:46.489> are<00:02:46.700> fruit<00:02:46.880> buds<00:02:47.090> each

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
big round buds those are fruit buds each

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.210 
big round buds those are fruit buds each
one<00:02:47.810> these<00:02:47.900> buds<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.380> going<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.590> break<00:02:48.739> into

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
one these buds is going to break into

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.640 
one these buds is going to break into
four<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.850> eight<00:02:50.000> fruit<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:51.019> this<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.410> going<00:02:51.560> to

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
four to eight fruit so this is going to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.620 
four to eight fruit so this is going to
be<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.550> everything<00:02:52.880> goes<00:02:53.000> well<00:02:53.060> on<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.390> spring

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
be if everything goes well on the spring

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.360 
be if everything goes well on the spring
with<00:02:53.750> no<00:02:53.840> frog<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.470> will<00:02:54.709> be<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.830> great<00:02:55.040> big

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
with no frog this will be a great big

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.979 
with no frog this will be a great big
cluster<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:56.090> blueberries<00:02:56.480> coming<00:02:56.720> out<00:02:56.810> here

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
cluster of blueberries coming out here

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.290 
cluster of blueberries coming out here
you'll<00:02:57.380> have<00:02:57.410> another<00:02:57.709> one<00:02:57.800> here<00:02:58.130> now<00:02:58.550> these

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
you'll have another one here now these

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.949 
you'll have another one here now these
flat<00:02:59.690> buds<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:00.620> are<00:03:01.610> hugging<00:03:02.420> close<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.840> the

flat buds that are hugging close to the

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.410 
flat buds that are hugging close to the
stem<00:03:03.200> those<00:03:03.739> are<00:03:03.920> leaf<00:03:04.070> buds<00:03:04.370> those<00:03:05.239> are<00:03:05.329> going

stem those are leaf buds those are going

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.690 
stem those are leaf buds those are going
to<00:03:05.480> make<00:03:05.570> Leafs<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.049> then<00:03:06.170> laterals<00:03:06.620> for<00:03:06.860> next

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
to make Leafs and then laterals for next

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.100 
to make Leafs and then laterals for next
not<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:08.030> year's<00:03:08.239> crop<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:08.690> next<00:03:08.870> year's

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
not this year's crop but next year's

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.319 
not this year's crop but next year's
crop<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.489> always<00:03:10.670> want<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:10.940> try<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.150> be

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
crop so you always want to try to be

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.569 
crop so you always want to try to be
encouraging<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:12.590> new<00:03:12.920> young<00:03:13.220> growth

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
encouraging this new young growth

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.789 
encouraging this new young growth
because<00:03:14.510> having<00:03:14.750> this<00:03:14.930> many<00:03:15.140> fruit<00:03:15.380> buds<00:03:15.590> down

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
because having this many fruit buds down

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.190 
because having this many fruit buds down
a<00:03:15.829> lateral<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.430> really<00:03:17.090> great<00:03:17.299> if<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.079> have

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
a lateral is really great if you have

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.660 
a lateral is really great if you have
old<00:03:18.410> wood<00:03:18.709> you're<00:03:19.070> going<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.250> end<00:03:19.370> up<00:03:19.430> as<00:03:19.579> I

old wood you're going to end up as I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.650 
old wood you're going to end up as I
showed<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:19.940> with<00:03:20.090> some<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.209> these<00:03:20.329> other<00:03:20.420> ones

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
showed you with some of these other ones

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.720 
showed you with some of these other ones
take<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:21.860> one<00:03:22.070> this<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.250> kind<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.610> old

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
take on this one this is kind of old

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.280 
take on this one this is kind of old
wood<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.030> just<00:03:23.180> have<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.329> few<00:03:23.570> fruit<00:03:23.780> buds<00:03:23.989> on

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
wood you just have a few fruit buds on

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.500 
wood you just have a few fruit buds on
the<00:03:24.650> end<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.860> a<00:03:24.920> relatively<00:03:25.310> weak<00:03:25.519> lateral<00:03:26.060> and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
the end of a relatively weak lateral and

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.580 
the end of a relatively weak lateral and
that's<00:03:26.720> what<00:03:26.870> we<00:03:26.959> want<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.170> try<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.320> get<00:03:27.470> away

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
that's what we want to try to get away

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.100 
that's what we want to try to get away
from

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.200 

so<00:03:32.740> this<00:03:32.950> Kruk<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.400> bush<00:03:33.640> right<00:03:33.850> now<00:03:34.030> if<00:03:34.120> we

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
so this Kruk this bush right now if we

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.540
