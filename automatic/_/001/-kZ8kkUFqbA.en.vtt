00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.830
 unlike last time this time, nvidia released a new 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.900
 generation of video cards a little earlier than the Rodion as far as the desire to be first 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.500
 influenced the quality and whether we will even see in this review the case with 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.610
 versions from the mass we have a 300 millimeter long PCB 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.660
 Pay attention to this if you decide to purchase this product because 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.060
 it has every body close and a small height of 125 millimeters what if 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.050
 you decide to install two such cards and leave a gap between them in 10 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.230
 millimeters and this will provide additional air flow for 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.149
 cooling on board we have a gk104 graphics chip 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.350
 and 2 gigabytes of ddr5 standard memory with a frequency of 6000 8 megahertz and a memory bus with 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.820
 bandwidth 256 bit standard set of connectors which 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.079
 includes displayport hdmi move oh go view 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.420
 the video card has three profiles of work and the mass decided to name them. I could gaming 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.039
 mod and sound mod only unlike video as last generation where after 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.689
 profile changes had to reboot the system here you can do it online well 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.340
 that is, on a hot simpler, these buttons allow you to switch between 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.289
 video card operating modes by changing the frequencies you feel it slows down 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.359
 turn on gaming mod watch a movie turn on silent and so on probably 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.740
 if the cooling were similar, then these buttons would bring the difference in frequency 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.749
 rotation of coolers, but here it is not necessary about this in more detail later on the system 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:47.270
 cooling called twin frozr 4 represented by two 10 millimeter 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.029
 fans and propeller blades and radiator 

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:57.649
 on 4 heat pipes all this ensures the proper level 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.789
 which did not give coolness under full load for several hours 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.849
 temperature rise above 80 degrees Celsius 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:10.780
 at the same time, the show didn’t hear the noise, and it didn’t hear the processor on the waka 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.560
 let's move on to performance just for a moment linger because I forgot 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.370
 mention that the video card is additionally powered by connecting two 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.290
 additional 8 + 6 pin connectors since the recently released total war 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.060
 Rome rumored that eats a lot of resources, we decided to check it out and so 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.760
 Meet the benchmark number 1 fresh and Nemer zhruschy total war what to say 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.240
 the card copes at high settings the truth starts to crash into 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.890
 battle mode when approaching on a common map, the problem is not detected at all here 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.490
 although much can be attributed to poor optimization as judging because 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.110
 write on the forums lags on many and on faster video cards promised 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.370
 we never saw the various faces of the soldiers even when we set the maximum, but this is not 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.740
 the main thing is that you can play and you can play quite comfortably second 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.150
 the game decided to take the edge of sestrey for one thing and see who the dad here can 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
 be a 7 series handle it better than the past 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.570
 here 760 we were pleasantly surprised shows 30 frames with light about dating on 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.810
 maximum settings of course if you consider that this 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.120
 multiplayer first person shooter 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.590
 even though few people play multiplayer, I would like more, but for this 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.430
 settings will have to be reduced, but for a single player this is more than 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.959
 there is also enough in the shareware war thunder mode 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.950
 the movie in which the description of the play is generally not recommended only videos 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.190
 browse here and see m honestly it is not clear why the developers 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.050
 wrote it but see for yourself that at high altitude when you see the whole field 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.680
 the battlefield which is low when you have to cope with accurate drawing 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.510
 we didn’t see the terrain and equipment below 60 fps even though 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.630
 recorded the video and in general it looks cool about this video card 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.700
 so it is not really bought and forgotten, but many modern games will work 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.510
 excellent, even more than excellent, although I think the next game 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.640
 generations should work fine as regards specifically this model 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.980
 The results are such that one of the quietest systems is installed on this card. 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.950
 the cooling of the ones on the market is affordable and does not work well 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.430
 have checked 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.349
 example 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:59.990
 By the way there are rumors that maybe in half a year old gta 5 and on the computer will be released
