00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.870
 pike perch today talk about the new 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.540
 y es war arena mode in particular from 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.770
 cardio polar base 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.800
 March update you are rude see 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.170
 new innovative modes arena arena 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.570
 mod is the implementation of moba games in the crossfire 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.949
 At first glance, the mode is very similar to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.230
 popular game dota 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.000
 in essence, the mode is of itself 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.890
 confrontation of two teams from the side 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.369
 which players are so 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.800
 bots 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.090
 and I am in small quantities of major 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.360
 tasks and both teams from destroying 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.829
 enemy base 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.739
 it would seem but prayed upon you by the mob and 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.539
 destroyed but it was not on the map 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.399
 there is a tower that will not miss 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.489
 base until you have them 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.230
 destroy towers pretty much a lot hp 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.050
 so you should get support 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.699
 right of the year in quiet under bullets and and bye 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 towers try to destroy the brave 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.039
 irritate the heroes from the corner 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.229
 one with the other both automatic at each 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.350
 teams there are three types of barge not small 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.330
 the average mostly natural they 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.759
 different level of damage, etc. 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.079
 but the latter can not shoot 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.079
 Before the game in the hall, each player must 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.850
 choose a map specialization mode would 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.549
 not so interesting if it was not 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.259
 cards or simply put class 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.750
 as in principle any game could 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:30.429
 can be divided into 3 groups is Saporta 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.959
 led support tanks damager by mine 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.709
 Observed most players play 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.219
 for the dealers 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:38.079
 what 's the point of the cards they add 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.420
 directly into the game only mode 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.899
 arena perks which corresponds to three 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.030
 groups 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.770
 for example about the dealers there is a hunter which 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.329
 can periodically use a shot 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.969
 blasted it wearing a lot of damage 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.340
 foxy opponent in support throwing 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.969
 treating grenades granite has a shield 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.979
 which is hard to break through simply 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.219
 class and diversifies the gameplay making it 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.229
 more flexible and enticing besides all 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.709
 interesting maps also can be improved 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.689
 at the moment there are two cards 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.030
 available for play this is a sandstorm and 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.680
 dust one base card for this mode 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.440
 worked out very well 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.849
 first of all she's a voice acting 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.769
 starting from what the bots 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.170
 conversing telling seen in 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.269
 opponents and hail cool music under 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.130
 which is very fun to play me 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.560
 pleased that the developers strongly 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.090
 tried over the cards for example in 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.400
 different games you can see that with her 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.239
 the whale even in enclosed spaces right there 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.239
 there is no snow under the roofs 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.439
 the game has graphics picks 5 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.989
 values on the last game looks 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.280
 very beautiful but as you know beauty 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.109
 requires sacrifice 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.209
 weak computers play high 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.700
 graphics settings will be difficult since 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.590
 now match for this is the first 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.019
 value in school graphic effects 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.819
 boils on this setting climb 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.840
 disappears any nishtyaki lied adjacent 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.959
 interactive storm 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.760
 or distance drawing at low 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.409
 settings you may not notice the helicopter 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.200
 bearing mortar or scientific station 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.849
 your box periodically on the card 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.189
 helicopter arrives and which let 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.379
 boxes to get the effect of these 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.840
 boxes need to go to them below 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.310
 a flat grip will appear when a grip 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.519
 will pass fully affect will begin 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.260
 act in the case of a mortar 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.939
 A strange mortar will appear 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.310
 shoot at the enemies of the thieves' tower 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.290
 mounted shots in the case of scientific 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.030
 station team is given a bonus 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.760
 increasing chances of surviving war 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.650
 capture box lasts a long time but you can 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.759
 speed this process out of grab 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.560
 box board not one but two or three players 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:40.780
 as it was possible to understand both bonus 1 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.110
 the teams therefore play around 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.210
 war is not a joke 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.190
 I would like to say separately about the bots 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.990
 that's done relatively well 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.700
 however, they are mainly used as 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.400
 cannon fodder that will tear 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.200
 Do release ahead and die but 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.760
 developers have taught bot to fight 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.620
 hand to hand if the enemy approached too 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.440
 close 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.760
 that's the way do not appear from the air 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.680
 a helicopter arrives dropping them off 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.940
 cards on the ropes and from there does not start 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.200
 their activities on the card are present 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.180
 two objects with which you can 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.459
 interact this machine gun anxiety 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.620
 to protect your base by the way he has 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.870
 endless ammunition and strained rope 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.350
 which leads respawn almost to the center 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.419
 cards 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.840
 this allows not to waste time on the race 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.180
 A piece will feed the child beyond that 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.440
 the towers which by the way the inability is very 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.130
 slowly heal characters 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.130
 skid and ammo boxes as you could 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.780
 understand the map is much higher 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.120
 as the game has bombardments 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.100
 fighters territory in which 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.320
 the view of Berkan's belt, the enemy did not drink 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.450
 a bunch of bots is an opportunity 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.060
 activated when a team destroys 40 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.860
 Prague bots after accumulating this 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.540
 numbers for about seconds to open 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.000
 opportunity to deliver a point blow to 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.650
 specified terrain player with all 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.510
 players can simultaneously use 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.190
 this amount 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.060
 after using counters 0 qi and all 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.060
 goes in circles 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.370
 gameplay in this mode is standard for 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.100
 mumbai r every team sendki bots u 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.030
 him the bots players are destroying the tower game 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.150
 gains experience 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.460
 due to level with increasing level 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.090
 increased cartridge belt level 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.440
 at home on bots the same thing happens 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.870
 the main goal as I said it 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.550
 destruction of the main enemy base but 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.030
 before that we need to destroy the defensive 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.280
 towers 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.229
 make it pretty difficult 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.120
 take into account that the tower itself scolds nehilo so 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.850
 also bots with players support them 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.860
 all of 3 types of towers tinting average 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.780
 main tower 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.280
 the first tower takes 70 percent of the cards 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.889
 and they have to be destroyed to 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.320
 get close to the middle towers those already your 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.970
 turn to protect the main after 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.039
 the destruction of the middle tower is open 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.789
 the main pass is essentially to draw out the match already 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.650
 at this stage it is impossible but not to bring 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.810
 match up to that state every player 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.090
 must clearly know his task to perform 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.760
 and help comrades simply speaking 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.160
 act out thinkway is perfect here if you 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.039
 play with clan team and communication so you 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.780
 will be almost invincible 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.330
 effective tactics are pressure on one 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.210
 side conventionally the card can be divided into 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.889
 three parts this center is right and left choosing 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.990
 one side needs to be actively destroyed 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.460
 the tower is on this side and not to run 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.400
 from side to side to waste 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.139
 time do not forget that the choice of cards 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.710
 the player before the match directly affect 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.450
 Exodus 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.460
 however, there is a small mode 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.780
 the lack of one hall is almost always 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.460
 people gather with the same 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.599
 specialties that practically kills 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.210
 wicked game play a 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:38.820
 the basis of the hill selects a map of the volcano then 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.240
 when you suppress the mester so nobody you 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.020
 not cure difficult 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.700
 But how can he speak? 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.320
 the entire enemy base we notice by 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.900
 icon victory in the center of the screen and by 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.640
 cool music that we won at 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.470
 viewing statistics he will have a chance to remove 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.420
 one anal gift this stones and 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.640
 additional cards that can 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.200
 receive existing or bonus 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.810
 for example when destroying towers is given 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:07.300
 ten percent more experience and quite a few 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:09.940
 amount of experience points mode turned out 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.710
 worthy of colorful innovative he 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.180
 diversified the playplay finally 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.930
 there were all sorts of interesting things 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.400
 sort of improving with her 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.750
 You can not knock that this mode 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.090
 can go to one of the available on 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.040
 clan server if this happens here 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.360
 really cool since this event 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.330
 will open the gates to create new 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.860
 tournaments and competitions 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.210
 Thank you all for watching with you 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.960
 antiques hope you enjoyed the video 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.960
 see you
