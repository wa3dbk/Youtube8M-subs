00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
turn out I get the crib and I'm not sure

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.310 
turn out I get the crib and I'm not sure
if<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.210> would<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.539> broken<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.080> sub

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
if that would have broken the sub

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.009 
if that would have broken the sub
otherwise<00:00:28.710> because<00:00:29.250> he<00:00:29.429> does<00:00:29.670> resist<00:00:30.150> bug<00:00:30.420> but

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
otherwise because he does resist bug but

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.659 
otherwise because he does resist bug but
nin<00:00:31.199> jessica<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.619> pretty<00:00:31.859> frail<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.520> am

nin jessica is pretty frail and I am

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.400 
nin jessica is pretty frail and I am
running<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.000> choice<00:00:33.180> band<00:00:33.510> house<00:00:33.690> elf<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.200> I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
running a choice band house elf as I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.680 
running a choice band house elf as I
said<00:00:34.469> before<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.120> go<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> gangor

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
said before so I'm going to go to gangor

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.410 
said before so I'm going to go to gangor
because<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.170> resists<00:00:37.680> x-scissor<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.329> in

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
because it resists x-scissor so just in

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.209 
because it resists x-scissor so just in
case<00:00:39.540> he<00:00:39.690> decides<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.140> attack<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.770> won't<00:00:40.980> die

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
case he decides to attack I won't die

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.459 
case he decides to attack I won't die
because<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.989> don't<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.260> anything

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
because I really don't have anything

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.410 
because I really don't have anything
else<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.829> deal<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> hard

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
else to deal with it it's kind of hard

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.299 
else to deal with it it's kind of hard
for<00:00:45.480> offensive<00:00:46.230> teams<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.100> fight

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
for offensive teams like this to fight

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.490 
for offensive teams like this to fight
baton<00:00:47.670> pass<00:00:47.940> because<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.809> basically<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
baton pass because you basically have to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
baton pass because you basically have to
keep<00:00:49.710> attacking<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.610> make<00:00:50.879> sure<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.270> take

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
keep attacking and make sure you take

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420 
keep attacking and make sure you take
out<00:00:51.660> ninjask<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.530> he<00:00:52.620> can't<00:00:52.829> baton<00:00:53.190> pass

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
out ninjask so he can't baton pass

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.670 
out ninjask so he can't baton pass
anymore<00:00:53.730> stat<00:00:54.449> boosts<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.289> his<00:00:55.469> other

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
anymore stat boosts to his other

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.549 
anymore stat boosts to his other
sweepers<00:00:56.360> because<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:58.079> don't<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.440> any

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
sweepers because I really don't have any

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.860 
sweepers because I really don't have any
phasers<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.399> an<00:00:59.760> offensive<00:01:00.359> team<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
phasers on an offensive team like this

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
phasers on an offensive team like this
so<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.590> kind<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.800> hard<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> deal<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so it's kind of hard to deal with it and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.690 
so it's kind of hard to deal with it and
I<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.170> keep<00:01:04.589> shadow<00:01:04.949> using<00:01:05.430> shadow

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I was going to keep shadow using shadow

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
I was going to keep shadow using shadow
ball<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.780> get<00:01:06.900> his<00:01:07.020> ninjask<00:01:07.409> down<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
ball just to get his ninjask down to a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.740 
ball just to get his ninjask down to a
pretty<00:01:08.130> low<00:01:08.310> health<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.240> really<00:01:09.600> wasn't

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
pretty low health and I really wasn't

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.090 
pretty low health and I really wasn't
expecting<00:01:09.869> him<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> switch<00:01:10.650> out<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
expecting him to switch out at that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
expecting him to switch out at that
point<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.549> thought<00:01:11.970> he<00:01:12.090> might<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.390> been

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
point I thought he might have been

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
point I thought he might have been
trying<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.590> another<00:01:13.710> sub<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> was

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
trying to go for another sub so I was

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.999 
trying to go for another sub so I was
going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.659> use<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> different<00:01:16.590> attack<00:01:16.830> on

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
going to just use a different attack on

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.980 
going to just use a different attack on
the<00:01:17.100> switch<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:18.000> instead<00:01:18.299> he<00:01:18.479> decides<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the switch but instead he decides to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.469 
the switch but instead he decides to
baton<00:01:19.439> pass<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:20.009> when<00:01:20.430> he<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:21.030> half

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
baton pass out when he was at half

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.719 
baton pass out when he was at half
health<00:01:21.720> which<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.369> uncommon

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
health which is a kind of uncommon

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
health which is a kind of uncommon
actually<00:01:24.240> most<00:01:24.689> people<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:25.229> their<00:01:25.380> ninjask

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
actually most people get their ninjask

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.280 
actually most people get their ninjask
to<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.130> low<00:01:26.369> health<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.759> possible<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.259> can

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
to as low health as possible so they can

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.980 
to as low health as possible so they can
get<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.460> many<00:01:29.640> stat<00:01:29.939> boost<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.360> with<00:01:30.540> speed<00:01:30.810> as

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
get as many stat boost in with speed as

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.469 
get as many stat boost in with speed as
they<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.640> guess<00:01:32.970> he<00:01:33.119> was<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.270> trying

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
they can but I guess he was just trying

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.359 
they can but I guess he was just trying

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
to save it for later maybe so anyway I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.100 
to save it for later maybe so anyway I
went<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.700> kingdra<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.750> really<00:01:36.960> don't

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
went to kingdra because I really don't

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
didn't want to go to him directly just

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.730 
didn't want to go to him directly just
in<00:01:51.630> case<00:01:51.780> he<00:01:51.960> predicted<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.530> an<00:01:52.619> earthquake

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
in case he predicted with an earthquake

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.800 
in case he predicted with an earthquake
and<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> shoe<00:01:54.329> kabiri<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and I do have the shoe kabiri and I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.330 
and I do have the shoe kabiri and I
didn't<00:01:55.079> want<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> waste<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.649> because<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.219> was

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
didn't want to waste that because I was

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.190 
didn't want to waste that because I was
trying<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.579> get<00:01:57.119> off<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> fire<00:01:57.540> blast<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
trying to get off a fire blast and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.490 
trying to get off a fire blast and
instead<00:01:59.100> he<00:01:59.520> actually<00:01:59.990> chaos<00:02:00.990> me<00:02:01.170> through<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
instead he actually chaos me through the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.929 
instead he actually chaos me through the
shoe<00:02:01.680> co<00:02:01.829> which<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.670> wasn't<00:02:02.820> expecting

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
shoe co which I really wasn't expecting

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.480 
shoe co which I really wasn't expecting
at<00:02:03.420> all<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.200> guess<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.469> has<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.340> a

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
at all so I guess that has to be in a

at all so I guess that has to be in a
demands<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.479> wanted<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.960> check<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.649> I

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
demands but I just wanted to check so I

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.260 
demands but I just wanted to check so I
went<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.039> flygon<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.879> then<00:02:09.000> switch<00:02:09.239> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
went to flygon and then switch to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.360 
went to flygon and then switch to
jirachi<00:02:10.050> double<00:02:10.560> switched<00:02:10.770> actually<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
jirachi double switched actually on the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.890 
jirachi double switched actually on the
meteor<00:02:11.670> mash<00:02:11.959> because<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.080> was<00:02:13.110> expecting

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
meteor mash because I was expecting

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.869 
meteor mash because I was expecting
either<00:02:14.079> a<00:02:14.170> meteor<00:02:14.560> mash<00:02:14.739> or<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> nice<00:02:15.189> punch<00:02:15.519> and

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
either a meteor mash or a nice punch and

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.940 
either a meteor mash or a nice punch and
if<00:02:16.390> he<00:02:16.510> was<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> jolly<00:02:17.079> metagross<00:02:17.620> than<00:02:17.860> he

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
if he was a jolly metagross than he

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.559 
if he was a jolly metagross than he
would<00:02:18.069> have<00:02:18.129> out<00:02:18.400> speeded<00:02:18.849> flygon<00:02:19.329> in

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
would have out speeded flygon in

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.179 
would have out speeded flygon in
potentially<00:02:20.290> I've<00:02:20.409> taken<00:02:20.620> out<00:02:20.769> my<00:02:20.920> revenge

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
potentially I've taken out my revenge

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.550 
potentially I've taken out my revenge
killer<00:02:21.549> so<00:02:22.450> yeah<00:02:22.569> he<00:02:22.720> was<00:02:22.840> probably<00:02:23.019> adamant

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
killer so yeah he was probably adamant

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.979 
killer so yeah he was probably adamant
since<00:02:23.769> he<00:02:23.860> ko'd<00:02:24.159> through<00:02:24.459> he<00:02:25.000> trims<00:02:25.329> shuka

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
since he ko'd through he trims shuka

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.380 
since he ko'd through he trims shuka
berry<00:02:26.230> but<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:26.950> was<00:02:27.310> kind<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.730> being<00:02:27.849> paranoid<00:02:28.209> I

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.670 
berry but I was kind of being paranoid I
probably<00:02:28.599> should<00:02:28.870> have<00:02:28.900> run<00:02:29.170> some<00:02:29.349> damage

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
probably should have run some damage

probably should have run some damage
coughs<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.069> that<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:31.000> anyway<00:02:31.269> he<00:02:31.450> has<00:02:31.540> a

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
coughs on that so anyway he has a

as soon as I saw him wish I was pretty

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.199 
as soon as I saw him wish I was pretty
sure<00:02:45.340> he<00:02:45.459> was<00:02:45.489> going<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.700> try<00:02:45.849> to<00:02:45.909> switch

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
sure he was going to try to switch

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.509 
sure he was going to try to switch
Ninjask<00:02:46.870> back<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.829> he<00:02:47.859> could<00:02:48.099> get<00:02:48.250> some

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
Ninjask back in so he could get some

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.360 
Ninjask back in so he could get some
more<00:02:48.670> health<00:02:48.909> in<00:02:49.239> stat<00:02:49.750> boost<00:02:50.049> some<00:02:50.859> more<00:02:51.069> to

more health in stat boost some more to

more health in stat boost some more to

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
pass to his other sweepers so now he's

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.149 
pass to his other sweepers so now he's
going<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.430> go<00:02:54.579> to<00:02:54.609> his<00:02:55.150> porygon<00:02:55.599> z<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.290> i'm<00:02:56.950> not

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
going to go to his porygon z and i'm not

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.740 
going to go to his porygon z and i'm not
really<00:02:57.310> sure<00:02:57.400> what<00:02:57.639> all<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.849> porygon<00:02:58.090> z<00:02:58.150> sets

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
really sure what all the porygon z sets

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.990 
really sure what all the porygon z sets
are<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.590> i'm<00:02:59.680> pretty<00:02:59.829> sure<00:03:00.069> that<00:03:00.099> i<00:03:00.340> can<00:03:00.459> stand

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
are but i'm pretty sure that i can stand

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.520 
are but i'm pretty sure that i can stand
up<00:03:01.120> against<00:03:01.450> them<00:03:01.599> and<00:03:01.810> do<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.079> pretty<00:03:02.319> good<00:03:02.409> job

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
up against them and do a pretty good job

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.569 
up against them and do a pretty good job
so<00:03:03.780> anyway<00:03:04.780> he's<00:03:05.079> going<00:03:05.409> to<00:03:05.590> switch<00:03:05.980> out<00:03:06.250> and

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
so anyway he's going to switch out and

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.330 
so anyway he's going to switch out and
actually<00:03:06.970> go<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.389> a<00:03:07.599> Gliscor<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.470> was<00:03:09.040> thinking

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
actually go to a Gliscor I was thinking

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.949 
actually go to a Gliscor I was thinking
he<00:03:09.430> might<00:03:09.579> have<00:03:09.760> actually<00:03:09.909> gone<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.299> blissey

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
he might have actually gone to blissey

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.720 
he might have actually gone to blissey
actually<00:03:11.349> so<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.590> switched<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.099> a<00:03:12.159> self<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.700> I

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
actually so I switched to a self and I

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.550 
actually so I switched to a self and I
was<00:03:12.879> planning<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.180> explode<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:13.930> him<00:03:14.139> with<00:03:14.530> the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
was planning to explode on him with the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.830 
was planning to explode on him with the
double<00:03:14.950> switch<00:03:15.040> but<00:03:15.939> instead<00:03:16.120> he<00:03:16.209> sends<00:03:16.510> in

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
double switch but instead he sends in

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.379 
double switch but instead he sends in
the<00:03:17.079> gliscor<00:03:17.620> like<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:17.980> said<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.489> fortunately

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
the gliscor like I said and fortunately

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:20.939 
the gliscor like I said and fortunately
I<00:03:19.449> do<00:03:19.569> have<00:03:19.870> ice<00:03:20.079> punch<00:03:20.410> which<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.799> pretty

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
I do have ice punch which is pretty

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.189 
I do have ice punch which is pretty
useful<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.489> this<00:03:21.609> case<00:03:21.879> because<00:03:22.599> it<00:03:22.780> gets<00:03:23.019> that

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:23.199 
useful in this case because it gets that

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.979 
useful in this case because it gets that
pretty<00:03:23.470> unexpected<00:03:23.769> KO<00:03:24.340> on<00:03:24.669> gliscor<00:03:25.269> i<00:03:25.480> mean

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
pretty unexpected KO on gliscor i mean

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.629 
pretty unexpected KO on gliscor i mean
it<00:03:26.079> doesn't<00:03:26.349> quite<00:03:26.470> KO<00:03:26.799> which<00:03:27.129> was<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> little

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
it doesn't quite KO which was a little

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.490 
it doesn't quite KO which was a little
surprising<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.329> mean<00:03:28.569> it's<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.750> choice<00:03:28.930> man<00:03:29.199> ice

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
surprising I mean it's a choice man ice

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.830 
surprising I mean it's a choice man ice
punch<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.069> that's<00:03:30.190> 4x<00:03:30.760> effective<00:03:31.389> against

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
punch and that's 4x effective against

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.990 
punch and that's 4x effective against
gliscor<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.829> I've<00:03:33.099> definitely<00:03:33.280> seen<00:03:33.489> him<00:03:33.760> KO

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
gliscor and I've definitely seen him KO

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.789 
gliscor and I've definitely seen him KO
lee<00:03:34.269> dewyze<00:03:34.329> scores<00:03:34.840> before<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.440> I'm<00:03:35.739> not

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
lee dewyze scores before so I'm not

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.530 
lee dewyze scores before so I'm not
really<00:03:35.919> sure<00:03:36.129> if<00:03:36.250> this<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.459> a<00:03:36.819> lot<00:03:37.150> bulky<00:03:37.510> or

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
really sure if this is a lot bulky or

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.960 
really sure if this is a lot bulky or
anything<00:03:38.019> so<00:03:38.799> I<00:03:38.829> switched<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.190> gang<00:03:39.430> Gargan

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
anything so I switched to gang Gargan

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.149 
anything so I switched to gang Gargan
and<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.389> wasn't<00:03:40.659> really<00:03:40.750> expecting<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.530> knock

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
and I wasn't really expecting that knock

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.949 
and I wasn't really expecting that knock
off<00:03:42.370> there<00:03:42.639> which<00:03:42.909> gets<00:03:43.120> rid<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.299> my<00:03:43.449> life<00:03:43.659> orb

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
off there which gets rid of my life orb

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.869 
off there which gets rid of my life orb
and<00:03:44.349> that's<00:03:44.979> a<00:03:45.069> little<00:03:45.310> bit<00:03:45.430> annoying<00:03:45.699> but

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
and that's a little bit annoying but

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.670 
and that's a little bit annoying but
even<00:03:46.629> though<00:03:46.720> it's<00:03:46.870> super<00:03:47.109> effective<00:03:47.229> it

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
even though it's super effective it

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.020 
even though it's super effective it
doesn't<00:03:47.949> do<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.159> much<00:03:48.220> damage<00:03:48.370> because

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
doesn't do that much damage because

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.420 
doesn't do that much damage because
knock<00:03:50.019> off<00:03:50.229> is<00:03:50.409> kind<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.769> more<00:03:50.919> of<00:03:50.979> an<00:03:51.099> annoying

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
knock off is kind of more of an annoying

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.819 
knock off is kind of more of an annoying
attack<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:52.090> mean<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:52.930> doesn't<00:03:53.169> really<00:03:53.290> do<00:03:53.530> too

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
attack I mean it doesn't really do too

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.710 
attack I mean it doesn't really do too
much<00:03:54.010> other<00:03:54.430> than<00:03:54.549> get<00:03:54.940> rid<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.090> your<00:03:55.239> item<00:03:55.569> I

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
much other than get rid of your item I

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.420 
much other than get rid of your item I
mean<00:03:55.959> it's<00:03:56.079> really<00:03:56.199> low<00:03:56.440> on<00:03:56.560> health<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.040> a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
mean it's really low on health and a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.009 
mean it's really low on health and a
really<00:03:57.970> low<00:03:58.090> end<00:03:58.239> damage<00:03:58.389> output<00:03:58.750> and

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
really low end damage output and

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.920 
really low end damage output and
everything<00:03:59.909> no<00:04:00.909> sono<00:04:01.239> he<00:04:01.359> sends<00:04:01.599> in<00:04:01.659> to<00:04:01.750> Brie

everything no sono he sends in to Brie
Liam<00:04:02.199> and<00:04:02.349> I'm<00:04:02.650> not<00:04:02.769> really<00:04:02.919> sure<00:04:03.010> if<00:04:03.129> it's

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
Liam and I'm not really sure if it's

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.740 
Liam and I'm not really sure if it's
going<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.489> be<00:04:03.609> a<00:04:03.639> bulky<00:04:04.030> Bri<00:04:04.239> limb<00:04:04.419> and<00:04:04.629> I've

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
going to be a bulky Bri limb and I've

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.990 
going to be a bulky Bri limb and I've
lost<00:04:04.959> my<00:04:05.290> life<00:04:05.919> orb<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.489> wasn't<00:04:06.669> sure<00:04:06.879> if

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
lost my life orb so I wasn't sure if

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.180 
lost my life orb so I wasn't sure if
shadow<00:04:07.239> ball<00:04:07.419> was<00:04:07.569> going<00:04:07.659> to<00:04:07.780> KO<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.229> I<00:04:08.739> don't

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
shadow ball was going to KO and I don't

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.490 
shadow ball was going to KO and I don't
want<00:04:09.340> him<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.519> get<00:04:09.609> a<00:04:09.669> spore<00:04:10.090> off<00:04:10.269> at<00:04:10.479> any<00:04:10.599> cost

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
want him to get a spore off at any cost

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.379 
want him to get a spore off at any cost
so<00:04:12.340> I'm<00:04:12.459> just<00:04:12.609> going<00:04:12.729> to<00:04:12.790> go<00:04:13.150> for<00:04:13.359> that

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
so I'm just going to go for that

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.449 
so I'm just going to go for that
explosion<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.229> take<00:04:14.349> him<00:04:14.470> out<00:04:14.590> it's<00:04:15.340> my

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
explosion and take him out it's my

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.469 
explosion and take him out it's my
strongest<00:04:15.819> major<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.299> was<00:04:16.389> definitely

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
strongest major so it was definitely

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.569 
strongest major so it was definitely
sure<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:17.019> he<00:04:17.139> was<00:04:17.260> going<00:04:17.409> to<00:04:17.530> explode<00:04:17.739> or

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
sure that he was going to explode or

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.099 
sure that he was going to explode or
that<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.030> was<00:04:19.180> going<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.599> explode<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:19.989> be<00:04:20.049> able

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
that I was going to explode and be able

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.560 
that I was going to explode and be able
to<00:04:20.199> take<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.409> out<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.880> he<00:04:21.880> goes<00:04:22.029> to<00:04:22.060> blissey<00:04:22.479> as

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
to take it out and he goes to blissey as

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.269 
to take it out and he goes to blissey as
I<00:04:22.690> go<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:22.990> azo<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.710> now<00:04:23.889> i'm<00:04:23.950> going<00:04:24.130> to<00:04:24.190> do

00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:24.279 
I go to the azo and now i'm going to do

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.339 
I go to the azo and now i'm going to do
a<00:04:24.310> double<00:04:24.639> explosion<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.630> get<00:04:25.960> rid<00:04:26.139> of<00:04:26.169> his

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
a double explosion and get rid of his

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.300 
a double explosion and get rid of his
blissey<00:04:26.800> as<00:04:26.919> well

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
blissey as well

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.820 
blissey as well
so<00:04:27.880> yeah<00:04:28.030> this<00:04:28.360> is<00:04:28.540> a<00:04:28.570> really<00:04:29.080> offensive<00:04:29.470> team

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
so yeah this is a really offensive team

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.250 
so yeah this is a really offensive team
I<00:04:30.070> think<00:04:30.730> advocates<00:04:31.300> from<00:04:31.450> smogon<00:04:31.840> actually

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
I think advocates from smogon actually

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.470 
I think advocates from smogon actually
came<00:04:32.440> up<00:04:32.470> with<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.919> original<00:04:33.190> version<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:34.060> I

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
came up with the original version and I

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.360 
came up with the original version and I
just<00:04:34.660> tweaked<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.080> couple<00:04:35.350> of<00:04:35.440> things<00:04:35.680> but<00:04:36.130> i'm

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
just tweaked a couple of things but i'm

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.220 
just tweaked a couple of things but i'm
actually<00:04:36.520> not<00:04:36.700> liking<00:04:37.210> this<00:04:37.360> team<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:37.810> much

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
actually not liking this team that much

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.960 
actually not liking this team that much
because<00:04:38.410> i<00:04:38.590> think<00:04:38.860> it's<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.190> little<00:04:39.280> bit<00:04:39.430> too

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
because i think it's a little bit too

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.690 
because i think it's a little bit too
offensive<00:04:40.419> even<00:04:40.840> for<00:04:41.020> me<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:42.130> I<00:04:42.160> do<00:04:42.310> get<00:04:42.520> that

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
offensive even for me so I do get that

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.030 
offensive even for me so I do get that
crib<00:04:42.970> but<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.510> really<00:04:43.840> don't<00:04:44.020> need<00:04:44.139> it<00:04:44.320> it<00:04:44.800> would

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
crib but I really don't need it it would

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.650 
crib but I really don't need it it would
have<00:04:45.160> ko'd<00:04:45.460> even<00:04:45.730> without<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.150> choice<00:04:46.360> band

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
have ko'd even without the choice band

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.280 
have ko'd even without the choice band
because<00:04:47.020> explosion<00:04:47.770> halves<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.340> opponent's

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
because explosion halves the opponent's

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.560 
because explosion halves the opponent's
defenses<00:04:50.290> and<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.700> has<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.910> base<00:04:52.120> power<00:04:52.330> of<00:04:52.419> 2

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
defenses and it has a base power of 2

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.960 
defenses and it has a base power of 2
250<00:04:53.350> so<00:04:53.560> it's<00:04:53.710> basically<00:04:53.919> stronger<00:04:54.639> than<00:04:54.760> most

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
250 so it's basically stronger than most

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.659 
250 so it's basically stronger than most
super<00:04:55.510> effective<00:04:55.750> attacks<00:04:56.139> even<00:04:56.490> so<00:04:57.490> i'm

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
super effective attacks even so i'm

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.460 
super effective attacks even so i'm
going<00:04:57.880> to<00:04:58.000> send<00:04:58.270> in<00:04:58.389> the<00:04:58.480> jirachi<00:04:58.780> on<00:04:59.110> his

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
going to send in the jirachi on his

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.000 
going to send in the jirachi on his
porygon<00:05:00.250> z<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.940> get<00:05:01.570> off<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:01.900> psychic<00:05:02.470> he

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
porygon z and get off that psychic he

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.159 
porygon z and get off that psychic he
actually<00:05:03.160> out<00:05:03.520> speeded<00:05:03.970> me<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:04.360> got<00:05:04.840> in<00:05:04.990> the

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
actually out speeded me and got in the

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.409 
actually out speeded me and got in the
attack<00:05:05.440> first<00:05:05.740> so<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:06.490> assume<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:06.970> it<00:05:07.090> has<00:05:07.240> to

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
attack first so I assume that it has to

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.240 
attack first so I assume that it has to
be<00:05:07.540> a<00:05:07.570> choice<00:05:07.930> car<00:05:08.200> variant<00:05:08.620> so<00:05:08.979> I'm<00:05:09.040> going<00:05:09.100> to

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
be a choice car variant so I'm going to

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.219 
be a choice car variant so I'm going to
send<00:05:09.520> in<00:05:09.639> flag<00:05:09.910> on<00:05:10.120> on<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.419> Thunderbolts<00:05:11.080> and

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
send in flag on on the Thunderbolts and

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.080 
send in flag on on the Thunderbolts and
just<00:05:11.770> go<00:05:11.889> get<00:05:12.250> going<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.550> go<00:05:12.639> straight<00:05:12.940> for

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
just go get going to go straight for

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.870 
just go get going to go straight for
that<00:05:13.150> outraged<00:05:13.690> because<00:05:14.470> it's<00:05:14.979> carved<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:15.790> I

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
that outraged because it's carved and I

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.370 
that outraged because it's carved and I
don't<00:05:16.060> think<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:16.389> he<00:05:16.600> has<00:05:16.690> anything<00:05:16.960> left<00:05:17.110> to

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
don't think that he has anything left to

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.710 
don't think that he has anything left to
resist<00:05:17.800> outrage<00:05:18.250> so<00:05:18.729> I<00:05:18.760> should<00:05:19.300> be<00:05:19.330> able<00:05:19.450> to

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
resist outrage so I should be able to

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.740 
resist outrage so I should be able to
clean<00:05:19.930> up<00:05:20.050> this<00:05:20.169> match<00:05:20.440> with<00:05:20.860> flygon<00:05:21.820> so<00:05:22.450> good

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
clean up this match with flygon so good

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.930 
clean up this match with flygon so good
game
