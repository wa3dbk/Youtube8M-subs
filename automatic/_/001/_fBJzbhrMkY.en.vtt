00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
show you how I solved my removing of the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.130 
show you how I solved my removing of the
bearings<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:12.500> Mavic<00:00:13.500> SLR<00:00:15.890> wheels<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.250> hubs

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
bearings in my Mavic SLR wheels and hubs

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.410 
bearings in my Mavic SLR wheels and hubs
so<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:20.869> tried<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.990> google<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.380> but<00:00:23.090> there<00:00:24.090> was<00:00:24.240> no

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
so I tried to google it but there was no

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.259 
so I tried to google it but there was no
results<00:00:25.140> showing<00:00:25.650> if<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.609> even<00:00:26.880> would<00:00:27.119> be

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
results showing if it even would be

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.300 
results showing if it even would be
possible<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.900> remove<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.500> bearings<00:00:28.890> from

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
possible to remove the bearings from

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.490 
possible to remove the bearings from
from<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.060> freehub<00:00:30.869> body<00:00:31.520> so<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.989> make

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
from the freehub body so just to make

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.889 
from the freehub body so just to make
sure<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.219> had<00:00:35.430> some<00:00:35.700> some<00:00:36.120> good<00:00:36.300> stuff<00:00:36.570> so

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
sure that I had some some good stuff so

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.200 
sure that I had some some good stuff so
I<00:00:37.140> bought<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> new<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:39.680> but<00:00:40.680> also<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.820> eBay

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
I bought a new one but also on eBay

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.889 
I bought a new one but also on eBay
bought<00:00:42.600> new<00:00:42.840> ceramic<00:00:43.760> ceramic<00:00:44.760> ball<00:00:45.239> bearings

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
bought new ceramic ceramic ball bearings

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.069 
bought new ceramic ceramic ball bearings
so<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> thought<00:00:47.030> that<00:00:48.030> let's<00:00:48.300> try<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> remove

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
so I thought that let's try to remove

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.630 
so I thought that let's try to remove
them<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.710> possible<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:50.820> possible

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
them if it's possible and it's possible

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.860 
them if it's possible and it's possible
so<00:00:53.809> what<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.840> did<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.690> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
so what I did was that I you have you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.049 
so what I did was that I you have you
have<00:00:58.050> two<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.739> these<00:00:58.859> bearings<00:00:59.930> with<00:01:00.930> this

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
have two of these bearings with this

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.640 
have two of these bearings with this
piece<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.300> between<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.070> I<00:01:05.070> cried<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.240> vise

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
piece in between and I cried in a vise

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.850 
piece in between and I cried in a vise
with<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> these<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:09.630> push<00:01:09.930> both<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.680> them

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
with one of these to push both of them

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.080 
with one of these to push both of them
out<00:01:11.310> from<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.360> side<00:01:12.920> because<00:01:13.920> they<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.220> both

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
out from this side because they are both

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.510 
out from this side because they are both
coming<00:01:15.450> from<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.170> side<00:01:17.240> one<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.220> this<00:01:20.220> one

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
coming from this side one and this one

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.130 
coming from this side one and this one
and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.600> second<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.780> no<00:01:24.780> matter<00:01:24.990> how

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and then the second one so no matter how

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.710 
and then the second one so no matter how
hard<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.860> tried<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> vise<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:27.000> couldn't

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
hard I tried in the vise I couldn't

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.990 
hard I tried in the vise I couldn't
remove<00:01:27.990> both<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.470> them<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.220> same<00:01:29.400> time<00:01:29.460> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
remove both of them at the same time I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630 
remove both of them at the same time I
was<00:01:30.689> afraid<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.290> was<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> break<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
was afraid I was going to break the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.749 
was afraid I was going to break the
whole<00:01:32.670> free<00:01:33.119> hub<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:35.579> had<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:37.340> take<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
whole free hub so I had to take the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.109 
whole free hub so I had to take the
first<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.210> out<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:40.680> one<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.070> sits<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.490> here

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.440 

with<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> hammer<00:01:45.710> with<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> hammer<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:48.000> chisel

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
with a hammer with a hammer and a chisel

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.649 
with a hammer with a hammer and a chisel
and<00:01:49.970> what<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.920> since<00:01:53.479> this<00:01:54.479> is

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
and what you do is that since this is

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.850 
and what you do is that since this is
going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.140> flush<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.680> put<00:01:58.680> your

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
going to be flush you have to put your

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.630 
going to be flush you have to put your
PIN<00:01:59.009> inside<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.759> push<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:01.640> when

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
PIN inside and push it like this when

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.310 
PIN inside and push it like this when
it's<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> sits<00:02:03.360> inside<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it's when it sits inside if we have and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.589 
it's when it sits inside if we have and
then<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.040> will<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:06.860> something<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.729> to

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
then you will have something to to to

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.589 
then you will have something to to to
hammer<00:02:09.869> against<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.489> push<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.180> you

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
hammer against so we push this and you

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.800 
hammer against so we push this and you
hammer<00:02:12.780> bit<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.349> side

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
hammer bit on this side

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.460 
hammer bit on this side
you<00:02:14.440> push<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.709> over<00:02:15.099> at<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.400> side<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.970> and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
you push it over at that side and and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.220 
you push it over at that side and and
and<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.620> way<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:18.040> goes

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
and the way it goes

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.890 
and the way it goes
sooner<00:02:20.230> or<00:02:20.260> later<00:02:20.319> come<00:02:21.160> out<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:24.459> after<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.420> had

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
sooner or later come out so after I had

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.410 
sooner or later come out so after I had
that<00:02:26.110> one<00:02:26.260> out<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:27.190> one<00:02:27.430> out<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:30.420> in

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
that one out and this one out I in

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.820 
that one out and this one out I in
advice<00:02:31.720> was<00:02:32.319> able<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:33.010> push<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.790> one<00:02:34.000> out<00:02:34.830> as

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
advice was able to push this one out as

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.120 
advice was able to push this one out as
it<00:02:36.010> sits<00:02:36.250> there<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.690> put<00:02:37.930> this<00:02:38.050> one<00:02:38.110> inside<00:02:38.650> and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
it sits there we put this one inside and

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.210 
it sits there we put this one inside and
you<00:02:39.400> can<00:02:40.120> use<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.720> vise<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.860> have<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.130> be

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
you can use a vise you have to be

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.250 
you can use a vise you have to be
careful<00:02:42.580> with<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.760> freehub<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.480> piece<00:02:44.110> of

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
careful with the freehub so piece of

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.240 
careful with the freehub so piece of
wood<00:02:45.180> as<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.239> backing<00:02:46.690> for<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.290> freehub<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.270 

that's<00:02:51.250> pretty<00:02:51.459> much<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.700> then<00:02:53.280> although

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
that's pretty much it then although

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.030 
that's pretty much it then although
they're<00:02:55.000> quite<00:02:55.269> old<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:56.530> have<00:02:56.680> been<00:02:56.860> using

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
they're quite old and I have been using

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.650 
they're quite old and I have been using
quite<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.790> bit<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:58.060> force<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.390> get<00:02:58.599> them<00:02:58.780> out

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
quite a bit of force to get them out

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.199 
quite a bit of force to get them out
after<00:03:01.660> some<00:03:01.840> cleaning<00:03:02.319> day<00:03:02.470> they<00:03:02.739> feel<00:03:02.920> good

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
after some cleaning day they feel good

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.089 
after some cleaning day they feel good
but<00:03:04.209> anyway<00:03:04.510> I'm<00:03:04.900> going<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.230> put<00:03:05.410> my<00:03:05.590> ceramic

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
but anyway I'm going to put my ceramic

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.380 
but anyway I'm going to put my ceramic
ball<00:03:06.310> bearings<00:03:06.849> in<00:03:07.299> and<00:03:07.900> use<00:03:08.530> my<00:03:08.560> old<00:03:08.890> one

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
ball bearings in and use my old one

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.120 
ball bearings in and use my old one
let's<00:03:10.390> save<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.750> new<00:03:11.019> one<00:03:11.200> for<00:03:11.500> later

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
let's save the new one for later

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.789 
let's save the new one for later
so<00:03:12.819> what<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.540> will<00:03:13.780> do<00:03:13.959> what<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.590> have<00:03:14.680> done

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
so what I will do what I have done

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.589 
so what I will do what I have done
already<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.400> put<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.849> noose<00:03:16.030> around<00:03:16.239> ball

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
already is put the noose around ball

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.990 
already is put the noose around ball
bearings<00:03:17.080> in<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.410> freezer<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:18.670> make<00:03:18.820> them

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
bearings in the freezer to make them

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.380 
bearings in the freezer to make them
easier<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.590> push<00:03:20.590> inside<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:21.910> one<00:03:22.150> I

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
easier to push inside and this one I

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.830 
easier to push inside and this one I
will<00:03:22.690> heat<00:03:23.320> up<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.980> hot<00:03:24.370> air<00:03:24.579> gun<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:25.480> make<00:03:25.630> it

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
will heat up the hot air gun to make it

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.280 
will heat up the hot air gun to make it
larger<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:28.150> then<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.480> use<00:03:28.720> some<00:03:29.069> some<00:03:30.069> really

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
larger and then I use some some really

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:42.690 
larger and then I use some some really
sticky<00:03:34.769> Schramm's<00:03:35.769> P<00:03:36.780> p.m.<00:03:37.780> 600<00:03:38.500> grease<00:03:41.549> as<00:03:42.549> a

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
sticky Schramm's P p.m. 600 grease as a

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.650 
sticky Schramm's P p.m. 600 grease as a
base<00:03:42.910> for<00:03:43.900> four<00:03:44.739> for<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.040> bearings<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.579> sit<00:03:46.120> in

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.390 

and<00:03:49.660> wait<00:03:49.870> it's<00:03:50.200> possible<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.950> can<00:03:51.100> be<00:03:51.250> done

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
and wait it's possible it can be done

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.509 
and wait it's possible it can be done
have<00:03:51.760> done<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.120> with<00:03:52.389> really<00:03:52.840> simple<00:03:53.200> tools

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
have done it with really simple tools

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.359 
have done it with really simple tools
thank<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:54.609> guys<00:03:54.760> bye<00:03:55.209> bye
