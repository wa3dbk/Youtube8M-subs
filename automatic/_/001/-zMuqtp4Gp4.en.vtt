00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:08.139 
yeah check the balance on this thing

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.450 
yeah check the balance on this thing
it's<00:00:09.139> going<00:00:09.290> to<00:00:09.350> take<00:00:09.530> half<00:00:09.860> an<00:00:10.040> ounce<00:00:10.190> of

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
it's going to take half an ounce of

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.359 
it's going to take half an ounce of
weight<00:00:10.700> so<00:00:11.480> I<00:00:11.540> get<00:00:11.750> my<00:00:12.370> lead<00:00:13.370> weights<00:00:13.670> here

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:15.369 
weight so I get my lead weights here

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.470 
weight so I get my lead weights here
take<00:00:16.369> half<00:00:16.640> an<00:00:16.820> ounce<00:00:17.000> and<00:00:17.330> wait<00:00:17.800> and<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:18.950> tail

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
take half an ounce and wait and the tail

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.750 
take half an ounce and wait and the tail
to<00:00:20.859> balance<00:00:21.859> this<00:00:22.039> thing<00:00:22.100> out<00:00:23.619> which<00:00:24.619> is<00:00:24.949> quite

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
to balance this thing out which is quite

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.349 
to balance this thing out which is quite
a<00:00:25.789> bit<00:00:26.000> in<00:00:26.090> my<00:00:26.150> book<00:00:26.510> for<00:00:26.779> plane<00:00:27.410> like<00:00:27.680> this

with scissors and I'll fill it in with
the<00:01:16.010> balsa<00:01:16.460> first<00:01:16.760> just<00:01:17.570> like<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:17.840> wing<00:01:18.020> it's

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
the balsa first just like the wing it's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.170 
the balsa first just like the wing it's
counting<00:01:18.590> on<00:01:19.210> some<00:01:20.210> Trillian<00:01:20.750> boat<00:01:20.960> halfway

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
counting on some Trillian boat halfway

counting on some Trillian boat halfway
eighths<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.330> an<00:01:23.450> inch<00:01:23.570> there<00:01:23.900> anyway<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:29.409> cap

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
eighths of an inch there anyway and cap

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.370 
eighths of an inch there anyway and cap
it<00:01:30.439> with<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.830> boss<00:01:31.009> of<00:01:31.340> sanded<00:01:31.759> flush<00:01:32.380> and

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
it with the boss of sanded flush and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.649 
it with the boss of sanded flush and
then<00:01:33.500> I'm<00:01:33.650> going<00:01:33.799> to<00:01:33.860> put<00:01:34.040> a<00:01:34.070> piece<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.659> that

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
then I'm going to put a piece of that

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.789 
then I'm going to put a piece of that
ply<00:01:35.990> over<00:01:36.439> there<00:01:36.619> just<00:01:36.829> to<00:01:36.979> beef<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:37.790> up<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:38.090> bit

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
ply over there just to beef it up a bit

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.380 
ply over there just to beef it up a bit
it's<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.860> little<00:01:39.890> more<00:01:40.220> weight<00:01:40.460> but<00:01:40.670> then<00:01:40.880> again

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
it's a little more weight but then again

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.120 
it's a little more weight but then again
I<00:01:41.810> tail<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.890> airplane<00:01:44.320> before<00:01:45.320> she<00:01:45.680> needs<00:01:45.920> it

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
I tail the airplane before she needs it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.940 
I tail the airplane before she needs it
the<00:01:46.579> other<00:01:46.700> thing<00:01:46.759> is<00:01:47.090> when<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:47.810> paint<00:01:48.740> it

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
the other thing is when you paint it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.030 
the other thing is when you paint it
it's<00:01:49.670> going<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.090> add<00:01:50.869> more<00:01:51.259> weight<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.860> a

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
it's going to add more weight to the a

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.770 
it's going to add more weight to the a
part<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.880> airplane<00:01:53.299> as<00:01:53.479> well<00:01:53.979> but<00:01:55.780> what

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
part of the airplane as well but what

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.359 
part of the airplane as well but what
I'm<00:01:56.869> doing<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.409> I'm<00:01:58.659> adjusting<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.990> CG<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:01.250> the

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
I'm doing is I'm adjusting the CG to the

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.539 
I'm doing is I'm adjusting the CG to the
forward<00:02:01.820> recommended<00:02:03.430> mountain<00:02:04.430> which<00:02:04.520> is

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
forward recommended mountain which is

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.490 
forward recommended mountain which is
about<00:02:04.729> three<00:02:05.270> quarters<00:02:05.299> of<00:02:05.689> an<00:02:05.780> inch<00:02:05.869> behind

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
about three quarters of an inch behind

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.949 
about three quarters of an inch behind
the<00:02:06.799> leading<00:02:07.009> edge<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.640> an<00:02:07.759> inch<00:02:07.969> and<00:02:08.179> 3/4<00:02:08.750> you

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
the leading edge to an inch and 3/4 you

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.100 
the leading edge to an inch and 3/4 you
can<00:02:09.110> believe<00:02:09.259> that

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
can believe that

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.020 
can believe that
so<00:02:12.110> if<00:02:12.320> I<00:02:13.030> balanced<00:02:14.030> it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
so if I balanced it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.610 
so if I balanced it
to<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.140> forward<00:02:17.470> CG<00:02:18.390> recommended<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:20.380> way

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
to the forward CG recommended that way

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.160 
to the forward CG recommended that way
as<00:02:21.010> they<00:02:21.220> had<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.330> dope<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.780> everything<00:02:23.050> to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
as they had the dope and everything to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.850 
as they had the dope and everything to
the<00:02:23.319> tail

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
the tail

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.050 
the tail
it<00:02:24.430> won't<00:02:24.700> go<00:02:24.910> beyond<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.480> after<00:02:27.060> hopefully

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
it won't go beyond the after hopefully

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.120 
it won't go beyond the after hopefully
it<00:02:28.150> be<00:02:28.240> somewhere<00:02:28.569> in<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.750> middle<00:02:29.130> lead

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
it be somewhere in the middle lead

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.120 
it be somewhere in the middle lead
weight<00:02:30.340> glued<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.260> still<00:02:32.970> put<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
weight glued in I still put the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.120 
weight glued in I still put the
sixteenth<00:02:36.130> inch<00:02:36.430> balsa<00:02:36.970> feller<00:02:37.830> maybe<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.010> go

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
sixteenth inch balsa feller maybe you go

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.610 
sixteenth inch balsa feller maybe you go
to<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.280> tents<00:02:39.730> actually<00:02:40.180> be<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.959> big<00:02:41.170> deal<00:02:41.380> to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
to a tents actually be a big deal to

that to tighten up against
and<00:04:24.510> all<00:04:24.600> its<00:04:24.750> doing<00:04:24.900> that's<00:04:25.200> just<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.500> guide<00:04:25.740> a

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
and all its doing that's just a guide a

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.380 
and all its doing that's just a guide a
screwy<00:04:28.830> pushrod<00:04:29.760> system

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
screwy pushrod system

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.660 
screwy pushrod system
hi<00:04:30.900> I'm<00:04:31.100> still<00:04:34.190> don't<00:04:35.190> know<00:04:35.250> what<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.490> make<00:04:35.520> of

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
hi I'm still don't know what to make of

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.660 
hi I'm still don't know what to make of
that

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
that

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:47.030 
that
so<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:43.680> tails<00:04:44.690> late<00:04:45.690> it<00:04:46.620> should<00:04:46.860> have<00:04:46.950> been

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
so the tails late it should have been

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.910 
so the tails late it should have been
longer<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.520> guess<00:04:48.800> but<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:50.040> big<00:04:50.220> thing<00:04:50.250> is<00:04:50.730> this

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
longer I guess but the big thing is this

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.150 
longer I guess but the big thing is this
this<00:04:52.920> knows<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.930> got<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:54.990> engine<00:04:55.530> I<00:04:55.770> was

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
this knows I got the engine I was

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.770 
this knows I got the engine I was
thinking<00:04:56.430> maybe<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.700> put<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.060> engine<00:04:57.330> too<00:04:57.510> far

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
thinking maybe I put the engine too far

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.180 
thinking maybe I put the engine too far
back<00:04:58.050> because<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.680> clearance<00:04:59.130> issues<00:04:59.520> here

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
back because of clearance issues here

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.850 
back because of clearance issues here
yeah<00:05:02.220> if<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:02.760> want<00:05:03.510> any<00:05:03.660> further<00:05:03.990> forward<00:05:04.650> I

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
yeah if I want any further forward I

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.520 
yeah if I want any further forward I
could<00:05:05.220> probably<00:05:05.430> go<00:05:05.640> on<00:05:05.670> eighths<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:06.060> an<00:05:06.180> inch

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
could probably go on eighths of an inch

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.440 
could probably go on eighths of an inch
forward<00:05:07.530> when<00:05:07.800> I<00:05:07.830> was<00:05:07.980> putting<00:05:08.220> it<00:05:08.340> together

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
forward when I was putting it together

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.450 
forward when I was putting it together
that's<00:05:09.450> going<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.750> make<00:05:09.900> my<00:05:10.110> tail<00:05:10.290> her<00:05:10.980> nose

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
that's going to make my tail her nose

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.150 
that's going to make my tail her nose
was<00:05:11.550> heavy<00:05:11.760> situation<00:05:12.480> even<00:05:12.630> worse<00:05:13.160> so

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
was heavy situation even worse so

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.760 
was heavy situation even worse so
knowing<00:05:15.060> now<00:05:17.060> doing<00:05:18.060> it<00:05:18.240> again<00:05:18.600> I'd<00:05:18.810> go<00:05:18.990> back

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
knowing now doing it again I'd go back

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.510 
knowing now doing it again I'd go back
quarter<00:05:20.340> of<00:05:20.430> an<00:05:20.520> inch<00:05:20.640> on<00:05:21.590> this<00:05:22.590> landing<00:05:23.310> gear

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
quarter of an inch on this landing gear

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.260 
quarter of an inch on this landing gear
once<00:05:24.120> that's<00:05:24.450> out<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:24.750> alike<00:05:25.200> and<00:05:26.270> go

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
once that's out and alike and go

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.710 
once that's out and alike and go
straight<00:05:27.600> up<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:27.960> down<00:05:28.050> like<00:05:28.290> he<00:05:28.410> did<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.720> you

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
straight up and down like he did and you

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
I'll do the filling and see what it

I'll do the filling and see what it
looks<00:06:42.010> like<00:06:42.190> and<00:06:43.800> next<00:06:44.800> part<00:06:45.040> of<00:06:45.070> the<00:06:45.160> video

looks like and next part of the video
should<00:06:46.630> be<00:06:47.730> doped<00:06:48.730> up<00:06:48.940> and<00:06:49.420> muffler<00:06:49.930> didn't

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
should be doped up and muffler didn't

should be doped up and muffler didn't
help<00:06:50.350> matters<00:06:50.560> any<00:06:50.920> for<00:06:51.220> the<00:06:51.340> weight<00:06:51.550> either

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
help matters any for the weight either

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.440

so<00:06:53.710> I<00:06:53.800> can<00:06:53.980> find<00:06:54.220> a<00:06:54.310> tongue<00:06:54.550> muffler<00:06:55.000> for<00:06:55.210> that

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
so I can find a tongue muffler for that

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.620 
so I can find a tongue muffler for that
little<00:06:56.410> later
