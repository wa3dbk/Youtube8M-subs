00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 it goes well with renault de clio and the 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.970
 crab number carry the dutch 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.010
 sell statistics 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.019
 in the recent metamorphosis of the espaces 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.179
 has also been received enthusiastically 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:20.430
 but this new career is not working 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:23.039
 so easily get the new renault 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.689
 is a so-called crossover 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.689
 in this case a cross between one 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.980
 station wagon and off-road vehicle 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.789
 you in different nowadays 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.560
 formats 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.600
 but the kadjar falls with a length of 4 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.600
 meter 45 in the outside category 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.540
 renault has to because the segment of the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.129
 compact SUVs 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.649
 just like this kind of car is 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.300
 called is fought hard 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.739
 all the little bits then help you 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.989
 stand out from the rest 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.250
 and in the case of the kadjar choose the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.250
 French for extra centimeters 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.399
 in the main competitor of the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.480
 Cat Yard is the Nissan Qashqai 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.590
 actually that's a bit one 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.000
 sham 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.010
 because renault and nissan have been working for some time 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.510
 closely together 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.250
 the similarities between both models 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.900
 are therefore greater than the differences 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.670
 however, those few differences can 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.960
 essential 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.090
 I already mentioned the larger ones 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.600
 dimensions of the kadjar but there are 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.600
 even more 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.560
 is the luggage space of the renault 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.119
 at least 42 liters larger than that of the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.360
 nissan 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.340
 you can also fold the front seat 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.409
 It is no difference the Qashqai offers the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.880
 possibility also the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.060
 possibility to store your suitcase 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 parts in various compartments 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.780
 in the back you have just like in the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.430
 nissan a lot of legroom 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.570
 main room falls through the glass roof 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.060
 rather against then there is the appearance 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.100
 of the renault here is a special one 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.930
 beautifully lined SUV 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.549
 and we should be proud of that but 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.250
 that line play comes from the hand of one 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.350
 dutch design there 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.329
 I will not have all the similarities between 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.909
 mention the qashqai and the kadjar 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.549
 but sign up for the renault 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.149
 most important and that is the extensive 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.530
 safety equipment 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.780
 just like in anything you have 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.340
 a lane assistant blind spot 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.280
 signaling and self-employed 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.349
 the renault rail system add there 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.900
 once LED headlights 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.680
 unique in this class, if you go for it 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.299
 choose the most expensive version 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.760
 the cardsharp comes first 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.170
 available with two diesel engines and one 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.730
 gasoline engine 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.719
 four-wheel drive belongs to the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.980
 opportunities 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.579
 but the default is the renault 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.579
 front-wheel drive 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.049
 the kadjar is such a typical holiday car 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.719
 it is wonderfully comfortable and that will come 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.569
 partly due to its nice big seats 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.349
 at least for the back seat is free 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.090
 flat 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.959
 adults have too little support there 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.959
 for them the lower legs 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.790
 the renault kadjar is spacious 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.530
 safe and fly but whether that is enough 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.439
 to cut down the competition 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.629
 folk or to be seen with a starting price of 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.939
 24 thousand seven hundred ninety euros 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.840
 It is not the cheapest SUV in this 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.459
 segment 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.019
 that nissan qashqai with whom the kart year 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.870
 subcutaneous parts to be invited 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.060
 is 1000 euros cheaper 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.599
 we foresee a hefty one 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.599
 family fight
