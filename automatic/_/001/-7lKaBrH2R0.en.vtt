00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.010
 yes hello and welcome to the 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.950
 second fan installation video of our 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.960
 channel last pcs today we show you 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.090
 how to fan without a fan control 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.890
 installs 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.439
 You can just talk about that 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.410
 motherboard or with conscience 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.669
 make adapter cable over the power supply 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.570
 we will do that today on both variants 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.430
 do 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.050
 We have once on the massa board 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.750
 the two fans on key that is 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.210
 two fans from the given 4 one can 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.820
 then to the motherboard and two 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.630
 we still have to go to the power supply 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.230
 connect 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.540
 So let's start with the power supply 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.510
 connect the fans to the mains 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.520
 whether one of these adapter cables are here 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.150
 mostly with mothers when you look at yourself 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.060
 ordered to the pc while that's just 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.930
 once these typical 4 pin plugs from 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.900
 power supply then just stop shopping or 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.229
 is looking for a power cable from the power supply 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.590
 from what is still free and closes this 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.840
 then on 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.270
 the plug from the power supply to yes that is 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.549
 actually as always with this cable 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.950
 squeeze a bit and free mails 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.450
 work then you can do that extra 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.740
 so adapter cable that do not want here 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.600
 power connection loses that means then 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.829
 you can still use afterwards and we 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.569
 take now for the back and the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.619
 front fan that means one closes 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.679
 it's just on 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.750
 but then it is to say that the that 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.240
 fan runs at 100% all the time 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.789
 now really an efficient cooling 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.780
 wants to and also save power then 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.000
 you should get a fan control 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.849
 buy what you now with the second 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.619
 I would like to do that too 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.630
 do it again with the same adapter 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.090
 that does not matter because we take that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.829
 Take the business as you take the bottom 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.329
 or the turbo we take the lower one 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.700
 Also connect again easily 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.369
 Then we come to the water board 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.409
 So most massa bosens two 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.810
 up to three connections from whatever 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.140
 at least one for the cpu cooler 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.480
 should be used and yes there 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.549
 Of course, two more connections left 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.709
 you can see here these are these 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.139
 white and there we can now 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.850
 then just two fans later 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:28.109
 take the plug and connect 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.880
 there is still nothing fix so do that 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.049
 there are always where you never seemed 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.030
 can introduce exactly 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.420
 So then you really can not do anything 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.420
 make wrong 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.750
 I myself still work that is 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.160
 you can see here as well 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.660
 You now have a 4 pin fan 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.190
 connect but we have now 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.990
 but not for that one can also here 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.820
 this rail can run so three 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.560
 that means you can be wonderful twelve 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.270
 close days because if you have the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.520
 mainboard connects that is still so 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.870
 that the motherboard is the fan 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.240
 regulates according to the temperature 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.790
 there are special programs for the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.320
 that the roma the air then manually 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.910
 but you can google that 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.410
 but to do both that's 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.380
 again a little more complicated because of that 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.850
 recommend like here also 10 to 20 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.110
 euro to put us one 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.670
 night tour to buy 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.050
 Now you can see the whole cable 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.690
 of course still stowing that make 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.570
 not now progressing example 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.880
 and otherwise it should be like that now 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.550
 work and then yes that 's it 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.250
 so everything is just stop relatively 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.410
 fast and most importantly, we hope 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.880
 we helped you with that and then 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.880
 let's see each other until the next shot
