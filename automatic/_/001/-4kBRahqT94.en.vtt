right in in a very rural area and the
disadvantages<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:08.190> were<00:01:08.520> things<00:01:08.910> like

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
disadvantages there were things like

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.139 
disadvantages there were things like
there<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.509> no<00:01:09.690> broadband<00:01:10.289> access<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.310> there

wasn't a lot of premises available so as

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.529

the<00:01:15.180> brand<00:01:15.420> grew<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.530> had<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.039> move<00:01:17.539> further

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
the brand grew we had to move further

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.600

away<00:01:18.810> from<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.410> heart<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.039> countryside

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
away from the heart of the countryside

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120 
away from the heart of the countryside
effectively<00:01:21.270> we're<00:01:21.780> still<00:01:22.050> fairly<00:01:22.410> rural<00:01:22.770> but

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
to go back into into the heart of the

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.749 
to go back into into the heart of the
countryside<00:01:28.050> because<00:01:28.740> we're<00:01:29.009> an<00:01:29.190> off-road
