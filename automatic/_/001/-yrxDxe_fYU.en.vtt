00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 so happy and the next game we did 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.280
 but is a game from the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.690
 super league in turkey and that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.980
 Game of the second third of 2013 at 18 o'clock in the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.850
 atatürk stadium ex series against 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.529
 galatasaray istanbul is first of all 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 a look at the table 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.269
 there we see the sixth plays 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.719
 home against the first points difference 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.730
 ten points but now was good money 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.370
 free has now almost a game 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.710
 against Orduspor is still with now 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.969
 therefore only 22 games included 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.160
 galatasaray yes there we go now 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.579
 the last one to meet 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.989
 a game of laziness 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.570
 Who should have done something different? 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.280
 have belonged to as burak yilmaz the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.430
 goalgetter par excellence for the turks 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.910
 also a very sympathetic player yes 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.010
 we see my shape curve drove the buttocks 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.909
 a 70 percent has that is already 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.720
 bad have the last game at 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.520
 bootboohook her here 2 2 played well 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.110
 but lost against kaiserslautern before 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.580
 well, it's the last five games 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.590
 not as good as it is on the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.720
 then refers to last seven games looks 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.270
 better, but I would rather 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.890
 to the last five and there I have to 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.119
 say that then no more 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.950
 looks so good at kässbohrer 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.619
 then it looks at galatasaray already 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.150
 a little better with three wins 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.380
 and two draws that can be 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.119
 actually let's see outside 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.690
 maybe the 1 1 against Schalke far 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.850
 a bit unnecessary 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.900
 because you just that a bit 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 gave away before that there was a 2 1 at 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:59.240
 axa before 1 2 0 at antalya spor 1 1 2 1 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.920
 against bursaspor and the 2 1 at the 720 den 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.890
 first against the big competitor like 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.420
 Send the last few 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.820
 meet each other when you look at the times 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.710
 Look , we see three victories for xbox 3 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.950
 15 victories for galatasaray 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.450
 so rather balanced statistics that 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.600
 but are just a few 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.890
 we meet each other 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.550
 the most successful protect 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.800
 in the super league for both teams 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.050
 we are with Kathi I do not know 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.540
 just like you say it with eleven 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:38.210
 tors 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:41.480
 Canada 8 gates for access at Galatasaray 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.530
 of course burak yilmaz twelve gates and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.670
 bulut also twelve gates and mother, mummy 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.650
 formtable if we have one more 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.060
 look at it or resp 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.790
 Galatasaray can say that third 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.920
 buttocks observer also does 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.270
 Not so much because he's always like that 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.920
 We will then look at games 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.530
 the circuit again to see but who 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.209
 hurt is just very important to see there 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.450
 we lucy injured from galatasaray and 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.519
 cetin and theo hurt 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.209
 gravel farmer or theo with one 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.209
 yellow red lock 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.370
 yes, let's have a look at the course 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.140
 the season we see that galatasaray 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.209
 up to two games always on the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.410
 first place emphasized that while her 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.440
 buttocks at such a little bit and 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.630
 Come on and are back now 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.060
 so have arrived in the upper middle field 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:45.790
 there is always established space 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.840
 86 rome one can say 8584 always so in 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.890
 the area where the team is 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.060
 moves yes and therefore to the conclusion 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.170
 I would like to share this analysis with you now 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.700
 give my tip to this game 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.250
 and i think that galatasaray that 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.350
 actually will do and type 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.680
 because of the fact that the team with two too 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.680
 one wins
