from the beginning you can generally get

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.560 
from the beginning you can generally get
a<00:00:41.040> good<00:00:41.190> idea<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.820> direction<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.390> team

terms of you know terminal itself this
map<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.020> tricky<00:01:40.409> because<00:01:40.560> there<00:01:40.920> are<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130

just<00:01:48.509> bond<00:01:48.750> there<00:01:48.990> even<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.630> really

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
just bond there even and so you really

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.980 
just bond there even and so you really
have<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> keep<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.530> eye<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:53.240> um<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
have to keep your eye out um it's a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.100 
have to keep your eye out um it's a
pretty<00:01:55.140> tricky<00:01:55.439> map<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.750> know<00:01:57.899> it's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
pretty tricky map and I do you know it's

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
pretty tricky map and I do you know it's
very<00:01:58.140> easy<00:01:58.469> i<00:01:58.680> chi<00:01:58.860> said<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.189> get<00:01:59.280> flanked<00:01:59.759> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
very easy i chi said to get flanked and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
very easy i chi said to get flanked and
so<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.930> really<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> keep<00:02:01.439> an<00:02:01.500> eye<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.649> on

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
so you really want to keep an eye out on

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.020 
so you really want to keep an eye out on
the<00:02:01.920> radio<00:02:02.250> radio<00:02:03.119> what's<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.750> radio<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.619> radar

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
the radio radio what's a radio the radar

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.469 
the radio radio what's a radio the radar
and<00:02:07.340> keep<00:02:08.340> an<00:02:08.459> eye<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.789> radar<00:02:08.940> see<00:02:09.330> where

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
and keep an eye on the radar see where

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.500 
and keep an eye on the radar see where
your<00:02:09.690> team<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.289> because<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:11.030> lot<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.060> times<00:02:12.360> if

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
your team is because a lot of times if

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.740 
your team is because a lot of times if
your<00:02:12.629> team<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.810> kind<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.170> group<00:02:13.379> on<00:02:13.530> one

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
your team is kind of group on one

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.410 
your team is kind of group on one
so<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.050> map<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.800> get<00:02:15.040> an<00:02:15.130> idea<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.460> where

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
so the map you can get an idea of where

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.760 
so the map you can get an idea of where
the<00:02:16.540> enemy<00:02:16.930> would<00:02:17.110> be<00:02:17.230> which<00:02:17.470> would<00:02:17.650> be

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
the enemy would be which would be

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.510 
the enemy would be which would be
obviously<00:02:18.220> where<00:02:18.880> your<00:02:19.060> team<00:02:19.270> isn't<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:21.430> only

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
obviously where your team isn't it only

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.120 
obviously where your team isn't it only
gives<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:21.970> rough<00:02:22.240> idea<00:02:22.420> but<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.980> can

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
gives you a rough idea but you can

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.610 
gives you a rough idea but you can
typically<00:02:24.520> be<00:02:24.940> very<00:02:25.780> helpful<00:02:25.960> in<00:02:26.230> keeping

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
typically be very helpful in keeping

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.050 
typically be very helpful in keeping
your<00:02:26.890> eye<00:02:26.920> on<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.490> keeping<00:02:27.700> track<00:02:28.000> of

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
your eye on that and keeping track of

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.360 
your eye on that and keeping track of
what's<00:02:28.360> kind<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.690> going<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:29.110> around<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.530> map

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.680 

so<00:02:33.370> I'm<00:02:33.670> really<00:02:33.910> just<00:02:34.180> kind<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.360> playing<00:02:34.600> it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
so I'm really just kind of playing it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.800 
so I'm really just kind of playing it
safe<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.290> being<00:02:35.800> defensive<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:37.240> know<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.390> know

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
safe and being defensive you know I know

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.180 
safe and being defensive you know I know
a<00:02:37.840> lot<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.350> lot<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.709> time<00:02:38.860> defensive

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
a lot of a lot of the time defensive

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.780 
a lot of a lot of the time defensive
players<00:02:39.520> get<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> bad<00:02:39.970> rep<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.670> know<00:02:42.760> I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
players get a bad rep and you know I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.000 
players get a bad rep and you know I
personally<00:02:43.510> do<00:02:43.750> not<00:02:43.780> believe<00:02:44.020> that<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:44.800> game

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
personally do not believe that this game

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.620 
personally do not believe that this game
was<00:02:45.190> intended<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.700> be<00:02:45.790> some<00:02:46.090> sort<00:02:46.270> of<00:02:46.420> running

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
was intended to be some sort of running

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.830 
was intended to be some sort of running
gun<00:02:46.840> shooter<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.350> really<00:02:47.800> don't<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:49.750> know

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
gun shooter I really don't and I know

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.449 
gun shooter I really don't and I know
some<00:02:50.110> people<00:02:50.140> will<00:02:50.500> disagree<00:02:50.590> with<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.040> but

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
some people will disagree with that but

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.670 
some people will disagree with that but
the<00:02:51.640> fact<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.150> can<00:02:52.300> die<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.050> fast<00:02:53.350> and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
the fact that you can die so fast and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.580 
the fact that you can die so fast and
that<00:02:53.770> there<00:02:53.980> are<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.550> many<00:02:54.730> hiding<00:02:54.970> spots

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
that there are so many hiding spots

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.860 
that there are so many hiding spots
leads<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.890> mean<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:58.500> basically<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:01.540> really

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
leads I mean it basically is really

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.500 
leads I mean it basically is really
obvious<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.440> this<00:03:02.590> game<00:03:03.030> was<00:03:04.030> meant<00:03:04.300> for

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
obvious that this game was meant for

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.690 
obvious that this game was meant for
defensive<00:03:04.930> players<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.530> really<00:03:06.190> was<00:03:06.340> i<00:03:06.489> mean

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
defensive players it really was i mean

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.940 
defensive players it really was i mean
if<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.630> wasn't<00:03:07.989> campers<00:03:08.380> wouldn't<00:03:08.650> be<00:03:08.709> nearly

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
if it wasn't campers wouldn't be nearly

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.890 
if it wasn't campers wouldn't be nearly
as<00:03:09.100> big<00:03:09.280> an<00:03:09.400> issue<00:03:09.520> as<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.660> I'm<00:03:10.780> not<00:03:10.870> a

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
as big an issue as it is and I'm not a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.270 
as big an issue as it is and I'm not a
big<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.200> don't<00:03:11.350> like<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.980> know<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.130> don't

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
big I don't like that you know I don't

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.820 
big I don't like that you know I don't
like<00:03:12.489> camping<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.420> don't<00:03:13.600> like<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:14.560> know<00:03:14.620> went

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
like camping I don't like you know went

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.960 
like camping I don't like you know went
to<00:03:14.890> playing<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.400> game<00:03:15.550> there's<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.820> lot<00:03:15.940> of

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
to playing a game there's a lot of

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.850 
to playing a game there's a lot of
campers<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:18.000> isn't<00:03:19.000> fun<00:03:19.239> but<00:03:20.200> that's<00:03:20.799> just

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
campers it isn't fun but that's just

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.780 
campers it isn't fun but that's just
kind<00:03:21.100> of<00:03:21.130> how<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:21.340> game<00:03:21.549> was<00:03:21.730> designed<00:03:21.880> and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
kind of how this game was designed and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.430 
kind of how this game was designed and
you<00:03:24.790> don't<00:03:24.970> have<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.360> camp<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.690> be<00:03:25.810> successful

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
you don't have to camp to be successful

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.120 
you don't have to camp to be successful
and<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.709> don't<00:03:26.950> camp<00:03:27.220> but<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:29.739> kind<00:03:30.070> of

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
and so I don't camp but that kind of

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.630 
and so I don't camp but that kind of
goes<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.459> show<00:03:30.700> why<00:03:31.180> defensive<00:03:32.110> play<00:03:32.320> is<00:03:32.640> so

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
goes to show why defensive play is so

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.660 
goes to show why defensive play is so
effective<00:03:34.000> in<00:03:34.330> this<00:03:34.420> game<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:36.220> like<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> halo

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
effective in this game and like a halo

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.280 
effective in this game and like a halo
of<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.180> camper<00:03:37.480> tries<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.840> shoot<00:03:38.049> you<00:03:38.170> from

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
of a camper tries to shoot you from

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.380 
of a camper tries to shoot you from
behind<00:03:38.470> if<00:03:39.100> you're<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.430> good<00:03:39.700> player<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.239> the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
behind if you're a good player and the

behind if you're a good player and the
other<00:03:40.540> player<00:03:40.750> isn't<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.110> good<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:41.709> could

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
other player isn't so good you could

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.140 
other player isn't so good you could
very<00:03:42.010> easily<00:03:42.130> turn<00:03:42.489> around<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:42.880> take<00:03:43.000> them

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
very easily turn around and take them

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.860 
very easily turn around and take them
out<00:03:43.269> this<00:03:43.959> game<00:03:44.200> not<00:03:45.010> really<00:03:45.549> because<00:03:46.480> usually

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
out this game not really because usually

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.069 
out this game not really because usually
the<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:48.549> camper<00:03:48.850> knows<00:03:49.000> how<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.180> aim<00:03:49.450> you'll

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
the the camper knows how to aim you'll

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.890 
the the camper knows how to aim you'll
already<00:03:50.260> be<00:03:50.410> dead<00:03:50.620> by<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.890> time<00:03:51.720> master<00:03:52.720> turn

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
already be dead by the time master turn

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.470 
already be dead by the time master turn
around<00:03:53.200> so

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.610 

it<00:03:57.480> was<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.659> very<00:03:57.690> different<00:03:58.170> kind<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.440> game

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
it was a very different kind of game

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.280 
it was a very different kind of game
very<00:03:59.549> tactical<00:04:00.239> game<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.720> even<00:04:00.930> then<00:04:01.110> it's

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
very tactical game and even then it's

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.920 
very tactical game and even then it's
still<00:04:01.379> very<00:04:01.830> frustrating<00:04:02.489> because<00:04:02.900> there's<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
still very frustrating because there's a

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.390 
still very frustrating because there's a
lot<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.080> gameplay<00:04:04.379> mechanics<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.010> think<00:04:05.280> are

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
lot of gameplay mechanics I think are

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.880 
lot of gameplay mechanics I think are
kind<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.640> broken<00:04:05.849> such<00:04:06.239> as<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.569> spawns<00:04:06.890> but

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
kind of broken such as the spawns but

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.680 
kind of broken such as the spawns but
all<00:04:08.819> in<00:04:09.209> all<00:04:10.879> this<00:04:11.879> game<00:04:12.090> requires<00:04:12.299> a<00:04:12.540> lot<00:04:12.659> of

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
all in all this game requires a lot of

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.380 
all in all this game requires a lot of
patience<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.860> really<00:04:14.069> does<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:15.209> kind<00:04:15.360> of

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
patience it really does it kind of

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.900 
patience it really does it kind of
reminds<00:04:15.720> me<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.870> poker<00:04:16.199> in<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.530> sense<00:04:16.799> that

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
reminds me of poker in the sense that

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.620 
reminds me of poker in the sense that
it's<00:04:17.910> more<00:04:18.180> about<00:04:18.359> picking<00:04:18.930> your<00:04:19.019> spots<00:04:19.380> and

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630
