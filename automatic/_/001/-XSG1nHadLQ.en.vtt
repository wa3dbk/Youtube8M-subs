 let's say so simple but enough 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.960
 reliable needles are needles that 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.640
 have proven themselves throughout 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.350

 there are just 500 and there are any 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:53.629
 but if at first itâ€™s worth the five 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.989
 the same series often they are already assembled 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.899

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.960
 mounting on wanted would look 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.380
 like that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.000
 but we will have a confident connection 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.000
 khojaly contact group

 feature in terms of playing bass 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.770
 because at least she was walking where 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:36.380
 fixed has a resonant feature 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:39.540

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.519
 aluminum casting 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.489
 and with all of this we should not forget about 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:00.350
 traditional materials for making 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:04.019
 headshots this tree is tree enough 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.100
 luxurious and has a characteristic 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.819
 sounding 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.750
 In today's review with us only one 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.989
 needle firm shur but one of the most 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.410
 representative representatives 40 4g 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.959
 This is a needle for both house DJs and 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.190
 beginners scratchier of for hardships 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.850
 scratchier of fits 44 7 and has 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.510
 nicknames 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.720
 vinyl killer but since the needle tip 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.320
 and plates for skratcha it consumables 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.370
 materials 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.110
 as ink from the printer so here we are 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:45.690
 Of course, do not be angry with them 40 4g 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.440
 quite eclectic and interesting in terms of 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.370
 sounding 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.160
 we have a big coil and therefore 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.790
 big bass so for example in the club 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.980
 if you play with these games, you can feel 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.930
 qualitative increase in density 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:07.290
 sounding also going back to talking about 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:11.670
 big coils and big bass unwittingly 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:16.060
 I remember the tip is the stylus of the needle 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.840
 stanton 680 is a popular 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.680
 time needle which is now enough 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:28.320
 hard to find but she possesses all 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.889
 the makings of a powerful club needles 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.930
 rarely comes across to users 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:38.560
 gilded like firm technics 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.860
 it is intended for players 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:46.030
 limited editions on this hedge or 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:49.510
 mounted head shur m97 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.470
 this successor popular 15 and hunger 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:58.090
 firm shur is an elliptical needle 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:01.389
 which gets out of the channels pretty 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.310
 many interesting sounds but only she 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.250
 recommended for you 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.450
 back spin off and even more so for scratch 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.729
 and because the ellipse is so let's say 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.520
 long-long diamond stick which 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.220
 took penetrates deep into the track 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.100
 most budget option for 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:28.050
 listening and playing records and 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:34.810
 also DJing is the younger needle of the firm 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:36.930
 audio technica 3600 she just quite 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.190
 sounds good for its value and 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.680
 often correct 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:47.280
 preinstalled on hajj or what it means 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.139
 correctly set the needle on the hajj or 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.240
 every technics player goes 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:06:01.979
 a pattern that indicates 52 millimeters 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.979
 from setting to the arm to the tip of the needle 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.070
 as you can see very well 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.700
 and the wolf in this case is correct 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.700
 installed 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.400
 In general, we can say that our review 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.290
 very few therefore we decided to supplement 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.470
 his extensive article 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.410
 which you can read on the blog 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.640
