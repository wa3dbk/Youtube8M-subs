seventy four hundred as well we're

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.039 
seventy four hundred as well we're
running<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:26.050> 40<00:01:26.890> horsepower<00:01:27.450> nitrous<00:01:28.450> kit<00:01:28.899> on

has<00:02:53.170> added<00:02:53.620> we're<00:02:54.160> 460<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.239> methanol<00:02:55.810> on

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
has added we're 460 on just methanol on

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.190 
has added we're 460 on just methanol on
our<00:02:56.620> standard<00:02:57.220> kits<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.569> methanol<00:02:59.019> is

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
our standard kits so the methanol is

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.740 
our standard kits so the methanol is
added<00:02:59.530> quite<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.860> bit<00:03:00.129> we're<00:03:00.310> able<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.670> run<00:03:01.269> and

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
added quite a bit we're able to run and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.000 
added quite a bit we're able to run and
that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.800 
that
with<00:03:02.099> pump<00:03:02.370> fuel<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:02.909> it's<00:03:03.209> enabled<00:03:03.659> us<00:03:03.780> to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
with pump fuel so it's enabled us to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.030 
with pump fuel so it's enabled us to
basically<00:03:04.260> get<00:03:04.680> race<00:03:04.920> fuel<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.900> get<00:03:07.019> race<00:03:07.680> fuel

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
basically get race fuel to get race fuel

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.300 
basically get race fuel to get race fuel

and we've made quite a few runs on it we

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.910 
and we've made quite a few runs on it we
haven't<00:03:15.540> even<00:03:15.599> used<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:16.049> third<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.439> a<00:03:16.530> gallon

occupant I think you've seen in other
videos<00:05:04.500> that<00:05:05.130> we<00:05:05.159> are<00:05:05.430> actually<00:05:05.699> using<00:05:06.260> the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
videos that we are actually using the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.010 
videos that we are actually using the
windshield<00:05:09.310> washer<00:05:09.939> and<00:05:10.090> nozzle<00:05:10.659> we've

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
windshield washer and nozzle we've

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.899 
windshield washer and nozzle we've
changed<00:05:11.409> the<00:05:11.650> orifice<00:05:12.159> size<00:05:12.189> of<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.729> nozzle

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
changed the orifice size of the nozzle

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:23.550 
changed the orifice size of the nozzle
and<00:05:14.279> we're<00:05:15.279> using<00:05:15.490> that<00:05:20.999> and<00:05:22.409> we're<00:05:23.409> using

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
and we're using that and we're using

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.739 
and we're using that and we're using
that<00:05:23.860> for<00:05:24.099> the<00:05:24.189> purge<00:05:24.460> I<00:05:24.729> think<00:05:24.969> it's<00:05:25.150> quite

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:25.749 
that for the purge I think it's quite

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:27.989 
that for the purge I think it's quite
ingenious<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.499> it<00:05:26.560> works<00:05:26.770> very<00:05:26.889> well<00:05:27.129> it<00:05:27.699> lets

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:27.999 
ingenious and it works very well it lets

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:29.760 
ingenious and it works very well it lets
the<00:05:28.240> driver<00:05:28.509> know<00:05:28.810> when<00:05:28.990> you're<00:05:29.199> armed<00:05:29.620> and

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
the driver know when you're armed and

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.980 
the driver know when you're armed and
the<00:05:29.919> system<00:05:30.310> is<00:05:30.460> ready<00:05:30.639> to<00:05:30.879> go<00:05:31.029> and<00:05:31.300> this

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
the system is ready to go and this

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.290 
the system is ready to go and this
pretty<00:05:32.259> much<00:05:32.529> wraps<00:05:33.219> up<00:05:33.490> what<00:05:33.759> we're<00:05:33.939> doing

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
pretty much wraps up what we're doing

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.899 
pretty much wraps up what we're doing
the<00:05:34.779> file<00:05:35.139> that's<00:05:35.379> in<00:05:35.560> the<00:05:35.680> ECU<00:05:36.159> is<00:05:36.279> a<00:05:36.310> standard

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
the file that's in the ECU is a standard

the file that's in the ECU is a standard

been done to the ignition timing maps

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:43.980 
been done to the ignition timing maps
it's<00:05:42.460> really<00:05:42.789> remarkable<00:05:43.120> what's<00:05:43.569> been<00:05:43.749> done

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
it's really remarkable what's been done

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.709 
it's really remarkable what's been done
with<00:05:44.199> nothing<00:05:44.860> more<00:05:44.979> than<00:05:45.039> methanol<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:45.759> a<00:05:46.389> 40

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
with nothing more than methanol and a 40

with nothing more than methanol and a 40
horse<00:05:47.129> nitrous<00:05:48.129> update<00:05:48.939> to<00:05:49.150> it<00:05:49.300> I<00:05:49.479> think<00:05:50.110> we

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
horse nitrous update to it I think we

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.540 
horse nitrous update to it I think we
still<00:05:50.409> have<00:05:50.560> some<00:05:50.770> more<00:05:50.800> to<00:05:51.039> go<00:05:51.189> with<00:05:51.460> the

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
still have some more to go with the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.800 
still have some more to go with the
methanol<00:05:51.999> we<00:05:52.120> should<00:05:52.300> be<00:05:52.419> able<00:05:52.569> to<00:05:52.659> run

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
methanol we should be able to run

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.050 
methanol we should be able to run
probably<00:05:53.139> close<00:05:53.589> to<00:05:53.620> eight<00:05:54.279> tenths<00:05:54.580> of<00:05:54.759> a<00:05:54.849> bar

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
probably close to eight tenths of a bar

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.239 
probably close to eight tenths of a bar
right<00:05:55.779> now<00:05:55.960> we're<00:05:56.139> not<00:05:56.319> leaning<00:05:56.710> near<00:05:57.009> there

00:05:57.239 --> 00:05:57.249

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:02.529 
were at most a half a bar to four or

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.769 
were at most a half a bar to four or
five<00:06:02.560> point<00:06:03.159> four<00:06:03.279> or<00:06:03.400> five<00:06:03.580> roughly<00:06:04.210> because

five point four or five roughly because

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:06.269 
five point four or five roughly because
we're<00:06:04.930> almost<00:06:05.080> hitting<00:06:05.499> seven<00:06:05.860> pounds<00:06:06.189> of

we're almost hitting seven pounds of
boost<00:06:06.430> so<00:06:06.759> we're<00:06:07.210> a<00:06:07.240> must<00:06:07.479> half<00:06:07.689> a<00:06:07.810> bar<00:06:07.990> so

boost so we're a must half a bar so

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.969 
boost so we're a must half a bar so
we're<00:06:08.589> a<00:06:08.620> mess<00:06:08.860> 0.5<00:06:09.339> ish<00:06:09.550> and<00:06:10.199> that's<00:06:11.199> going<00:06:11.919> to
