00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.850
 Greetings, 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.169
 I'm Johnny from ASUS ROG Team. We recently launched a brand new one 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.610
 gaming Mouse 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.129
 named Gladius. Many of you have shown enormous interest in this mouse 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.700
 therefore I would like to introduce you to this video 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.820
 its main functions as well as some thoughts and ideas 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.120
 that stood at her birth. 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.120
 Let's go. 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.239
 Many people ask the following question: 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.099
 Why does ROG supply two cables to this mouse? 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.550
 There are several reasons for this. 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.940
 Let's first look at the cables themselves. One of them is braided. 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.710
 Not only offers increased durability and longer life 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.089
 but also a more valuable look. 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.498
 However, its robustness is also a disadvantage in some respects 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.629
 it is heavier and can rub against the mat, which is not ideal. 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.870
 The second cable is a classic cable without braid 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.200
 it is much lighter and especially appreciated by players 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.820
 who require cable enabling 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.500
 fast moves - for example, professional players 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.180
 or fans of FPS games. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.909
 Therefore our goal is to make it 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.289
 the Gladius mouse has complied with players of all types 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.380
 and players can choose for themselves 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.770
 what about them and their game style 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.119
 best suited. 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.930
 Another great feature 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.390
 These cables are that they use a micro USB interface 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.659
 so if for example 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.520
 you forget the charger for your mobile 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 you can charge the phone with the mouse cable. 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.200
 Or you can buy another one 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.420
 micro USB cable and color it so 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.240
 align with your PC assembly 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.270
 or - even better - 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.940
 with the color of your game team. 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.140
 With detachable cable 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.230
 the mouse is very easy to carry. 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.170
 Simply put your Gladius mouse into this elegant ROG travel case 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.090
 and you can go. 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.930
 The mouse will be perfectly protected in every situation. 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.340
 One of the main advantages of Gladius 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.720
 is the possibility of replacing Omron switches. 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.350
 Let's see, 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.910
 how to do it. 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.310
 First you have to take off 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.530
 these four washers. 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.840
 Then just unscrew the four screws 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.380
 and remove the top cover. 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.630
 This will give you access 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.650
 to two Omron switches 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.480
 which can be very easy 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.210
 replace it. 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.820
 Just pull them out. 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.049
 There are two kinds of switches in the box, 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.430
 white and gray. 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.590
 As you can notice 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.500
 varies in height. 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.390
 In the case of white switches, we have added 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.250
 a small pad to make this one 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.660
 the difference. 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.450
 If you ever 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.700
 buy a new set of white switches 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.900
 Be sure to use these washers. 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.950
 Sockets for these Omron switches 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.440
 produces only ROG. 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.560
 It's our own slot, which is very specific. 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.890
 It is thanks to it that switches can be used 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.300
 so easy to replace and paste back. 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.060
 Because we expect you to exchange them, 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.070
 we used instead of regular self-tapping screws 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.159
 two-part internal threaded screws. 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.320
 Therefore, the mouse is structurally very solid, 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.639
 resistant and distinguished by it 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:38.639
 longer life. 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.850
 We have been working on the design and execution of this mouse for a very long time. 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.419
 For most other gaming mice on the market 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.219
 the top cover also buttons. It is made in one piece 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.380
 material. 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.700
 However, ASUS Gladius has separate separate buttons 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.889
 which offer players extremely fast 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.450
 response and significantly less resistance. 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.799
 She owes these two to it 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.250
 special notches. 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.990
 They make buttons between clicks 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.030
 they move very fast. 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.570
 It is therefore an ideal solution for 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.040
 FPS shooters and professional players. 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.240
 To be honest, this player will be appreciated by all players 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.980
 because he offers to play for a long time 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.919
 extra comfort for your fingers. 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.818
 Now let's look at the side buttons. 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.870
 Side buttons of most game mice 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.909
 the market are fairly flat. 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:55.909
 Players are therefore forced by their fingers 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.308
 more lift and the use of side buttons is not exactly comfortable. 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.539
 We talked to some of the professional players we sponsor. 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.688
 They have clearly agreed that it is extremely important for them 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.129
 so that they can have a tight thumb during demanding gameplay 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.539
 in one place. 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.449
 Therefore, we are side buttons 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.439
 Gladius mice designed to 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:25.879
 moderately. 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.430
 Thus, players do not have to lift their thumbs, 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.789
 you just need to move it up slightly. 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:36.430
 It saves a lot of time for players 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:43.430
 and, as a result, will also increase playing comfort. 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.700
 We chose to design the side panels 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.450
 rubberized material that does not slip. 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.530
 An even better and more secure grip 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.790
 then it provides this special pattern. 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.530
 Many of you will surely say why this one 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.410
 a specific pattern? We thought about what ROG best describes. 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.340
 We conclude that it is the typical Mayan ROG motif, 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.480
 which can also be found on our computers 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.420
 and mini PC series ROG. 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.660
 With this characteristic motif is 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.060
 you will be at our latest products 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.770
 continue to meet. Many of them have just 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.799
 we will present in the future. This theme so 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.290
 you may consider it a ROG signature. 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:42.450
 For a typical element you will soon encounter 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.599
 for a mouse pad. So don't miss it. 

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.610
 Before we say goodbye, let me mention one more thing. 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.800
 Gladius Gaming Mouse achieves the latest driver update 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.640
 the world's first transmission speeds over USB up to 2000 Hz. 

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.560
 I believe that with such performance you will enjoy playing Gladius with your mouse 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.400
 as we enjoyed it in its development.
