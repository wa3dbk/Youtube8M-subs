with our compost tea in order to get a 1

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.520 
with our compost tea in order to get a 1
to<00:01:54.700> 4<00:01:54.909> breakdown<00:01:55.329> ratio<00:01:55.719> of<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.899> compost<00:01:56.350> tea

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
to 4 breakdown ratio of the compost tea

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.649 
to 4 breakdown ratio of the compost tea
we<00:01:56.920> just<00:01:57.369> put<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.640> at<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.850> 8<00:01:58.000> ounce<00:01:58.210> setting

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
we just put it at the 8 ounce setting

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.050

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
and that 8 ounce per 32 tons ends up

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.209 
and that 8 ounce per 32 tons ends up
being<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.539> one<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.110> four<00:02:02.259> ratio<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:02.950> this<00:02:03.009> is<00:02:03.159> a

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
being a one to four ratio so this is a

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.830 
being a one to four ratio so this is a
great<00:02:03.490> one<00:02:03.729> for<00:02:03.969> us<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.270> be<00:02:04.329> able<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.509> water<00:02:04.719> our
