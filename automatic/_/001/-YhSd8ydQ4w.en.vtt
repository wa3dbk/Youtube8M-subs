00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.630 
later then you want to get a crowd riled
up<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.800> these<00:00:29.010> guys<00:00:29.189> are<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
up so these guys are all going to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519 
up so these guys are all going to
investigate<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.199> probably<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
investigate and this is probably the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.830 
investigate and this is probably the
best<00:00:31.710> area<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.219> found<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.730> do<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.329> this

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
best area I found to do it because this

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.479 
best area I found to do it because this
gives<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> largest<00:00:34.559> area<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.070> go<00:00:35.190> around

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
gives you the largest area to go around

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.830 
gives you the largest area to go around
and<00:00:35.790> again<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.420> take<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and again you want to take out the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.660 
and again you want to take out the
captain<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.710> he<00:00:38.070> could<00:00:38.219> block<00:00:38.430> your

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
captain because he could block your

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.220 
captain because he could block your
attacks<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.300> he<00:00:39.390> follows<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.050> makes

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
attacks and if he follows you that makes

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.540 
attacks and if he follows you that makes
double<00:00:40.649> file<00:00:40.800> them<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.129> not<00:00:41.219> only<00:00:41.280> going

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
double file them because not only going

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.790 
double file them because not only going
to<00:00:41.640> block<00:00:41.940> your<00:00:42.090> attacks<00:00:42.450> he<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.110> also<00:00:43.350> shoot

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
to block your attacks he can also shoot

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.290 
to block your attacks he can also shoot
you<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.700> really<00:00:44.940> don't<00:00:45.120> want<00:00:45.239> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
you and you really don't want that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.670 
you and you really don't want that
because<00:00:45.629> that'll<00:00:45.780> ruin<00:00:45.989> your<00:00:46.230> kill<00:00:46.379> streak

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
because that'll ruin your kill streak

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.459 
because that'll ruin your kill streak
and<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.700> no<00:00:48.270> fun<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.110> want

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and then that just is no fun so you want

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.290 
and then that just is no fun so you want
to<00:00:49.559> run<00:00:49.649> over<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.070> area<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.550> gather<00:00:50.760> two
