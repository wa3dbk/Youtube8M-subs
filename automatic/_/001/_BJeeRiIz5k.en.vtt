someone so you'll see I go 13 and one in
this<00:00:37.890> game<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.809> basically<00:00:39.809> i'd<00:00:40.170> say<00:00:40.559> maybe

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
this game and basically i'd say maybe

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.900 
this game and basically i'd say maybe
three<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.660> my<00:00:42.960> kills<00:00:43.320> were<00:00:43.800> from<00:00:44.160> prenat<00:00:44.670> sand

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
three of my kills were from prenat sand

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.479 
three of my kills were from prenat sand
that<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.059> HUGE<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:45.980> that<00:00:46.980> starts<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.460> off

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
that is HUGE because that starts you off

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.940 
that is HUGE because that starts you off
on<00:00:47.820> your<00:00:47.940> kill<00:00:48.239> streak<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.649> gets<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
on your kill streak and it gets you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.180 
on your kill streak and it gets you
started<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.879> fast<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.500> swear<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.920> team

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
started really fast so I swear this team

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.970 
started really fast so I swear this team
was<00:00:53.520> meant<00:00:53.879> mentally<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> handicapped

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
was meant mentally like a handicapped

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
was meant mentally like a handicapped
because<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.149> kid<00:00:57.390> walking<00:00:57.809> into<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
because like this kid walking into a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.560 
because like this kid walking into a
wall<00:00:58.410> these<00:00:59.039> kids<00:00:59.250> were<00:00:59.489> pretty<00:01:00.059> young<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
wall these kids were pretty young I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.119 
wall these kids were pretty young I
think<00:01:00.750> they're<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.050> 10<00:01:01.530> years<00:01:01.739> old<00:01:01.920> so

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
think they're like 10 years old so

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.470 
think they're like 10 years old so
they're<00:01:02.250> probably<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.789> new<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.270> game

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
they're probably a bit new to this game

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.740 
they're probably a bit new to this game
and<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.650> was<00:01:05.100> really<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.700> tearing<00:01:06.390> these<00:01:06.479> kids

will just keep on truckin along here a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.050 
will just keep on truckin along here a
lots<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.740> times<00:02:25.950> people<00:02:26.250> go<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.760> exact

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
lots of times people go to the exact

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.420 
lots of times people go to the exact
same<00:02:27.240> place<00:02:27.570> if<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.290> works<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:28.830> them<00:02:28.950> or<00:02:29.250> even

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
same place if it works for them or even

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.280 
same place if it works for them or even
if<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.760> doesn't<00:02:30.000> they<00:02:30.240> sometimes<00:02:30.660> will<00:02:31.020> go<00:02:31.230> to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
if it doesn't they sometimes will go to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.150 
if it doesn't they sometimes will go to
the<00:02:31.380> same<00:02:31.560> place<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:32.490> if<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.540> kill<00:02:33.780> someone

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
the same place so if you kill someone

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.560 
the same place so if you kill someone
chances<00:02:35.160> are<00:02:35.340> they<00:02:35.550> might<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:36.060> back<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.450> that

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
chances are they might go back to that

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.690 
chances are they might go back to that
place<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:37.290> kind<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.830> how<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.310> human

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
place it's just kind of how the human

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.270 
place it's just kind of how the human
brain<00:02:38.850> thinks<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:40.440> they<00:02:41.040> feel

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
brain thinks is that they feel

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.550 
brain thinks is that they feel
comfortable<00:02:41.340> with<00:02:42.120> one<00:02:42.390> place<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.170> map

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
comfortable with one place in the map

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.610 
comfortable with one place in the map
that<00:02:44.220> they<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.550> done<00:02:44.580> good<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.240> history<00:02:45.960> so

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
that they have done good in history so

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.740 
that they have done good in history so
they're<00:02:46.830> going<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> go<00:02:47.160> there<00:02:47.460> more<00:02:47.970> likely<00:02:48.240> on

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
they're going to go there more likely on

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.950 
they're going to go there more likely on
each<00:02:49.530> round<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.760> if<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.390> get<00:02:51.540> killed<00:02:51.780> in

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
each round so and if you get killed in

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.810 
each round so and if you get killed in
one<00:02:52.080> place<00:02:52.320> go<00:02:52.740> back<00:02:52.980> there<00:02:53.250> maybe<00:02:53.550> try

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
one place go back there maybe try

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.630 
one place go back there maybe try
separate<00:02:54.240> route<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.770> you<00:02:55.770> can<00:02:55.920> probably<00:02:56.160> kill

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
separate route and you can probably kill

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.850 
separate route and you can probably kill
them<00:02:56.790> oh<00:02:57.000> my<00:02:57.930> goodness<00:02:58.110> look<00:02:58.470> at<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.620> kid
