00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.500
 hello to all guys welcome to this one 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.119
 new fan review video 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.919
 italia.com 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.090
 Also today I speak of a cydia tweak 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:34.660
 we are talking about pluck a calino tweak 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.300
 nice quite interesting though not 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.059
 necessarily useful to everyone what goes 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.410
 plug in substance as you see adds a 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.120
 omino in the settings of ios and one 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.109
 once activated by the first entry 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.609
 practically allows us to choose 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.519
 when we are playing a song 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:57.370
 even when we are not reproducing it 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.899
 to change tracks directly from 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.059
 lock screen 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.269
 as you can see I had the key twice 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:08.020
 home to detect to reveal sorry i 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.229
 musical checks and as you can see 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.720
 there is this little button that a novelty that 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.900
 we don't find on the original iphone and it is 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.570
 just the only novelty of plates then 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.600
 if I press the key and then press 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.910
 this button practically has the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.590
 possibility to choose another song 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.630
 to be played directly from 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.610
 lock screen without therefore having to 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.470
 unlock the iphone and log in 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.680
 to the music application which is a lot 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.230
 useful because especially when 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.570
 use a lock code and then 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.880
 obliges the user to enter this 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.800
 code the process gets sleep has 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.140
 speeded up a lot and gets a lot 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.140
 very simple so if for example me 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.780
 I choose this song 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.070
 as you can see, it changes immediately, now I do 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.940
 listen for a moment that the music in 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.940
 reproduction 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.870
 and if I reproduce if I do the same 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.520
 action once again in short we choose 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.989
 another one 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.989
 any areas I have no idea 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.400
 these are charged with a smash 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.769
 so they take a few seconds to 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.519
 of course if you have the song 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.849
 saved locally on the iPhone part 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.190
 immediately so this is one of the two 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.019
 plug functions a lot 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.680
 interesting that by activating this 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.080
 second option p many paul songs 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.170
 we can practically create a species 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.250
 of reproduction tail a bit like 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:48.599
 happens on itunes 11 and with this last one 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.200
 button we move the switch to 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.579
 pluck on the right now I'll show you 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.650
 you see now it's on the right in short 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.959
 as appropriate, as you are 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.120
 better we say that if you use 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.400
 the iphone with the right hand maybe the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.510
 button on the right will be more comfortable 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.250
 if you use it with your left hand 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.650
 probably on the left with the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.390
 inch you get there better I do 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.560
 see the second function of which 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.019
 I was talking about a reproduction this passage e 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.480
 I want to add more than one 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.120
 so for example I want to put everything 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.600
 a song all an album being played 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:30.630
 to any one I select 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:34.049
 more songs we see should go not 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.340
 I know why he's not taking these well 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.819
 these tracks 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.620
 however we see the first game there 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.079
 secondly, there are so there are 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.480
 really just a graphic error 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.859
 we have seen them put now 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.049
 selected for the cia in the tweet 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.430
 works by the way if I go back 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.489
 I should come back 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.549
 no it doesn't work that way anyway 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.109
 this is pluck a shortcut to the 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.720
 lock screen that allows you to 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.870
 select the music to play on 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.049
 tweak available for free on cydia 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.209
 in the modmyi repository if you are 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.280
 interested in low cost and just download 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.440
 try it and see a bit if you are 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.780
 like it or not and if it's worth keeping it 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.250
 on your iphone or if it's better 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.680
 use the classic application 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.540
 music to manage music in 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.430
 reproduction 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.710
 even for today it's all a greeting from 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.710
