some of the characters so first off we

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.310 
some of the characters so first off we
got<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> jagwire<00:00:35.660> he<00:00:36.660> looks<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.930> little<00:00:37.079> bit

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
got the jagwire he looks a little bit

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.970 
got the jagwire he looks a little bit
like<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:39.210> character<00:00:39.930> from<00:00:40.050> AC<00:00:40.260> 3<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> forgot

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
like the character from AC 3 I forgot

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.770 
like the character from AC 3 I forgot
his<00:00:41.070> name<00:00:41.100> uses<00:00:41.520> DLC<00:00:41.879> character<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.329> well<00:00:42.480> but

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
his name uses DLC character as well but

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.869 
his name uses DLC character as well but
I<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.200> he's<00:00:43.500> different<00:00:43.710> he<00:00:44.399> certainly

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
I think he's different he certainly

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.910 
I think he's different he certainly
doesn't<00:00:45.180> look<00:00:45.420> exactly<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.590> he<00:00:46.680> doesn't

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
doesn't look exactly like and he doesn't

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.190 
doesn't look exactly like and he doesn't
do<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> same<00:00:47.280> moves<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.960> looking<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> little

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
do the same moves but looking a little

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
regular animation but um I think the

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.590 
regular animation but um I think the
