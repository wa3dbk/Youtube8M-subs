stuff especially considering there's

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.580 
stuff especially considering there's
been<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> bit<00:03:55.239> of<00:03:55.269> racism<00:03:55.720> card<00:03:56.079> brought<00:03:56.350> into

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
been a bit of racism card brought into

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.009 
been a bit of racism card brought into
it<00:03:56.709> which<00:03:56.859> is<00:03:57.040> always<00:03:57.459> fairly<00:03:57.880> unsavory<00:03:58.299> what

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
it which is always fairly unsavory what

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.390 
it which is always fairly unsavory what
do<00:03:59.079> you<00:03:59.109> think<00:03:59.200> potentially<00:03:59.709> it's<00:04:00.070> good<00:04:00.250> for

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
do you think potentially it's good for

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.009 
do you think potentially it's good for
boxing<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.090> many<00:04:01.180> people<00:04:01.299> are<00:04:01.630> now

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
boxing that so many people are now

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.190 
boxing that so many people are now
talking<00:04:02.290> about<00:04:02.590> their<00:04:02.739> rivalry<00:04:03.160> yeah<00:04:04.200> yeah

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
talking about their rivalry yeah yeah

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.990 
talking about their rivalry yeah yeah
that's<00:04:05.470> why<00:04:05.859> mundane<00:04:06.310> promotes<00:04:06.760> that

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
that's why mundane promotes that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.300 
that's why mundane promotes that
promotes<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.810> fights<00:04:08.049> like<00:04:08.290> he<00:04:08.440> talks<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:09.160> lot

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
promotes the fights like he talks a lot

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.550 
promotes the fights like he talks a lot
but<00:04:09.340> maybe<00:04:10.269> on<00:04:10.480> this<00:04:10.630> occasion<00:04:11.170> he's<00:04:11.320> just

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
but maybe on this occasion he's just

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.319 
but maybe on this occasion he's just
probably<00:04:11.889> cross<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.459> line<00:04:12.639> a<00:04:12.669> little<00:04:12.760> bit<00:04:13.000> too

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
probably cross the line a little bit too

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.350 
probably cross the line a little bit too
much<00:04:13.510> like<00:04:13.810> these

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
much like these

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.410 
much like these
attracted<00:04:16.360> a<00:04:16.600> lot<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.870> negative<00:04:17.470> attention<00:04:18.420> to

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
attracted a lot of negative attention to

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.080 
attracted a lot of negative attention to
himself<00:04:20.190> there's<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.250> lot<00:04:21.519> of<00:04:21.549> attention<00:04:22.060> to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090
