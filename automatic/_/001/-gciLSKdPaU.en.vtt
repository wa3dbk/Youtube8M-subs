00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:08.210
 hi everyone knows barrel 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.190
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.440
 new test 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.700
 so here we will meet for the test 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.210
 al fakher liquorist so attack 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.580
 licorice so we have a box that is 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.910
 kind of huge a little bit of each package 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.070
 a gray box with a tea seller 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.590
 Moroccan on it we do not understand it is necessary 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.360
 not looking very very far 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.190
 here I do not understand the box 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.980
 so here I do not understand the box 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.470
 it's impressive but good so 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.110
 Liquorist in fact it's al fakher 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.540
 licorice then it's not the double apple 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.250
 this is the al fakher licorice it's at 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.690
 our al fakher and we'll see what 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.050
 so gives a 50 grams bought on his 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:03.320
 mocha rise the base days we will feel 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:05.000
 that then we have an odor we have a 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.799
 smell of liquorice but which is getting closer 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.600
 really with liquorice not licorice 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.590
 candy but more natural licorice I 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.020
 want to say that like that makes me think of 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.600
 past tasted yellow boxes round 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.590
 with small car and liquorice 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.659
 call the penalties the dungeons here is so 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.729
 where their church on natural stick is 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.770
 really what this smell sas had 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.549
 recalled every month on a range of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.900
 licorice have a really strong taste and to 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.650
 the smell we know a little sweet note 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:44.119
 but we are really on a x10 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:47.630
 so pretty strong but we do not stay 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.549
 too chemical enough natural anyway 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.369
 this is for lovers of liquorice 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.439
 really that julie slip pure there there we 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.750
 is certain in any case the smell that so 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.100
 in 3d a very good smell gionis she 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.530
 is really different from that of 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.759
 double like this double skin skirt but 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.310
 the chemical pages but she gets 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.770
 closer to the regis quite sweet not 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.660
 pretty strong at the level of taste there we are 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.090
 more to the slide really 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.710
 with a really strong strong natural taste 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.320
 to stop this not too sweet it's a little 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.560
 complicated what I say but it's necessary 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.450
 taste candies made from natural gas 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:29.970
 what really to this bouquet that premium 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:34.650
 so will be for the test we end up 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:39.480
 his lines at 8 o'clock always with the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.250
 base the cioc has a focus 5h05 the case 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.740
 loudes 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.010
 the cloud is inside 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.900
 so that's pretty paul let go 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.820
 of this stage and coal I put 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.180
 three coconut bricks in the Caribbean 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.330
 technical god no monkey peeled but 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.330
 good 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.209
 actually formed three charming at home in 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.440
 an August call for example it's because 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.349
 he really wanted to warm up 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.209
 long enough diverted once well 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.890
 let heat for the coal 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.520
 shrink slightly for entries 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.450
 the three of a sudden 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.849
 good a technique me I do not want it 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.959
 works well anyway but there you go 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.360
 here 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.800
 let's go back on the test so I 'm going to smoke 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.800
 I tell you a little impression on 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:01.430
 frankly we have a taste that takes us 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.760
 really very very good really well the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.470
 good mouth and we really 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.660
 its loyal to gold exists one has a taste 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.049
 strong really strong game again in 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.660
 mouth there a strong taste of licorice 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.549
 but natural really not chemical the 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.630
 all this is a very good advantage 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.979
 for second not chemical for me 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.000
 I appreciate just about every taste this 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.440
 licorice frankly it is rather not 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.660
 wrong even though I prefer it slightly 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.639
 double apple one has a taste that is pretty 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:37.700
 very natural frankly frankly they 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.919
 have made the taste of risk very well 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.870
 natural 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.330
 on the other hand I think that tobacco holds 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.039
 very good shf but a slight 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.350
 sensitivity so be very careful 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:52.430
 that's where I think I put it 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.139
 close 15 15 g of taste here but good 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.660
 pay attention to the seven heater 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.030
 cats but frankly where we have a gouge 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.280
 really strong liquorice not too sweet 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.470
 really a bit sweet compared to double 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.560
 apple but we have a very good taste of 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:27.820
 liquorice nothing to say 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:31.060
 I still smoked 3 lat and frankly 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.690
 nothing to say that we really have this taste of 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.270
 licorice very well done so again 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.310
 Jury lovers glide like the double 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.040
 apple that I consider a tobacco of 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.380
 basic basis like the sale dedication 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.229
 not believe 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.030
 there the base is the base frankly 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.360
 if you are you like these notes of 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.610
 licorice 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.270
 there we really have a tobacco a china 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.430
 ivory I think this is al fakher 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.790
 who will recreate a maximum of their church 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.860
 by pure here against slight defects 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.700
 as I said it was that this tobacco and 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.100
 not too sweet but my big advantage 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.780
 who really not chemical at all good 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.780
 after that it's a good thing about tobaccos 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.090
 alfacar but really not chemical 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.890
