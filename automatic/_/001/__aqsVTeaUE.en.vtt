see<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.190> again<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.550> slow-mo<00:00:36.300> let's<00:00:36.510> see<00:00:36.660> if

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
see that again in slow-mo let's see if

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
see that again in slow-mo let's see if
lightning<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.410> actually<00:00:37.590> hits<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.520> truck

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
lightning really actually hits the truck

so the Lightning comes down you see it

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.630 
so the Lightning comes down you see it
kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> goes<00:00:40.710> around<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.280> then<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.489> just

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
kind of goes around and then it just

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.850 
kind of goes around and then it just
thing<00:00:42.300> explodes<00:00:42.899> well<00:00:43.440> believe<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.710> or<00:00:43.770> not

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
thing explodes well believe it or not

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860 
thing explodes well believe it or not
cases<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.579> are<00:00:44.730> actually<00:00:44.969> rare<00:00:45.510> due<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
cases like this are actually rare due to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.150 
cases like this are actually rare due to
the<00:00:46.020> fact<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:46.559> you're<00:00:46.680> driving<00:00:46.920> you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the fact that when you're driving you

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.340 
the fact that when you're driving you
have<00:00:47.340> rubber<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.090> tires<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.870> obviously

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
have rubber on your tires and obviously

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.720 
have rubber on your tires and obviously
that<00:00:49.559> doesn't<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:49.920> conduct<00:00:50.340> good

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that doesn't really conduct good

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
that doesn't really conduct good
electricity<00:00:51.420> good<00:00:51.629> science<00:00:52.079> lesson<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.590> this

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
electricity good science lesson so this

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.500 
electricity good science lesson so this
