00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.579
 hello everyone I'm here in another video 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.809
 more and good today's video will try 

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:09.809
 about my haircut 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.830
 Well, the truth was that it was not because 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.650
 I really would like because I always 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.080
 loved the mane and had it about 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.090
 short years and the short and then I 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.240
 I regret a lot of having cut it 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.980
 because I had not grown up but I mean 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.769
 that this time I'm super happy with 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.690
 the haircut that I'm comfortable 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.550
 very comfortable and good and tell you what to see 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.410
 that my situation more than anything was so 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.360
 that a need before obviously 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.699
 We have been through a pregnancy 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.629
 gone through a stage of physical changes 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.640
 and hormonal changes then I already 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.479
 I came to an extreme to see you mine 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.110
 good everywhere I was overwhelmed I was going 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:00.570
 to hate knows how to develop my hair to hate 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.540
 everything then I chose myself I decided to cut myself 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.580
 the hair is to say I have given birth and the 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.900
 first months that they said to me and yes that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.909
 you will do a lot but I do not 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.130
 I had believed it because I had 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.010
 lots of hair that has not fallen 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.220
 or anything but after a few months to 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.040
 here she read like a 6 months and at 6 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.620
 in the light then well, it started 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.290
 to notice that I was running out of hair around here and 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.480
 below this area especially and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.720
 here and good and to this day because I 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.700
 I see and the truth that has grown me grows 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.270
 it grows pretty fast 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.360
 but I see that my bangs are missing 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.400
 that I had before and what I 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.550
 I liked 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.530
 but I have to tell you that the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.600
 path has been very radical seen from 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.530
 forward from behind and because I cut 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.530
 a good layer 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.610
 I do not know if you can appreciate it there 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.869
 and it's worth 3 and from the back, yes, but 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.480
 later my friend and hairdresser told me 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.720
 he said what 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.790
 that cut it like this 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.790
 over here where the jaw 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.470
 because I have a pretty round face 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.530
 and good and then well well I do not know 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.380
 would make the maradona effect even more 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.600
 still then so it lengthens me a 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.820
 little I stylized a little more the face and 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.710
 after this area here then the same 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.450
 then of course you will have the 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.670
 bangs like I had before and everything is not 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.360
 it's a change there so much elastic we have 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.450
 start a straight short fringe or if 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.010
 will cut all this then it is a change 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.380
 that does not impact much on my face 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.900
 so then good option that I liked 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.020
 much and the truth then is to clean up the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.960
 hair so great I made some wicks 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.960
 Californian here at the tips and 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.420
 he did and well I'm very happy with 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.790
 my change that is super comfortable and about 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.430
 everything now with a baby that I always 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.400
 she said she does not melena morena but bueno 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.970
 I am very comfortable and tell you here at 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.930
 what have you given 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.030
 recently how good that at the beginning 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.410
 maybe you will not notice the changes and if 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.570
 then note them since you have 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.250
 a lot of hair and such then then also 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.960
 nowadays there are many remedies and 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.570
 Even if you cut your hair, as always 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.790
 I say the hair grows so nothing else 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.620
 from here a very strong kiss to all and 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.620
 see you next video chao
