I'll put that link to that review down
there<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.949> do<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.640> another<00:00:24.380> Black

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.980 
there but I do have another Black
Diamond<00:00:25.619> headlamp<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> really<00:00:27.090> enjoy<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
Diamond headlamp that I really enjoy and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.769 
Diamond headlamp that I really enjoy and
I<00:00:28.949> definitely<00:00:29.130> got<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.760> specific<00:00:30.330> reasons

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
I definitely got it for specific reasons

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.490 
I definitely got it for specific reasons
and<00:00:30.990> that's<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.380> Black<00:00:31.590> Diamond<00:00:31.859> storm<00:00:33.500> Black

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and that's the Black Diamond storm Black

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.959 
and that's the Black Diamond storm Black
Diamond<00:00:34.710> storm<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:36.000> main<00:00:36.210> reason<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.750> got<00:00:36.899> this

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
Diamond storm the main reason I got this

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.410 
Diamond storm the main reason I got this
headlamp<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.960> what's<00:00:40.680> called<00:00:40.920> ipx7<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
headlamp is it is what's called ipx7 and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.639 
headlamp is it is what's called ipx7 and
it's<00:00:42.750> waterproof<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:45.410> sometimes<00:00:46.410> when<00:00:46.620> I'm

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it's waterproof so sometimes when I'm

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.799 
it's waterproof so sometimes when I'm
out<00:00:46.920> hunting<00:00:47.520> especially<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.210> duck<00:00:48.420> hunting

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
and we're traveling across and this is

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.869 
and we're traveling across and this is
actually<00:00:52.680> happened<00:00:53.160> we've<00:00:53.309> been<00:00:53.520> traveling

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
actually happened we've been traveling

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.389 
actually happened we've been traveling
across<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> lake<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:54.899> pouring<00:00:55.680> rain

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
across the lake and just pouring rain

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.049 
across the lake and just pouring rain
and<00:00:56.430> storm<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.510> everything<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.350> had<00:00:59.059> was

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and storm and everything that we had was

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.200 
and storm and everything that we had was
getting<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:01.109> soaked<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.579> fact<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.910> had<00:01:03.059> my

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
getting just soaked and in fact I had my

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.690 
getting just soaked and in fact I had my
life<00:01:03.420> preserver<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> life<00:01:04.979> jacket<00:01:05.280> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
life preserver have a life jacket that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.200 
life preserver have a life jacket that
has<00:01:05.880> an<00:01:06.119> automatic<00:01:06.830> inflate<00:01:07.830> water<00:01:08.760> sensitive

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
has an automatic inflate water sensitive

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.940 
has an automatic inflate water sensitive
and<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.439> actually<00:01:10.799> blew<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.280> its<00:01:11.460> own<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
and it actually blew on its own so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.640 
and it actually blew on its own so
that's<00:01:13.950> out<00:01:14.189> what<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.960> wanted<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that's out what it was but I wanted to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.130 
that's out what it was but I wanted to
have<00:01:16.799> something<00:01:17.390> plus<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.900> other

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
have something plus we also have other

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.200 
have something plus we also have other
other<00:01:19.680> boats<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> are<00:01:20.280> traveling<00:01:20.580> around<00:01:20.820> in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
other boats that are traveling around in

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.719 
other boats that are traveling around in
the<00:01:21.270> dark<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.530> wanted<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> get<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> super

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the dark so I wanted to get a super

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.109 
the dark so I wanted to get a super
bright<00:01:25.040> headlamp<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.220> was<00:01:26.340> waterproof<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
bright headlamp that was waterproof and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.469 
bright headlamp that was waterproof and
that's<00:01:27.299> what<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.659> storm<00:01:28.100> is<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.270> think

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that's what this storm is and I think

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.380 
that's what this storm is and I think
it's<00:01:30.750> intention<00:01:31.380> was<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:32.100> runners<00:01:32.579> so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it's intention was for like runners so

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.240 
it's intention was for like runners so
if<00:01:33.540> they're<00:01:33.689> running<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> rain<00:01:35.869> this<00:01:36.869> is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
if they're running in the rain this is

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.950 
if they're running in the rain this is
designed<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.490> out<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.390> type<00:01:39.689> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
designed to be out in that type of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.289 
designed to be out in that type of
weather<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.939> what's<00:01:42.119> called

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
weather this one here is what's called

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.789 
weather this one here is what's called
ipx4

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
ipx4

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.609 
ipx4
and<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> water<00:01:45.420> resistant<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.530> know

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and so it is water resistant or you know

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.710 
and so it is water resistant or you know
it<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.890> take<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.490> take<00:01:47.700> some<00:01:48.000> light<00:01:48.420> rain

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
it can take you can take some light rain

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560 
it can take you can take some light rain
or<00:01:48.750> drizzle<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.970> fine<00:01:51.329> with

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
or drizzle and it's it's it's fine with

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.899 
or drizzle and it's it's it's fine with
that

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
that

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.090 
that
but<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.570> one<00:01:53.749> is<00:01:53.840> actually<00:01:53.990> designed<00:01:54.499> as<00:01:54.920> a

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
but this one is actually designed as a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.520 
but this one is actually designed as a
lot<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.429> proof<00:01:55.609> unit<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:56.810> can<00:01:56.960> see<00:01:57.170> right

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
lot of proof unit and you can see right

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.209 
lot of proof unit and you can see right
here<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:58.189> has<00:01:58.539> even<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.719> knurled<00:02:00.219> battery

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
here it has even a knurled battery

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.959 
here it has even a knurled battery
compartment<00:02:02.200> cover<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.310> seals<00:02:04.670> up

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
compartment cover and so it seals up

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.789 
compartment cover and so it seals up
really<00:02:05.539> well<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.579> that<00:02:07.579> is<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.450> inside<00:02:09.349> and

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
really well so that is the inside and

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.190 
really well so that is the inside and
it's<00:02:10.009> all<00:02:10.459> gasketed<00:02:11.420> all<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.750> way<00:02:11.840> around

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
it's all gasketed all the way around

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.550 
it's all gasketed all the way around
really<00:02:12.680> tight<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:14.269> more<00:02:14.540> waterproof<00:02:15.200> and

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
really tight so it's more waterproof and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.240 
really tight so it's more waterproof and
it<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.640> their<00:02:17.150> most<00:02:17.390> powerful<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.980> they<00:02:19.099> have

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
it is their most powerful that they have

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.190 
it is their most powerful that they have
this<00:02:19.489> one<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:19.879> hundred<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.390> sixty<00:02:20.810> lumens

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
this one is a hundred and sixty lumens

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.770 
this one is a hundred and sixty lumens
and<00:02:21.319> I<00:02:21.379> think<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.769> one's<00:02:22.030> 110<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:25.660> but<00:02:26.660> it

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
and I think this one's 110 so but it

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.729 
and I think this one's 110 so but it
also<00:02:27.129> has<00:02:28.129> four<00:02:28.959> batteries<00:02:29.959> where<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.470> has

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
also has four batteries where this has

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.869 
also has four batteries where this has
three<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.989> rechargeable<00:02:33.879> unit

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
three and this is the rechargeable unit

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.600 
three and this is the rechargeable unit
but<00:02:35.239> this<00:02:35.390> takes<00:02:36.079> four<00:02:36.379> batteries<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.430> can

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
but this takes four batteries so you can

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.740 
but this takes four batteries so you can
actually<00:02:37.760> there's<00:02:38.030> three<00:02:38.120> then<00:02:38.510> there's<00:02:38.690> a

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
actually there's three then there's a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.360 
actually there's three then there's a
fourth<00:02:39.110> one<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.220> very<00:02:40.489> back<00:02:41.049> but<00:02:42.220> we<00:02:43.220> go

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
fourth one in the very back but we go

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.339 
fourth one in the very back but we go
this<00:02:43.549> one<00:02:43.730> here<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.510> definitely<00:02:45.140> use<00:02:45.260> this

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
this one here I definitely use this

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.160 
this one here I definitely use this
specifically<00:02:45.950> when<00:02:46.879> I'm<00:02:47.030> hunting<00:02:47.299> that's

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
specifically when I'm hunting that's

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.330 
specifically when I'm hunting that's
what<00:02:48.349> I<00:02:48.379> keep<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.799> for<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.829> that's<00:02:51.980> what<00:02:52.129> I<00:02:52.190> use

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
what I keep it for and that's what I use

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.330 
what I keep it for and that's what I use
it<00:02:52.489> for<00:02:52.700> primarily<00:02:53.329> this<00:02:54.049> this<00:02:54.470> model<00:02:54.890> here<00:02:55.220> is

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
it for primarily this this model here is

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.300 
it for primarily this this model here is
about<00:02:55.549> two<00:02:55.940> years<00:02:56.150> old<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.069> has<00:02:58.220> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
about two years old but it has the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.170 
about two years old but it has the
there's<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.519> spot<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.359> that's<00:03:02.540> 160<00:03:03.139> lumens

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
there's a spot and that's 160 lumens

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.500 
there's a spot and that's 160 lumens
and<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.109> one's<00:03:06.349> 110<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.790> I've<00:03:07.909> both

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
and so this one's 110 like I've both

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.819 
and so this one's 110 like I've both
fired<00:03:08.810> up<00:03:08.959> here<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:11.379> you<00:03:12.379> know<00:03:12.500> they're<00:03:12.650> both

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
fired up here so you know they're both

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.899 
fired up here so you know they're both
bright<00:03:13.129> in<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.340> camera<00:03:13.819> but<00:03:14.030> but<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:16.010> this<00:03:16.159> 160

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
bright in a camera but but so this 160

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.679 
bright in a camera but but so this 160
lumens<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:18.049> can<00:03:18.200> hold<00:03:18.409> it<00:03:18.560> down<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.689> dim

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 
lumens and you can hold it down and dim

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.789 
lumens and you can hold it down and dim
it<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:21.549> think<00:03:22.549> it's<00:03:22.700> out<00:03:22.790> of<00:03:22.819> 25<00:03:23.420> lumens<00:03:23.719> hold<00:03:24.620> it

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
it I think it's out of 25 lumens hold it

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.490 
it I think it's out of 25 lumens hold it
down<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.370> comes<00:03:25.579> back<00:03:25.819> up<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:26.930> can<00:03:27.079> dim

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
down and it comes back up so you can dim

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.819 
down and it comes back up so you can dim
it<00:03:27.530> then<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.579> can<00:03:28.730> go<00:03:28.879> to<00:03:28.939> the<00:03:29.329> two<00:03:29.599> LEDs<00:03:30.349> on

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
it then you can go to the two LEDs on

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:37.100 
it then you can go to the two LEDs on
the<00:03:30.859> side<00:03:31.689> and<00:03:32.689> they<00:03:32.870> do

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.820 

and<00:03:37.590> shirt<00:03:37.890> off<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.400> we'll<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.730> down<00:03:38.940> get<00:03:39.600> your

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
and shirt off and we'll it down get your

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:47.120 
and shirt off and we'll it down get your
double<00:03:40.830> Reds<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.800> so<00:03:44.340> that's<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:46.130> that's

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
double Reds and so that's is that's

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.800 
double Reds and so that's is that's
that's<00:03:47.580> always<00:03:47.880> been<00:03:48.150> that's<00:03:48.360> always<00:03:48.570> my

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
that's always been that's always my

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.200 
that's always been that's always my
requirement<00:03:49.440> when<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.590> comes<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:50.040> these<00:03:51.000> have

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
requirement when it comes to these have

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.210 
requirement when it comes to these have
apps<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.690> I've<00:03:51.840> gotta<00:03:52.050> have<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.740> lease<00:03:52.950> those

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
apps is I've gotta have to lease those

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.680 
apps is I've gotta have to lease those
three<00:03:53.520> features<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:54.990> is<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.650> little<00:03:55.980> bit

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
three features this one is a little bit

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.020 
three features this one is a little bit
heavier<00:03:57.980> because<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.460> the<00:03:59.760> fourth

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
heavier because of the the fourth

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.530 
heavier because of the the fourth
battery<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:02.610> see<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:02.910> thing<00:04:03.000> if<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.270> here

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
battery and you see the thing if I here

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.870 
battery and you see the thing if I here
or<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.220> three<00:04:08.520> point<00:04:08.790> nine

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
or so it is this is three point nine

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.610 
or so it is this is three point nine
ounces<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.880> it<00:04:11.880> has<00:04:12.330> that<00:04:12.480> extra<00:04:12.660> battery<00:04:13.170> but

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
ounces so it has that extra battery but

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.610 
ounces so it has that extra battery but
it<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.830> a<00:04:13.860> it's<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.460> great<00:04:14.610> headlamp<00:04:15.540> as<00:04:15.900> on<00:04:16.380> the

real nice headband that might that might

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.680 
real nice headband that might that might
revolt<00:04:20.010> has<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:24.060> know<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:24.450> it's

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
revolt has and and you know it's it's

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.490 
revolt has and and you know it's it's
one<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:24.990> know<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.530> can<00:04:25.800> depend<00:04:25.950> on<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.870> really

one I know I can depend on and in really

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.050 
one I know I can depend on and in really
serious<00:04:28.890> started<00:04:29.430> conditions<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:29.940> know

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
serious started conditions I know

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.190 
serious started conditions I know
there's<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.270> lot<00:04:30.360> of<00:04:30.510> guys<00:04:30.720> out<00:04:30.900> there<00:04:30.960> that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
there's a lot of guys out there that

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.640 
there's a lot of guys out there that
hunt<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:33.510> like<00:04:33.960> if<00:04:34.080> you're<00:04:34.230> out<00:04:34.320> tracking

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
hunt and like if you're out tracking

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.160 
hunt and like if you're out tracking
deer<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.520> you've<00:04:35.610> got<00:04:35.790> reflectors<00:04:36.450> up<00:04:36.870> on

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
deer and you've got reflectors up on

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.120 
deer and you've got reflectors up on
trees

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.290 

but<00:04:43.730> if<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:44.030> if<00:04:44.450> you<00:04:44.750> need<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:46.030> look<00:04:47.030> for<00:04:47.210> those

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
but if you if you need to look for those

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.600 
but if you if you need to look for those
those<00:04:47.780> reflectors<00:04:48.320> far<00:04:48.650> away<00:04:48.920> when<00:04:49.490> your

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
those reflectors far away when your

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.490 
those reflectors far away when your
tracking<00:04:49.850> gear<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.720> one<00:04:50.900> has<00:04:51.020> that<00:04:51.230> that

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
tracking gear this one has that that

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.720 
tracking gear this one has that that
power<00:04:51.740> output<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:54.380> think<00:04:54.830> you<00:04:55.520> know<00:04:55.610> the

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
power output that I think you know the

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.330 
power output that I think you know the
deer<00:04:55.940> hunters<00:04:56.240> would<00:04:56.420> like<00:04:56.630> as<00:04:56.960> well<00:04:57.260> so<00:04:58.040> I
