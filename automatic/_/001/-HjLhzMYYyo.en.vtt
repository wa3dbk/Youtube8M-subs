pencils<00:00:14.639> intense<00:00:15.639> pencils<00:00:16.119> were<00:00:16.299> from<00:00:16.480> the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
pencils intense pencils were from the

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.720 
pencils intense pencils were from the
same<00:00:16.720> principle<00:00:17.259> as<00:00:17.349> watercolor<00:00:17.830> pencils<00:00:18.310> the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
same principle as watercolor pencils the

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.010 
same principle as watercolor pencils the
difference<00:00:19.119> is<00:00:19.270> that<00:00:19.419> when<00:00:19.570> you<00:00:19.689> add<00:00:19.840> water

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
difference is that when you add water

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.550 
difference is that when you add water
you're<00:00:20.350> producing<00:00:20.619> ink<00:00:21.010> not<00:00:21.460> watercolor<00:00:22.560> when

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
you're producing ink not watercolor when

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.800 
you're producing ink not watercolor when
dry<00:00:23.830> ink<00:00:24.130> pens<00:00:24.400> pencils<00:00:24.699> are<00:00:25.119> permanent<00:00:25.570> and

dry ink pens pencils are permanent and

waterproof can't lift the color

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.570 
waterproof can't lift the color
subsequently<00:00:29.260> and<00:00:29.529> she<00:00:29.740> can<00:00:29.949> with<00:00:30.099> watercolor

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
witless version of the pencil produces a

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:40.350 
witless version of the pencil produces a
different<00:00:38.830> range<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.159> marks<00:00:39.610> but<00:00:40.030> it's<00:00:40.239> the

different range of marks but it's the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.630 
different range of marks but it's the

this<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.410> still<00:02:37.590> wet<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.010> need<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.430> working

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
this is still wet I need to be working

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.890 
this is still wet I need to be working
with<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.000> dry<00:02:39.380> intense<00:02:40.380> into<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.920> wet

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
with the dry intense into the wet

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:58.500 
with the dry intense into the wet
produces<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> soft

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.670 

working<00:02:59.510> with<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> pencil<00:02:59.930> will<00:03:00.230> give<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.470> much

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
working with a pencil will give you much

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.280 
working with a pencil will give you much
finer<00:03:01.010> life<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.980> with<00:03:04.330> working<00:03:05.330> into<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.810> then

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
finer life but with working into it then

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.220 
finer life but with working into it then
there<00:03:06.470> my<00:03:06.620> lens<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.520> it's<00:03:07.760> broader<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.420> knew

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
there my lens and it's broader I knew

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.830 
there my lens and it's broader I knew
when<00:03:09.380> you're<00:03:09.500> working<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.370> very<00:03:10.580> dry<00:03:10.910> very
