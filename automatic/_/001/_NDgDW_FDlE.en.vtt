right<00:01:53.280> about<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:54.049> draw<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.140> through<00:01:55.320> just

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
right about that draw it through just

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.319 
right about that draw it through just
like<00:01:55.710> before<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.869> continue<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.740> manner

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.109 

and<00:02:03.329> starting<00:02:03.780> under<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> last<00:02:04.500> strand<00:02:05.119> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
then pulling it right through

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.249 
then pulling it right through
so<00:02:08.580> there's<00:02:08.819> your<00:02:08.970> stitch<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.750> pop<00:02:10.080> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so there's your stitch you can pop it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.640 
so there's your stitch you can pop it
right<00:02:10.289> back<00:02:10.470> onto<00:02:10.950> your<00:02:11.129> left<00:02:11.250> needle

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
right back onto your left needle

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.670 
right back onto your left needle
it's<00:02:13.340> like<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.730> never<00:02:14.060> happened<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:15.019> that's<00:02:15.410> in

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
it's like it never happened so that's in

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.860 
it's like it never happened so that's in
stockinette<00:02:16.250> stitch<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.720> stitch

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
stockinette stitch this is the stitch

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.170 
stockinette stitch this is the stitch
that<00:02:18.110> we<00:02:18.379> dropped<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:19.280> looks<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.640> same<00:02:19.849> as<00:02:20.060> it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
that we dropped it looks the same as it

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.740 
that we dropped it looks the same as it
did<00:02:20.300> before<00:02:20.410> which<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.560> good<00:02:22.000> now<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.060> will<00:02:23.540> do

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
did before which is good now we will do

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.050 
did before which is good now we will do
a<00:02:24.019> fix<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.860> garter<00:02:25.220> stitch<00:02:25.250> which<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> little

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
a fix in garter stitch which is a little

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.400 
a fix in garter stitch which is a little
bit<00:02:26.150> different<00:02:26.540> because<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:27.019> garter<00:02:27.319> stitch

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
bit different because in garter stitch

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.320 
bit different because in garter stitch
you<00:02:30.410> have<00:02:30.440> bumps<00:02:31.160> on<00:02:31.280> either<00:02:31.459> side<00:02:31.879> it's<00:02:32.150> just

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
you have bumps on either side it's just

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.850 
you have bumps on either side it's just
not<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.690> smooth<00:02:33.019> piece<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.470> knitting<00:02:33.620> like

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
not one smooth piece of knitting like

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.440 
not one smooth piece of knitting like
stockinette<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:34.879> if<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.150> could<00:02:35.330> be

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
stockinette is so if you could be

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.660 
stockinette is so if you could be

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
stitch drops off your needle and it

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.530 
stitch drops off your needle and it
falls<00:02:40.160> down<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.459> couple<00:02:40.790> rows<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:44.120> will<00:02:44.269> take

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
falls down a couple rows you will take

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.770 
falls down a couple rows you will take
your<00:02:44.930> hook<00:02:45.200> again<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:46.010> same<00:02:46.220> way<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:47.510> here's

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.589 
that we'll just put that back on the
hook<00:02:55.030> then<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.209> will<00:02:56.360> grab<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.900> Strand<00:02:57.379> above

hook then you will grab the Strand above

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.250 
hook then you will grab the Strand above
just<00:02:59.599> like<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.870> four<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.709> drop<00:03:01.010> through<00:03:02.260> now

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
just like the four and drop through now

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.960 
just like the four and drop through now
you'll<00:03:03.440> have<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.709> flip<00:03:03.920> sides<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.670> get<00:03:04.849> the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
you'll have to flip sides so you get the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.520 
you'll have to flip sides so you get the
bump<00:03:05.150> on<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:05.420> other<00:03:05.569> side<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.709> kind<00:03:07.280> of

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
bump on the other side so I kind of

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.229 
bump on the other side so I kind of
insert<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.739> hook<00:03:09.920> under<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.430> next<00:03:10.760> strand<00:03:10.879> of

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
insert the hook under the next strand of

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.990 
insert the hook under the next strand of
yarn<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:12.349> then<00:03:12.560> I'll<00:03:12.709> flip<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.489> around<00:03:13.579> and

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
yarn and then I'll flip it around and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.319 
yarn and then I'll flip it around and
change<00:03:14.299> hands<00:03:15.459> then<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.639> take<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.030> hook<00:03:17.180> out

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.789 
change hands then I take the hook out
and<00:03:17.600> then<00:03:17.720> coming<00:03:18.019> from<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:18.290> front<00:03:18.560> I'll

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
and then coming from the front I'll

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.819 
and then coming from the front I'll
insert<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.340> back<00:03:19.489> into<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:19.910> stitch<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.829> draw

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
insert it back into that stitch and draw

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.069 
insert it back into that stitch and draw
through<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.310> next<00:03:22.700> thread<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:25.190> that<00:03:26.079> then

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
through that next thread like that then

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.030 
through that next thread like that then
we'll<00:03:27.200> flip<00:03:27.350> it<00:03:27.410> around<00:03:27.560> again

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
we'll flip it around again

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.300 
we'll flip it around again
oh<00:03:31.810> my<00:03:32.810> hook<00:03:32.989> out<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.410> insert<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:33.889> again<00:03:34.069> from

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
oh my hook out and insert it again from

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.110 
oh my hook out and insert it again from
the<00:03:34.400> front<00:03:35.799> draw<00:03:36.799> through<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.160> next<00:03:37.459> one<00:03:40.120> like

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
the front draw through the next one like

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.839 
the front draw through the next one like
that<00:03:42.459> last<00:03:43.459> one

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
that last one

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.250 
that last one
flip<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.180> around<00:03:44.889> pull<00:03:45.889> out<00:03:45.950> your<00:03:46.130> hook<00:03:47.260> we

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
flip it around pull out your hook we

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.909 
flip it around pull out your hook we
insert<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.769> into<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.280> stitch<00:03:50.030> from<00:03:50.419> the<00:03:50.510> front

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
insert it into the stitch from the front

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:56.949 
insert it into the stitch from the front
hook<00:03:51.919> that<00:03:52.099> next<00:03:52.459> strand<00:03:54.519> that<00:03:55.810> loop<00:03:56.810> it

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
hook that next strand that loop it

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:57.940 
hook that next strand that loop it
around<00:03:57.139> one<00:03:57.349> more<00:03:57.500> time

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
around one more time

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.949 
around one more time
and<00:03:58.459> then<00:03:58.669> that<00:03:58.880> can<00:03:59.030> go<00:03:59.180> right<00:03:59.359> back<00:03:59.389> onto<00:03:59.780> the

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
and then that can go right back onto the

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.569 
and then that can go right back onto the
left<00:04:00.139> hand<00:04:00.349> needle<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:00.859> there's<00:04:01.130> our<00:04:01.310> drop

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
left hand needle so there's our drop

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.089 
left hand needle so there's our drop
stitching<00:04:02.030> garter<00:04:02.329> stitch<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:03.709> went<00:04:03.950> down

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
stitching garter stitch it went down

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.430 
stitching garter stitch it went down
maybe<00:04:04.310> four<00:04:04.639> or<00:04:04.669> five<00:04:04.760> rows<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:06.049> now<00:04:06.169> it<00:04:06.290> looks

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
maybe four or five rows and now it looks

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.009 
maybe four or five rows and now it looks
the<00:04:06.530> same<00:04:06.709> again<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:07.940> that's<00:04:08.359> it<00:04:08.660> it's<00:04:08.870> a

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
the same again so that's it it's a

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.949 
the same again so that's it it's a
simple<00:04:09.260> fix<00:04:10.120> if<00:04:11.120> you<00:04:11.239> have<00:04:11.389> any<00:04:11.569> questions

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
simple fix if you have any questions
