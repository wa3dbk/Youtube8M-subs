00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.840

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.590
 This is passion I do not have it long ago 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.590
 but good 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.880
 the college 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.880
 here I already put my wallpaper 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.700
 this is how the iphone comes so it comes 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.860

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.220

 Youtube 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.920
 look like to give you an idea what 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.920
 it's good I'm going to show you how to use 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.500
 before 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.200
 and it arrives here and this would be what they would be 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.710
 the settings of there are for example here 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.330
 new airplane wifi notifications by 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.310
 wallpaper that came to be the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.409
 home screen wallpaper when it is 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.800
 locked the ipod that would be the bottom of 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.440
 screen 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.270
 do not trust and do not think that it is the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.940
 wallpaper of this that is here 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.460
 back because for this they will need a 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.170
 Program 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.080
 same 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.920
 in another video I will upload it in any 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.020
 moment 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.299
 Do not be the problem at any time 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.799
 I upload the new video is how to change the 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:04.930
 wallpaper and the way to change 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.930
 and a couple of other things 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.290
 here they have to accommodate the brightness of 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.760
 sound and screens generate music video 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.760
 photos and everything there 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.130
 for example we will generate good 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:29.959
 here they have for the future location 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.409
 this location I think that what 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.409
 put 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.940
 on the road 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:46.780
 and I stayed with him 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:50.290
 this location and here I think that 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.709
 automatic keyboard in fact 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.140
 and give you an idea this guy is very 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.860
 well look here I have music for 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.610
 example 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.680
 and here you have all the music you want 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:11.010
 or artist all over 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:16.610
 it is the best thing that is here is very good 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.610
 but but last 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.630
 I would tell him at any time he is going to 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.360
 leave the program a low program 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.010
 more carelessness with which you can download 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.840
 many programs and you will 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.360
 Well, this is what is good 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.190
 here is for example the site 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.080
 with this program in the next videos 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.090
 I'm going to show you what it's for and 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.880
 give them an idea that suits them 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.870
 download if I do not like it very much 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.540
 have to pay for a game yes 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.310
 after obtaining it for free 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.310
 so look well you see 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.950
 what is it takes a lot in heat 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.310
 In Internet 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.720
 what's wrong with it 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.230
 games games whatever they want 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.590
 budgets 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.280
 look 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.840
 this is a free game but then I go 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.840
 to show one that 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.889
 this for example 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.700
 That's not very good game but now 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.380
 I'm like anti 9 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.780
 It is a very heavy game 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.729
 but the truth is that it is very good just 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.229
 I have downloaded yet 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.999
 but at any time I'm going to 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.999
 download is very good 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.969
 they have very good graphics and everything 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.110

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:59.339

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.339

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:09.560

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.120

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.200
 where my life was made with my ipod 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.200

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.560

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.320
 ipod 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.760
 it was not plugged into the computer 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.560
