because doctor said that he wasn't ever
gonna<00:02:27.260> walk<00:02:27.470> he<00:02:27.799> might<00:02:27.980> not<00:02:28.100> ever<00:02:28.250> walk<00:02:28.489> again

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
gonna walk he might not ever walk again

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.479 
gonna walk he might not ever walk again

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
and climbing into race car would that

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.289 
and climbing into race car would that
was<00:02:31.609> never<00:02:31.730> gonna<00:02:31.910> happen

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
was never gonna happen

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.270 
was never gonna happen
I<00:02:32.480> think<00:02:33.079> I<00:02:33.200> knew<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:34.000> mean<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.299> never<00:02:36.170> doubt<00:02:36.920> him

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
I think I knew I mean I never doubt him

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.819 
I think I knew I mean I never doubt him
because<00:02:38.180> he<00:02:38.359> could<00:02:38.510> just<00:02:38.720> pull<00:02:39.019> stuff<00:02:39.320> out<00:02:39.560> and

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
because he could just pull stuff out and

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.340 
because he could just pull stuff out and
you<00:02:40.310> know<00:02:40.579> not<00:02:40.820> because<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:41.359> just<00:02:41.570> magical

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
you know not because it's just magical

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.690 
you know not because it's just magical
for<00:02:42.560> him<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.890> he's<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.190> got<00:02:43.370> all<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.489> luck

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
for him and he's just got all the luck

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.460 
for him and he's just got all the luck
in<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.970> world<00:02:44.000> because<00:02:44.420> he<00:02:44.540> doesn't<00:02:44.780> but<00:02:45.440> I

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
in the world because he doesn't but I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.140 
in the world because he doesn't but I
think<00:02:45.709> it's<00:02:45.829> because<00:02:45.950> he<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.640> such<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.880> hard

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
think it's because he is such a hard

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.780 
think it's because he is such a hard
worker<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:48.140> knew<00:02:48.440> anybody<00:02:49.370> could<00:02:49.549> make

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
worker and I knew anybody could make

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.410 
worker and I knew anybody could make
that<00:02:49.970> happen

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
that happen

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.810 
that happen
that<00:02:50.660> he<00:02:50.810> could<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:51.890> if<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.430> would<00:02:52.579> have<00:02:52.640> seen

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
that he could and if you would have seen

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.970 
that he could and if you would have seen
