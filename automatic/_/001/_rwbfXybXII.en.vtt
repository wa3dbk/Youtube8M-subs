yeah<00:00:02.939> we've<00:00:03.330> given<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.810> chance<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.350> get

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
yeah we've given this a chance to get

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.880 
yeah we've given this a chance to get
nice<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.569> hot<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.600> fact<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.259> would<00:00:07.440> say<00:00:07.680> the

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
nice and hot in fact I would say the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.270 
nice and hot in fact I would say the
eggs<00:00:08.189> have<00:00:09.059> all<00:00:09.380> cooked<00:00:10.380> out<00:00:10.590> enough<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
eggs have all cooked out enough to the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.440 
eggs have all cooked out enough to the
point<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.700> they're<00:00:12.030> going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.210> provide

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
point that they're going to provide

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.730 
point that they're going to provide
structure<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:12.960> don't<00:00:13.110> want<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.290> cook<00:00:13.410> them<00:00:13.530> too

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
structure we don't want to cook them too

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.129 
structure we don't want to cook them too
much<00:00:13.889> because<00:00:13.950> then<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:15.240> chocolate<00:00:15.990> will

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
much because then the chocolate will

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.890 
much because then the chocolate will
actually<00:00:16.529> burn<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.460> will<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.690> butter

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
actually burn but it will the butter

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.660 
actually burn but it will the butter
will<00:00:19.080> help<00:00:19.350> keep<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.770> temperature<00:00:20.310> down<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
will help keep that temperature down and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.040 
will help keep that temperature down and
then<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> eggs<00:00:21.029> cooking<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.689> little<00:00:21.900> bit

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
then the eggs cooking just a little bit

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.439 
then the eggs cooking just a little bit
they<00:00:22.380> stiffen<00:00:22.949> up<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.340> create<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> little

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
they stiffen up and create a little

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.500 
they stiffen up and create a little
thicker<00:00:24.750> batter<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.550> whole<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
thicker batter so that the whole the the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.210 
thicker batter so that the whole the the
souffle<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.470> much<00:00:28.680> lighter<00:00:28.980> in

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
souffle is going to be much lighter in

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.679 
souffle is going to be much lighter in
much<00:00:29.369> airier<00:00:29.820> because<00:00:30.090> it'll<00:00:30.300> hold<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
much airier because it'll hold that

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.840 
much airier because it'll hold that
pockets<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.289> air<00:00:31.439> better<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> dough

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
pockets of air better because the dough

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.780 
pockets of air better because the dough
just<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.270> bit<00:00:33.480> stiffer<00:00:35.719> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> fun<00:00:37.559> part

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
just a bit stiffer this is the fun part

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.850 
just a bit stiffer this is the fun part
this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> actually<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> part<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
this is actually the part that is the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.310 
this is actually the part that is the
most<00:00:41.190> important<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.660> comes<00:00:42.780> time<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
most important when it comes time to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.860 
most important when it comes time to
making<00:00:43.950> your<00:00:44.070> souffle<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.760> that's<00:00:45.149> folding

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
making your souffle and that's folding

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.700 
making your souffle and that's folding
the<00:00:45.989> egg<00:00:46.140> whites<00:00:46.410> into<00:00:50.480> into<00:00:51.480> our<00:00:51.600> batter<00:00:51.840> yeah

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the egg whites into into our batter yeah

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.459 
the egg whites into into our batter yeah
the<00:00:53.399> way<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.719> easy<00:00:55.140> all

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the way to do this is really easy all

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
the way to do this is really easy all
you<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.399> take<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.910> egg<00:00:57.059> white<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.480> cut<00:00:57.780> it

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you do is take your egg white and cut it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.750 
you do is take your egg white and cut it
into<00:00:58.820> fourths<00:01:00.109> grab<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.410> fourth<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.640> egg

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
into fourths grab one fourth of your egg

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
into fourths grab one fourth of your egg
white<00:01:03.000> I'll<00:01:03.899> usually<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> first<00:01:04.589> fourth<00:01:04.949> what

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
white I'll usually the first fourth what

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.149 
white I'll usually the first fourth what
I'll<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.790> I'll<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.360> mix<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.979> mix

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
I'll do is I'll just mix it in just mix

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.340 
I'll do is I'll just mix it in just mix
it<00:01:08.310> into<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.990> actually

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
it into kind of just a it actually

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.929 
it into kind of just a it actually
lowers<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.830> temperature<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> chocolate

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
lowers the temperature of the chocolate

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.300 
lowers the temperature of the chocolate
a<00:01:11.970> little<00:01:12.210> bit<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.570> makes<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> easier<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
a little bit and makes it easier it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
a little bit and makes it easier it
creates<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.150> pathway<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.229> other<00:01:16.439> egg

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
creates a pathway for the other egg

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.190 
creates a pathway for the other egg
white<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.490> add<00:01:17.610> them<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.869> can

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
white so that when we add them we can

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.550 
white so that when we add them we can
they'll<00:01:19.950> bond<00:01:20.280> better<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:21.360> our<00:01:21.570> batter<00:01:21.810> it's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
they'll bond better with our batter it's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.960 
they'll bond better with our batter it's
funny<00:01:22.799> when<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> add<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.580> first<00:01:23.820> thing

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
funny when you add this the first thing

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.429 
funny when you add this the first thing
you'll<00:01:24.119> notice<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.750> batter<00:01:24.930> starts<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you'll notice is the batter starts to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.770 
you'll notice is the batter starts to
get<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.759> stringy<00:01:26.759> that's<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.659> an

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
get really stringy that's just an

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.450 
get really stringy that's just an
example<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.259> our<00:01:28.409> proteins<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.189> our<00:01:29.280> egg

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
example of our proteins in our egg

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.630 
example of our proteins in our egg
whites<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.119> work<00:01:31.070> there<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.250> go<00:01:32.369> you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
whites going to work there we go you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.700 
whites going to work there we go you
also<00:01:32.820> notice<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.360> your<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.500> batter

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
also notice that your your your batter

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.200 
also notice that your your your batter
is<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.250> lighter<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.820> lighter<00:01:35.970> with

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
is going to get lighter and lighter with

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.020 
is going to get lighter and lighter with
each<00:01:36.390> addition<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> egg<00:01:37.200> white<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
each addition of egg white what that is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.719 
each addition of egg white what that is
that's<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> air<00:01:40.409> that's<00:01:41.070> inside<00:01:41.340> these

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that's all the air that's inside these

there's this thing called oven spring
it's<00:03:07.109> a<00:03:07.319> fancy<00:03:07.620> way<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.280> talking<00:03:09.030> about<00:03:09.299> how

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
it's a fancy way of talking about how

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.289 
it's a fancy way of talking about how
when<00:03:10.919> you<00:03:11.040> put<00:03:11.250> something<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.639> the<00:03:11.760> oven<00:03:11.790> it

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
when you put something in the oven it

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.349 
when you put something in the oven it
goes<00:03:13.099> that's<00:03:14.099> that's<00:03:14.639> what<00:03:14.879> we<00:03:14.969> want<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.239> have

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
happen in fact let me wipe off the edge

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.539 
happen in fact let me wipe off the edge
of<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.449> that<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.690> don't<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.139> doesn't<00:03:19.549> make

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
of this so that it don't it doesn't make

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.860 
of this so that it don't it doesn't make
a<00:03:20.609> mess<00:03:21.030> when<00:03:21.329> we<00:03:21.419> put<00:03:21.629> in<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> oven<00:03:23.540> but<00:03:24.540> oven

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
a mess when we put in the oven but oven

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.599 
a mess when we put in the oven but oven
spring<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.440> cool<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:25.829> that's<00:03:25.979> why<00:03:26.159> we<00:03:26.190> want<00:03:26.549> to

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
spring is cool and that's why we want to

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.479 
spring is cool and that's why we want to
cook<00:03:26.729> this<00:03:26.879> 400<00:03:27.540> degrees<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:28.229> by<00:03:28.979> adding<00:03:29.250> that

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
cook this 400 degrees is by adding that

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.119 
cook this 400 degrees is by adding that
heat<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.239> going<00:03:30.659> to<00:03:30.689> cause<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
heat it's going to cause the the

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.619 
heat it's going to cause the the
soufflés<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.769> almost<00:03:34.769> very<00:03:35.430> slowly<00:03:35.849> explode

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
soufflés and almost very slowly explode

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.369 
soufflés and almost very slowly explode
so<00:03:37.319> we'll<00:03:37.530> get<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.769> nice<00:03:38.129> big<00:03:38.489> full<00:03:39.379> delicious

we're going to back off the heat and put
it<00:03:49.229> at<00:03:49.259> 350<00:03:49.650> for<00:03:49.889> another<00:03:50.189> four<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.639> five

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
it at 350 for another four to five

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.330 
it at 350 for another four to five
minutes<00:03:51.540> we<00:03:51.930> want<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.199> do<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.470> because<00:03:52.739> once

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
minutes we want to do that because once

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.580 
minutes we want to do that because once
it's<00:03:53.549> expanded<00:03:54.209> if<00:03:54.359> we<00:03:54.720> kept<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.049> at<00:03:55.139> that<00:03:55.290> heat

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
it's expanded if we kept it at that heat

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.949 
it's expanded if we kept it at that heat
it<00:03:55.769> would<00:03:55.949> cause<00:03:56.189> just<00:03:56.939> all<00:03:57.359> sorts<00:03:57.689> of<00:03:57.750> weird

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
it would cause just all sorts of weird

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.679 
it would cause just all sorts of weird
things<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.439> happen<00:03:58.620> in<00:03:58.889> our<00:03:59.009> souffle<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.759> when

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
things to happen in our souffle and when

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.270 
things to happen in our souffle and when
we<00:04:00.810> pull<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.109> out<00:04:01.229> it<00:04:01.259> would<00:04:01.530> cause<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.949> middle

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
we pull it out it would cause the middle

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.249 
we pull it out it would cause the middle
default<00:04:02.609> by<00:04:02.790> dropping<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.239> heat<00:04:03.479> down<00:04:03.629> to<00:04:03.840> 350

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:04.259 
default by dropping the heat down to 350

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.559 
default by dropping the heat down to 350
it<00:04:04.680> cooks<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.579> middle<00:04:05.849> and<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.239> cooks<00:04:06.419> the

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
it cooks the middle and it cooks the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.570 
it cooks the middle and it cooks the
outside<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.109> one<00:04:07.500> with<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.739> delicious<00:04:08.040> souffle
