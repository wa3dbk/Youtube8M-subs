got<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> system<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.450> I'm<00:01:25.259> already

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
got the system out here I'm already

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.280 
got the system out here I'm already
checked<00:01:25.830> into<00:01:26.009> how<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:26.490> money<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:27.290> 247,000
