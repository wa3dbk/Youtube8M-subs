guards<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:08.040> i<00:01:08.340> think<00:01:08.549> i'm<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.850> put<00:01:09.000> on

guards which i think i'm going to put on

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.250 
guards which i think i'm going to put on
since<00:01:09.450> they're<00:01:09.659> probably<00:01:09.810> gonna<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.110> fine

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260

since they're probably gonna be fine
this<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> house<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> i<00:01:12.030> think<00:01:12.270> that'll<00:01:12.630> be

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
this in the house so i think that'll be

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.710 
this in the house so i think that'll be
smart<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.760> this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> controller<00:01:15.540> that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
smart and this is the controller that

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.420 
smart and this is the controller that
comes<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.590> stop<00:01:16.799> controller<00:01:17.220> for

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
comes with is the stop controller for

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.090 
comes with is the stop controller for
this<00:01:17.549> thing<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.630> actually<00:01:18.840> looks<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.409> good

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
this thing it actually looks really good

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.160 
this thing it actually looks really good
um<00:01:21.650> it<00:01:22.650> feels<00:01:22.710> quite<00:01:23.040> nice<00:01:23.220> too<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:24.170> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
um it feels quite nice too for the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.490 
um it feels quite nice too for the
controller<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.799> comes<00:01:26.360> with<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.500> eventually

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
controller that comes with it eventually

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
controller that comes with it eventually
sell<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> quality<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.460> actual<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:30.659> into

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
sell the quality of the actual one into

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
sell the quality of the actual one into
a<00:01:30.840> week<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.100> turn<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.369> over<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
a week so if we turn this over to this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.249 
a week so if we turn this over to this
side<00:01:33.090> over<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.780> see<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> we've

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
side over here you can see that we've

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.980 
side over here you can see that we've
got<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.740> microsd<00:01:35.640> slot<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.900> actually

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
got a microsd slot so we can actually

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.469 
got a microsd slot so we can actually
record<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> flight<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.070> we're<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.090> USB

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
record the flight and we're going USB

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
port that's connect to the computer will

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.960 
port that's connect to the computer will
need<00:01:42.240> alone<00:01:42.450> wide<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.979> we<00:01:43.979> turn<00:01:44.520> over<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> this

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
need alone wide if we turn over to this

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.240 
need alone wide if we turn over to this
side<00:01:45.240> we've<00:01:45.840> actually<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.380> port<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
side we've actually got a port for the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.920 
side we've actually got a port for the
video<00:01:47.549> goggles<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.420> want<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> plug<00:01:48.780> in

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
video goggles if you want to plug in

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.010 
video goggles if you want to plug in
your<00:01:49.140> fpv<00:01:49.619> goggles<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.149> we've<00:01:51.149> also<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:51.810> an

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
your fpv goggles and we've also got an

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.880 
your fpv goggles and we've also got an
audio<00:01:52.350> plug<00:01:52.850> ok<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.350> charger<00:01:55.350> for

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
audio plug ok this is the charger for

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.469 
audio plug ok this is the charger for
the<00:01:56.100> help<00:01:56.399> sin<00:01:56.579> itself<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.829> this<00:01:59.360> connects<00:02:00.360> to

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the help sin itself and this connects to

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.649 
the help sin itself and this connects to
the<00:02:00.570> battery<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.590> has<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> USB<00:02:01.829> port<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.729> i'm

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the battery and it has a USB port so i'm

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.090 
the battery and it has a USB port so i'm
guessing<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.140> plug<00:02:04.439> into<00:02:04.680> your<00:02:04.890> wall

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
guessing you can plug into your wall

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.510 
guessing you can plug into your wall
plug<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.640> your<00:02:05.909> computer<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
plug for your computer so this is the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.210 
plug for your computer so this is the
hops<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.360> mini<00:02:09.899> multi-rotor<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.979> looks

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
hops and mini multi-rotor it looks

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.920 
hops and mini multi-rotor it looks
really<00:02:11.700> quite<00:02:12.120> good<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.599> actually<00:02:12.840> got

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
really quite good and it's actually got

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.580 
really quite good and it's actually got
a<00:02:12.959> better<00:02:13.140> way<00:02:13.290> to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
a better way to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.339 
a better way to
that's<00:02:13.709> not<00:02:13.890> um<00:02:14.670> yeah<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.840> assume<00:02:16.200> that's

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
that's not um yeah so I assume that's

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.839 
that's not um yeah so I assume that's
the<00:02:16.440> FFA<00:02:16.920> enter<00:02:17.220> we've<00:02:17.400> got<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> battery

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
the FFA enter we've got the battery

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.500 
the FFA enter we've got the battery
tucked<00:02:18.239> in<00:02:18.390> there<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.430> we've<00:02:20.430> got<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.760> FFA

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
tucked in there and we've got the FFA

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.390 
tucked in there and we've got the FFA
camera<00:02:21.930> here<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.739> it's<00:02:22.890> pretty<00:02:23.010> much<00:02:23.160> good<00:02:23.370> to

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
camera here so it's pretty much good to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.430 
camera here so it's pretty much good to
go<00:02:23.580> what<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:23.879> will<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.480> do<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> review<00:02:25.170> of

bases<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.970> beginner<00:02:35.970> series<00:02:36.209> for<00:02:36.660> fpv<00:02:37.110> which

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
bases on a beginner series for fpv which

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.020 
bases on a beginner series for fpv which
I<00:02:37.620> think<00:02:37.799> it'd<00:02:37.860> be<00:02:37.950> really<00:02:38.220> really<00:02:38.400> cool<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
I think it'd be really really cool and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.940 
I think it'd be really really cool and
this<00:02:39.209> could<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.599> really<00:02:39.989> good<00:02:40.260> tool<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.620> get

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
this could be a really good tool to get

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.130 
this could be a really good tool to get
you<00:02:41.069> up<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.370> running<00:02:41.430> with<00:02:41.970> our<00:02:42.180> learning<00:02:43.049> to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
fpv especially with the prop guards on

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.059 
fpv especially with the prop guards on
it's<00:02:45.930> going<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.110> be<00:02:46.170> far<00:02:46.440> better<00:02:46.620> than<00:02:46.769> any

it's going to be far better than any
