00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.120
 What's up kids, I do not have anything 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.759
 good news to give you if you give 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:10.010
 account the help go the name that 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.260
 has has a name of you grandmother 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.850
 Well, I started to deploy if I 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.230
 deis account the tentacles already dance a 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.910
 little because the sun of the current is a 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.480
 good news I started again to 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.820
 inflate for which I sincerely believe that 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.600
 is going to save there is a 60 with 60 by 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.580
 a hundred chances to be saved 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.560
 It was a great idea to put it in the farrowing 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.240
 because that way it does not feel let's say the 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.440
 current of the fish nor feel anything 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.350
 weird then apart it's next to the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.180
 this pileup of the anti-silicates that 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.580
 I put it here, you can see it 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.680
 that a trick that you can see since 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.900
 I'm here you can see that I apologized 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.210
 so that when it came down I would 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.960
 a curtain and times excessively 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.660
 bubbles 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.610
 because we already know that not in which and 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.670
 marilÃ³ should not have bubbles stress to 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.460
 the fish and also the corals 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.680
 So, well, I'm telling you how to look 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.330
 move and the tentacles are quite 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.490
 open and I told you that I was watching 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.080
 at night for the day he retreated and 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.730
 if the first night of the ark begins 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.250
 take out the tentacles 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.040
 so I think it's going to 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.230
 survive for those who do not know what is going 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.840
 the story is that he fell several times 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.460
 by the current on the rocks and it 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.160
 They pierced several tentacles and departed 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.560
 from there he went in a lot 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.480
 very much very much and sincerely 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.790
 I thought he was going to die 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.010
 you see that the conditions are pretty 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.990
 good for her right now 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.510
 that you already know that I have to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.240
 remember that many corals think 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.070
 so they are little plants and such are beings 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.020
 alive in the sense that they are animals 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.190
 they are considered animals are not considered 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.560
 plants 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.060
 so look how this is 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.890
 perfect I think that I 'm already 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.170
 we can see quite more displayed 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.640
 so pretty happy first no longer 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.830
 for the money that is lost because I 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.270
 it did not matter, but because of what I say, 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.000
 like a living being I'm dying in the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.370
 aquarium and then apart is that the philia 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.590
 It's beautiful I need it I want to put it 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.750
 next to the payasetes to put that 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.160
 hole that you step on and where the black is 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.890
 the ideal place to put what is the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.690
 center of all the caves and the couple 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.390
 dominant in the end will do symbiosis 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.250
 with the philia but already up to see is a 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.250
 news the best a little premature but 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.890
 I was seeing according to how he was these days 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.740
 I think he 's already pulling ahead 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.380
 and it comes well to inform you because 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.000
 they are always going to move the good things 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.350
 here transparency about everything and the day 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.240
 let a habit die I hope that 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.470
 be old as well there will also be 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.110
 throw it out 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.720
 so nothing filia guys throws for 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.490
 forward and good as we are 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.790
 it will continue to duck that is 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.650
 very well that the other day I told my 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.530
 family which earned me pa and me toos 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.390
 they all looked with a boy face not 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.400
 I know how you could spend 70 euros on 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.290
 a fish 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.739
 is that I already tell you it's worth almost the same as 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.739
 a puppy 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.970
 but of course how good you do not go to 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.030
 spend 70 euros on this little bug that 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.730
 true we said to see if it happens is 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.550
 a little bit the name and we put a 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.870
 name the epp to your 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.870
 I do not know what name to give 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.230
 take then nothing 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.239
 I hope we liked the good 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.099
 news and already tomorrow if I see that it 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.260
 unfolds everything to another video or if not 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.819
 It's already happening tomorrow because I'm going to be 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.739
 here every day the next dow the 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.659
 it looks like it's getting right but 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.680
 come on, I think it's going to throw 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:51.090
 ahead 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.090
 it has been a greeting guys
