spectators and for the rider is just to

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.410 
spectators and for the rider is just to
do<00:01:32.350> our<00:01:32.530> method<00:01:33.100> backside<00:01:33.730> air<00:01:33.880> out<00:01:34.150> of<00:01:34.300> this

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
do our method backside air out of this

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.330 
do our method backside air out of this
thing<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.320> absolutely<00:01:35.590> massive<00:01:37.890> now<00:01:38.890> you

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
thing that is absolutely massive now you

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.640 
thing that is absolutely massive now you
can<00:01:39.490> go<00:01:39.610> as<00:01:39.790> big<00:01:40.000> as<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.450> can<00:01:40.600> go<00:01:40.720> fast<00:01:41.110> but<00:01:41.530> the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
can go as big as you can go fast but the

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.410 
can go as big as you can go fast but the
fact<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.100> matter<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.430> once<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.120> hit<00:01:43.300> the

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
fact of the matter is once you hit the

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.480 
fact of the matter is once you hit the
bottom<00:01:43.720> of<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:43.900> transition<00:01:44.350> gravity<00:01:45.160> wants

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
bottom of that transition gravity wants

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.520 
bottom of that transition gravity wants
to<00:01:45.670> squish<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.300> and<00:01:46.540> compress<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.170> into

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
to squish you and compress you into

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.770 
to squish you and compress you into
little<00:01:47.680> ball<00:01:47.980> and<00:01:48.190> spit<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.880> out<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.210> top<00:01:49.450> and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
little ball and spit you out the top and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.060 
little ball and spit you out the top and
if<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.110> don't<00:01:50.320> have<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.620> right<00:01:50.770> amount<00:01:51.010> of

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
if you don't have the right amount of

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.710 
if you don't have the right amount of
strength<00:01:51.370> you<00:01:51.790> don't<00:01:51.910> have<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.150> skill<00:01:52.450> it's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
strength you don't have the skill it's

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.290 
strength you don't have the skill it's
like<00:01:52.930> this<00:01:53.110> bug<00:01:53.740> on<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.250> windshield<00:01:54.370> or<00:01:55.150> get

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
like this bug on a windshield or get

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.910 
like this bug on a windshield or get
spit<00:01:55.660> out<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.930> top<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.260> quarter<00:01:56.500> pipe<00:01:56.560> you

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
spit out the top of the quarter pipe you

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.800 
spit out the top of the quarter pipe you
could<00:01:57.070> potentially<00:01:57.640> fall<00:01:57.790> 50<00:01:58.210> feet<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.600> dead

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
could potentially fall 50 feet to dead

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:08.370 
could potentially fall 50 feet to dead
flat<00:02:05.190> I'm<00:02:06.190> saying<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.210> is<00:02:07.390> arguably<00:02:08.080> the

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
flat I'm saying that it is arguably the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.040 
flat I'm saying that it is arguably the
hardest<00:02:08.980> of<00:02:09.820> all<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.420> disciplines<00:02:10.810> of

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
hardest of all of the disciplines of

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.080 
hardest of all of the disciplines of
snowboarding<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.830> be<00:02:11.950> really<00:02:12.220> good<00:02:12.400> at<00:02:12.580> it's

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
snowboarding to be really good at it's

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.520 
snowboarding to be really good at it's
the<00:02:13.240> amount<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.540> speed<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.260> need<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
the amount of speed that you need to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.170 
the amount of speed that you need to
