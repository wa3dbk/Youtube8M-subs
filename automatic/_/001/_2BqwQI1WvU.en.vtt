00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
stuff that I actually got plus three

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.620 
stuff that I actually got plus three
attack<00:02:25.820> damage<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:27.070> then<00:02:28.070> just<00:02:28.850> get<00:02:29.180> some<00:02:29.420> a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
attack damage and then just get some a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.630 
attack damage and then just get some a
bit<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.930> extra<00:02:30.290> damage<00:02:30.470> down<00:02:30.860> on<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.370> creeps

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
bit of extra damage down on the creeps

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.360 
bit of extra damage down on the creeps
so<00:02:32.180> which<00:02:32.660> means<00:02:32.690> i<00:02:33.080> will<00:02:33.230> kill<00:02:33.440> creeps<00:02:33.800> faster

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
so which means i will kill creeps faster

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.880 
so which means i will kill creeps faster
then<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> normal<00:02:35.420> jungle<00:02:36.170> would<00:02:36.290> do<00:02:36.470> without

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
then a normal jungle would do without

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.790 
then a normal jungle would do without
without<00:02:37.850> butcher<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:39.550> yeah<00:02:40.550> plus<00:02:41.330> four<00:02:41.800> attack

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
without butcher so yeah plus four attack

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.140 
without butcher so yeah plus four attack
speed<00:02:43.210> and<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:48.250> then<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.430> one<00:02:49.490> gives<00:02:50.060> me

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
speed and and then this one gives me

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.710 
speed and and then this one gives me
plus<00:02:50.600> nine<00:02:50.900> damage<00:02:51.860> run<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.310> little<00:02:52.490> 18<00:02:52.940> which

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
plus nine damage run a little 18 which

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.010 
plus nine damage run a little 18 which
isn't<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.110> lot<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:54.620> still<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.150> can<00:02:56.810> save

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
isn't a lot but still that that can save

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.680 
isn't a lot but still that that can save
your<00:02:57.140> life<00:02:57.200> can<00:02:57.740> make<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> Break<00:02:58.280> gang<00:02:59.060> whatever

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
your life can make a Break gang whatever

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.250 
your life can make a Break gang whatever
and<00:02:59.870> then<00:03:00.830> plus<00:03:01.310> ten<00:03:01.490> percent<00:03:01.910> on<00:03:02.750> my

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
and then plus ten percent on my

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.760 
and then plus ten percent on my
penetration<00:03:04.180> plus<00:03:05.180> ten<00:03:05.420> percent<00:03:06.230> critical

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
penetration plus ten percent critical

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.270 
penetration plus ten percent critical
strike<00:03:07.130> damage<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:09.170> plus<00:03:09.620> three<00:03:09.860> percent

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
strike damage the plus three percent

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.760 
strike damage the plus three percent
live<00:03:10.550> still<00:03:10.850> which<00:03:11.360> helps<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.020> lot<00:03:12.140> in<00:03:12.200> jungles

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
live still which helps a lot in jungles

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.370 
live still which helps a lot in jungles
and<00:03:13.030> then<00:03:14.030> 6<00:03:14.780> plus<00:03:15.170> 6<00:03:15.200> i'm<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.650> penetration<00:03:16.190> and

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
and then 6 plus 6 i'm a penetration and

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.290 
and then 6 plus 6 i'm a penetration and
obviously<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.680> lowest<00:03:18.980> one<00:03:19.190> does<00:03:19.940> six

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
obviously the lowest one does six

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.180 
obviously the lowest one does six
percent<00:03:20.660> more<00:03:20.840> damage<00:03:21.230> if<00:03:21.470> target<00:03:21.860> is<00:03:21.950> below

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
percent more damage if target is below

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.210 
percent more damage if target is below
forty<00:03:22.459> percent<00:03:22.700> health<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:24.200> thats<00:03:24.740> that's<00:03:25.070> it

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
forty percent health so thats that's it

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.040 
forty percent health so thats that's it
for<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.550> offense<00:03:26.000> as<00:03:26.270> 80<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:26.900> then<00:03:27.740> i<00:03:28.190> have<00:03:28.520> my

plus two magic resist plus for armor the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.090 
plus two magic resist plus for armor the
main<00:03:47.150> reason<00:03:47.300> I<00:03:47.540> take<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:48.050> bit<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.410> magic<00:03:48.680> resist

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
main reason I take a bit of magic resist

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.390 
main reason I take a bit of magic resist
as<00:03:49.280> well<00:03:49.490> is<00:03:49.730> because<00:03:49.940> when<00:03:50.870> you<00:03:50.990> gank<00:03:51.230> mid<00:03:51.500> you

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
as well is because when you gank mid you

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.170 
as well is because when you gank mid you
will<00:03:52.580> need<00:03:52.820> that<00:03:53.290> it's<00:03:54.290> actually<00:03:54.709> hard<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.180> you

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
marked but the one next to durability

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.529 
marked but the one next to durability
gives<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.050> health<00:04:32.229> region<00:04:32.879> so<00:04:33.879> it<00:04:34.300> actually

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
gives you a health region so it actually

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.409 
gives you a health region so it actually
works<00:04:35.500> out<00:04:35.680> pretty<00:04:35.800> cool<00:04:36.099> and<00:04:36.939> i'll<00:04:37.060> show<00:04:37.090> you
