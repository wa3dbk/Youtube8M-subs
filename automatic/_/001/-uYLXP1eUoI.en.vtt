hello<00:00:01.940> over<00:00:02.690> the<00:00:02.810> past<00:00:03.279> the<00:00:24.009> relative<00:00:25.009> work

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:25.249 
hello over the past the relative work

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.519 
hello over the past the relative work
was<00:00:25.490> no<00:00:25.970> common<00:00:26.630> when<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:26.929> conditions<00:00:27.380> are

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
was no common when the conditions are

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.370 
was no common when the conditions are
right<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.099> we<00:00:28.579> just<00:00:29.179> got<00:00:29.329> curious<00:00:29.509> about<00:00:29.779> how

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
right and we just got curious about how

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.150 
right and we just got curious about how
it<00:00:30.409> would<00:00:30.650> be<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:31.640> touch<00:00:32.060> wingtips<00:00:32.599> and<00:00:33.160> what

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
it would be to touch wingtips and what

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.830 
it would be to touch wingtips and what
was<00:00:34.309> interesting<00:00:34.550> is<00:00:35.000> that<00:00:35.030> we<00:00:35.360> need<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.629> go<00:00:35.719> to

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
was interesting is that we need to go to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.720 
was interesting is that we need to go to
approach<00:00:36.110> such<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:36.379> wingtips<00:00:36.860> as<00:00:37.010> a<00:00:37.039> barrier<00:00:37.579> of

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
approach such a wingtips as a barrier of

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.549 
approach such a wingtips as a barrier of
error<00:00:37.940> that<00:00:38.180> kind<00:00:38.600> of<00:00:38.629> tries<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:39.020> prevent<00:00:39.379> that

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
error that kind of tries to prevent that

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.410 
error that kind of tries to prevent that
and<00:00:39.620> you<00:00:39.859> really<00:00:40.070> have<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.460> give<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:41.149> a<00:00:41.239> good

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
and you really have to give it a good

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.799 
and you really have to give it a good
force<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:42.070> touch<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:43.340> find<00:00:43.609> that<00:00:43.820> exact

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
force to touch it and find that exact

00:00:44.809 --> 00:01:13.290 
force to touch it and find that exact
amount<00:00:45.379> of<00:00:45.469> force<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:46.160> it<00:00:46.370> takes<00:00:46.399> to<00:00:46.789> tap<00:00:47.059> it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.880 

before<00:01:14.300> you<00:01:14.420> get<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.870> dog<00:01:15.110> tonight<00:01:15.590> when

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
before you get to the dog tonight when

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.140 
before you get to the dog tonight when
you<00:01:15.980> come<00:01:16.160> to<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.370> dock<00:01:16.550> you're<00:01:16.760> moving<00:01:17.060> at

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
you come to the dock you're moving at

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.750 
you come to the dock you're moving at
the<00:01:17.240> same<00:01:17.420> speed<00:01:17.480> and<00:01:18.440> it's<00:01:18.560> late<00:01:18.770> just<00:01:19.010> slight

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
the same speed and it's late just slight

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.490 
the same speed and it's late just slight
little<00:01:20.030> push<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.300> what's<00:01:20.630> amazing<00:01:20.870> about<00:01:21.170> it

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
little push and what's amazing about it

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.640 
little push and what's amazing about it
is<00:01:21.620> you<00:01:21.740> really<00:01:21.860> see<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:24.020> precision<00:01:24.500> of<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
is you really see the precision of the

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.990 
is you really see the precision of the
aircraft<00:01:25.100> when<00:01:25.280> you've<00:01:25.430> got<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:25.610> reference

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
aircraft when you've got a reference

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.250 
aircraft when you've got a reference
point<00:01:26.210> when<00:01:26.420> you're<00:01:26.510> that<00:01:26.630> close<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:27.050> someone

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
point when you're that close to someone

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.720 
point when you're that close to someone
you've<00:01:27.440> got<00:01:27.470> multiple<00:01:27.770> reference<00:01:28.340> punches

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
you've got multiple reference punches

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.670 
you've got multiple reference punches
you<00:01:28.850> see<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.150> axis<00:01:29.540> moving<00:01:30.110> like<00:01:30.350> this<00:01:30.530> you

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
you see the axis moving like this you

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.380 
you see the axis moving like this you
see<00:01:30.830> your<00:01:30.980> wingtips<00:01:31.160> moving<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:31.970> relative

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
see your wingtips moving and so relative

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.460 
see your wingtips moving and so relative
to<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.600> point<00:01:32.870> you<00:01:33.050> know<00:01:33.140> if<00:01:33.230> you're<00:01:33.320> just

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
to a point you know if you're just

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.900 
to a point you know if you're just
flying<00:01:33.650> by<00:01:33.770> yourself<00:01:33.950> you've<00:01:34.310> got<00:01:34.490> no<00:01:34.640> point

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
flying by yourself you've got no point

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.090 
flying by yourself you've got no point
of<00:01:35.000> F&amp;C<00:01:35.450> it's<00:01:36.200> amazing<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.650> see<00:01:36.680> how<00:01:36.830> one

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
of F&amp;C it's amazing to see how one

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.160 
of F&amp;C it's amazing to see how one
little<00:01:37.220> it's<00:01:38.120> almost<00:01:38.300> like<00:01:38.450> an<00:01:38.570> exhale<00:01:38.990> and

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
little it's almost like an exhale and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.600 
little it's almost like an exhale and
like<00:01:39.290> on<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.530> bar<00:01:39.740> like<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.100> will<00:01:40.310> move<00:01:40.460> you

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
like on the bar like this will move you

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.670 
like on the bar like this will move you
up<00:01:40.640> just<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.330> position<00:01:41.750> where<00:01:41.930> you're<00:01:42.110> if

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
up just to that position where you're if

00:01:42.680 --> 00:02:38.170 
up just to that position where you're if
docked<00:01:43.010> right<00:01:43.130> next<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.550> some

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.000 

getting<00:02:39.180> beyond<00:02:39.420> devil<00:02:39.780> slide<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.620> really

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
getting beyond devil slide is really

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.760 
getting beyond devil slide is really
getting<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.310> height<00:02:42.110> when<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.200> get<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.500> devil

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
getting the height when you get to devil

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.050 
getting the height when you get to devil
slide<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.400> lot<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.610> times<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.850> can<00:02:44.970> get

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
slide and a lot of times you can get

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.510 
slide and a lot of times you can get
there<00:02:45.300> as<00:02:45.540> low<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:45.930> 4<00:02:46.260> or<00:02:46.380> 500<00:02:46.830> feet<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.250> climb

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
there as low as 4 or 500 feet and climb

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.990 
there as low as 4 or 500 feet and climb
back<00:02:47.760> up<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:49.200> sometimes<00:02:50.010> you'll<00:02:50.520> have<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.850> go

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
back up and sometimes you'll have to go

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.930 
back up and sometimes you'll have to go
across<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.840> Bay<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.190> Taco<00:02:53.519> Bell<00:02:53.640> Beach

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940

page is to cut across cut all that

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.500 
page is to cut across cut all that
geography<00:02:58.320> off<00:02:58.769> your<00:02:59.040> flight<00:02:59.580> because<00:03:00.090> if<00:03:00.390> you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
geography off your flight because if you

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.540 
geography off your flight because if you
went<00:03:00.780> around<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.260> land<00:03:01.470> way<00:03:01.680> which<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.070> you

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
went around the land way which is you

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.949 
went around the land way which is you
would<00:03:02.700> not<00:03:03.239> be<00:03:03.390> able<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.600> make<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.930> that

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
would not be able to make it to that

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.870 
would not be able to make it to that
point<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.920> goal<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.280> try<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.549> get<00:03:05.760> to

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
point so the goal is to try to get to

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.550 
point so the goal is to try to get to
that<00:03:06.000> Shelter<00:03:06.510> Cove<00:03:06.540> point<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.410> faces

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
that Shelter Cove point and it faces

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.550 
that Shelter Cove point and it faces
Northwest<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.489> once<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.330> get<00:03:09.480> there<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:10.380> try

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
Northwest and once you get there you try

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.020 
Northwest and once you get there you try
to<00:03:10.620> climb<00:03:10.860> up<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.220> if<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.430> can't<00:03:11.670> you've<00:03:11.880> got

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
to climb up and if you can't you've got

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.870 
to climb up and if you can't you've got
this<00:03:12.180> Taco<00:03:12.600> Bell<00:03:12.870> Beach<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.290> land<00:03:13.500> on<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.130> if<00:03:14.760> I

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
this Taco Bell Beach to land on so if I

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.180 
this Taco Bell Beach to land on so if I
don't<00:03:15.060> get<00:03:15.180> over<00:03:15.450> 1,500<00:03:16.080> feet<00:03:16.230> when<00:03:16.799> I'm<00:03:16.950> there

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
don't get over 1,500 feet when I'm there
