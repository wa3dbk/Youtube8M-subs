00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
guitar Center so I was like sweet it's

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:38.820 
guitar Center so I was like sweet it's
kind<00:03:28.960> of<00:03:29.020> clearish<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:34.440> XLR<00:03:35.440> obviously<00:03:37.830> so

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
kind of clearish and XLR obviously so

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.040 
kind of clearish and XLR obviously so
that<00:03:39.070> was<00:03:39.580> pretty<00:03:39.760> sweet

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.920 

and<00:03:44.050> then<00:03:44.170> here's<00:03:44.590> this<00:03:44.770> part<00:03:47.010> here<00:03:48.010> spark

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
and then here's this part here spark

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.830 
and then here's this part here spark
shows<00:03:49.930> like<00:03:50.940> diagram<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.239> stuff<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.540> guess<00:03:52.690> how

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
shows like diagram and stuff I guess how

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.479 
shows like diagram and stuff I guess how
to<00:03:52.900> use<00:03:53.110> it

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489
