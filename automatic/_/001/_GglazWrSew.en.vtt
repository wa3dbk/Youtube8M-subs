build these real quick already so design
number<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.349> things<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.830> are<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
number one the things you are going to

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.790 
number one the things you are going to
need<00:00:32.579> are<00:00:32.850> some<00:00:33.540> sort<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.870> block<00:00:34.200> that's<00:00:34.590> not

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
need are some sort of block that's not

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.220 
need are some sort of block that's not
going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.070> be<00:00:35.100> destroyed<00:00:35.579> by<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> shovel<00:00:36.600> easily

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
going to be destroyed by a shovel easily

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.000 
going to be destroyed by a shovel easily
so<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:38.010> not<00:00:38.160> use<00:00:38.460> grass<00:00:39.420> don't<00:00:39.809> use<00:00:39.989> dirt<00:00:40.320> sand

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so do not use grass don't use dirt sand

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.430 
so do not use grass don't use dirt sand
or<00:00:42.530> snow<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.129> matter<00:00:44.960> easiest<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.110> just

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
or snow that matter easiest is just

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.410 
or snow that matter easiest is just
block<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.100> obsidian<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.239> not

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
block of obsidian because that will not

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690 
block of obsidian because that will not
break<00:00:48.660> anytime<00:00:49.110> soon<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.520> some

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
break anytime soon and then get some

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.389 
break anytime soon and then get some
glass<00:00:50.879> panes<00:00:51.239> or<00:00:51.480> iron<00:00:51.780> bars<00:00:52.219> you're<00:00:53.219> also

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
glass panes or iron bars you're also

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.160 
glass panes or iron bars you're also
going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> need<00:00:53.940> snow<00:00:54.649> day<00:00:55.649> pumpkin<00:00:56.149> for<00:00:57.170> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
going to need snow day pumpkin for the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.430 
going to need snow day pumpkin for the
Snowman<00:00:58.980> itself<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.199> simple

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
Snowman itself so this is really simple

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.920 
Snowman itself so this is really simple
I<00:01:01.680> got<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> do<00:01:02.129> throw<00:01:03.000> down<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> block<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.690> that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
I got to do throw down a block like that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.410 
I got to do throw down a block like that
go<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.010> two<00:01:05.250> blocks<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:07.700> make<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.939> little

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
go up two blocks and make a little

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.140 
go up two blocks and make a little
square<00:01:09.840> around<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.560> top<00:01:10.740> block<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
square around that top block in the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
square around that top block in the
glass<00:01:12.420> panes<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:12.930> iron<00:01:13.080> bars<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.920> rid<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
glass panes or iron bars get rid of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.640 
glass panes or iron bars get rid of
those<00:01:14.220> two<00:01:14.430> blocks<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:16.140> build<00:01:16.500> your

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
those two blocks then just build your

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.030 
those two blocks then just build your
snowman<00:01:16.939> to<00:01:17.939> snow<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> pumpkin<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.770> top

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
snowman to snow with a pumpkin on top

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.510 
snowman to snow with a pumpkin on top
and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:21.650> there<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:22.770> snow<00:01:23.130> generator

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and then there you go snow generator

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.539 
and then there you go snow generator
this<00:01:24.090> aim<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> snow<00:01:24.840> hold<00:01:25.799> down<00:01:26.009> right

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
this aim at the snow hold down right

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609 
this aim at the snow hold down right
trigger<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.180> you'll<00:01:27.630> you'll<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.229> snow<00:01:28.439> for

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
trigger and you'll you'll have snow for

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.200 
trigger and you'll you'll have snow for
days<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:30.450> second<00:01:31.020> design<00:01:31.939> you're<00:01:32.939> going

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
days and the second design you're going

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.080 
days and the second design you're going
to<00:01:33.329> need<00:01:33.740> snow<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.130> pumpkin<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:38.090> golem

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
to need snow and pumpkin for the golem

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.990 
to need snow and pumpkin for the golem
again<00:01:39.360> you're<00:01:40.079> also<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.590> need<00:01:41.000> two

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
again you're also going to need two

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.039 
again you're also going to need two
pistons<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.369> one<00:01:44.369> lever<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:46.220> some<00:01:47.220> glass<00:01:48.049> so

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
pistons and one lever and some glass so

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.069 
pistons and one lever and some glass so
what<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.860> want<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:52.520> have

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
what you're going to want to do is have

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.410 
what you're going to want to do is have
pissed<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.229> there<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.850> then<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> piston

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
pissed in there and then a piston

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.749 
pissed in there and then a piston
diagonal<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> facing<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> other<00:01:58.740> way<00:01:58.860> then

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
diagonal to it facing the other way then

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.830 
diagonal to it facing the other way then
you're<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.090> want<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> block<00:02:00.630> next

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you're going to want to put a block next

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.170 
you're going to want to put a block next
to<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.200> put<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> lever<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:03.000> when

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
to it put a lever on it that way when

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.429 
to it put a lever on it that way when
you<00:02:03.240> push<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:04.619> extend<00:02:05.009> at<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> same<00:02:05.310> time

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
you push it they extend at the same time

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.809 
you push it they extend at the same time
now<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.920> where<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> snow<00:02:08.369> golem<00:02:08.700> is

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
now that is where the snow golem is

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.520 
now that is where the snow golem is
going<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.149> stand<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.080> don't<00:02:10.229> want<00:02:10.379> them<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
going to stand so you don't want them to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.559 
going to stand so you don't want them to
get<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:12.030> you're<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.270> want<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.450> have

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
get out so you're going to want to have

wondering why you would want to deal
with<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.230> Pistons<00:03:00.710> it's<00:03:01.040> because<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:02.180> just

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
with the Pistons it's because it just

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.600
