the frame rate issue is

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.530 
the frame rate issue is
I'm<00:02:16.069> kind<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.220> thinking<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.030> carpenter

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540

blocks<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:19.080> I'm<00:02:19.230> not<00:02:19.410> sure<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:22.069> don't<00:02:23.069> know

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.030 
blocks but I'm not sure I don't know
I've<00:02:23.400> tried<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:24.000> very<00:02:24.690> slowly<00:02:25.290> moving

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
I've tried like very slowly moving

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.400 
I've tried like very slowly moving

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
towards the basin and seeing when the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.559 
towards the basin and seeing when the
framerate<00:02:28.680> drops<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.430> trying<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.790> zero<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.270> on

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
framerate drops and trying to zero in on

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.050 
framerate drops and trying to zero in on
the<00:02:31.440> location<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.220> thing<00:02:32.430> causing<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.030> and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
the location of the thing causing it and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.309 
the location of the thing causing it and
it's<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.870> can't<00:02:34.860> it's<00:02:35.160> just<00:02:36.030> like<00:02:36.450> from

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
it's like I can't it's just like from

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.860 
it's like I can't it's just like from
any<00:02:37.560> side<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.250> base<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.880> load<00:02:39.150> as

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
any side of the base that you load as

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.440 
any side of the base that you load as
soon<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.410> loads<00:02:40.590> framerate<00:02:41.370> drops<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.269> I

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
soon as it loads framerate drops and I

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.949 
soon as it loads framerate drops and I
don't<00:02:42.510> know<00:02:43.080> why<00:02:44.150> like<00:02:45.150> if<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.540> come<00:02:45.750> from

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
from that side of the trees compared to

that<00:02:47.850> side<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.269> trees<00:02:48.510> as<00:02:49.080> soon<00:02:49.230> as<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
that side of the trees as soon as the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.080 
that side of the trees as soon as the
first<00:02:49.620> building<00:02:50.040> loads<00:02:50.280> there's<00:02:50.700> issues

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
first building loads there's issues

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.289 
first building loads there's issues
basically<00:02:51.680> um<00:02:52.709> oh<00:02:53.670> I'm<00:02:53.940> stuck<00:02:54.239> again<00:02:56.299> might

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
episodes too lately I don't know why

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.449 
episodes too lately I don't know why
usually<00:03:46.410> when<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.620> happens<00:03:46.680> in<00:03:47.130> my<00:03:47.250> other

let's play series I'll just go and start
a<00:03:49.739> new<00:03:49.859> project<00:03:50.100> off<00:03:50.489> somewhere<00:03:50.880> else<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.299> and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
a new project off somewhere else and and

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.180 
a new project off somewhere else and and
try<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.200> do<00:03:52.290> something<00:03:52.530> fun

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
try to do something fun

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.840

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
but with this doesn't quite work because

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.400 
but with this doesn't quite work because
we<00:03:56.970> all<00:03:57.090> kind<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.420> agreed<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.900> build<00:03:58.079> it<00:03:58.290> our

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
we all kind of agreed to build it our

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.699 
we all kind of agreed to build it our
base<00:03:58.620> here<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.100> also<00:04:00.049> like<00:04:01.049> if<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.319> starts

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
base here and also like if I starts

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.370 
base here and also like if I starts
making<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:02.160> rollercoaster<00:04:02.489> somewhere<00:04:03.390> people

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
making a rollercoaster somewhere people

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.110 
making a rollercoaster somewhere people
are<00:04:04.560> going<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.769> be<00:04:04.829> like<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.160> thought<00:04:05.579> this<00:04:05.850> was

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
are going to be like I thought this was

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.590 
are going to be like I thought this was
a<00:04:06.150> war<00:04:06.540> server<00:04:06.959> etho<00:04:07.850> where's<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:09.120> fighting

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
a war server etho where's the fighting

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.690 
a war server etho where's the fighting
and<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.680> don't<00:04:10.859> think<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.280> could<00:04:11.430> get<00:04:11.579> away

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
and I I don't think I could get away

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.960 
and I I don't think I could get away
with<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.150> if<00:04:13.019> I<00:04:13.470> just<00:04:13.500> did<00:04:13.980> some<00:04:14.190> random<00:04:14.700> fun

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
my own mod pack if we go that route

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.830 
my own mod pack if we go that route
because<00:04:54.310> there's<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.610> few<00:04:54.880> mods<00:04:55.090> with<00:04:55.420> this<00:04:55.630> one

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
because there's a few mods with this one

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.480 
because there's a few mods with this one
I<00:04:55.870> don't<00:04:56.020> think<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.500> would<00:04:56.680> ever<00:04:56.860> use<00:04:56.950> like<00:04:57.370> the

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
I don't think I would ever use like the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.460 
I don't think I would ever use like the
witchery<00:04:57.880> one<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.540> blood<00:04:58.720> magic<00:04:58.900> just

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
witchery one and the blood magic just

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.100 
witchery one and the blood magic just
doesn't<00:04:59.830> really<00:04:59.980> appeal<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.340> me<00:05:00.960> but<00:05:01.960> there's

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
doesn't really appeal to me but there's

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.710 
doesn't really appeal to me but there's
a<00:05:02.170> few<00:05:02.470> other<00:05:02.950> mods<00:05:03.490> I<00:05:03.670> would<00:05:04.000> like<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:04.540> add

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
a few other mods I would like to add

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.210 
a few other mods I would like to add
maybe<00:05:05.850> so<00:05:06.850> maybe<00:05:07.170> if<00:05:08.170> I<00:05:08.380> do<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.560> single-player<00:05:09.130> I

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
maybe so maybe if I do a single-player I

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.490 
maybe so maybe if I do a single-player I
will<00:05:09.580> try<00:05:09.760> to<00:05:09.790> create<00:05:10.150> my<00:05:10.300> own<00:05:10.330> mod<00:05:10.900> pack<00:05:11.200> and

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
will try to create my own mod pack and

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.770 
will try to create my own mod pack and
then<00:05:11.830> play<00:05:12.010> with<00:05:12.040> that<00:05:12.370> um<00:05:14.760> but<00:05:15.760> yeah<00:05:15.970> I<00:05:16.000> don't

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
then play with that um but yeah I don't

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.140 
then play with that um but yeah I don't
know<00:05:16.950> I'm<00:05:17.950> just<00:05:18.010> spilling<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.730> beans<00:05:18.880> here

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
know I'm just spilling the beans here

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.450 
know I'm just spilling the beans here
letting<00:05:19.390> you<00:05:19.600> know<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:20.680> deal<00:05:20.890> instead<00:05:21.280> of

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
letting you know the deal instead of

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.560 
letting you know the deal instead of
just<00:05:21.670> like<00:05:22.050> leaving<00:05:23.050> you<00:05:23.140> wondering<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:23.770> guess

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
just like leaving you wondering I guess

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.050 
just like leaving you wondering I guess
that's<00:05:26.440> that's<00:05:26.950> basically<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:27.640> point<00:05:27.760> of

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
that's that's basically the point of

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.780 
that's that's basically the point of
this<00:05:28.150> episode<00:05:28.330> yes<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.710> would<00:05:30.250> like<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.520> go<00:05:30.640> do

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
this episode yes I would like to go do

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.060 
this episode yes I would like to go do
something<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.420> fill<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:31.930> rest<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.350> it<00:05:32.470> but<00:05:32.860> I

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
something to fill the rest of it but I

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.610 
something to fill the rest of it but I
don't<00:05:33.370> think<00:05:33.580> that's<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.930> goes<00:05:35.170> in<00:05:35.320> spurts

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
don't think that's it goes in spurts

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.550 
don't think that's it goes in spurts
though<00:05:35.830> like<00:05:36.010> right<00:05:36.190> now<00:05:36.310> it's<00:05:36.460> fine<00:05:36.730> and<00:05:37.560> then
