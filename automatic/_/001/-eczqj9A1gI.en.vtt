00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.570
 the clamp between the lever is a clamp 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.300
 for the assembly of artificial baits 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:51.080
 and made by the Italian company stonfo 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.230
 of Florence a high product 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.500
 technology made with materials from 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.300
 first quality stainless steel steels 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:06.640
 Tempered bronze aluminum is a clamp 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:11.470
 it is very practical and easy to use 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:16.369
 simple to use and durable 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:23.780
 the clamp between is the lever is provided with 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:29.960
 a three different clamp is provided with a base 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:34.369
 heads a spring and a still material 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.540
 registration key the fixing 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.210
 on the base it is very simple fits 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.450
 in the cylinder then using the screw 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:51.799
 blocking stops with the use of 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:53.780
 key the caliper holder e 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.850
 made of steel hince il 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.329
 monoblock can be adjusted in 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:09.290
 various inclinations with the use of 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:12.560
 key for locking the mot 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:16.970
 you need to set the bit and register a 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:22.209
 block then making on the ring of 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.910
 register the exact tension is set 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:30.410
 of the pliers in the case that these are 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.900
 too slow it still intervenes on the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.780
 fair register in such a way that 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.410
 the hook is tightened 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.600
 firmly clamp and supplied dates 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.670
 different heads according to the measurements 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.000
 years to use the head 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.209
 average practically collects a range 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.989
 very vast of hooks and therefore can serve 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.989
 for an unlimited number of montages 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.290
 two other heads supplied a lot 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:03.040
 small you need for extremely loving 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.239
 reduced from number 28 to models 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.780
 below was very large in his head 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.970
 can reach up to 6 dami equal to 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.720
 zero then to me from sea and for 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.519
 very particular constructions 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.130
 the head extraction operation is 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.880
 very simple closing the life of 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.800
 I resist to block we tend to slip the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:33.420
 lever to free the head 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:39.850
 from the hook then if it defies the head 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:42.670
 fits the new one worrying that 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.790
 this is inserted into the tracks 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.810
 at the tip of the center 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.650
 at this point it is a matter of fixing a 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.090
 I love relative greatness to the head that 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.950
 we have entered in this case 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.420
 we insert the maximum size of the mot a 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:08.620
 cin 6 mar a 0 the hook is inserted into the 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:14.200
 then the lever is adjusted 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:18.489
 Registered life is closed in this case 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.480
 the mou is blocked in case you have to 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.290
 mount to me very large type hamida 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:30.990
 and it is essential that the hook be in contact 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:33.570
 of the cylinder wall if there is a 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.020
 need to use really love 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:41.190
 small of measures below 20 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.780
 so if you obviously work like 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.610
 we said for the extraction of the 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.770
 head fits the new head e 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.680
 so this is able to 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.680
 close to me really reduced 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.960
 this clamp used with the clamp 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:13.669
 and can be transported comfortably 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.669
 without large dimensions 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.430
 on this terminal can be 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.850
 fitted all the accessories produced 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.889
 from the firm fed up as the screen of 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.160
 contrast the accessory to make dry 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.810
 the accessory plus the tube fly the lens e 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.770
 all those in the catalog 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:51.340
 general this clamp produced by 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.650
 stonfo life was distributed in all 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.389
 parts of the world and can be found 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.389
 the best nicolosi of Christ
