00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.560
 Well let's start with the porta 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.820
 rings and the first thing we have to 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.330
 use is a wooden lath 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:15.450
 I already made the divisions to put them 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.380
 the wires of the wires 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.179
 I'm going to drill to put the irons 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.640
 and good is a wooden ribbon that 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.560
 You can find it because I found it 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.430
 thrown at home 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.180
 and we need also 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.270
 the wires fixed I'm going to use 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 three I'm going to use three I do not have many 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.330
 canaries then I will not use 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 many many rings and good for 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.300
 put them in the holes I will use 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.300
 a 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.200
 drill these toy 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.160
 for 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.740
 to make the perforations and to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.440
 can put the irons and then I'll 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.950
 use 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.650
 have 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.260
 White glue 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.770
 with the white carpenter and also 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.770
 I'm going to use 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.640
 spray paint you can find it in 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.640
 the Chinese for three euros I think the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.250
 varied euros 50 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.280
 and well it's white you can paint it 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.280
 all 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.500
 ok let's start making the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.420
 perforations and holes little by little 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.560
 a fine bit 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.560
 and let's give it 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.960
 It is advisable to give it easy 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.960
 by half the ribbon roughly 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.750
 and this will then happen in quick camera 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.150
 well before introducing the irons in 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.850
 the holes we are going to 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.320
 with a little bit of cola in a stopper 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.320
 to wet those who do not know 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.720
 for we wet the tip 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.319
 A) Yes 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.799
 let's introduce 1 1 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.799
 the expression 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.500
 that they stay well there 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.700
 we go 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.709
 in placed all 3 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.850
 and others taking form 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.560
 before painting I'm going to put them 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.470
 some tips wooden blocks 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.610
 with some tips 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.360
 why 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.220
 because I'm going to put it against the wall 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.740
 so that I excel a little 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.610
 so 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.960
 as you see 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.420
 and let's put a few small 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.420
 we put a little tail always tail 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.650
 plus 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.650
 let's put the first nail 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.670
 to hold 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.410
 against the wall 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.190
 it will not do much strength 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.190
 so 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.810
 and we look at how it is 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.340
 we let it dry 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.050
 then we passed him a 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.030
 we passed him a cloth 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.729
 and paint it 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.870
 We spent some time around 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:09.020
 remove society without a trace of dust 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.610
 and we give him a painting 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.449
 but I spray 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.979
 6 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.979
 for interiors for wood 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.429
 this is 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.700
 after painting, I made two 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.780
 incisions restorations one here another 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.410
 here 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.410
 to see if he looks 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.870
 to which to stick the wall when 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.870
 the screws 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.009
 the screws of this one 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.009
 caliber are online 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.150
 and well we are going to 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:21.620
 screw it to the prisoners 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.620
 let's hit him with a hammer 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:33.509
 and now we are going to 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.509
 put the screws integrating the wall 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.810
 good 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.230
 after screwing it they secured the 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:01.900
 work wall already 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:05.010
 it's over, it's done, I put the 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.740
 rings as I told you are few 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:10.590
 they will be arriving more 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.349
 and good he stayed at work if you 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.300
 liked the video I would like to subscribe 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:18.979
 if you want more 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.979
 and good until the next video
