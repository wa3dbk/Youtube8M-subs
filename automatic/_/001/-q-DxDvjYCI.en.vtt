00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:03.430
 Welcome to the harvest will be the woman 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.550
 Here you can see a disassembled and Dell Inspiron 11z 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.949
 around with a penalty 6-inch screen 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.899
 but this time I will not be able to be what Lamerdingen's friend 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:14.519
 is 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.519
 we can see a lot of screws there 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.529
 Liechti had to remove 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.730
 but I can give my guidance 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.820
 how you could do the whole way here would be the umts modem 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.319
 wanders down 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.699
 that is murder input so something could not be optimally developed 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.330
 maybe the cable would 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.060
 we hand over and on 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.170
 Here you could rent as well as you can see my vest in the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.430
 Bumper 50-liter-barrel Bertelsmann 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.250
 the not Beck and offices as well as the endzone borne by Hynix 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.740
 but we have with Christoph Begemann 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.070
 GI 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.300
 was installed around so 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.490
 but it was not going to be that easy 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.170
 I'll try to build it all together or live now 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.960
 Straumann Bowers whole 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.620
 was here with one 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.140
 covered for plastic thing here 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.850
 that's what it's all about 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.300
 Here you can see a chimney sweep 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.050
 that's the power force that would 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.510
 you would have to be stuck there and then 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.600
 then we have the two speakers left and right here 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.240
 they also have one 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 that would have to be infected here 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.550
 into the house 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.980
 is my father infected 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.270
 where they might do the most 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.270
 then, if you have certainly taken the shot will not do now 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.220
 about as 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 then comes the operation 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 because they can not write 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.220
 Brest has to force her to insert this link under Ludger Moor 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.159
 Cookie of a seal does not rub indices entire commits commuter out of the 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.350
 Here's the screw on it, the coming to be moved again 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.580
 Scholtes APA van Gaal did not give a hot show over the stress test for the crown 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.850
 had received 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.930
 here there was 1 2 3 dip so a 2 x 4 is not moved there 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.529
 become 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.009
 just then it looks very simple Hosp 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.629
 around 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.929
 that could be the teacher 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:23.259
 the front 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:27.109
 the meeting on now take 19 counter after each screw has made 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.199
 yes, this is also the place to sit 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.759
 the cable 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.979
 that just has to be here in this slot blending then and then the window 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.469
 and become worldwide 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.009
 I just want it here, you want to be more mature »Hannah 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:39.399
 what the card 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.679
 settled on the edge 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.209
 with abbot 1 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.679
 then to do something here that was the next one 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:51.449
 So the 2 2 after I turn on and he has already made it to Reuter 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.459
 You just have to learn that too high 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.390
 around 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.410
 latest comic no songs can do whatever she wants is just that 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.319
 is done 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.279
 can the Easy 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:04.939
 Helper the keyboard 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.849
 the Tauern easy 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.299
 off because on the left side above said loose the heat sink and 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.579
 Dolberg and then the whole thing off 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.350
 around there, the little screw would have lost even more time 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.950
 and fair with Zecher but the bottom Wolter has removed small screws 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.669
 I think that was twelve pieces 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.749
 Percent Stephanus whole entourage is still in the Plus 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.099
 that fits together 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.919
 and at the bottom 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.919
 I have 1 2 here 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.249
 dülmen 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:41.239
 6 s 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.169
 7 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.749
 8 9 vom weges yesterday, the new management duo is on the neck 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.579
 they are also a 2er so a total of eleven screws its bottom 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.209
 completely remove 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.679
 then turn the top and then love as I said with the steps 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.229
 keyboard 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.609
 by percent all screws as well as seven pieces 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.799
 to take out on posters page on order 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.259
 and then this 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.599
 Plastic could have really come to ballot if it were just the noise 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.609
 wanted to exchange quite complicated would have this eleven Schomann 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.719
 bottom 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.719
 Show off you card did not really have this difficult 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.699
 and then come here 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.129
 Nevertheless, you may look at it 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.150
 then it comes namely after the dice clock clock snapped whether this 

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:27.370
 really 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.159
 It is easier to do 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.430
 she comes here transferred quite simple time 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.970
 and the ceremonial act then times to remove three screws we allow it 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:36.809
 the 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.469
 save 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:41.559
 as I said I am unfortunately disappointed that the umts modem is too 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.229
 easy 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.520
 Percent via pci-express Modern or something similar to install but is 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.039
 then I can have everything 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.139
 that was the Dell Inspiron 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.310
 around 11 z for coaches 9 90 euros at cheaper de available 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.490
 screwed on 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.289
 Also, I do not fear what you're doing there, I believe that Westerwelle 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.129
 triple 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:04.819
 how long can you go in 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.490
 and he foremost barça-star also looks for our YouTube 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.659
 Position but van der Velde place come 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.039

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.119
 Tests come something of mine in the first few days of the «Boxing Video and 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:18.030
