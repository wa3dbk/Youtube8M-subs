 Fish like the off-road segment on customer catching

 shape the streetscape 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.100
 October 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.310
 Ground clearance and all-wheel drive are good on this bumpy road 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.910
 volume 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.680
 ideal for a test drive with the Katie 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.990
 but the terrain should not be much harder 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.699
 top petrol just like the also available 2-liter diesel over a 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.680
 modern four-wheel drive, if necessary, up to 50 percent of the power to the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.020
 Distributed rear wheels 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.800
 the four gentian blocking and reduction are not there for 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 Money still good words 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 after all, the downhill help brings everyone safely into the valley and 20 centimeters 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.010
 Ground clearance is not a bad value 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.870
 Gravel and boulders are not the preferred area of ​​Capital Corp. 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.770
 this is probably true for its platforms or the Opel Antara 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.920
 Preuss honestly, the Rüsselsheimer hardly differs from the KAP which was not 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.600
 Miracles because both arise at the JU in Korea 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.310
 with at least 26 dead 850 euros is the cheapest Antara however 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.310
 four and a half thousand more expensive than the Chevy entry-level model 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.299
 the appearance of the cup winner 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.380
 beefy but not too chunky 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.280
 the underbody protection clearly underlines the ambition of food glass 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.280
 Headlights not only ensure a high-quality look in the top model 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.760
 Just like the calls rain in 17 or 18 inches format 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:22.749
 the higher models reserved parking assistance unsportsmanlike two remain 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.279
 high exhaust system 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:28.719

 Exhaust Rosendahl weak point in Rauenthal 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.909
 only a maximum of 930 liters of boot capacity that others can better 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.699
 Practically a bit cramped the third row of seats 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.369
 In the top-of-the-range model, passengers are enthralled with leather as standard 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:49.199
 the build quality of the cockpit is good just a bit cheap 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.779
 Acting materials are reminiscent of times when Shaw is still alive in June 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:01.349
 So the country roads completed the two-tonner surprisingly good athletic 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.870
 while his for the smallest gasoline dpa 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.280
 with 36 hp who is completely overwhelmed with the weight 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:13.139
 the alternative 150-ps diesel from Opel has 320 minutes with meters 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.629
 the biggest torque 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.859
 and probably the best choice 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.429
 because even the big six-cylinder is sluggish 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.079
 the slow automatic also added strength 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.179
 even the kickdown hardly helps 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:27.179
 if 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.810
 a fair price and good workmanship are the strengths of the capital 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.340
 There are penalty points for the tired six-cylinder and the lack of food 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.340
 driving aids 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:44.229
 Like many of his Sude competitors, the Cup is again too tame for a real one 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:45.129
 SUVs 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.579
 but he does offer a lot of Fortune for the sake of money and he has good ones 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.069
 Chances to catch one or two customers
