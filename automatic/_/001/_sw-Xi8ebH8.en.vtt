00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.610
 what we are going to do without any problem 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.040

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.170
 point is ok that's what we're going to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.600

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.460

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.420

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.000
 tutorial that another program we are going to 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:28.080
 need now is 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.110
 this program called imgburn ok 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.610

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.790
 this time also for you to learn to 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.830
 download it and install it in this 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:43.710

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.440
 see double click 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.239
 this program is very good now 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.510
 I recommend it a lot because 'we 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.340
 our images and they are added to the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.530
 files to make boote speak ok 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.870
 so that when we start our 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.569
 computer can start from the 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.810
 civilian and that already with the files that you 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.640
 added the program because and as far as 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.040
 good 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.620
 that what we're going to need right now is 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.410
 this first option that is to burn a 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.640
 image on a site that write a 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.950
 image on a site that on a good disk 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.480
 let's see a clip and then what are we going 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.210
 to do 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.100
 let's find the ok file which is the 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.169
 point did good let's give here 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.979
 and we look for it in 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.979
 this 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.770
 suppose they are on a lost route 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.720
 what we will do us 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.660
 we know that he is at the desk between us 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.520
 we go desk we know that 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.910
 we just created a folder that 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.820
 call james we look for the heinz folder and 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.010
 nothing else will show us the file that 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.740
 ends at point did that is going to 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.050
 show more because here it shows us everything 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.980
 this and here nothing else shows us the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.470
 point is ok 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.120
 well we select it, we click on 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.000
 open 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.190
 ok we have the route from where it is 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.900
 our file that what we're going to do 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.790
 then we will insert our cd ok 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.800
 and in this case I have two trays 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:30.639
 you select the one you want and 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.430
 insert sensitive since this one decides 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.909
 this leave it like this I do not recommend it 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.249
 palomino good after I recommend them 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:42.610
 leave it here in x 4 number of drinks 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:44.259
 because nothing else we want one and good me in 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.479
 this case I do not have the cid and that's why 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.789
 I took it you read it here but you 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:52.060
 they already have the civilian will seem 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:55.090
 more text in black right now is 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.909
 as gray plus text in black and 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.999
 this is going to shade them more ok it's going to 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.499
 appear a stronger and good color 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.150
 everything they have to do and nothing else 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:06.370
 is to give him to go here since they have done 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.550
 the configuration that I gave them in the way 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.770
 in which the here and the process begins 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.810
 burn the disc ok 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.020
 I leave a video I'll leave a 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.509
 video of how when it finishes makes a 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.699
 sound ok and this means that our 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.370
 civilian has already been and is already perfectly 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:29.400
 to use ok well I leave the video 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.400
 it lasts like five seconds good here is 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.820

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.440
 ready ok and nothing else is a matter of 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.360
 When you start the computer, enter 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.220
 set and tell him we want to start 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.800
