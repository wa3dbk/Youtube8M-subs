00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.600 
you've got one detector for both systems
which<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.900> really<00:02:22.770> handy<00:02:22.890> now<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.370> don't<00:02:23.520> have

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
which is really handy now you don't have

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.070 
which is really handy now you don't have
to<00:02:23.670> buy<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.820> live<00:02:24.030> cord<00:02:24.300> specifically<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:24.960> one

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.420 
of the other great if you ever changing
platforms<00:02:27.090> or<00:02:27.300> just<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.950> simplify<00:02:28.950> there's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
platforms or just to simplify there's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.060 
platforms or just to simplify there's
fewer<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.780> know<00:02:30.900> dongles<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.590> devices<00:02:32.040> that

cross-platform capabilities for both iOS

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.870 
cross-platform capabilities for both iOS
and<00:02:44.850> Android<00:02:45.180> built<00:02:45.960> into<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.350> new<00:02:46.380> Macs<00:02:46.880> all

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
and Android built into the new Macs all

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.910 
and Android built into the new Macs all
on<00:02:48.090> one<00:02:48.570> device<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:49.290> pretty<00:02:49.830> handy<00:02:51.500> okay<00:02:52.500> so

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
on one device so pretty handy okay so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.130 
on one device so pretty handy okay so
here's<00:02:53.190> an<00:02:53.310> example<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:54.060> k-band<00:02:54.510> alert<00:02:54.840> here

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
here's an example of a k-band alert here

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.540 
here's an example of a k-band alert here
on<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.530> Macs

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
on the Macs

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.700 
on the Macs
you<00:02:57.180> just<00:02:57.330> saw<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.510> go<00:02:57.660> away<00:02:57.750> should<00:02:58.440> come<00:02:58.620> back

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
you just saw it go away should come back

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.960 
you just saw it go away should come back
here<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.070> second

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
here in a second

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.390 
here in a second
there<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.530> there's<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.920> speed<00:03:02.160> sign

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
up ahead so you can see there it is on

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.979 
up ahead so you can see there it is on
both<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.720> Android<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.490> Macs

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.190 

and<00:03:12.989> here's<00:03:13.950> an<00:03:14.069> example<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.780> max2

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
and here's an example of the max2

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.140 
and here's an example of the max2

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
iPhone getting the same k-band speed

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.000 
iPhone getting the same k-band speed
sign<00:03:21.930> alert<00:03:22.200> right<00:03:22.349> here<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.590> yeah<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.890> then

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
sign alert right here so yeah and then
