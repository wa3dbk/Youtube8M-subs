00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
skin down it'll come up a lot easier

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.180 
skin down it'll come up a lot easier
in<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:33.170> end<00:04:33.320> it'll<00:04:33.530> come<00:04:33.710> up<00:04:33.740> a<00:04:33.860> lot<00:04:33.980> easier

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
in the end it'll come up a lot easier

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.280 
in the end it'll come up a lot easier
one<00:04:34.460> thing<00:04:34.670> I<00:04:34.760> neglected<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.510> do<00:04:35.750> on<00:04:35.900> this<00:04:36.080> and

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
one thing I neglected to do on this and

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.430 
one thing I neglected to do on this and
that<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.590> normally<00:04:36.710> do<00:04:37.220> is<00:04:37.400> uh<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.910> like<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.660> spray

that I normally do is uh I like to spray
with<00:04:39.650> nonstick<00:04:39.680> spray<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.640> that<00:04:40.850> will

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
with nonstick spray is that will

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.400 
with nonstick spray is that will
definitely<00:04:41.180> come<00:04:41.450> up<00:04:41.570> easier<00:04:41.870> but<00:04:42.020> also<00:04:42.140> when

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
definitely come up easier but also when

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.650 
definitely come up easier but also when

meat<00:04:47.300> going<00:04:47.690> down<00:04:47.900> in<00:04:48.140> that<00:04:48.260> skin<00:04:48.560> will<00:04:48.710> hold

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
meat going down in that skin will hold

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.100 
meat going down in that skin will hold
it<00:04:49.040> from<00:04:49.670> falling<00:04:49.880> through<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.300> grade<00:04:50.570> yeah
