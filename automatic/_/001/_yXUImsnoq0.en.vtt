little bit about the braiding pattern so

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.350 
little bit about the braiding pattern so
since<00:00:47.040> she's<00:00:47.190> getting<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.430> middle<00:00:47.730> part<00:00:47.940> I

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
since she's getting the middle part I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.200 
since she's getting the middle part I
wanted<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.230> track<00:00:49.530> too<00:00:49.739> late<00:00:49.949> very<00:00:50.489> close<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
wanted the track too late very close to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.400 
wanted the track too late very close to
her<00:00:51.690> leave<00:00:51.900> out<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:53.309> way<00:00:53.960> looking<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.170> really

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
her leave out that way looking at really

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.770 
her leave out that way looking at really
natural<00:00:55.830> and<00:00:55.860> prevent<00:00:56.519> slippage<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.629> in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
natural and prevent slippage you know in

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.990 
natural and prevent slippage you know in
the<00:00:57.809> track<00:00:58.110> starts<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.530> slide<00:00:58.769> down<00:00:59.000> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the track starts to slide down this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.390 
the track starts to slide down this
prevents<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:00.540> from<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.900> so<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.220> the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
prevents it from that so you have the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.600 
prevents it from that so you have the
ring<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:02.790> round<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.199> small<00:01:04.680> braids<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.460> it'll

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
ring go round of a small braids so it'll

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.990 
ring go round of a small braids so it'll
be<00:01:05.640> flat<00:01:05.940> at<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> top<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:07.020> comes<00:01:07.320> around

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
be flat at the top that comes around

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.969 
be flat at the top that comes around
then<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.030> braid<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:09.960> down<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
then you braid all of these down the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
then you braid all of these down the
brides<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.610> size<00:01:11.850> cuz<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
brides are this size cuz I think it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.499 
brides are this size cuz I think it
keeps<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.410> from<00:01:13.770> snapping<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> hair<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.240> much

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
keeps it from snapping the hair so much

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.960 
keeps it from snapping the hair so much
with<00:01:16.289> small<00:01:16.560> braids<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.399> was<00:01:17.550> still<00:01:17.759> like

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
with small braids but it was still like

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.450 
with small braids but it was still like
flat<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.600> left<00:01:19.440> her<00:01:19.590> leave<00:01:19.800> out<00:01:20.009> around<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
flat I left her leave out around the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
flat I left her leave out around the
edges<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.090> she'll<00:01:21.270> be<00:01:21.479> able<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.810> put<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.050> in<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
edges so she'll be able to put it in a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.340 
edges so she'll be able to put it in a
ponytail<00:01:22.410> and<00:01:23.149> it's<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.509> braid<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.050> see<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
ponytail and it's the braid you see it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.950 
ponytail and it's the braid you see it
gets<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.770> thicker<00:01:26.330> but<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.539> I<00:01:27.570> saw<00:01:27.899> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
gets a little thicker but when I saw you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
gets a little thicker but when I saw you
will<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:28.440> that<00:01:28.560> i<00:01:28.679> will<00:01:28.890> sell<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> track

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
will see that i will sell the track

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.990 
will see that i will sell the track
underneath<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.780> braid<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.250> also<00:01:32.700> why

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
underneath the braid and that's also why

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.139 
underneath the braid and that's also why
like<00:01:33.990> she<00:01:34.140> has<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> lot<00:01:34.440> of<00:01:34.500> hair<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.149> that's

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
like she has a lot of hair so that's

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.940 
like she has a lot of hair so that's
also<00:01:36.330> why<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.660> did<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> small<00:01:37.440> braids<00:01:37.679> in<00:01:37.830> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
also why I did the small braids in the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.620 
also why I did the small braids in the
back<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:38.490> when<00:01:38.640> she<00:01:38.789> tries<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.149> pull<00:01:39.330> it<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.539> in

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
back so when she tries to pull it up in

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.279 
back so when she tries to pull it up in
a<00:01:39.720> ponytail<00:01:41.119> she<00:01:42.119> will<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:42.929> be

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
a ponytail she will have you know be

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.040 
a ponytail she will have you know be
