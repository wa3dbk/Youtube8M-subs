00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 2:46 pm in the middle 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.020
 Welcome to that moment 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.170
 Huge earthquake with a maximum seismic intensity of 7 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:33.480
 The figure of a pedestrian squatting into too much shaking 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.130
 About one hour before 4:00 pm 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.960
 It was when the car stopped in a traffic jam 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.079
 eh 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.870
 From the left of the screen 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.870
 A few cars flowed into tsunami 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.540
 Next time 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.430
 From behind 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.430
 I think the tsunami is coming 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:08.210
 Only 10 seconds No. tsunami in the car has reached 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.210
 Mr. Muroga's car begins to be pushed forward gradually 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:22.390
 And after 25 seconds the car is completely lifted 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:27.870
 I lost control and began to drift 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.870
 At this time, Mr. Muroka was still staying in- house 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.630
 Cloth's car approaches the black wagon ahead 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.900
 Some of the demons are men 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.340
 Ha 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.909
 Hmm 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.450
 me 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.409
 I thought about running away right after this collision 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.409
 That the window was opened 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:07.050
 While debris and cars in front of the screen slowly flow in the right direction 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:09.650
 Trucks are being swept to the left high school with tremendous speed in screen country 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.650
 Only when I went 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.430
 A man who was in a crashed wagon 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.430
 I also see evacuation on the car 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.970
 And slowly the car to change the orientation 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.750
 Then the camera 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.750
 The buildings were rushing from now on 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.500
 The broadcast which tells the damage of the tsunami which happened in another place in the antiques 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.370
 ni 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:00.660
 At this time, Mr. Muroga said that he had been thinking if he would escape five cars 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.870
 And about 4 minutes after beginning to be washed away 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.319
 As cars are drawn 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.349
 I was caught in a fast flowing stream 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.349
 U 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.610
 matched 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:38.540
 A car swaying up and down 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.540
 Another car was in front of me 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.730
 While began to experience car was carrying a Mr. Muroga 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.730
 Continue being swept away by the tsunami 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.890
 none 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.890
 Hmm 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.790
 And 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.260
 From the tsunami encounter 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.260
 Approximately four and a half minutes 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:25.200
 Where a car collides with a building and sinks into the water 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.200
 The picture was broken
