00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
- you can't really see them over there

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.300 
- you can't really see them over there
it's<00:00:16.350> got<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.830> steal<00:00:17.990> staged<00:00:18.990> event<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.859> this

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it's got to steal staged event in this

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.189 
it's got to steal staged event in this
shape<00:00:21.680> to<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.800> make<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> arch<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.519> pack

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
shape to like make the arch in the pack

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.300 
shape to like make the arch in the pack
thinking<00:00:25.199> but<00:00:25.320> I've<00:00:25.410> noticed<00:00:25.680> about<00:00:25.980> this

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
thinking but I've noticed about this

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.019 
thinking but I've noticed about this
which<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.580> actually<00:00:26.939> pretty<00:00:27.359> neat<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:29.029> once

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
which is actually pretty neat is once

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.870 
which is actually pretty neat is once
you<00:00:30.150> put<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> bladder<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.990> there<00:00:31.399> you<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.610> kind

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
you put a bladder in there you can kind

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.080 
you put a bladder in there you can kind
of<00:00:32.969> see<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:34.260> little<00:00:35.250> Ridge<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.850> little

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
of see that little Ridge the little

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.600 
of see that little Ridge the little
furrow<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.020> guess<00:00:37.290> you'd<00:00:37.469> call<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.800> your

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
furrow I guess you'd call it your

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.880 
furrow I guess you'd call it your
hydration<00:00:39.000> sleeve<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.350> fit<00:00:40.710> in

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
hydration sleeve actually they fit in

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.910 
hydration sleeve actually they fit in
between<00:00:41.100> those<00:00:42.059> two<00:00:42.300> stays<00:00:42.629> down<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.260> there<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
between those two stays down in there so

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.340 
between those two stays down in there so
what<00:00:44.040> kind<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> helps<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.289> volume<00:00:46.289> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
what kind of helps with the volume of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.400 
what kind of helps with the volume of
the<00:00:46.440> pack<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.340> actually<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.910> back<00:00:48.410> behind

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the pack so it actually the back behind

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
the pack so it actually the back behind
the<00:00:50.039> mesh<00:00:50.219> panel<00:00:50.700> actually<00:00:51.030> protrude<00:00:51.600> out<00:00:53.899> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the mesh panel actually protrude out the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.330 
the mesh panel actually protrude out the
back<00:00:55.110> behind<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> mesh<00:00:55.590> panel<00:00:55.860> will<00:00:56.100> actually

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
back behind the mesh panel will actually

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.660 
back behind the mesh panel will actually
protrude<00:00:56.730> out<00:00:56.910> somewhat<00:00:57.719> into<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.140> space

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
protrude out somewhat into that space

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.979 
protrude out somewhat into that space
which<00:00:59.670> will<00:00:59.879> give<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:00.870> bit<00:01:00.960> extra

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
which will give you a little bit extra

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.330 
which will give you a little bit extra
volume<00:01:02.059> inside<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.239> pack<00:01:06.560> um<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.950> nice<00:01:08.130> I

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
comfortable once you get it there's a

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.729 
comfortable once you get it there's a
breeze<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:11.540> air<00:02:11.720> back<00:02:11.989> panel<00:02:12.319> really<00:02:12.530> works

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
breeze the air back panel really works

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.009 
breeze the air back panel really works
well<00:02:13.220> like<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:13.940> said<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.269> me<00:02:14.300> I'm<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.510> big<00:02:14.840> so

well like I said for me I'm just big so

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.360 
well like I said for me I'm just big so
I<00:02:15.080> sweat<00:02:15.350> anyway<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.950> doesn't<00:02:16.160> really<00:02:16.220> make

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
I sweat anyway so it doesn't really make

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.190 
I sweat anyway so it doesn't really make
a<00:02:16.430> difference<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.540> um<00:02:17.690> yeah<00:02:18.470> that's<00:02:18.769> it

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
a difference but um yeah that's it

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.760
