gotten a couple of requests to show what
the<00:00:10.590> butter<00:00:10.800> looks<00:00:11.040> like<00:00:11.219> after<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.610> cooled

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the butter looks like after it cooled

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.640 
the butter looks like after it cooled
and<00:00:12.210> if<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.900> don't<00:00:13.049> know<00:00:13.110> what<00:00:13.259> I'm<00:00:13.349> talking

and if you don't know what I'm talking
about<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.160> previous<00:00:14.759> video<00:00:15.120> before<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.509> one

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
about the previous video before this one

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.740 
about the previous video before this one
I<00:00:15.929> made<00:00:16.139> some<00:00:16.890> homemade<00:00:17.160> shea<00:00:17.820> butter<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.300> you

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
I made some homemade shea butter so you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.880 
I made some homemade shea butter so you
might<00:00:18.869> want<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.050> take<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.289> look<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.619> first

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
might want to take a look at that first

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.890 
might want to take a look at that first
and<00:00:20.160> then<00:00:20.220> come<00:00:20.490> back<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.000> now<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.510> got

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
and then come back to this one now I got

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.320 
and then come back to this one now I got
a<00:00:21.930> good<00:00:22.289> tip<00:00:22.350> from<00:00:22.800> geochemist<00:00:23.609> thank<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.119> so

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
a good tip from geochemist thank you so

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.050 
a good tip from geochemist thank you so
very<00:00:24.449> much<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.900> he<00:00:25.500> or<00:00:25.710> she<00:00:25.740> said<00:00:26.160> when<00:00:26.910> you're

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
very much and he or she said when you're

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.970 
very much and he or she said when you're
weeping<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.810> put<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> bowl<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.500> ice<00:00:28.650> water

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
weeping you can put a bowl of ice water

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.650 
weeping you can put a bowl of ice water
underneath<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.760> bowl<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.119> you're<00:00:30.390> eating

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
underneath the bowl that you're eating

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.720 
underneath the bowl that you're eating
in<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.380> helps<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> butter<00:00:32.219> cool<00:00:32.489> like

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
in and this helps the butter cool like

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.340 
in and this helps the butter cool like
and<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.300> think<00:00:33.390> that's<00:00:33.660> brilliant<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and I think that's brilliant because the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.190 
and I think that's brilliant because the
butter<00:00:34.500> cools<00:00:34.920> as<00:00:35.309> you're<00:00:35.820> whipping<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
butter cools as you're whipping so the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.510 
butter cools as you're whipping so the
heat<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.680> comes<00:00:37.829> with<00:00:38.070> whipping<00:00:38.399> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
heat that comes with whipping is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.639 
heat that comes with whipping is
dissipated<00:00:39.149> into<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.540> ice<00:00:39.840> water<00:00:40.020> which<00:00:40.410> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
dissipated into the ice water which I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.709 
dissipated into the ice water which I
think<00:00:41.160> will<00:00:41.340> shorten<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.790> amount<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.270> time<00:00:42.510> it

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
think will shorten the amount of time it

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.150 
think will shorten the amount of time it
takes<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.379> leave<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.890> cooling

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
takes for you to leave and the cooling

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
takes for you to leave and the cooling
process<00:00:44.489> as<00:00:44.610> well<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.820> that's<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> good<00:00:45.899> point

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
process as well so that's a good point

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.720 
process as well so that's a good point
and<00:00:46.350> thank<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.829> much<00:00:46.950> your<00:00:47.219> chemist<00:00:47.550> for

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and thank you so much your chemist for

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.000 
and thank you so much your chemist for
mentioning<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.870> will<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> next<00:00:49.860> time

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
mentioning that I will do that next time

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.189 
mentioning that I will do that next time
now<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> show<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> consistency<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
now to show you what the consistency of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.889 
now to show you what the consistency of
the<00:00:52.350> butter<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.800> here<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:54.030> more<00:00:54.420> like

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the butter is here it is it's more like

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.990 
the butter is here it is it's more like
a<00:00:55.260> very<00:00:56.250> Airy<00:00:56.910> cream<00:00:57.920> as<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.370> it's

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
a very Airy cream as you can see it's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
a very Airy cream as you can see it's
pretty<00:01:00.180> much<00:01:00.530> solid<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.129> that's<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
pretty much solid so that's the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.670 
pretty much solid so that's the
consistency<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> I'll<00:01:04.170> show<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.500> how

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
consistency of it and I'll show you how

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560 
consistency of it and I'll show you how
it<00:01:04.799> absorbs<00:01:05.280> into<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> skin<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:06.060> soon<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it absorbs into the skin as soon as it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.200 
it absorbs into the skin as soon as it
touches<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:07.229> skin<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:08.189> begins<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.760> melt<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.150> I'm

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
touches my skin it begins to melt so I'm

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.690 
touches my skin it begins to melt so I'm
just<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.570> touch<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> little<00:01:10.170> bit<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
just going to touch a little bit of it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.880 
just going to touch a little bit of it
not<00:01:11.700> too<00:01:11.850> much<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.299> place<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.530> my<00:01:13.560> wrist

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
not too much and place it on my wrist

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.850 
not too much and place it on my wrist
here<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:15.390> soon<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.840> place<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.619> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
here and as soon as I place it there it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.240 
here and as soon as I place it there it
begins<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.460> melt<00:01:17.610> right<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:19.250> it's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
begins to melt right you can see it's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.789 
begins to melt right you can see it's
already<00:01:21.020> liquefying<00:01:23.090> okay<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:25.530> I'm

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
already liquefying okay and then I'm

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.359 
already liquefying okay and then I'm
just<00:01:25.860> gonna<00:01:26.159> spread<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.610> very<00:01:27.000> thinly<00:01:28.189> on<00:01:29.189> my

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
just gonna spread it very thinly on my

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.810 
just gonna spread it very thinly on my
hand

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.480 

and<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.359> media<00:01:35.719> lead<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.259> in<00:01:36.590> seconds<00:01:37.219> the

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
and the media lead is in seconds the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.370 
and the media lead is in seconds the
skin<00:01:37.789> will<00:01:38.000> absorb<00:01:38.119> it<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:38.960> doesn't<00:01:39.140> feel

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
skin will absorb it and it doesn't feel

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.300 
skin will absorb it and it doesn't feel
oily<00:01:39.649> at<00:01:39.890> all

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
oily at all

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.399 
oily at all
partly<00:01:40.909> because<00:01:41.119> I<00:01:41.329> used<00:01:41.570> rice<00:01:41.869> powder<00:01:42.079> and

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
partly because I used rice powder and

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.020 
partly because I used rice powder and
partly<00:01:42.679> because<00:01:42.829> most<00:01:43.159> of<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.399> oils<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:43.789> used

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
partly because most of the oils I used

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.359 
partly because most of the oils I used
are<00:01:44.240> not<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:44.570> foilage<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.079> start<00:01:45.350> with<00:01:45.590> and

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
are not that foilage to start with and

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.690 
are not that foilage to start with and
miss<00:01:46.520> my<00:01:46.700> hand<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:48.170> not<00:01:48.319> oily<00:01:48.829> at<00:01:49.039> all<00:01:49.780> see<00:01:51.700> it
