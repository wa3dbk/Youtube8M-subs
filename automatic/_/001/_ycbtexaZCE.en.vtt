00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.349
 I'm a very homely person 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.420
 for me there is nothing better than 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.890
 have a good night and have a good night 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.260
 see my favorite series on 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.449
 Television calls keep block but I 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.130
 I'd rather be sitting on the couch and see if 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.380
 is sitting in front of a computer at 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.000
 greeny series and more comfortable but 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.250
 this comfort goes with a price to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.230
 advertising by passing it false central and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.780
 believe me that over the years 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.969
 I've seen a lot of publicity so I decided 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.120
 make this video talk the cliches 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.579
 of the police that make us say yes 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.010
 It seems like it 's if we go to that on the wall. 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.809
 people are all rejected or 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.640
 once they noticed that everyone who 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.890
 appears in the ads of the products of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.809
 seems to have good difficulty in 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.550
 clean whatever happens 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.379
 It's more or less this way. 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.480
 always someone who accidentally 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.640
 surrounds something and for some reason 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.829
 this person seems to be good at difficulty 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.539
 now things like a normal person 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.670
 It seems that he never separated anything in the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.729
 life I have seen people so odd or so 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 like this or even not enough 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.960
 I was joking sometimes I ask where it is 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.400
 that they will get these people 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.750
 will they make a case of dengue only 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.659
 choose people who do not know how to do 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.520
 cleanup expects people not only from 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.130
 be banned in advertisements for 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.470
 cleaning and absurdity in ads 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.610
 of cooking products and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.320
 personal hygiene 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.030
 then we all know how it is 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.280
 This ends, no one ever appears. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.170
 present the miraculous product that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.840
 solves all existential problems 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.990
 that one person had and move away and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.369
 cleaning and wakes up the ball and this 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.960
 is brushing teeth 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.399
 they do not look to the movies 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.409
 pornographic images that try to have a 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.649
 history but the only difference is that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.780
 no one gets on the scene blame done here 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.820
 in the sea two speak all Portuguese more 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.170
 it's not my impression or most of it 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.390
 of ads that goes on the television 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.549
 They are in Portuguese but the voice seems 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.270
 never respond to the movement of the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.549
 people 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.439
 like that, calm does not happen eight 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.460
 computers was just to understand what 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.920
 I'm speaking 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.750
 This is because the nuci was made in 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.970
 another language and then recorded in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.540
 Portuguese over obvious right so the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.329
 question does not look like 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.909
 the old and with cool shocked what I 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.469
 I really think that the complaint is that it bears 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.540
 to persuade people who are 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.730
 Portuguese, for example, in the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.769
 lead in the machines of value 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.900
 always appears some dog means the 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.799
 What causes trouble is the machine is 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.780
 limestone 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.909
 you can see that it is not Portuguese pig that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.340
 state corresponds to no motion of 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.439
 mouth gave this is to go to and when 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.989
 appears a talking talon appear to 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.269
 your posts are not Jose Maria in this case 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.609
 and if need be, do not subject or 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.689
 even josé maria men want in a 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.129
 serious clinic 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.439
 The woman still looks at the 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.319
 toothpastes appear to extend already 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.540
 say our bet is both recommended 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.609
 by the Portuguese dentists 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.370
 then passes to a pseudo dentist 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.680
 who says and uses this tempting peace for 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.810
 prevent various problems 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.090
 The worst of it all is that you can see that 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.450
 she is not even Portuguese and yet the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.209
 If you believe in these three, neither kaeda 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.519
 people believe bullshit like these 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.150
 which brings us to the third point number 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.010
 3 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.139
 only the Portuguese believe this to 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.180
 times with each ad in the provision 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.370
 that I was thinking but who goes in 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.870
 talk of this space I'm talking 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.849
 from those product announcements to the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.129
 province where a girl appears in 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.199
 imagine that the biased girl 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.810
 and this fight I said I lost a lot 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:40.419
 weight with this product and to show that 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.970
 even a fight exchange with the 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:46.299
 pants that are wide to show that 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.729
 lost a lot of weight bitching where it is 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.739
 who are going to get these ideas chances 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:53.229
 Okay, you need a way to show it. 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.389
 to the people that the product operates in 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:58.180
 The truth is that the contract has a good 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.340
 metal on to wear trousers three numbers 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.739
 above which she normally uses three 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.079
 numbers up right but something 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.909
 now a picture of a fat 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.759
 any and edith that is the before and after 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.849
 also in the image of a fat one or contain 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:15.609
 yesterday and I can not forget that the 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.440
 ads can not tell you the 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.229
 your experience with the product in question 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.889
 and how much your life has improved since 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:29.719
 I took calcium my life came back 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:32.120
 a unit was always holy remedy 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.710
 very credible chances especially the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.860
 door where the person is reading everything 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.990
 state and see jeft cover our climate 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.120
 balls and hopefully these videos have 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.520
 helped distract from ads that 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.289
 are spending on the effort effort as 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.139
 I like to be that the computer 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.060
 how much vision of the fourth linked quartet 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.949
 that annoys in advertising share the 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.050
 your opinion on the area of ​​my genitals 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.759
 that is destroyed and do not forget to 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.159
 leave what I like and share in 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.990
 social networks you know you can follow in 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.939
 social networks just click here and 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.610
 I also passed on the channel 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:07.039
 Mauricio makes subjects his rights 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.400
 subscribers on my part is everything 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.400
 strong hug
