300 I think they're still in the 100's
right<00:02:40.599> now<00:02:40.750> most<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.410> them<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:42.400> it's<00:02:42.640> not<00:02:42.760> going

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
right now most of them so it's not going

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.190 
right now most of them so it's not going
to<00:02:42.970> be<00:02:43.060> as<00:02:43.150> clear<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.599> can<00:02:43.750> get<00:02:43.870> up<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:43.989> it

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.630 
to be as clear you can get up to it
actually<00:02:44.560> count<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.920> different<00:02:45.040> pixels<00:02:45.489> if

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
actually count the different pixels if

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
you get real close and stare at it don't

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.309 
you get real close and stare at it don't
recommend<00:02:47.769> doing<00:02:47.880> anyways<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.140> what

anything and that upgrade is I think a
hundred<00:04:22.930> dollars<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.620> if<00:04:24.430> you're<00:04:24.760> going<00:04:24.970> to

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
display due to the higher dpi the colors

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.279 
display due to the higher dpi the colors
look<00:04:51.759> better<00:04:52.000> as<00:04:52.449> well<00:04:52.629> but<00:04:52.810> that's<00:04:52.900> just<00:04:53.139> due

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
look better as well but that's just due

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.899 
look better as well but that's just due
to<00:04:53.319> higher<00:04:53.650> quality<00:04:53.800> display<00:04:54.250> Apple<00:04:54.759> makes

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909 
to higher quality display Apple makes

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.460 
to higher quality display Apple makes
better<00:04:55.090> displays<00:04:55.479> an<00:04:55.629> asus<00:04:55.960> test

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
better displays an asus test

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.399 
better displays an asus test
so<00:04:56.979> is<00:04:57.190> that<00:04:57.250> display<00:04:58.000> upgrade<00:04:58.360> worth<00:04:58.539> it<00:04:58.720> $400

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
so is that display upgrade worth it $400

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.080 
so is that display upgrade worth it $400

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
hope you enjoyed I will mention that the

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.330 
hope you enjoyed I will mention that the
17-inch<00:05:34.719> has<00:05:35.020> a<00:05:35.050> much<00:05:35.319> higher<00:05:35.500> resolution<00:05:35.710> yet

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
17-inch has a much higher resolution yet

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.159 
17-inch has a much higher resolution yet
it's<00:05:36.580> actually<00:05:36.880> beyond<00:05:37.210> 1080p

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
it's actually beyond 1080p

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.040 
it's actually beyond 1080p
I<00:05:38.199> believe<00:05:38.620> it's<00:05:38.740> 1920<00:05:39.580> by<00:05:39.729> 1200<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.599> that

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
I believe it's 1920 by 1200 and that

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.120 
I believe it's 1920 by 1200 and that
would<00:05:41.229> be<00:05:41.349> the<00:05:41.500> 16<00:05:41.979> by<00:05:42.159> 10<00:05:42.550> version<00:05:43.509> of<00:05:44.130> the

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
would be the 16 by 10 version of the

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.430 
would be the 16 by 10 version of the
1080p<00:05:45.819> standard<00:05:46.509> so<00:05:46.719> you're<00:05:47.050> going<00:05:47.229> to<00:05:47.259> have<00:05:47.409> a

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
1080p standard so you're going to have a

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.080 
1080p standard so you're going to have a
little<00:05:47.650> bit<00:05:47.740> of<00:05:47.860> black<00:05:48.099> lines<00:05:48.460> on<00:05:48.759> the<00:05:48.849> side

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
little bit of black lines on the side

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.999 
little bit of black lines on the side
because<00:05:49.300> there's<00:05:49.539> 1200<00:05:50.139> pixels<00:05:50.529> in<00:05:50.680> the

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
because there's 1200 pixels in the

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.209 
because there's 1200 pixels in the
17-inch<00:05:51.430> versus<00:05:52.029> 1080p<00:05:52.750> you're<00:05:53.110> losing<00:05:53.500> 120

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
17-inch versus 1080p you're losing 120

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:55.890 
17-inch versus 1080p you're losing 120
pixels<00:05:54.370> or<00:05:54.699> so<00:05:54.849> so<00:05:55.000> you're<00:05:55.090> gonna<00:05:55.180> have<00:05:55.360> 60

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
pixels or so so you're gonna have 60

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.209 
pixels or so so you're gonna have 60
pixels<00:05:56.169> on<00:05:56.440> each<00:05:56.469> side<00:05:56.800> if<00:05:56.919> you're<00:05:57.039> going<00:05:57.130> to

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
pixels on each side if you're going to

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.390 
pixels on each side if you're going to
watch<00:05:57.340> a<00:05:57.460> 1080p<00:05:57.940> movie<00:05:58.440> but<00:05:59.440> most<00:05:59.830> likely<00:06:00.250> if

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
watch a 1080p movie but most likely if

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.080 
watch a 1080p movie but most likely if
you're<00:06:00.490> going<00:06:00.610> to<00:06:00.699> go<00:06:00.789> with<00:06:00.909> a<00:06:00.940> higher

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
you're going to go with a higher

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.309 
you're going to go with a higher
resolution<00:06:01.300> display<00:06:01.900> you're<00:06:02.050> going<00:06:02.169> to<00:06:02.229> do

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
resolution display you're going to do

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.320 
resolution display you're going to do
more<00:06:02.469> than<00:06:02.620> watch<00:06:02.740> movies<00:06:03.159> so<00:06:04.000> just<00:06:04.210> my

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330
