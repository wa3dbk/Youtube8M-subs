00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
you got the music levels and you felt

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.420 
you got the music levels and you felt
like<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.719> too<00:00:36.930> much<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.320> put<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
