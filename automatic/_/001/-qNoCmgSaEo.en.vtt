00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.350
 good here we have today 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.080
 we'll see 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.080
 What is it about 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:25.060
 well really is not not a boxing 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.210
 It is a small craft that I have 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.650
 fact that I've seen it out there with a 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.570
 old computer keyboard 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.300
 it is caught and all the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.290
 keys 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.320
 to make a curious and good 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.680
 I had a computer keyboard 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.540
 after dinner and then the pieces are 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.309
 a little thick if one has a keyboard 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.559
 of a laptop the pieces are much more 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.620
 fine then that was much better left 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.270
 plus 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.090
 easier this is more eighties 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.420
 of the type q I see a time machine and 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.240
 such 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.550
 then I choose a portable keyboard 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.060
 I have not 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.590
 best 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.270
 relatives leave, the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.860
 keys with mind care front 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.720
 of the cube that you put on tour better or 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.720
 worse this one that did not play very good 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.190
 and what does he put on then they put on a 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.020
 the place of the win 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.160
 with a short list of colors and what I have 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.160
 put here then the functions 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.549
 here around since the keyboard 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.549
 qwerty is worth 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.400
 until the end with the metal point m 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.260
 spanish the other side the keyboard this 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.670
 color cursor key 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.380
 and be blocking your 1st 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.240
 in the top part and in the part of 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.439
 down the civil servant you can do the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.920
 things many times but it's pretty 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.420
 quite apparent and what I tell you with 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.340
 vic laptop keys then there is much left 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.710
 I wanted better cell has 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.899
 seen long ago and well then we see 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.110
 difficult that you have to do not but have 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:15.459
 a keyboard the pieces are taken and they 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.160
 you cut these normally so you can see 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.769
 this has a salient here then the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.850
 work is a bit double because you have to 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:27.040
 close this part of here is valid and then 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.480
 file so that it is flat and 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.830
 put the pgr you see if this does not remain 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.019
 totally flat because you have to give it 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.269
 lime session and if one spends a lot 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.940
 with the file as it happens as it is here 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.970
 what have i seen 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.250
 the rich because sometimes it goes away 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.730
 It is also convenient to wash the keys 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.730
 because of 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.330
 of smoke and the Italian society outbreak 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.769
 conscientiously 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.460
 some are yellow but good 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.380
 of the sun too 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.340
 well then be careful with this 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.430
 subject really then gets tipped to a point 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.720
 of glue you have to be careful 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.310
 really what hits is this here and 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.860
 you can also put here in the center 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.310
 if we filed this well with putting them in 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.310
 corners 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:19.140
 and above all because that closing the magnet is 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.540
 makes one a personalization of a juice 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.440
 of the keyboard and that the apparent I think 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.080
 that with the keys of a laptop 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.190
 it would be better and just that 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:33.270
 I wanted to teach it and I hope that 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.660
 that you liked the crafts 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.200
 today's craftsmanship good thank you thank you 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.200
 to see it
