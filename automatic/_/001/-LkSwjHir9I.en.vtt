really good at the start of advanced
Warfare's<00:01:45.780> lifecycle<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.560> didn't<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
Warfare's lifecycle I didn't like it

Warfare's lifecycle I didn't like it
that<00:01:47.310> much<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:47.909> ever<00:01:48.570> since<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.990> tried<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that much but ever since I tried out the

I've<00:01:51.570> been<00:01:51.630> primarily<00:01:52.110> using<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.950> weapon

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
I've been primarily using this weapon

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940 
I've been primarily using this weapon

together with of course a someone does
that<00:01:58.110> gun<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.829> way<00:01:59.040> too<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.729> but

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
that gun is just way too good but

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.149 
that gun is just way too good but
because<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.229> also<00:02:01.439> want<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.890> this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
because of that I also want to get this

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.950 
because of that I also want to get this
weapon<00:02:02.430> wanna<00:02:02.790> give<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.180> go<00:02:03.329> see<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.810> can

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
deal some damage with it and that is why

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.940 
deal some damage with it and that is why
I<00:02:06.210> put<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.689> at<00:02:06.960> number<00:02:07.229> 5

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I put it at number 5

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.790 
I put it at number 5
next<00:02:08.580> up<00:02:08.729> at<00:02:08.940> number<00:02:08.970> 4<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.200> K<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.560> 5

next up at number 4 we have the K of 5
breakneck<00:02:11.250> now<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.209> think<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.900> it's<00:02:13.020> been

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
breakneck now I think that it's been

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.910 
breakneck now I think that it's been
roughly<00:02:13.500> 2

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
roughly 2

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.530 
roughly 2
week<00:02:14.069> since<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.459> managed<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> get<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.090> k5

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540

spanner in one of my advanced supply
drops<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.760> actually<00:02:18.270> used<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.810> one<00:02:19.110> for

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
drops I actually used that one for

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.870 
drops I actually used that one for
little<00:02:19.680> bits<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.220> safe<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.640> say<00:02:20.849> that

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
little bits and it's safe to say that

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.030 
little bits and it's safe to say that
was<00:02:21.150> pretty<00:02:21.569> disappointed<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.650> actually

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
was pretty disappointed I actually

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.710 
was pretty disappointed I actually
talked<00:02:23.400> about<00:02:23.520> wanted<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> get<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.330> KFI

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
talked about wanted to get the KFI

expander<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.349> absolutely<00:02:25.739> ages<00:02:25.890> during<00:02:26.459> my

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
expander for absolutely ages during my

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.670 
expander for absolutely ages during my
live<00:02:26.880> streams<00:02:27.180> why<00:02:27.420> not<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.500> when<00:02:28.620> I

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
live streams why not and then when I

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.800 
live streams why not and then when I
finally<00:02:28.920> got<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.580> just<00:02:29.790> wasn't<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.420> great

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
finally got it it just wasn't that great

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.930 
finally got it it just wasn't that great
and<00:02:31.410> because<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.190> really<00:02:32.250> want<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.730> try

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
and because of that I really want to try

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.059 
and because of that I really want to try
out<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> K<00:02:33.390> apply<00:02:33.690> break<00:02:34.050> neck<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.860> one

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
out the K apply break neck this one

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.160 
out the K apply break neck this one
basically<00:02:35.489> has<00:02:35.760> minus<00:02:36.270> one<00:02:36.390> accuracy<00:02:36.959> and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
basically has minus one accuracy and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.470 
basically has minus one accuracy and
then<00:02:37.290> plus<00:02:37.590> three<00:02:37.860> fire<00:02:38.160> rights<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.030> at<00:02:39.239> close

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
then plus three fire rights so at close

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.570 
then plus three fire rights so at close
range<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:40.080> one<00:02:40.319> should<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.860> an<00:02:41.069> absolute

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
range this one should be an absolute

didn't<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.769> one<00:02:58.950> too<00:02:59.130> much<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.970> one

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090

basically<00:03:00.390> had<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:01.019> believe<00:03:01.140> plus<00:03:01.560> three

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
basically had I believe plus three

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.320 
basically had I believe plus three
accuracy<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.700> was<00:03:02.880> one<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> most

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
accuracy so it was one of the most

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.630 
accuracy so it was one of the most
accurate<00:03:03.600> guns<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.170> game<00:03:04.220> but<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.400> still

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
accurate guns in the game but I still

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.280 
accurate guns in the game but I still

you<00:03:22.049> range<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.680> basically<00:03:22.980> makes<00:03:23.220> this

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
you range and that basically makes this

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.789 
you range and that basically makes this
gun<00:03:23.549> really<00:03:23.760> good<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.329> I<00:03:24.930> believe<00:03:24.959> it's<00:03:25.620> a
