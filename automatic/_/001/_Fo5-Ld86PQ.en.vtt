00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.360 
done my best here anyway when the side
profile<00:00:48.420> probably<00:00:48.840> looks<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.410> best<00:00:49.620> that's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
profile probably looks the best that's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.930

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
I could could have got the creases in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.040 
I could could have got the creases in
the<00:00:59.010> head<00:00:59.219> and<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.359> kind<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.600> stuff<00:01:00.660> so

the head and all that kind of stuff so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.609 
the head and all that kind of stuff so
you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.489> what<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> had<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.059> deal<00:01:03.210> with
