00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
more to the accuracy very little to the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.759 
more to the accuracy very little to the
FPS<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.329> don't<00:01:03.539> shoot<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> lot<00:01:04.229> harder<00:01:04.470> but

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
FPS so you don't shoot a lot harder but

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.440 
FPS so you don't shoot a lot harder but
accuracy<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.430> improved<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.000> lot

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450

dr.<00:01:06.930> oh<00:01:06.960> yes<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.799> way<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.159> works<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
dr. oh yes and the way this works is you

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.690 
dr. oh yes and the way this works is you
actually<00:01:09.600> unscrew<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.229> top<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:11.159> the

cartridge and insert the pellet and then

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.990 
cartridge and insert the pellet and then
you<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.549> screw<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> back<00:01:15.090> on

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
going on yeah it is it's a really really

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.170 
going on yeah it is it's a really really
clever<00:02:14.680> idea<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.340> like<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.700> lot

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
clever idea and I like that a lot

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.030 
clever idea and I like that a lot
so<00:02:16.420> as<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.630> go<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:16.900> when<00:02:17.320> do<00:02:17.470> those<00:02:17.590> commands

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
so as we go so when do those commands

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.190 
so as we go so when do those commands
they<00:02:18.490> should<00:02:18.730> if<00:02:19.150> they're<00:02:19.330> if<00:02:19.900> they're<00:02:20.080> not

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
they should if they're if they're not

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.290 
they should if they're if they're not
out<00:02:20.280> already<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.459> should<00:02:21.700> be<00:02:21.820> hitting<00:02:22.000> stores

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
out already it should be hitting stores

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.000 
out already it should be hitting stores
really<00:02:22.660> really<00:02:23.050> soon<00:02:23.260> right<00:02:23.440> there's<00:02:23.800> been<00:02:23.860> a
