00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.109
 immediately we will practice both 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.509
 chords that we have learned from the 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:10.849
 next form 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.849
 first let's change the 7th 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.309
 to re major without taking any time 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.580
 only practicing the position of 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.580
 fingers 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.490
 giving a single radius down 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.680
 a strum for each chord 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.750
 several times 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.850
 the third agreement that we 're going to 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.820
 to learn is greater sun and it is made of the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.390
 next way finger one fifth rope 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.300
 second fret 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.570
 mourners sixth string third fret 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.570
 and of 23 first rope third behind 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.510
 This is the agreement of the greater sun 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 let's do the remember the seventh 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.820
 giving a strum and the chord of D major 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.890
 giving a strum 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.260
 and we will make our chords by marking the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.690
 time and will initially be a way 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.930
 slow the time we can mark it with the 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.420
 foot 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.580
 each chord will last two times and 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.090
 this combination of the seventh and re 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.300
 we will repeat it four times 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.300
 it will sound like this 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.140
 in the same way as we practice 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.240
 combination of the seventh and d major 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.360
 marking the times in each chord 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.110
 Now we are going to play the sun 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.110
 good 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.860
 we are doing greater sun 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.980
 D major 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.850
 the seventh 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.850
 higher
