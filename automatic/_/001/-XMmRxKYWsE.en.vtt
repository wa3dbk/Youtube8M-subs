00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.770
 to 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.420
 from home 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.710
 all right 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.750
 There are people as they are, I hope they are 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.970
 very good i am crazy macri with good 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.980
 welcome to a video more here in 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.050
 the channel after these three days that 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.460
 I did not upload video there are reasons there 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.080
 reasons why I did not upload videos anymore 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.730
 had said that he will upload daily video 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.350
 but there are reasons that at the end of the video 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.850
 I'll tell you ok ok well as I already 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.590
 they could see the title I traced 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.210
 I already know that I'm behind in several widgets 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.190
 but good to establish what would be two 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.989
 new very simple clichés very fast 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.309
 of doing so they are practical for 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.720
 when we are playing and the free mode 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.090
 for when we are not doing 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.710
 nothing then we can apply stoglin these 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.230
 glitches ok the first of these cliches 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.820
 would be how can we play without cops or 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.740
 I do not mean we're going to 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.600
 disappear disappear or that if not 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.310
 we will be able to have it what it would be 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.920
 the stability of the polygon now 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.080
 crimes or that of the police does the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.550
 Vista Gorda I do not remember how it is or this 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.200
 for as long as we want ok 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.850
 real and that's something very simple and the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.590
 second glitches like disappearing from 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.960
 radar equal for the time that we 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.850
 we want ok all this is the same 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.200
 method is the same cliché what with the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.060
 different options offered by the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.680
 this so then let's go with the first 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.569
 what would be the how to have the police 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.500
 as not having the time police 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.060
 we want to 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.620
 the first thing we will have to do what 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.290
 first we'll have to go to 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.730
 contacts we will go to contact the 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.060
 estero let's go and with our good friend 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.860
 lester the pelón chances of vic and then 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.020
 let's call ok I think this option 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.520
 of the polices of the blind eye or the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.590
 polygonal to crimes we all have 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.390
 all we have unlocked so 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.460
 Well, we're going to buy it with only five 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.780
 we will buy a thousand dollars and we will 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.800
 wait for those two minutes to end 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.869
 okay 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.760
 good people once it's over 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.260
 what would this countdown be that 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.640
 we have down to the right that itself is 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.380
 what time we have for 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.240
 do what we want only that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.170
 I kept getting the good cell phone before 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.700
 take out the site we are not going to put 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.770
 any weapon we are going to take out the cell phone 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.720
 and leaving the cell phone outside we go to 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.160
 can do the undoing that we 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.770
 We want for the time that we 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.690
 we want and then we can do what 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.040
 we want without the police 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.810
 come to interrupt or what things here 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.180
 I'm shooting so it would be 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.860
 what is this then the deposit where 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.989
 supposes that we are policemen and we do not 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.430
 they put no star so it is 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.500
 a little trick to ensure implementation 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.480
 when they have this of the police not 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.640
 will make crimes or want to steal a house or 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.049
 want more time to steal a house things 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.370
 and you know they can use this 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.319
 very simple trick and then 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.170
 this would be the first one then with the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.700
 second trick good people in what 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.409
 would consist this second trick this 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.360
 second trick is the same method as in 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.010
 the previous one the only thing that changes is that 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.090
 then change the option or option that 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.830
 let's dial this time we're not going to 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.200
 mark the police option if not 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.040
 let's mark it the option outside of 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.629
 radar ok 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.310
 this kit is for when we 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.989
 we want to disappear from the radar a 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.150
 little more time than the one offered by the 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.680
 this already when he is not bothering when 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.900
 are bothering with a tank and 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.760
 we want to run away because we activate 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.799
 this little trick and so we will be able to 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.840
 take the tank off we're going to 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.099
 can destroy it calmly but good 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.450
 that the first thing we would have to do 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.950
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.390
 same as the previous league we are going to 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.819
 go to the cell phone we will go to contacts 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.500
 and again we're going to go with lester a 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.090
 Once we are with Lester it will be 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.579
 practically the same as the saying 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.680
 previous but with the option of outside 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.409
 radar in the option of was the radar I think 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.329
 that is unlocked with level 40 I think 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.819
 that is the only bad thing that I see this 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.620
 Well, this trick is part of good 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.049
 this second glitch since it is required 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.819
 level 40 to be able to unlock 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.410
 what would this option be if it is a level 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.610
 40 no problem they will be able to continue 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.020
 with what this link would be 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.030
 once you can buy what would be 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.370
 the out of radar like we have a minute 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.020
 it's a little less time than we had with 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.670
 the polygon now crimes it would be 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.350
 practically the same thing we will have to 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.840
 wait for what would be the 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.490
 stopwatch and when there are less than 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.010
 20 seconds let's practically do 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.990
 the same as the previous one we are going to put 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.250
 the weapon that we want to shoot with 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.020
 that we will not be able to change the weapon 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.850
 while we take out of the cell phone we are going to 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.740
 take out the cell phone and it would be what 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.080
 would this active trick here 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.580
 we would be off the radar for the time 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.440
 that we want or while 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.840
 let's have the cell phone outside if we 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.730
 that we press start or they kill us 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.010
 will remove what would be the cell there 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.930
 we will not be able to as well let 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.669
 rather appear already on the radar so 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.530
 as long as you have the cell phone 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.960
 we are going to be able to grab vehicles and 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.520
 we can all shoot like that 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.980
 in the vehicle as long as it's not 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.690
 a c4 because that 4 can not be exploited 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.220
 or what is it that we would be outside right now 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.110
 of the radar would be fine by the time 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.760
 we want to upload from someone for when 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.650
 this one is bothering us when we 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.570
 they kill without some reason like here Carlos 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.060
 to open here to kill as we activate 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.070
 this quickie trick and we ran away or 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.880
 we kill him without him realizing that 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.580
 is 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.350
 well that would practically be all these 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.050
 two little tricks that I wanted them 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.880
 teach I know that it's already good your video three 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.010
 days but there are reasons since Friday 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.780
 I went up from Amman on Friday to upload several 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.000
 blogs but that went up a little gameplay 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.130
 Saturday and Sunday had to dig into 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.390
 color figs which in the morning the 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.220
 Saturday morning I went to buy the 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.350
 furniture because update I made myself top and 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.090
 then I arrived at 4 to 5 he started the 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.800
 closures until 10 o'clock at night 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.160
 Sunday I stopped to like what it would be 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.960
 my 90 you'll see soon and from 5 to 10 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.210
 again because it was the quartz clan that 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.260
 that I did not have time to record anything because 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.240
 because the face is not something very important 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.190
 since for those who do not know what are the 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.110
 you nail in color and cause then you play 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.830
 of some time against other teams 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.750
 you play I do not know 5 to 10 d in the day and 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.610
 Well if you win I can be you win 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.210
 how many prizes and so against several 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.070
 teams 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.870
 ok so then you have to be willing to 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.150
 all those things that we have thus 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.590
 extras in the channel and well now that 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.330
 it would practically be then but that 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.120
 they already know that they can give a 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.830
 like if you liked this little video 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.120
 nothing more later to resume not because 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.800
 she will also start to upload all 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.260
 the clichés all that come out I'm going to 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.940
 promise to upload all 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.950
 even money I'm going to start 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.940
 climb I create money clichés and more 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.440
 things like that and then what else if they want me 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.000
 stay in peace 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.740
 down there in the destruction are going to have 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.350
 the link or for miami user I do not know that 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.730
 go see this one I do not upload anything does like this 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.680
 important nothing else there were things of 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.330
 concerts that I've gone so 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.010
 there they continue less so that later for 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.780
 that we are many there in by and also and 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.860
 Well, practically it will not be everything until the 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.860
 next goodbye bay 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.860
 I stopped writing
