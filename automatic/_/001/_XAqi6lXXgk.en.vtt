you

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.010 

okay<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.730> friend<00:01:51.150> of<00:01:51.240> ours<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.570> picked<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:51.870> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
okay so friend of ours just picked up a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.380 
okay so friend of ours just picked up a
bone<00:01:52.200> stock<00:01:52.440> mm<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.190> lightning<00:01:53.550> you<00:01:54.150> want<00:01:54.330> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
bone stock mm to lightning you want to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.760 
bone stock mm to lightning you want to
put<00:01:54.510> an<00:01:54.600> intake<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.470> thought<00:01:55.620> this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
put an intake on it so we thought this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.500 
put an intake on it so we thought this
was<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.980> good<00:01:56.160> opportunity<00:01:56.220> for<00:01:57.000> us<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.330> go

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
was a good opportunity for us to go

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.240 
was a good opportunity for us to go
ahead<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.840> test<00:01:58.200> an<00:01:58.350> intake<00:01:58.620> that<00:01:58.830> we<00:01:58.920> put<00:01:59.100> out

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
ahead and test an intake that we put out

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.700 
ahead and test an intake that we put out
six<00:01:59.610> or<00:01:59.760> seven<00:02:00.000> years<00:02:00.180> ago<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.450> tested<00:02:01.380> six<00:02:01.590> or
