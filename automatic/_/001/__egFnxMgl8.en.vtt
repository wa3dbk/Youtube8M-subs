 ground garlic salt black pepper 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.970
 There is no mono sodium motorcycle blue tomato 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.950
 which is the same 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.620
 and already 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:36.210
 rice water and oil I'm going to do it 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.730
 roll operates each to that rice 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.760
 how do you want we put a little oil 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.760
 we throw the ground garlic 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.910
 we throw the rice and I'm going to throw it 5 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.480
 one 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.480
 two 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.520
 4 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.799
 5 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.780
 and the measured measure of rice are always 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.880
 for each glass of water streams is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.880
 say that 105 I have to throw 10 water 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.649
 one 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.920
 two 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.290
 3 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.290
 4 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.830
 56 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.670
 7 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.700
 8 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.290
 9 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.460
 and 10 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.970
 ah 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.240
 and we put it to cook this is a 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.240
 rice cooker 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.720
 the second that we are going to do 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.710
 is to prepare 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.310
 the podium 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.710
 we put a frying pan to fire we throw a 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.270
 trickle of oil if you have an egg 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.869
 which is much better because it is prepared 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.869
 best in web 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.510
 we take a splash of oil 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.970
 we wait for it to warm up a little and 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.720
 we miss 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.720
 the chicken 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.890
 and the script 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.170
 We will increase the chicken have to throw 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.710
 salt because if it already comes with salt and 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.140
 chicken we also salt very little salt 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.600
 a little piece 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.600
 of salt and another piece of black pepper 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.040
 once it is seasoned, it is given a 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.040
 return 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.240
 and once we have a new one we have 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.180
 beaten as I 'm going to show you the eggs 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.660
 shakes previously to not take long 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.660
 we throw the egg 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.400
 and we move it so that it does not stick 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.970
 it has to be like 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.470
 scrambled 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.470
 we move it in circles 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.549
 we do not have to stir well 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.280
 well so that it separates the 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.280
 tortilla and it does not stay stuck 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.680
 and if he cooks us all 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.080
 now we proceed to throw the broth of 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.080
 chicken 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.180
 and a little bit of ajinomoto that is the 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.310
 sodium blackberry glutamate 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.310
 this will make the flavor grow stronger 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.799
 Now we put the rice in the pan 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.799
 i 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.610
 once we have the pan 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.610
 we take the Chinese onion 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.970
 LOL 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.970
 and we remove 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.850
 or better an egg because deeper and so 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.850
 enter everything 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.120
 Now we take the chair and we throw it to 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.120
 let's stay dark 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.100
 all these products we can 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.820
 find in latin stores in 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.820
 Chinese stores 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.749
 they sell it almost everywhere 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.330
 to 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.510
 once we have moved it 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.610
 how many minutes with the sauce of yes ya 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.690
 although it is what gives the taste flavor already 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.690
 we will proceed to place 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.889

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.960
