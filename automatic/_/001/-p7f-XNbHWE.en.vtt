00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.069
 welcome back in bad luck swing descend Ã¶v in our second Boston 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.040
 dpa - Ron defense system 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.270
 This consists of four dreams each of these dreams has 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.509
 Hundreds of Nitz 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.829
 MLR different Faber depending on which Thomas Kahle is and if this 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.620
 Energy indicator is 50 percent down 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.140
 if he dreams, the next dream comes to an end, the next dream becomes active 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.170
 At this step, none of the Munich may come that our little ones 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.829
 Special ability is triggered 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.479
 Furthermore, there is also to say that if the energy generator to zero 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:36.860
 Percent falls, the Traun inactive hears and the next turn comes like that 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.399
 will always be two transactions in the course of the fight that is by the way 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.540
 fortuitously 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.390
 the comet's first ability is a final score of magma front 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.590
 this foot 8 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.300
 enormous damage and must be against the heat 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.660
 here comes the second e-tron 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.690
 that's taxi trust 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.829
 the other principle is not too busy either 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.760
 Here we have from the poison cloud Leaking is happening here arises 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.980
 This elastomer can not cause us 50 percent more damage one can as well 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.660
 the bosses incur 50% more damage on them alone 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.320
 like the two of them, we see the magma's ability of Asus flamethrower 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.250
 while a back and forth is selected and on the over this flame thrower 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.160
 choked 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.300
 this goal should then go out of the group as possible and the damage 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.480
 intercept alone 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.860
 the next ability to pull out of there is the poison experiment 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.710
 that's what the three of them want to pursue right now in these little flops 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.920
 Fires Targets Eurogroup must become the kids should reach the goals 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.400
 are these 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.260
 without compromises 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.350
 next we have here 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.469
 Akan agreement 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.420
 Often, no one else can faithfully spend a year trying to stay here again and again 

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:48.979
 to write this must be interrupted for it was best a red 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.499
 but because BBS know the saints depending on what's available to them 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.570
 from this interrupt the whole sag 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.729
 nw the also this small field from the boss must be pulled out this 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.100
 Ability does too 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.790
 because there he says 50% more damage but we also 50 percent in front of his village 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.660
 more damage 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.070
 that means we can theoretically be in it after that all via suffer but also 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.090
 50 percent more damage because of that 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.170
 Sure, let's see if much but just this fight of the percent just 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.170
 Active then the West should not be enough 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:25.759
 Next, we have now seen percent in the electron here 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.419
 active he makes a very simple chain of lightning 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.499
 and what else do we have in principle 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.499
 He's making a lightning rod straight down the WDR back there 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.189
 four alone the straight path runs 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.529
 Percent below them many flashes come out and he is sort of the one 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:46.159
 but already lightning rods said it should go out of the group 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.739
 Ms. Spendier arrived at 8 in the beginning are a worthy at least recommend if for 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.179
 Example takano of just active can do more and more damage 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.989
 as soon as the sign on a few neutron principle you also recommend your 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.929
 interrupt again between leaving him there again to interrupt 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.409
 By the way, Arcandor Convention should be hurting his late phase 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.829
 at the European Championships prefer the pool which makes him much more damage 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.240
 That means you should do it best 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.500
 Designers can agree on that, such as a magician 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.279
 a priest a shaman or other 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.869
 and above all no melee damage do that also applies to the text 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.989
 that was it to the displeasure of defense system I wish you 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.519
 have fun with the Christ Child
