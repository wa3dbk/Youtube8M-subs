it<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.750> exactly<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.190> am<00:00:41.370> handing

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it and to see exactly if I am handing

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.540 
it and to see exactly if I am handing
out<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> bad<00:00:42.090> tip<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.629> sania<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.770> pretty<00:00:44.370> much

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
out a bad tip and sania is pretty much

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.190 
out a bad tip and sania is pretty much
correct<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.120> checked<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.629> every<00:00:45.930> angle

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
correct I checked it with every angle

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.420 
correct I checked it with every angle
and<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.440> course<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.829> going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> work<00:00:47.219> because

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and of course it's going to work because

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.930 
and of course it's going to work because
I'm<00:00:47.730> making<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> same<00:00:48.450> cut<00:00:48.780> twice<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.550> let<00:00:50.820> me

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
I'm making the same cut twice so let me

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819 
I'm making the same cut twice so let me
show<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.390> proper<00:00:51.660> method<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.230> checking

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
show you the proper method for checking

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.959 
show you the proper method for checking
a<00:00:52.890> 45-degree<00:00:54.260> lighter<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.640> making<00:00:56.640> sure<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a 45-degree lighter and making sure that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.450 
a 45-degree lighter and making sure that
your<00:00:57.120> angle<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.140> blade<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.739> correct<00:00:59.250> when

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
your angle of your blade is correct when

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.700 
your angle of your blade is correct when
cutting<00:00:59.789> minors<00:01:00.270> using<00:01:00.600> your<00:01:00.719> miter<00:01:00.930> gauge<00:01:01.170> so

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
cutting minors using your miter gauge so

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.350 
cutting minors using your miter gauge so
let's<00:01:02.100> take<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> look<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.670> now<00:01:04.939> so<00:01:05.939> guys<00:01:06.119> in

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
let's take a look at that now so guys in

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.810 
let's take a look at that now so guys in
the<00:01:06.479> video<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.110> showed<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:08.130> method<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the video I showed you a method of

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.450 
the video I showed you a method of
cutting<00:01:10.430> one<00:01:11.430> cut<00:01:12.830> sliding<00:01:13.830> your<00:01:13.950> board<00:01:14.220> down

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
cutting one cut sliding your board down

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.600 
cutting one cut sliding your board down
making<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.270> second<00:01:15.900> cut<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.530> taking<00:01:17.460> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
making a second cut and taking this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
making a second cut and taking this
first<00:01:17.970> piece<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.450> flipping<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> 180<00:01:19.560> degrees

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
first piece I'm flipping it 180 degrees

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.230 
first piece I'm flipping it 180 degrees
and<00:01:19.979> pairing<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:22.100> your<00:01:23.240> remaining

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and pairing it up to your remaining

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.090 
and pairing it up to your remaining
piece<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.840> checking<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> gap<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.770> way

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
piece and checking for a gap that way

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.609 
piece and checking for a gap that way
well<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:27.509> isn't<00:01:27.720> correct<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.470> will

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
well that isn't correct because it will

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
well that isn't correct because it will
work<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.159> you're<00:01:29.280> making<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> same<00:01:29.880> cut

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
work on it you're making the same cut

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.530 
work on it you're making the same cut
twice<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:32.100> need<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.280> call<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.390> me

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
twice and so need to call it out to me

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.289 
twice and so need to call it out to me
and<00:01:33.689> he<00:01:34.350> was<00:01:34.500> right<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.939> need<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> do

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and he was right so what you need to do

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.690 
and he was right so what you need to do
is<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.600> need<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> square<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.400> you

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
is you need to have a square and you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.569 
is you need to have a square and you
need<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.180> check<00:01:39.450> your<00:01:39.689> angle<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.500> an<00:01:41.189> upright

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
need to check your angle in an upright

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.910 
need to check your angle in an upright
position<00:01:41.720> centerpieces<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:42.930> 90<00:01:43.409> degrees<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
position centerpieces up 90 degrees and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.850 
position centerpieces up 90 degrees and
check<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.060> miter<00:01:45.420> angles<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.320> way<00:01:46.530> using

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
check your miter angles that way using

standing the two pieces up on their side
and<00:01:54.810> using<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.500> square<00:01:55.890> something<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.670> a

and using a square something that is a
true<00:01:56.969> 90<00:01:57.299> degrees<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.960> putting<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.920> two

true 90 degrees and putting the two

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.850 
true 90 degrees and putting the two
pieces<00:01:59.310> together<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> gap<00:02:01.469> at<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
pieces together I do have a gap at the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.940 
pieces together I do have a gap at the
end<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:02.640> means<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:04.049> blade<00:02:04.380> even

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
end which means that my blade even

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.770 
end which means that my blade even
though<00:02:05.100> my<00:02:05.280> table<00:02:05.670> saw<00:02:05.700> says<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.390> tipped<00:02:06.630> at

though my table saw says it's tipped at

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.580 
though my table saw says it's tipped at
45<00:02:07.200> degrees<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:07.979> not<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:09.090> off<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.810> what<00:02:10.560> I

need<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.160> readjust<00:02:11.760> my<00:02:12.000> table<00:02:12.390> saw<00:02:12.420> so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
need to do is readjust my table saw so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.340 
need to do is readjust my table saw so
that<00:02:13.020> when<00:02:13.140> I

I'm going to do now is I'm going to make
a<00:02:20.580> second<00:02:21.360> cut<00:02:21.540> after<00:02:21.960> making<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.920> adjustment

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
a second cut after making the adjustment

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.590 
a second cut after making the adjustment
to<00:02:24.080> remove<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.440> gap<00:02:26.100> we'll<00:02:26.970> check<00:02:27.150> our<00:02:27.360> fit

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
to remove that gap we'll check our fit

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.670 
to remove that gap we'll check our fit
then<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:29.360> then<00:02:30.360> I'll<00:02:30.570> look<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.960> see<00:02:31.110> how<00:02:31.380> off

gap is you just saw in that 45 by

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.309 
gap is you just saw in that 45 by
checking<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.700> with<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.909> square<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.599> that<00:03:29.200> is

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
checking it with a square and that is

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.449 
checking it with a square and that is
the<00:03:29.439> proper<00:03:29.620> way<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:29.950> need<00:03:30.099> to<00:03:30.189> do<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.370> you
