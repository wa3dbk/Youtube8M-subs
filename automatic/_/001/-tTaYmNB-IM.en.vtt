00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
bootleg because a lot of people like to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.660

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
know how to get more abs but they don't

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.290 
know how to get more abs but they don't
know<00:00:20.730> how<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.300> obviously<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.680> there's<00:00:23.640> not

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
know how and obviously but there's not

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.580 
know how and obviously but there's not
like<00:00:24.480> too<00:00:24.660> much<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.140> obviously<00:00:25.260> you're

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
like too much to it obviously you're

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.410 
like too much to it obviously you're
going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> be<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.039> little<00:00:26.880> bit<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.240> better

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
going to be a little bit of a better

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.620 
going to be a little bit of a better
player<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.680> makes<00:00:28.859> sense<00:00:29.010> obviously<00:00:29.630> but

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
player if that makes sense obviously but

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.540 
player if that makes sense obviously but
the<00:00:31.019> several<00:00:31.289> ways<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.679> do<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> my<00:00:32.279> way<00:00:32.309> is

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the several ways you can do it my way is

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.530 
the several ways you can do it my way is
very<00:00:32.989> mm<00:00:33.989> quick<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:35.130> guess<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.420> my

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
very mm quick I guess if you do it my

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450 
very mm quick I guess if you do it my
way<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:37.440> chances<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.010> getting<00:00:38.190> it

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
way the chances of you getting it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.610 
way the chances of you getting it
probably<00:00:38.910> are<00:00:39.059> lower<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:40.469> definitely

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
probably are lower but it's definitely

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
probably are lower but it's definitely
more<00:00:40.890> fun<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:42.360> might<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.629> more

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
more fun and it might be more

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
more fun and it might be more
frustrating<00:00:43.350> eating<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.100> I've<00:00:44.489> never<00:00:44.640> really

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
frustrating eating but I've never really

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.360 
frustrating eating but I've never really
tried<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.450> stay<00:00:46.020> back<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.590> sit<00:00:46.890> back<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
tried the stay back and sit back and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.950 
tried the stay back and sit back and
wait<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> enemies<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> come<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.750> but

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
wait for the enemies to come to you but

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.260 
wait for the enemies to come to you but
I'll<00:00:49.410> push<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:51.030> want<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
like what I like to do is get it to to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
like what I like to do is get it to to
their<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.910> spot<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.840> map<00:00:54.989> where<00:00:55.020> they

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
their like spot on the map where they

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.990 
their like spot on the map where they

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
shouldn't have done that I just ran away

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.039 
shouldn't have done that I just ran away
because<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.759> knew<00:01:51.060> he<00:01:51.149> had<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> sniper<00:01:51.509> rifle<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
because I knew he had a sniper rifle and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.620 
because I knew he had a sniper rifle and
I<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.610> ran<00:01:53.820> away<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.299> could<00:01:54.479> not

because<00:02:14.860> that's<00:02:15.070> obviously<00:02:15.460> pretty<00:02:15.940> standard

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
because that's obviously pretty standard

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.700 
because that's obviously pretty standard
as<00:02:16.540> well<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:17.500> just<00:02:17.710> gives<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.980> majority<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.520> the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
as well it just gives a majority of the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.080 
as well it just gives a majority of the
players<00:02:20.710> on<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.130> map<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:21.550> not<00:02:21.730> all<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:21.970> them

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
players on the map but not all of them

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.460 
players on the map but not all of them
all<00:02:22.270> some<00:02:22.960> of<00:02:23.020> them<00:02:23.110> are<00:02:23.170> going<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.350> have

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
all some of them are going to have

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.690 
all some of them are going to have
assassin<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.130> Lobby<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.460> was<00:02:24.580> pretty

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
assassin in this Lobby I was pretty

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.520 
assassin in this Lobby I was pretty
lucky<00:02:24.880> most<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.420> them<00:02:25.510> did<00:02:25.750> not<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.140> Sasson

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
lucky most of them did not have a Sasson

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.530 
lucky most of them did not have a Sasson
so<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.310> was<00:02:27.400> quite<00:02:27.520> helpful<00:02:27.790> in<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.060> sense

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
so it was quite helpful in that sense

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.600 
so it was quite helpful in that sense
and<00:02:28.750> here<00:02:29.530> comes<00:02:29.740> my<00:02:29.920> teammate<00:02:30.250> trying<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.490> cap

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
and here comes my teammate trying to cap

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.800 
and here comes my teammate trying to cap
that<00:02:30.760> flag<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.360> was<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> little<00:02:31.780> nervous

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
that flag and I was a little nervous

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.690 
that flag and I was a little nervous
here<00:02:32.200> running<00:02:32.500> out<00:02:32.650> but<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.040> see<00:02:33.220> my<00:02:33.340> teammates

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
here running out but I see my teammates

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.730 
here running out but I see my teammates
out<00:02:33.850> there<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.600> assumed<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.470> would<00:02:35.620> be

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
out there so I assumed it would be

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.030 
out there so I assumed it would be
pretty<00:02:36.640> protected<00:02:37.210> but<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:38.410> wasn't<00:02:38.770> actually

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
pretty protected but it wasn't actually

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.350 
pretty protected but it wasn't actually
I'm<00:02:39.550> looking<00:02:39.640> around<00:02:39.850> right<00:02:40.090> now<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.270> don't

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
I'm looking around right now I don't

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.610 
I'm looking around right now I don't
know<00:02:40.690> where<00:02:40.810> they<00:02:40.900> are<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.080> don't<00:02:41.290> know<00:02:41.500> where

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
know where they are I don't know where

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.260

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
the hell out of this situation I do not

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.560 
the hell out of this situation I do not
