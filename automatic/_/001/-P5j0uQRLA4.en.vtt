00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello my team but it 's for you two more 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 video for our week of a series of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
 bank update will use the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.120
 numsa includes the character of this 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.789
 update and good theme of today's video 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.220
 and the generation of smartphones there microsoft 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.189
 lume is for those who have not known for several months 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.439
 back there, microsoft acquired nokia and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.359
 now finally the appliances and I will not 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.380
 most have the name nokia mainly the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.260
 numbers here right 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 they will have the name microsoft lumia much 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 people are worried about the quality of 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.390
 smartphones to remain in the same 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.980
 price among other things and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.719
 especially if the new devices are 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 has a good configuration and everything else 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.309
 This group was really worried 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 It was good to continue as good as 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.809
 nokia because well it was not only the good as 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.910
 by the way it's getting better guys 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.670
 the following to Microsoft today 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.550
 recording the video announced the number 535 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.350
 she announced it out there and at the moment in 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.510
 who announced the microsoft brazil website 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.219
 already listed device here before 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.960
 when nokia will release the device you 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.420
 have to wait weeks sometimes until 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.100
 even if the device appears on the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.930
 No Brazil, and yes, I know 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.369
 publicly available now 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.470
 by the way Microsoft will include the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.470
 Brazil in the list of countries receiving 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.119
 already on the launch day in the week of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.720
 launch of the handsets which is great 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.189
 huh 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.930
 I believe this should happen because the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.729
 microsoft a much bigger company 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.740
 must know how to handle bureaucracy better 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.360
 has more contacts and chaos because it is not only 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.950
 the devices here the smartphones that she 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.280
 Microsoft has to produce a wide range 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.350
 of products she has been doing there for decades 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 so it's going to be a lot of time with 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.689
 to the distribution I believe will improve 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.220
 a lot more 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.530
 we will have the new releases of 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.810
 practically real time with a 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.340
 that we have in the countries of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.350
 first world in the countries that generally 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.600
 were cast first, right? 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.700
 Another very good thing is that the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.009
 colored in Brazil is very complicated that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.570
 the nokia brought black and white were the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.520
 only type of check for grass 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.649
 our numbers sometimes even had others 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.270
 but I had to buy 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.180
 separated now not the numbers the way 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.350
 good wine in the colors available out there 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.079
 will arrive here in brazil also the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.509
 number 535 was announced today it was already 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.890
 where the made available on the site 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.510
 microsoft not to buy even more 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.830
 have all of his information there then 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.320
 soon he will have available 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.880
 the contract and is already in various colors 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.050
 different from what happened with nokia 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.180
 that was just black and white 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.340
 there is no blue timing phone if you do not 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.930
 the orange was already there. 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.940
 launch will have all these colors 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.400
 so a great surprise for people who 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.660
 microsoft improved her products there 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.490
 especially now that for people in the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.260
 Brazil is not what matters 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.670
 another very good thing is that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.400
 smartphones are maintaining the quality 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.530
 not only as good as it was before 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.060
 better still nokia will do this 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.590
 device and microsoft nÃ© 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.270
 it will make a device that should not 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.770
 be so expensive for the price of it out there 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.410
 I should arrive in Brazil , I believe in 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.420
 around 500 reais and it has 1 gb of 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.980
 ram memory quad-core processor 5 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.170
 megapixels and rear camera of 5 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.780
 megapixel front or a camera 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.300
 very fucking for those who like to take the sky 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.000
 I did and a 5 inch screen a 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.950
 resolution well good quite reasonable does not arrive 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.810
 to be an HD but a good resolution for 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.640
 the device of this price range is 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.040
 excellent exceptional 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.380
 so the device is very good and it comes 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.180
 with a great price also then the 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.370
 microsoft is doing a great job 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.370
 started there with his first microsoft 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.470
 I slept with my right foot, I did not 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.970
 I want to change sooner than Lula is to 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.440
 who has accompanied me for some time knows 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.880
 I have the number 820 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.170
 but I do not intend to change so soon 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.150
 until you feel so much need 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.489
 so I think it's going to take a while because 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.810
 windows phone still runs very well 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.790
 Most applications are made by 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.739
 example for 512 gb ram that my number 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.890
 121 gb of ram dual-core processor 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.550
 Very good, I think I'm going to switch from 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.140
 name at the end of 2015 probably before 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.030
 I do not intend to do this now because here 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.140
 end of 2014 is going to be a year since I'm 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.640
 with 1820 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.410
 I intend to stay at least one more 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.600
 year with him the only reason he would 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.150
 appliance trade before before 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.709
 end whistle of 2015 would happen 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.720
 some problem with it such as 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.190
 a few weeks ago whoever accompanies 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.540
 more assiduously knew that my name 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.850
 I was giving some small problems and this is 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.220
 That problem persists if I did. 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.480
 end up switching smartphones and I think 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.940
 that your own smartphone will end 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.390
 being a half even though I really like 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.489
 on the windows phone the device there that 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.010
 very satisfying in every way 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.450
 I need to use a smartphone all 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.630
 requirements i need smartphone 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.190
 windows phone here about with a break 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.970
 very good indeed and also very pricey 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.220
 good right 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.900
 So I'm really happy to see the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.210
 microsoft doing a great job with 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.550
 On Sundays I did not have any doubts. 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.040
 you know then we have several products 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.590
 microsoft xbox and the original windows and 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.410
 everything else and I always enjoyed a lot of products 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.090
 microsoft then the numbers going to hand 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.860
 to the hands of microsoft already expected 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.930
 that there was something very good out there 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.880
 I do not like the view you 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.680

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.450
