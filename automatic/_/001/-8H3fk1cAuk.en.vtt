00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.579
 all around the world 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.749
 is the lowest level in a month 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.749
 in June of 2008 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.029
 a timely 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.900
 until the end of this year 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.900
 despite the defeat to the crash 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.710
 you will bump 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 in the last five 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.270
 but I'm not walking 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.270
 marina 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.050
 same 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.050
 it seems to me a lot 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.900
 it's not a bit 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.900
 my father 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.270
 5 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.270
 same 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.030
 no an 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.460
 we did not have 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.460
 I want to, but I do not 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.970
 the octagon 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 we do not have five 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.900
 according to the delegate 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.900
 it's not worth 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.439
 let's get 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.909
 Great to 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.909
 in the holy spirit 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.139
 also in 2008 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.109
 it's nothing much 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.109
 the truck and the cargo of cocaine 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.609
 I was crazy 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.429
 not from now 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.919
 5 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.529
 the last club
