using<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.770> W<00:01:17.720> mainly<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.049> fact<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
using as W mainly for the fact that I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.460 
using as W mainly for the fact that I
usually<00:01:21.270> prefer<00:01:21.390> cross<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.439> here

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470

usually prefer cross like you see here
with<00:01:22.770> surber<00:01:23.159> sex<00:01:24.770> because<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:26.280> melee

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
with surber sex because your melee

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.510 
with surber sex because your melee
attack<00:01:27.150> has<00:01:27.570> an<00:01:27.750> actual<00:01:28.140> faster<00:01:28.860> castrate

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
attack has an actual faster castrate

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.370 
attack has an actual faster castrate
than<00:01:30.119> your<00:01:30.329> long-range<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:33.140> can't<00:01:34.140> remember

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
than your long-range I can't remember

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.490 
than your long-range I can't remember
why<00:01:34.530> i<00:01:34.560> used<00:01:34.650> wide<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:38.420> dissemination

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
why i used wide for dissemination

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.889 
why i used wide for dissemination
decimation<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:41.210> but<00:01:42.210> these<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
decimation or not but these are the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.800 
decimation or not but these are the
paradigms<00:01:43.790> when<00:01:44.790> ahead<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.119> showed<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.600> me
