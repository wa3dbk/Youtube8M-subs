00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.060
 it is of course to talk 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.620
 samsung galaxy s 5 on top i have 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.630
 here again in the blue but as I said it 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.300
 is also still available in other colors 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.920
 buy is very nice already through 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.420
 window can see is that we too 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.250
 here the waterproof of the back 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.720
 to be maintained if we are the 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.210
 make back the same from samsung 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.460
 you see the rubber border here too 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.390
 will persist and also the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.920
 camera and the heart rate monitor can also be in the 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.450
 used as well as that 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.340
 mike now I'm even the judge 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.710
 off with the golden here too we have 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.180
 By the way, of course, a separate one 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.680
 video for you if you like the golden one 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.540
 further interested just look 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.770
 use our channel pure and the 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.180
 Just put it in so I'll do that 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.010
 I like to press my press 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.090
 press it once outside until it is 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.760
 cracking everywhere is natural 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.260
 also really waterproof is because 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.909
 if we have so small columns here 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.280
 Of course, the water can penetrate that 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.659
 is not good 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.100
 samsung always remembers you too 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.560
 Let me tell you that you really are 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.000
 in fact, this is so beautiful everywhere 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.799
 pure does not place then 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.750
 can fall out and then we can 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.220
 the s5 already used with the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.690
 swim cover that way, too 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.790
 can completely fold back and 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.540
 even then photos are still possible 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.580
 Of course , that should be the case 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.890
 also be clean but the best is when 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.290
 you just do the photos or you 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.030
 can the photos right here from the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.920
 start app is now just here 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.990
 camera app up and you can already 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.820
 with the rear camera here photos 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.770
 shoot you also have fast access 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.689
 whether you want automatic lightning 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.040
 or not, and he became focused on topics 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.720
 should come because the touchscreen is 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.189
 of course, but still usable here 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.799
 You could also easily get it out of the app 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.720
 come out again and then that too 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.200
 show weather or the pedometer 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.400
 to let 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.680
 Of course, there is something for that here 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.270
 example here as you can see the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.490
 option to leave this hans home or 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.630
 Not 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.570
 or you can also do that 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.729
 change background for her for your as 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.780
 you cover and if you have the phone then 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.520
 you can see it here, too 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.740
 that you have more options at 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.150
 accessories if we already in the window 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.459
 but earlier here were the remains 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.050
 background is the same as always 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.790
 if we do that in the unlock window then off 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.350
 Looks like this but when I do 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.330
 then there's another window here 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.730
 of course, if you are one, it is convenient 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.560
 differently colored had like now the mobile phone 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.950
 spams itself is open as see their 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.330
 can 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.470
 it also reacts nicely fast 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.520
 also has such a nice open 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.160
 animations in it 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.739
 when unfolding I find that very 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.569
 pleasant and otherwise there are here 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.130
 not really other functions above 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.959
 you can go back to the status bar here 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.120
 pull down another 1 4 to the left or 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.260
 go right but come sand 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.310
 should immediately assume we have to 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.170
 Open up again, up here 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.730
 Of course, the speaker is in there 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.620
 You can make a phone call like that 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.019
 is in your hand and the microphone here 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.550
 Downstairs is also accessible as well 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.120

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.420
 camera and also the fingerprint resp
