00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.850
 i is the dough mode j 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:10.780
 There is another street but the same is clothes that do the kilometers 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:14.810
 Actually I reviewed that guitar once yesterday, though 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:19.880
 It is in spite of the talking hard 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:24.800
 It feels like the video has not been turned and it's already over again today 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:30.740
 It 's a guitar that you've noticed when you go to the libor ne Nantoyoshi guitar 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.890
 People take in over light if you get it I'm connected to the Torne lines after all it is the line now 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 Many 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.110
 Parry Roh 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:43.400
 The shape of a normal cat and its 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:46.580
 It's a shape when I'm through my back, I know-the shape of this line is completely different 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.340
 And after all I that is it is to some extent now 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:54.790
 When the amplifier attached to the guitar is not firm 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.160
 I'm depending on that Well guitar because becomes a completely different 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.600
 There is no way 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.530
 I hear a very flimsy sound 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.440
 Using now 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.330
 About 50 en years of formation type 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.280
 But the amp was just a net 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.890
 It is only tone the volume wood 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.900
 This man is what Naa be allowed to flow normally be 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.140
 this 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:23.300
 It would be a really bot fluent sound and presumptuous made 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.610
 Cherry blossoms of the future 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:31.250
 People how you are listening to yourself in the sound of a lack of Naa sound is good Nechotto climax or say 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.180
 Since the rough door softening efficacy 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.320
 A good guitar with a good sound 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:45.290
 And Well I'd been looking for a knee of a certain degree of price 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.860
 I used to borrow a guitar when I thought it was an outside bar, but that guitar is very 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.980
 I'm glad the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.100
 Because the balance was good 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:58.520
 I was looking for a guitar that looked like it 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.650
 I'm a Yamaha guitar and I do n't like it a bit for Yamahara 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.990
 But I 'm evolving wide 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.470
 Electric acoustic guitar and I do also that of each maker I type I is by raw sound the sound of good 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.680
 1 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.900
 Yamaha a series I saw this time 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:22.100
 By Te very well in to Edan' 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:24.280
 If it is about 100,000 even if it is bought with a new article, it will be the Hachiman or the 9th I 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.560
 I was looking for a return 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.230
 As a rectangular field and unresponsive k 4 place 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.300
 There are 3 or 3 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.600
 I was looking for such a feeling of guitar 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.460
 It is cheap 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.760
 Lead is found 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.240
 You can buy it for less than half the price you buy for a new item 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.760
 I found 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.740
 Hey 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.800
 I supported you and the place is today 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.700
 Arrived or rather Tsurou tired yesterday 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:01.260
 It's just arrived I got a little pull 6 I was very good 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:03.620
 Yamaha of ac's a 3 draft'd review it today 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.620
 About Te 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.340
 Yes 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.970
 It feels like 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.410
 Hey hey this today 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.280
 It is spiritually debut 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.819
 Then there is a 3 of Yamaha 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.900
 We introduce first I This is the pleasure 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.900
 It contains little 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.460
 Oh yeah 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.970
 This is the Yamaha emblem Neun 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.510
 You have 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.110
 Good 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.040
 Yes this is 4 Yes this is from behind 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.630
 It has become bought on 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.490
 It depends a little 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.780
 a First of all it is behind 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.650
 It is big and is big 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.650
 I can do it 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.920
 It is a pick guard unique to a series now 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.200
 It is sugar Te 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.830
 Cat Oh 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.830
 It is low 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.340
 It is difficult to practice 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.090
 It is easy to pull 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.690
 poroco battery is 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.410
 Hmm 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:22.100
 It is not this qualification but it is carbonic acid 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.100
 This is great 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.720
 And this pre-Aan 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.490
 a There are two series, but this one is a little more 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.830
 What 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.880
 Setting is good 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.650
 I can fork, but I will make a sound again on the next occasion 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.509
 Owned Toka this child riser is not poked 3 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.509
 There is also a lot of switching 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.910
 I think that it is easy to use 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.400
 How long i think 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.660
 It has become a feeling 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.930
 I use 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.930
 so 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.470
 Right 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.290
 The neck is too late This feature is 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:24.180
 Neck not have become so extremely thick, which was subjected to a body from the You're Well is 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:29.400
 It is very easy to play in the feature 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:33.889
 Has become easier to use for this there was Hogaee 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.889
 I have entered a fairly big up school 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.110
 I am 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.710
 I guess would have been how to enter a 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.400
 I think it's still difficult to understand 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.569
 It is this 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.449
 Flower soon please 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.889
 It is cheap and good 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.889
 All operations in 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.070
 It does not say 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:03.360
 It is after in 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:06.009
 Ac to this series mountain series and others 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.750
 There is a type of English translation 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:13.220
 Besides , I was a woman at that time when I was a club 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.409
 There is a little rack Ueno over there 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.830
 5 minutes 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.370
 Wonder 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.129
 Then line 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.380
 It will be live but 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:25.740
 of apx and cpx 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:30.220
 There are many differences in the Toei series 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:35.890
 The bottleneck is cpx or fix 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:41.050
 It is two grains a series seems to be like a little like so much like a limp 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:48.139
 There is no sense of luxury , but that 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:52.660
 Firmly wide Cage really I really Toka summer and is a lot slippery and feel to fit in the hand 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:58.570
 It is difficult to change sweat and hold a walk so much 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:07:00.250
 It's a bit slippery and it's like yashikimi I'm really worried about this 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.639
 It is included 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:08.260
 So it's thin like this 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:15.529
 Say sound out splashed also that next time also and want to do is water cancer 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:18.090
 This is a series of a series a 3 a draft of Yamaha's Eleako 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:22.740
 There may be 3 a 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:28.529
 It was the current of this, I wonder if it would be better if I was lost 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:30.460
 Come on, let 's see for a moment and see if it's time to draw 

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:35.770
 As a security 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:42.940
 Please listen to those who want a very good feeling of shary 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:44.139
