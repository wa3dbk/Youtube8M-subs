them<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:47.020> that<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.530> don't<00:02:48.010> I'm<00:02:48.250> not

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
them like that I don't I'm not

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.979 
them like that I don't I'm not
comfortable<00:02:48.670> with<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.690> little

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
comfortable with that so it's a little

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:50.910 
comfortable with that so it's a little
too<00:02:50.140> much<00:02:50.320> for<00:02:50.560> me

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
too much for me

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
if I was going to be locking them so I

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.810 
if I was going to be locking them so I
would<00:02:53.260> make<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.860> little<00:02:54.190> bit<00:02:54.340> tighter<00:02:54.550> too

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
would make this a little bit tighter too

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.960 
would make this a little bit tighter too
