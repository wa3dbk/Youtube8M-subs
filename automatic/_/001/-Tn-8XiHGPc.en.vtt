 phone 317 77 71 a clash between a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.859
 pipe with 60 thousand liters of gas and a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.560
 trailer was produced on the highway 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.800
 Mexico-Guadalajara 500 meters from the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.420
 toll booth of zinapécuaro michoacán 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.669
 the trailer that transported water 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.649
 bottled it ran out of brakes so 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.719
 that used the braking ramp 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.420
 hours later the pipe of the company zeta 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.000
 suffered a similar mishap and used the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.600
 same emerging way impacting against 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.600
 the heavy truck 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.460
 near nine o'clock in the morning 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.590
 four lanes of the highway to the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.350
 height of the marathon stretch zinapécuaro 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.290
 They were closed between kilometers 183 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.660
 and 226 around three in the afternoon 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.390
 Civil protection elements began 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.670
 the draining of hydrocarbon to another pipe 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.650
 at the risk of an explosion by the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.650
 leak that occurred after the impact 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.490
 víctor hugo sanchez lieutenant of firemen 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.440
 He said that the maneuvers were carried out 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.690
 careful way of having 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.240
 an explosion occurred 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.340
 they would have reached up to 8 kilometers 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.930
 the round one or one of the tanks has 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.970
 a fissure and is spilling large 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.980
 quantities of liquid gas then today 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.620
 is what we are doing is a 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.570
 terminal transfer and another dissipating the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.660
 gas cloud so that it greatly diminishes the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.660
 risk 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.560

 he said that his workers maneuvered 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.880
 with the trailer that was left without brakes 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.470
 when the pipe hit him they were 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.570
 working with the first trailer of 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.610
 fact you can see the box that is 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.350
 there everything destroyed was working 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.180
 with them that was left without brakes and for 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.160
 they were taking it out they also work a 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.040
 trailer and they heard nothing more like a 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.130
 explosion more pressure from there all are 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.050
 it clouded them there was a cloud of dust the pipe 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.450
 with 60,000 liters of liquid gas 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.850
 came from the state of Hidalgo and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.920
 directed to Morelia the driver of 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.020
 trailer received a blow to the nose 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.300
 while that of the pipe was given to the 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.030
 leak about an hour and a half 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.800
 It took the transfer maneuvers and a 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.870
 time done about four o'clock in the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.090

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.480
 lanes 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.680
