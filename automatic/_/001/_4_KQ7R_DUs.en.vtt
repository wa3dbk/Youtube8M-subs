00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
really carbon fiber but looks like it

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.859 
really carbon fiber but looks like it
could<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:20.970> kind<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:22.160> design<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
could be kind of design and it's a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.009 
could be kind of design and it's a
flexible<00:00:25.529> case<00:00:26.130> here<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.699> then<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.869> see

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
flexible case here and then you can see

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.710 
flexible case here and then you can see
the<00:00:28.109> keys<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.179> let<00:00:30.179> me<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:30.420> if<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.660> get

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
these to not be blurry one second all

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
these to not be blurry one second all
right<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:37.399> these<00:00:38.399> are<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.940> various<00:00:39.090> keys<00:00:39.570> that

supposed to work so let's try that see

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.859 
supposed to work so let's try that see
if<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:12.900> right<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.979> I've<00:01:14.130> got<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.869> blue

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
now we're connected now this keyboard is

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.410 
now we're connected now this keyboard is
very<00:01:55.990> similar<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:57.220> fact<00:01:57.670> it's<00:01:57.970> identical

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
very similar to in fact it's identical

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.230 
very similar to in fact it's identical
to<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:58.930> keyboard<00:01:59.229> this<00:02:00.160> one<00:02:00.460> is<00:02:00.790> currently

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
to this keyboard this one is currently

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.969 
to this keyboard this one is currently
my<00:02:01.479> favorite<00:02:01.810> it's<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.320> one<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.590> I've<00:02:02.710> been

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
my favorite it's the one that I've been

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.580 
my favorite it's the one that I've been
using<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.810> keyboard<00:02:05.020> i<00:02:05.260> think<00:02:05.470> is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
using and the keyboard i think is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.980 
using and the keyboard i think is
exactly<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.160> same<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.750> difference

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
exactly the same so the difference

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.910 
exactly the same so the difference
between<00:02:08.500> these<00:02:09.459> two<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:10.300> going<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.230> be<00:02:11.410> whether

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
between these two is going to be whether

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.370 
between these two is going to be whether
you<00:02:12.459> want<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.880> have<00:02:13.090> kind<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.540> full<00:02:13.959> cover

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
you want to have kind of full cover

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.160 
you want to have kind of full cover
protection<00:02:15.100> for<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.490> ipad<00:02:15.850> which<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.900> do

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
protection for the ipad which you do

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.880 
protection for the ipad which you do
with<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.940> one<00:02:19.239> as<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:20.110> can<00:02:20.320> see<00:02:20.590> it's

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
with this one as you can see it's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.979 
with this one as you can see it's
bulkier<00:02:22.200> because<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.850> has<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:25.360> clamshell

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
bulkier because it has a clamshell

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.979 
bulkier because it has a clamshell
design<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:27.430> looks<00:02:27.940> like<00:02:28.180> it's<00:02:28.360> supposed<00:02:28.750> to

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
design it looks like it's supposed to

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.550 
design it looks like it's supposed to
yeah<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.709> does<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.489> clicks<00:02:30.760> together<00:02:31.150> here

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
yeah it does so it clicks together here

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.130 
yeah it does so it clicks together here
so<00:02:32.560> that's<00:02:32.739> pretty<00:02:32.950> cool<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.459> guess<00:02:33.959> but<00:02:34.959> I

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
so that's pretty cool I guess but I

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.870 
so that's pretty cool I guess but I
don't<00:02:35.290> like<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.560> bulkiness<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.520> i

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
don't like the bulkiness of it and i

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.760 
don't like the bulkiness of it and i
also<00:02:36.910> don't<00:02:37.360> like<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.810> can't<00:02:37.840> use<00:02:38.560> this<00:02:39.459> my

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
also don't like that I can't use this my

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.190 
also don't like that I can't use this my
apple<00:02:41.770> cover<00:02:42.340> with<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.270> keyboard<00:02:43.570> right<00:02:44.140> i

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
apple cover with this keyboard right i

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.840 
apple cover with this keyboard right i
mean<00:02:44.320> obviously<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:44.950> would<00:02:45.070> make<00:02:45.280> no<00:02:45.310> sense<00:02:45.489> to

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
mean obviously it would make no sense to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.310 
mean obviously it would make no sense to
have<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.180> thing<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:49.630> i<00:02:49.959> wouldn't<00:02:50.260> be

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
have this thing on it so i wouldn't be

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.600 
have this thing on it so i wouldn't be
able<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.500> use<00:02:50.709> it<00:02:50.739> but<00:02:51.250> let's<00:02:51.340> go<00:02:51.459> ahead<00:02:51.519> and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
able to use it but let's go ahead and

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.150 
able to use it but let's go ahead and
test<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.970> keyboard<00:02:52.320> I'm<00:02:53.320> imagine<00:02:53.920> it's<00:02:54.040> going

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
test the keyboard I'm imagine it's going

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.090 
test the keyboard I'm imagine it's going
to<00:02:54.220> perform<00:02:54.519> very<00:02:54.910> similarly<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.890> other

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
to perform very similarly to this other

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.860 
to perform very similarly to this other
one<00:02:57.310> right<00:02:57.610> here<00:02:57.820> which<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.060> like<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.299> lot<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
one right here which I like a lot so the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.740 
one right here which I like a lot so the
keyboard<00:02:59.260> probably<00:02:59.650> will<00:02:59.739> be<00:02:59.860> pretty<00:02:59.980> good

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
keyboard probably will be pretty good

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.050 
keyboard probably will be pretty good
okay<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.049> let<00:03:02.890> me<00:03:02.920> just<00:03:03.130> select<00:03:03.519> all<00:03:03.760> and

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
okay so let me just select all and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.460 
okay so let me just select all and
delete<00:03:05.250> now<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.310> Adonit<00:03:07.239> writer<00:03:07.690> too<00:03:08.019> had<00:03:08.440> a

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
delete now the Adonit writer too had a

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.300 
delete now the Adonit writer too had a
time<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.799> one<00:03:09.220> minute<00:03:09.250> 45<00:03:09.880> seconds<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:11.310> let's

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
time of one minute 45 seconds and let's

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.539 
time of one minute 45 seconds and let's
see<00:03:12.459> how<00:03:12.580> this<00:03:12.730> one<00:03:12.940> does<00:03:13.180> in<00:03:13.420> comparison<00:03:14.079> so

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
see how this one does in comparison so

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:51.540 
see how this one does in comparison so
here<00:03:15.549> we<00:03:15.670> go

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:59.430 

and<00:03:52.120> then<00:03:52.300> I<00:03:52.390> want<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.660> grab<00:03:52.990> this

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.070 

and<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.070> can<00:04:00.190> just<00:04:00.370> hit<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.700> cut<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.150> then<00:04:01.960> up

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
and I can just hit the cut and then up

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.340 
and I can just hit the cut and then up
here<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:04.090> paste<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.960> I'm<00:04:05.050> done<00:04:05.520> so<00:04:06.520> amazingly

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
here the paste and I'm done so amazingly

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.230 
here the paste and I'm done so amazingly
amazingly<00:04:08.350> this<00:04:08.590> keyboard<00:04:09.070> actually<00:04:09.520> did<00:04:10.120> it

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
amazingly this keyboard actually did it

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.560 
amazingly this keyboard actually did it
fast<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.780> could<00:04:10.960> do<00:04:11.050> this<00:04:11.140> faster<00:04:11.820> than<00:04:12.820> on<00:04:13.030> the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
fast I could do this faster than on the

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.350 
fast I could do this faster than on the
laptop<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.680> did<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.920> in<00:04:15.010> 51<00:04:15.580> seconds<00:04:16.060> on<00:04:16.299> the

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
laptop I did it in 51 seconds on the

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.590 
laptop I did it in 51 seconds on the
laptop<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.470> took<00:04:17.590> me<00:04:17.709> 56<00:04:18.100> seconds<00:04:18.820> which<00:04:19.299> that

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
laptop it took me 56 seconds which that

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.960 
laptop it took me 56 seconds which that
is<00:04:19.750> incredible<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.440> on<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.489> identity<00:04:21.790> writer

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
is incredible and on the identity writer

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.270 
is incredible and on the identity writer
took<00:04:22.180> me<00:04:22.330> a<00:04:22.360> minute<00:04:22.660> in<00:04:22.870> 46<00:04:23.440> seconds<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:24.040> it

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
took me a minute in 46 seconds so it

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.880 
took me a minute in 46 seconds so it
just<00:04:24.520> goes<00:04:24.700> to<00:04:25.000> show<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:26.110> value<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.710> having

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
just goes to show the value of having

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.770 
just goes to show the value of having
keys<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.520> are<00:04:27.550> spaced<00:04:27.910> far<00:04:28.270> apart<00:04:28.360> from<00:04:28.600> each

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
keys that are spaced far apart from each

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.730 
keys that are spaced far apart from each
other<00:04:28.930> let<00:04:29.140> me<00:04:29.200> just<00:04:29.350> show<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.560> the

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
other let me just show you the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.710 
other let me just show you the
difference<00:04:30.190> in<00:04:30.370> keys<00:04:30.760> let<00:04:31.090> me<00:04:31.180> take<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.450> adhan

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
difference in keys let me take the adhan

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.860 
difference in keys let me take the adhan
it<00:04:31.900> back<00:04:32.590> out<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.770> its<00:04:32.980> box<00:04:33.160> here<00:04:33.670> and<00:04:34.240> show<00:04:34.810> you

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
it back out of its box here and show you

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.590 
it back out of its box here and show you
the<00:04:34.990> difference<00:04:35.440> in<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:36.130> key<00:04:37.060> spacing

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
the difference in the key spacing

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.730 
the difference in the key spacing
because<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.140> pretty<00:04:38.380> incredible<00:04:39.690> how<00:04:40.690> well

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
because it is pretty incredible how well

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.340 
because it is pretty incredible how well
this<00:04:41.740> zag<00:04:42.190> keyboard<00:04:42.760> is<00:04:42.880> laid<00:04:43.090> out<00:04:43.350> as

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
this zag keyboard is laid out as

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.390 
this zag keyboard is laid out as
compared<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.690> via<00:04:46.690> donít<00:04:47.200> I<00:04:47.410> don't<00:04:48.190> know<00:04:48.280> if

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
compared to via donít I don't know if

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.430 
compared to via donít I don't know if
it's<00:04:48.520> going<00:04:48.640> to<00:04:48.730> really<00:04:48.880> show<00:04:49.300> but<00:04:50.200> there's<00:04:50.380> a

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
it's going to really show but there's a

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.770 
it's going to really show but there's a
lot<00:04:50.830> more<00:04:50.860> space<00:04:51.430> somehow<00:04:52.060> even<00:04:52.540> though<00:04:52.570> these

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
lot more space somehow even though these

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.890 
lot more space somehow even though these
keyboards<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.620> guess<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:54.850> zagg<00:04:55.150> yeah<00:04:55.660> I<00:04:55.690> mean

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
keyboards I guess the zagg yeah I mean

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.290 
keyboards I guess the zagg yeah I mean
it's<00:04:56.050> just<00:04:56.140> about<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.650> same<00:04:57.010> width<00:04:57.370> right

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
it's just about the same width right

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.020 
it's just about the same width right
there's<00:04:58.510> not<00:04:58.660> really<00:04:59.460> somehow<00:05:00.460> these<00:05:00.640> keys

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
there's not really somehow these keys

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.630 
there's not really somehow these keys
are<00:05:01.060> just<00:05:01.510> so<00:05:02.110> much<00:05:02.320> more<00:05:02.770> spacious<00:05:03.130> Lee<00:05:03.460> laid

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.580 
are just so much more spacious Lee laid
out<00:05:03.790> on<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:03.970> zagg<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:04.630> can't<00:05:05.020> tell<00:05:05.230> you<00:05:05.380> how

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
out on the zagg I can't tell you how

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.770 
out on the zagg I can't tell you how
hugely<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:07.320> different<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:09.160> zagg<00:05:10.030> keyboard<00:05:10.600> or

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
hugely a different the zagg keyboard or

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.870 
hugely a different the zagg keyboard or
logitech<00:05:11.230> keyboard<00:05:11.440> feels<00:05:11.919> as<00:05:12.280> compared<00:05:12.820> to

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
logitech keyboard feels as compared to

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.060 
logitech keyboard feels as compared to
this<00:05:13.060> one<00:05:13.120> so<00:05:13.600> it's<00:05:14.350> just<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.710> world<00:05:14.919> of

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
this one so it's just a world of

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.860 
this one so it's just a world of
difference<00:05:15.160> and<00:05:15.610> in<00:05:15.700> fact<00:05:15.970> it's<00:05:16.300> twice<00:05:16.840> as

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
difference and in fact it's twice as

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.260 
difference and in fact it's twice as
fast<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.560> even<00:05:17.950> faster<00:05:18.400> than<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.610> laptop<00:05:19.030> was

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
fast and even faster than the laptop was

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.980 
fast and even faster than the laptop was
which<00:05:19.540> is<00:05:20.430> amazing<00:05:21.430> so<00:05:22.030> we<00:05:22.330> put<00:05:22.540> this<00:05:22.600> adhan<00:05:22.840> it

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
which is amazing so we put this adhan it

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.140 
which is amazing so we put this adhan it
back<00:05:23.169> in<00:05:23.350> its<00:05:23.470> case

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.520 

so<00:05:28.150> this<00:05:28.270> is<00:05:28.420> the<00:05:28.570> zagg<00:05:28.810> folio<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:31.200> just<00:05:32.200> kind

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
so this is the zagg folio and just kind

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.490 
so this is the zagg folio and just kind
of<00:05:32.560> show<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.740> these<00:05:32.920> keys<00:05:33.250> again<00:05:34.320> here<00:05:35.320> they

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
of show you these keys again here they

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.680 
of show you these keys again here they
are<00:05:36.810> so<00:05:37.810> I<00:05:37.870> can<00:05:38.110> go<00:05:38.980> to<00:05:39.040> the<00:05:39.370> home<00:05:39.580> screen<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:40.360> can

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
are so I can go to the home screen I can

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:52.320 
are so I can go to the home screen I can
search<00:05:41.350> I<00:05:46.680> can<00:05:47.680> do<00:05:47.830> photos<00:05:48.310> I<00:05:50.910> can<00:05:51.910> pull<00:05:52.120> up<00:05:52.150> a

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
search I can do photos I can pull up a

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.240 
search I can do photos I can pull up a
keyboard<00:05:52.840> I<00:05:53.110> guess<00:05:53.650> that's<00:05:53.830> what<00:05:53.980> this<00:05:54.070> is

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
keyboard I guess that's what this is

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.130 
keyboard I guess that's what this is
supposed<00:05:54.340> to<00:05:54.580> do<00:05:54.760> I'm<00:05:55.300> not<00:05:55.690> sure<00:05:55.930> it's<00:05:56.080> not

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
supposed to do I'm not sure it's not

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.140 
supposed to do I'm not sure it's not
doing<00:05:56.410> anything<00:05:56.560> right<00:05:56.800> now<00:05:56.860> but<00:05:57.160> maybe<00:05:57.910> if

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
doing anything right now but maybe if

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.630 
doing anything right now but maybe if
i'm<00:05:58.330> in<00:05:58.540> let<00:05:59.200> me<00:05:59.290> just<00:05:59.470> try<00:05:59.790> being<00:06:00.790> in<00:06:01.000> here

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
i'm in let me just try being in here

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.070 
i'm in let me just try being in here
yeah<00:06:03.640> i<00:06:03.670> don't<00:06:03.820> know<00:06:03.970> what<00:06:04.150> this<00:06:04.270> out<00:06:04.720> assume

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
yeah i don't know what this out assume

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.330 
yeah i don't know what this out assume
this<00:06:05.200> would<00:06:05.350> be<00:06:05.440> to<00:06:05.560> pull<00:06:05.740> up<00:06:05.830> an<00:06:05.950> on-screen

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
this would be to pull up an on-screen

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.670 
this would be to pull up an on-screen
keyboard<00:06:06.970> but<00:06:07.200> doesn't<00:06:08.200> seem<00:06:08.350> to<00:06:08.440> be<00:06:08.530> really

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
keyboard but doesn't seem to be really

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.420 
keyboard but doesn't seem to be really
doing<00:06:09.100> anything<00:06:11.670> it's<00:06:12.670> this<00:06:12.850> one<00:06:13.060> right<00:06:13.090> here

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
doing anything it's this one right here

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.280 
doing anything it's this one right here
so<00:06:15.430> i<00:06:15.670> don't<00:06:15.940> really<00:06:15.970> know<00:06:16.240> and<00:06:17.550> then<00:06:18.550> it<00:06:19.450> has

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
so i don't really know and then it has

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.350 
so i don't really know and then it has
the<00:06:21.360> cut<00:06:22.360> paste<00:06:23.080> or<00:06:23.680> cut<00:06:24.130> copy<00:06:24.400> and<00:06:24.550> paste<00:06:24.910> so<00:06:25.330> i

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
the cut paste or cut copy and paste so i

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.950 
the cut paste or cut copy and paste so i
can<00:06:25.600> keep<00:06:26.350> pasting<00:06:26.620> text<00:06:26.860> here<00:06:27.490> as<00:06:27.720> well<00:06:28.720> as<00:06:28.930> a

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
can keep pasting text here as well as a

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.260 
can keep pasting text here as well as a
music<00:06:29.770> Keys<00:06:30.010> volume<00:06:30.910> and<00:06:31.360> then<00:06:32.350> screen<00:06:33.010> lock

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
music Keys volume and then screen lock

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.980 
music Keys volume and then screen lock
so<00:06:34.270> that's<00:06:34.450> the<00:06:35.520> logitech<00:06:36.570> z<00:06:37.570> it's<00:06:37.900> actually

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
so that's the logitech z it's actually

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.870 
so that's the logitech z it's actually
not<00:06:38.290> logic<00:06:38.680> at<00:06:38.890> all<00:06:38.980> I<00:06:39.010> guess<00:06:39.250> it's<00:06:39.430> just<00:06:39.460> zag

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
not logic at all I guess it's just zag

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.450 
not logic at all I guess it's just zag
folio<00:06:40.360> so<00:06:40.660> zag<00:06:40.930> folio<00:06:41.410> keyboard<00:06:42.070> made<00:06:42.250> by<00:06:42.400> zagg

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
folio so zag folio keyboard made by zagg

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.090 
folio so zag folio keyboard made by zagg
the<00:06:42.850> logitech<00:06:43.270> also<00:06:43.540> uses<00:06:43.870> the<00:06:44.530> zagg<00:06:44.770> folio

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
the logitech also uses the zagg folio

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.310 
the logitech also uses the zagg folio
keyboard<00:06:45.520> and<00:06:45.760> i'm<00:06:46.420> just<00:06:46.510> going<00:06:46.690> to<00:06:46.720> slide<00:06:47.110> the

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
keyboard and i'm just going to slide the

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.090 
keyboard and i'm just going to slide the
ipad<00:06:47.710> back<00:06:47.980> out<00:06:48.220> and<00:06:49.380> so<00:06:50.380> there's<00:06:50.620> the<00:06:50.770> ipad

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
ipad back out and so there's the ipad

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.250 
ipad back out and so there's the ipad
without<00:06:51.460> the<00:06:52.090> keyboard<00:06:52.300> on<00:06:52.540> it<00:06:52.630> ok<00:06:52.900> so<00:06:52.990> that's

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
without the keyboard on it ok so that's

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.820 
without the keyboard on it ok so that's
keyboard<00:06:53.710> number<00:06:54.100> two
