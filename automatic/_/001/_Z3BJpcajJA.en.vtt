hi<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:02.250> going<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.580> today<00:00:03.210> we're<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.570> do

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
hi I'm going to today we're going to do

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.680 
hi I'm going to today we're going to do
something<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.049> little<00:00:04.620> different<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.420> this<00:00:06.420> is

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
something a little different and this is

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.549 
something a little different and this is
the<00:00:06.839> HP<00:00:07.020> laserjet<00:00:07.859> p2<00:00:08.460> 0<00:00:08.760> 1<00:00:09.150> 5<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.900> they<00:00:10.349> make<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
the HP laserjet p2 0 1 5 and they make a

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.060 
the HP laserjet p2 0 1 5 and they make a
p20<00:00:11.070> one<00:00:11.580> 4<00:00:11.880> also<00:00:12.030> but<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.870> p2<00:00:13.230> 0<00:00:13.410> 1<00:00:13.620> 5<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
p20 one 4 also but the p2 0 1 5 is the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.760 
p20 one 4 also but the p2 0 1 5 is the
most<00:00:14.130> common<00:00:14.610> one<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> duplexing

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
most common one and this is a duplexing

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.240 
most common one and this is a duplexing
network<00:00:17.160> model<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.350> we<00:00:19.350> get<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> ton<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.010> these

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
network model and we get a ton of these

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.359 
network model and we get a ton of these
machines<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.390> you'll<00:00:22.230> get<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> paper<00:00:23.010> jam

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
machines in and you'll get the paper jam

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.700 
machines in and you'll get the paper jam
light<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> toner<00:00:24.420> light<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.170> comes<00:00:25.500> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
light and the toner light that comes on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.730 
light and the toner light that comes on
them<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.689> some<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> some<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> guys

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
them and some of the some of the guys

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.650 
them and some of the some of the guys
have<00:00:28.980> tried<00:00:29.250> baking<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> board<00:00:30.330> that's

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
have tried baking the board that's

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.520 
have tried baking the board that's
actually<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> formatter<00:00:31.710> board<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:34.410> we

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
actually the formatter board and what we

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.470 
actually the formatter board and what we
have<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.010> cold<00:00:35.460> solder<00:00:35.850> joints<00:00:36.329> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
have is we have cold solder joints that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
have is we have cold solder joints that
the<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.050> soldering<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.620> actually<00:00:38.100> cracked

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the the soldering is actually cracked

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.030 
the the soldering is actually cracked
causing<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.239> not<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.540> make<00:00:39.690> connections<00:00:40.200> but

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
causing it not to make connections but

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.650 
causing it not to make connections but
it<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.340> such<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> big<00:00:41.760> problem<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> plagued<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it was such a big problem it plagued the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.680 
it was such a big problem it plagued the
industry<00:00:43.110> I've<00:00:44.070> got<00:00:44.399> three<00:00:44.940> machines<00:00:45.420> today

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
industry I've got three machines today

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.569 
industry I've got three machines today
that<00:00:45.809> are<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.289> doing<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> same<00:00:46.800> thing<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
that are all doing the same thing and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.740 
that are all doing the same thing and
I'm<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> little<00:00:48.480> fun

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
I'm going to kind of have a little fun

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.959 
I'm going to kind of have a little fun
with<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> three

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
with this and I'm going to do three

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.880 
with this and I'm going to do three
boards<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.660> we're<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.230> bake<00:00:52.469> them<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
boards and we're going to bake them and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
boards and we're going to bake them and
see<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> result<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
see what the result is I think this is

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.330 
see what the result is I think this is
going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.020> kind<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.260> cool

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
going to be kind of cool

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:27.260 
going to be kind of cool
also<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> HP<00:00:57.510> laserjet<00:01:07.189> p1102w<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:27.090> comes

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
also the HP laserjet p1102w it comes

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.410 
also the HP laserjet p1102w it comes
right<00:01:27.540> out<00:01:27.570> pretty<00:01:27.930> easy<00:01:28.220> but<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:30.030> could<00:01:30.299> be

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
right out pretty easy but this could be

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.370 
right out pretty easy but this could be
a<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:31.380> fun<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.720> something<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.229> might

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
a really fun and something that might

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.810 
a really fun and something that might
even<00:01:34.590> save<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.890> some<00:01:35.070> money<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.430> that's<00:01:35.579> kind

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
even save you some money and that's kind

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.450 
even save you some money and that's kind
of<00:01:35.880> cool<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.920> some<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> guys<00:01:38.189> have

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
of cool so some of the guys have

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
of cool so some of the guys have
recommended<00:01:38.880> baking<00:01:39.689> these<00:01:39.840> boards<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.350> 350

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
recommended baking these boards at 350

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.389 
recommended baking these boards at 350
degrees<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.850> 5<00:01:42.570> minutes<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.189> it

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
degrees for 5 minutes and you know it

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.139 
degrees for 5 minutes and you know it
helps<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:46.100> we've<00:01:47.100> always<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.579> replacing

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
helps it out we've always just replacing

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.450 
helps it out we've always just replacing
the<00:01:48.180> board<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:50.070> model

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the board but you know on this model

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.630 
the board but you know on this model
this<00:01:51.210> board<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:51.960> over<00:01:52.829> $100<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
this board is actually over $100 and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.100 
this board is actually over $100 and
that's<00:01:53.729> quite<00:01:54.030> expensive<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> small

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
that's quite expensive for just a small

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.920 
that's quite expensive for just a small
desktop<00:01:55.680> printer<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.570> repair

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
desktop printer and so if this repair

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.219 
desktop printer and so if this repair
works<00:01:58.170> successful<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.880> think<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> great

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
works successful I think this is a great

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.649 
works successful I think this is a great
option<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.490> somebody<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.060> do<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.390> at<00:02:03.600> home

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
option for somebody to do this at home

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.440 
option for somebody to do this at home
and<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.610> fix<00:02:05.850> their<00:02:06.030> own<00:02:06.090> printer

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
and and you know fix their own printer

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.990 
and and you know fix their own printer
and<00:02:06.540> that's

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
and that's

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.870 
and that's
wolf<00:02:07.150> so<00:02:08.130> what<00:02:09.130> you<00:02:09.220> want<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.429> do<00:02:09.550> is<00:02:09.670> just

wiring harnesses and just kind of remove
them<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.800> again<00:02:20.980> all<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:21.190> need<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:21.460> just<00:02:21.580> a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
them so again all you need is just a

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.660 
them so again all you need is just a
number<00:02:22.030> two<00:02:22.210> phillips<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:23.400> there<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.520> go

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
number two phillips and there you go

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.290 
number two phillips and there you go
there's<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.030> board<00:02:27.990> again<00:02:28.990> I'm<00:02:29.260> going<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.770> do

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
there's the board again I'm going to do

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.210 
there's the board again I'm going to do
three<00:02:31.300> boards<00:02:31.720> just<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:32.530> can<00:02:32.709> kind<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.070> have

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
three boards just so we can kind of have

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.060 
three boards just so we can kind of have
more<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.870> more<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:36.450> suitable<00:02:37.450> test<00:02:38.070> I

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
more of a more of a suitable test I

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.770 
more of a more of a suitable test I
think<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.730> kind<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.000> cool<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.390> do<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.630> this

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
think this is kind of cool to do it this

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.150 
think this is kind of cool to do it this
way<00:02:40.959> all<00:02:41.200> three<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.530> these<00:02:41.590> machines<00:02:42.040> are

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
way all three of these machines are

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.670 
way all three of these machines are
doing<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.489> same<00:02:42.760> thing<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.230> really

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
doing the same thing and this is really

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.040 
doing the same thing and this is really
common<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.340> on<00:02:45.550> part<00:02:46.150> two<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.540> we're

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
common so on part two of this we're

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.780 
common so on part two of this we're
going<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.230> do<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.470> baking<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.100> then<00:02:48.459> part

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
going to do the baking and then part

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.420 
going to do the baking and then part
three<00:02:48.820> will<00:02:49.270> be<00:02:49.390> actually<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.020> final<00:02:50.560> what<00:02:51.280> we

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
three will be actually the final what we

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.280 
three will be actually the final what we
did<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.820> how<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.060> results<00:02:52.270> were<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:52.989> pretty

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
did and how the results were so pretty

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.890 
did and how the results were so pretty
cool<00:02:53.470> little<00:02:53.620> time
