00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
under the in the video but it's just

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.820 
under the in the video but it's just
kind<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.060> hanging<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> little<00:02:17.170> horn<00:02:17.560> there

can see on camera how kind of just like

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.940 
can see on camera how kind of just like
slowly<00:03:50.690> pumping<00:03:51.260> this<00:03:51.440> rather<00:03:51.650> than<00:03:51.770> just

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
slowly pumping this rather than just

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.620 
slowly pumping this rather than just
push<00:03:52.220> me<00:03:52.400> in<00:03:52.610> past<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:54.880> that's<00:03:55.880> so<00:03:56.240> that<00:03:56.420> just

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
push me in past and that's so that just

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.250 
push me in past and that's so that just
kind<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.900> goes<00:03:57.110> out<00:03:57.380> both<00:03:57.770> in<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.010> little<00:03:58.460> micro

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
kind of goes out both in a little micro

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.770 
kind of goes out both in a little micro
droplets<00:04:00.490> okay<00:04:01.490> it's<00:04:01.790> just<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.240> slower<00:04:02.630> you

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
droplets okay it's just the slower you

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.410 
droplets okay it's just the slower you
inject<00:04:03.290> anesthesia<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.730> more<00:04:04.910> comfortable

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
inject anesthesia the more comfortable

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.120

it<00:04:05.600> is<00:04:05.630> for<00:04:06.050> patients<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.709> doesn't<00:04:07.010> have

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
it is for patients and it doesn't have

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.940 
it is for patients and it doesn't have
to<00:04:07.250> be<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.400> painful<00:04:07.730> experience<00:04:08.320> in<00:04:09.320> immediate

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
to be a painful experience in immediate

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.690 
to be a painful experience in immediate
effect<00:04:10.550> pretty<00:04:10.940> much<00:04:11.120> yes<00:04:12.459> doing<00:04:13.459> anything
