00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
for the past week I think that in the

for the past week I think that in the
past<00:00:17.730> week<00:00:17.970> I've<00:00:18.150> gained<00:00:18.359> more<00:00:18.630> subscribers

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
past week I've gained more subscribers

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.679 
past week I've gained more subscribers
than<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.830> did<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> entire<00:00:20.699> month<00:00:20.939> October

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
than I did in the entire month October

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.109 
than I did in the entire month October
don't<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.890> really<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
don't like that so it's really really a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.060 
don't like that so it's really really a
nice<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.779> lowly<00:00:25.199> change<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> pace<00:00:25.830> but

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
nice and a lowly change of pace but

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.380 
nice and a lowly change of pace but
let's<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.400> straight<00:00:26.580> into<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.970> classes

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
let's get straight into the classes

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.960 
let's get straight into the classes
first<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.289> custom<00:00:28.590> class<00:00:28.740> 1<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
first so custom class 1 this is

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.359 
first so custom class 1 this is
definitely<00:00:30.269> my<00:00:30.599> favorite<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.320> PDW<00:00:31.980> I've

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
like one of those guns where I'm not
entirely<00:01:28.049> sure<00:01:28.259> whether<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.549> mean

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
entirely sure whether I like it I mean

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.030 
entirely sure whether I like it I mean
at<00:01:30.119> some<00:01:30.329> points<00:01:30.720> are<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.920> I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
at some points are just right with it I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.859 
at some points are just right with it I
feel<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.939> feast<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.540> stuff

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
feel like it's like a feast and stuff

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.719 
feel like it's like a feast and stuff
like<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.409> other<00:01:34.979> times<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.400> shoot

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
like that and other times I just shoot

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.940 
like that and other times I just shoot
people<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.240> bullets<00:01:36.990> don't<00:01:37.350> seem<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> connect

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
people and bullets don't seem to connect

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.469 
people and bullets don't seem to connect
that's<00:01:38.130> also<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> reason<00:01:38.640> why<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.790> only<00:01:39.030> just

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that's also the reason why I only just

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.929 
that's also the reason why I only just
reached<00:01:39.860> second<00:01:40.860> prestige<00:01:41.159> because<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
reached second prestige because the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.450 
reached second prestige because the
connection<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.930> before<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.770> entire<00:01:44.189> week

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
connection like before this entire week

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.030 
connection like before this entire week
or<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.939> been<00:01:45.030> pretty<00:01:45.180> bad<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.049> today<00:01:46.799> or

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
or so it's been pretty bad and today or

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.800 
or so it's been pretty bad and today or
yesterday<00:01:47.189> they<00:01:47.579> patched<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.390> now<00:01:48.600> it's

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
yesterday they patched it and now it's

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.719 
yesterday they patched it and now it's
just<00:01:48.960> freaking<00:01:49.470> amazing<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.070> my<00:01:50.159> bullets<00:01:50.490> hit

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
just freaking amazing and my bullets hit

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.770 
just freaking amazing and my bullets hit
so<00:01:51.060> that's<00:01:51.240> pretty<00:01:51.390> cool

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
so that's pretty cool

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.210 
so that's pretty cool
well<00:01:52.200> let's<00:01:52.350> take<00:01:52.470> actually<00:01:52.770> take<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> look<00:01:53.100> at
