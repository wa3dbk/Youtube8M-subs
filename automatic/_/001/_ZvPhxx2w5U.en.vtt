hello there I just wanted to show you
how<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.170> read<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.100> set<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.879> binary<00:00:06.450> clock<00:00:08.179> right

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
how to read and set a binary clock right

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.890 
how to read and set a binary clock right
so<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:11.099> watched<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.700> just<00:00:11.969> got<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
interesting it is all in binary now the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
interesting it is all in binary now the
camera<00:00:18.449> isn't<00:00:18.750> too<00:00:19.439> clear<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.010> these<00:00:20.340> numbers

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
camera isn't too clear on these numbers

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.300 
camera isn't too clear on these numbers
you<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.109> see<00:00:22.140> here<00:00:22.529> we've<00:00:22.619> got<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.769> minute<00:00:23.130> I

four and eight and here we have AM and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.119 
four and eight and here we have AM and
PM<00:00:37.610> now<00:00:38.610> thing<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:39.059> binary<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.739> uses

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
PM now thing about binary is it uses

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.459 
PM now thing about binary is it uses
these<00:00:41.309> numbers<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.910> these<00:00:42.809> numbers<00:00:42.870> are<00:00:43.230> tell

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
these numbers and these numbers are tell

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.030 
these numbers and these numbers are tell
the<00:00:43.590> time

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the time

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.190 
the time
start<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> hours<00:00:45.480> because<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.930> very

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
start with the hours because it's very

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.680 
start with the hours because it's very
simple<00:00:46.800> we've<00:00:47.070> got<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> 1<00:00:47.520> 2<00:00:48.420> 4<00:00:49.200> &amp;<00:00:49.469> 8<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
simple we've got a 1 2 4 &amp; 8 so this a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.000 
simple we've got a 1 2 4 &amp; 8 so this a
is<00:00:51.719> a.m.<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:55.289> 4<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.640> 1<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> lit

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
is a.m. and the 4 and the 1 is a lit

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.959 
is a.m. and the 4 and the 1 is a lit
that<00:00:59.010> would<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.520> 5:00<00:00:59.969> a.m.<00:01:01.250> simple<00:01:02.250> so

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that would make it 5:00 a.m. simple so

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.770 
that would make it 5:00 a.m. simple so
let's<00:01:03.000> say<00:01:03.329> now<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.899> 8<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.680> 1<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:06.360> 2<00:01:06.390> is

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
let's say now the 8 the 1 and the 2 is

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.630 
let's say now the 8 the 1 and the 2 is
lit<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.920> make<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.280> 8:00<00:01:08.430> 9:00<00:01:09.210> 10:00<00:01:09.390> 11:00

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
lit that make it 8:00 9:00 10:00 11:00

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.810 
lit that make it 8:00 9:00 10:00 11:00
a.m.<00:01:11.640> lights<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.810> 11:00<00:01:13.229> a.m.<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:14.610> show

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
a.m. lights on the 11:00 a.m. to show

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.920 
a.m. lights on the 11:00 a.m. to show
you<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.970> mean<00:01:15.330> what<00:01:15.900> time<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.439> now<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
you I mean what time is it right now a

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
you I mean what time is it right now a
bit<00:01:18.930> hard<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> time<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
bit hard to see the time but we have the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.690 
bit hard to see the time but we have the
8<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.689> 1<00:01:21.930> 2<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.450> made<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.659> 11<00:01:25.650> a.m.<00:01:26.250> we've

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
8 the 1 2 so that made it 11 a.m. we've

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.370 
8 the 1 2 so that made it 11 a.m. we've
got<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> am<00:01:27.180> light<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.560> 2<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.670> 1<00:01:30.380> now

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
got the am light the a a 2 and the 1 now

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.210 
got the am light the a a 2 and the 1 now
let's<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.650> 2<00:01:31.710> minutes

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
let's go 2 minutes

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.940 
let's go 2 minutes
I<00:01:33.560> said<00:01:34.560> bed<00:01:34.710> 2<00:01:34.829> 1<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.340> 2<00:01:35.369> before<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.990> 8<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.439> 16

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
I said bed 2 1 the 2 before the 8 the 16

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.359 
I said bed 2 1 the 2 before the 8 the 16
and<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.220> 32<00:01:39.290> so<00:01:40.290> what<00:01:40.619> minute<00:01:40.950> are<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.250> on

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
and the 32 so what minute are we on

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.260 
and the 32 so what minute are we on
right<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:42.829> we're<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.220> 8<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.149> look

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
right now we're on the 8 and if I look

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.940 
right now we're on the 8 and if I look
at<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.659> clock<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> wall<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.250> does<00:01:47.490> say<00:01:47.759> 1108

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
at my clock on the wall it does say 1108

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.399 
at my clock on the wall it does say 1108
so<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.130> quite<00:01:50.340> simple<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.880> well<00:01:51.259> whereas<00:01:52.259> if

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
so it's quite simple as well whereas if

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.310 
so it's quite simple as well whereas if
we<00:01:52.439> had<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> 8<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.520> fall<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:55.049> 12

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
we had the 8 and the fall it would be 12

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.859 
we had the 8 and the fall it would be 12
minutes<00:01:55.649> past<00:01:55.860> if<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.490> had<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> 1<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.360> 2<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.750> be

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
minutes past if we had the 1 the 2 it be

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.859 
minutes past if we had the 1 the 2 it be
free<00:01:58.140> minutes<00:01:58.439> passed<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.610> had<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> 32<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
free minutes passed if we had the 32 and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.679 
free minutes passed if we had the 32 and
the<00:02:01.170> 8<00:02:01.350> it'll<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.829> 40<00:02:02.280> minutes<00:02:02.549> passed<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.509> it's

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the 8 it'll be 40 minutes passed if it's

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.660 
the 8 it'll be 40 minutes passed if it's
41<00:02:04.140> minutes<00:02:04.229> passed<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.009> first<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.520> the
