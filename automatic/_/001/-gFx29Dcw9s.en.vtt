 changing so that it's not always the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.530
 same funds there are for example the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.830
 ebony floor we have some boards that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.590
 are different pieces of paper that we're going 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.570
 modifying depending on the session or 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.170
 of the complements of the girl that or the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.060
 boy that we are going to do so that it is 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.400
 so it looks different there you see some 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 how many reflectors that we use 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.780
 also many sessions we have of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.740
 different sizes of a size 50 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.660
 centimeters to reflectors 5 in one 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.660
 two meters 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.750
 and here for example is one of the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.299
 accessories that we have then yes 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.590
 if we put for example a crib for 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:50.520
 to be able to make pictures with the bezel 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.520
 newborn and all that 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.420
 well here what you see is a 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.890
 bit weird that's just a set 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.430
 for baby photography 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.830
 it is a structure that we have made of pvc 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.080
 we have fastened here there are placed 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.100
 cushions in everything is the good thing that has 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.100
 this is in no time you see the background 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.010
 you always see the same fabric where 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.440
 the baby is supported and you can place 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.440
 the baby here lying normal and running 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.580
 you do not avoid having to throw yourself 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.190
 floor to take these shots and also 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.310
 you can modify the height of the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.620
 cushions and the set so that it supports by 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.660
 example the head here and the feet 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.630
 fall here then with respect to 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.560
 height is better angle than the baby 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.640
 fall if the baby is very small is 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.470
 newborn this hair is not more is not 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.140
 very advisable because it is for a lot 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.110
 the face then we have here 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.560
 different blankets different colors 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.690
 which is coupled in the same way to 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.040
 to be able to make even the same shots 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.319
 with different funds so that expand the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.510
 work done 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.510
 and this is all from this set
