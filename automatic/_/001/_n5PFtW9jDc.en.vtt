00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
because it's during the summer months so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.070 
because it's during the summer months so
it's<00:01:38.310> very<00:01:38.460> very<00:01:38.700> long<00:01:38.970> day<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:39.930> you're

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
it's very very long day and if you're

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.730
