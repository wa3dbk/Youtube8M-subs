00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.069
 today we're going to see how to make a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.929
 beautiful airplane a beautiful 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.630
 airplane to do to play with

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.600
 anyway, however, today there is one 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.760
 novelty there is a novelty there will be with me the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.250
 true protagonist of this channel 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.220
 or tutor the channel is called tutor 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.740
 let's go to reality in reality 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.289
 the main character is not who I am but is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.380

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.079

 here is what tutor appeared here is that tutor 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.969
 appeared as you can see looks like 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.750
 very much to the president of the united states but 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.870

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.980

 greeting the public is what you want 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.180
 hi to all youtube friends 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.680
 my name is tutor from now on i'll be 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.530
 always present in these beautiful 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.800
 video will also correct my friend 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.140
 in case he made some mistakes I know 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.110
 that this verse is painful but it is mine 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.810
 laugh ara thanks tutor 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.890
 however, I believe there is no need 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.640
 to correct you will see as good as you want 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.750
 you tutor 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.189
 let's leave let's start with the tutorial 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.290
 to start this tutorial there 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.259
 first of all a piece of 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.970
 so let's take a nice piece of paper 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.100
 paper a sheet a4 a sheet a4 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.509
 let's start by creating this plano 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.549
 then how do you do this robina 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.790
 first we have to use the piece 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.820
 of paper in this way we do 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.860
 linear and precise bending in such a way 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.860
 such that the plane 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.070
 be very effective well we continue 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:08.260
 at this point let's join the 22 born 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.560
 in this way doing the whole lot 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.560
 Slowly slowly in this way 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:25.490
 all in this way we continue 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.960
 explaining these little pieces of paper 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.940
 as I am doing it all very much 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.660
 slowly 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.770
 everything slowly tutor am 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.100
 continuing well 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.120
 yes yes very well thanks to six tutors 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.600
 really a good friend at this point 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.750
 we must further bend these 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.910
 small pieces of paper so let's do one 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.720
 fold so it is a turn and now too 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.540
 from the opposite direction then we open 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.710
 another fold 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.130
 another fold so there is another 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.130
 fold 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:13.050
 in this way another fold 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:16.490
 this point is suspicious in this way 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:22.650
 a very delicate job that is 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:31.530
 close them in this way close them in 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:33.600
 this way we continue to this point 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.800
 we can fold the price of paper and 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.800
 close lario bla but this way 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.480
 well we realized the part we say 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.270
 in front of the airplane we now have to 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.080
 realize the Latvian from the Latvian to the 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.730
 sorry excuse us then we do them 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.940
 I call them the small piece of cards up to 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.780
 touch with wings in this way 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:02.040
 and we go to bend it we go to fool 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:05.790
 very definitely so that when 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:16.950
 we will go to cut will be the most accurate 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:27.360
 possible once again and we can 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:29.010
 trying to break it more or less is not 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.410
 came one hundred percent accurate 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.930
 however at this point we can 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.520
 put a second aside this there 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.890
 focus on this perception of 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.960
 paper we have to bend it perfectly to 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.760
 half 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:47.450
 we must perfectly fold it in half 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.450
 in this way more or less 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.110
 this way 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:02.240
 however we are ok 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.600
 we are on the small end 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.680
 cut this way we go to 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.680
 open them like two little ones 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.680
 panettone 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:21.380
 so now let's take the part 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.530
 created previously in the le g in 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:28.510
 this way then we explain in this 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:32.290
 so let's open the wings and then a 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.290
 leave the sign 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.860
 we continue with the room we have who it is 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.360
 created the whole front 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.760
 at this point it will not remain even 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.140
 folding it is in this small space 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:51.350
 that has been created insert insert the 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.650
 quota we have just created 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.660
 and as we can see we have created a 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.960
 excellent airplane that can be insured 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.900
 flight also perfectly al 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.080
 perfectly it is very nice to play at 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.919
 school with friends wherever you want is 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.540
 really beautiful 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:16.370
 nothing all started you take a ride 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:20.450
 maybe leave it that later 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.970
 to make me a ride ok to tutors maybe 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:26.870
 I leave you here in truth I leave it 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:29.300

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.529
 beautiful airplane you both liked and 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.619

 shitting on his pants for fear 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:56.219
 this does not mean that you can 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:58.709
 try to fly with this plane to and 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:07:01.289
