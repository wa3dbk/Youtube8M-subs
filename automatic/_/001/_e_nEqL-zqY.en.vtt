there<00:03:06.680> now<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.740> have<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.490> 2000<00:03:09.060> rpm<00:03:09.510> fan

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
there now I have that's a 2000 rpm fan

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.030 
there now I have that's a 2000 rpm fan
because<00:03:10.980> if<00:03:11.880> we<00:03:12.090> touch<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.990> fins<00:03:13.290> an<00:03:13.500> accident

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
because if we touch the fins an accident

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.620 
because if we touch the fins an accident
they<00:03:14.790> will<00:03:14.970> cut<00:03:15.240> you<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:17.210> so<00:03:18.210> I<00:03:18.240> have<00:03:18.450> those

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
they will cut you and so I have those

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.120 
they will cut you and so I have those

that thermal take liquid cooling I like

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.990 
that thermal take liquid cooling I like
this<00:04:28.500> liquid<00:04:28.740> cooling<00:04:29.310> because<00:04:29.520> these<00:04:29.700> are

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
this liquid cooling because these are

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.130 
this liquid cooling because these are
hoses<00:04:31.100> are<00:04:32.100> very<00:04:32.490> strong<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.510> stable<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:33.990> you

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
hoses are very strong and stable so you

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.600 
hoses are very strong and stable so you
would<00:04:34.380> have<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.770> be<00:04:34.980> worrying<00:04:35.250> about<00:04:35.370> the

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
I'm a great bang for the buck that's why

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.410 
I'm a great bang for the buck that's why
you<00:05:17.570> have<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.810> go<00:05:17.900> with<00:05:18.050> AMD<00:05:18.350> because<00:05:19.000> yes<00:05:20.000> yes

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
you have to go with AMD because yes yes

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.540 
you have to go with AMD because yes yes

they have more you know threading faster
rating<00:05:28.730> threading<00:05:29.480> capabilities<00:05:30.260> but<00:05:31.070> AMD<00:05:31.610> is

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
rating threading capabilities but AMD is

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.410 
rating threading capabilities but AMD is
definitely<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.480> best<00:05:32.750> bang<00:05:33.020> for<00:05:33.050> your<00:05:33.380> buck
