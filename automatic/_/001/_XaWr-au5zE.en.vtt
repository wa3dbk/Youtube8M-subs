00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hi everybody my name is cliff and today

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.519 
hi everybody my name is cliff and today
I'm<00:00:02.639> doing<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.850> review<00:00:02.879> on<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.529> electronic

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
I'm doing a review on the electronic

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.720 
I'm doing a review on the electronic
3400<00:00:05.400> milliamp<00:00:05.759> hour<00:00:05.879> 18<00:00:06.810> 650<00:00:07.109> battery<00:00:07.730> mmm

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
3400 milliamp hour 18 650 battery mmm

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.919 
3400 milliamp hour 18 650 battery mmm
now<00:00:08.940> currently<00:00:09.269> right<00:00:09.450> now<00:00:09.540> these<00:00:09.750> are<00:00:09.809> the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
now currently right now these are the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.870 
now currently right now these are the
highest<00:00:10.320> milliamps<00:00:10.740> out<00:00:10.860> there<00:00:11.040> true

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
highest milliamps out there true

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.009 
highest milliamps out there true
milliamps<00:00:12.330> because<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> lot<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.690> people<00:00:12.900> claim

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
milliamps because a lot of people claim

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.440 
milliamps because a lot of people claim
higher<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:13.500> none<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.769> them<00:00:13.889> are<00:00:13.980> true

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
higher but none of them are true

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.900 
higher but none of them are true
these<00:00:15.450> are<00:00:15.599> Panasonic<00:00:16.109> cells<00:00:16.880> they<00:00:17.880> are

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
these are Panasonic cells they are

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.160 
these are Panasonic cells they are
button<00:00:18.300> top<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:18.720> work<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.020> most

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
button top so they work in most

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.820 
button top so they work in most
flashlights<00:00:20.570> they<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.660> protected<00:00:24.769> now<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
flashlights they are protected now the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.839 
flashlights they are protected now the
thing<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.189> know<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.490> lot<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.760> these

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
thing is to know what a lot of these

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.250 
thing is to know what a lot of these
lithium-ion<00:00:27.810> batteries<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:30.170> they're<00:00:31.170> not

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
lithium-ion batteries is they're not

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.420 
lithium-ion batteries is they're not
like<00:00:31.410> normal<00:00:31.560> batteries<00:00:31.949> everybody's<00:00:32.309> used

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
like normal batteries everybody's used

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.630

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
eyes I also have the previous ones a

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.229 
eyes I also have the previous ones a
little<00:02:34.220> thirty<00:02:34.489> one<00:02:34.640> hundred<00:02:34.670> milliamps

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
little thirty one hundred milliamps

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.550 
little thirty one hundred milliamps
I<00:02:35.330> got<00:02:35.540> djebena<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.020> then<00:02:36.110> just<00:02:36.230> holding<00:02:36.470> it

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
I got djebena and then just holding it

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.890 
I got djebena and then just holding it
because<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.800> have<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.040> other<00:02:37.280> 30<00:02:37.640> 100<00:02:37.850> mi<00:02:38.270> empty

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
because I have the other 30 100 mi empty

26 these bad either great - and to
really<00:02:44.630> get<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.900> highest<00:02:45.110> milliamps<00:02:45.650> out<00:02:45.739> of

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
really get the highest milliamps out of

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.440 
really get the highest milliamps out of
these<00:02:45.920> batteries<00:02:46.220> right<00:02:46.310> here<00:02:46.459> make<00:02:47.150> sure<00:02:47.300> you

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
these batteries right here make sure you

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.680 
these batteries right here make sure you
run<00:02:47.690> them<00:02:48.370> at<00:02:49.370> least<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.730> good<00:02:49.850> 5<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.180> 10<00:02:50.480> cycles

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
run them at least a good 5 to 10 cycles

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.479 
run them at least a good 5 to 10 cycles
for<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.170> chemistry<00:02:51.830> inside<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.190> batteries

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
for the chemistry inside the batteries

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.300 
for the chemistry inside the batteries
alive<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:54.350> get<00:02:54.500> your<00:02:54.620> highest<00:02:54.860> milliamps<00:02:55.190> out

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
alive you get your highest milliamps out

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.610 
alive you get your highest milliamps out
of<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:59.019> give<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.080> guys<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.200> good<00:03:00.290> look<00:03:00.470> at<00:03:00.560> these

of it give you guys a good look at these

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.449 
of it give you guys a good look at these
batteries<00:03:01.060> my<00:03:02.060> favorite<00:03:02.420> ones<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:03.400> think<00:03:04.400> these

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
batteries my favorite ones I think these

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.550 
batteries my favorite ones I think these
are<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.700> same<00:03:04.910> cells<00:03:05.150> as<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.450> Eagle<00:03:06.170> tax<00:03:06.380> you

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
are the same cells as the Eagle tax you

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.670 
are the same cells as the Eagle tax you
think<00:03:07.010> it's<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.220> exact<00:03:07.489> same<00:03:07.670> cell<00:03:08.680> just

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
think it's the exact same cell just

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.880 
think it's the exact same cell just
different<00:03:10.390> protection<00:03:11.390> Karen<00:03:11.600> I'm<00:03:11.690> not<00:03:11.840> sure
