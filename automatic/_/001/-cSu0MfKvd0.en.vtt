sort of strategy but at the end of the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.630 
sort of strategy but at the end of the
day<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> didn't<00:00:58.530> feel<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.800> creating<00:00:59.280> another

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
day I didn't feel like creating another

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.670 
day I didn't feel like creating another
character<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.390> all<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.690> these<00:01:00.840> abilities<00:01:01.170> so

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
character with all of these abilities so

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070 
character with all of these abilities so
most<00:01:02.430> importantly<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.270> need<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> tack

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
most importantly all you need is a tack

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.250 
most importantly all you need is a tack
haste<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.559> cure<00:01:04.739> boosts<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:06.020> pretty<00:01:07.020> much

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
haste and cure boosts and pretty much

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.280 
haste and cure boosts and pretty much
just<00:01:07.770> leave<00:01:08.220> bracers<00:01:08.729> once<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.810> second

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
just leave bracers once more second

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.670 
just leave bracers once more second
chance

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
chance

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.620 
chance
also<00:01:11.070> probably<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.729> good<00:01:11.820> idea<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
also probably a good idea to have the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.690 
also probably a good idea to have the
screens<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.260> well<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.740> relook<00:01:14.430> okay

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
screens as well and relook okay

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
screens as well and relook okay
basically<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.390> anyone<00:01:16.080> what<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> have

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
basically you just go anyone what I have

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.359 
basically you just go anyone what I have
here<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:18.180> probably<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> good<00:01:18.869> idea<00:01:19.189> well<00:01:20.189> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
here it's probably a good idea well that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.070 
here it's probably a good idea well that
being<00:01:20.549> said<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.420> isn't<00:01:21.659> really

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
being said there really isn't really

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.130 
being said there really isn't really
