your<00:01:41.670> when<00:01:41.880> are<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.210> especially<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.049> corn

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
your when are we especially your corn

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
your when are we especially your corn
you're<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.399> want<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> purchase<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
you're going to want to purchase a

you're going to want to purchase a
separate<00:01:46.020> jar<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.470> looks<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.070> this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
separate jar it looks just like this

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.030 
separate jar it looks just like this
it's<00:01:48.210> around<00:01:48.509> 100<00:01:48.689> dollars<00:01:49.020> extra<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.950> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it's around 100 dollars extra so you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.590 
it's around 100 dollars extra so you
will<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.340> paying<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.670> little<00:01:50.820> more<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.420> this

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
will be paying a little more to do this

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.359 
will be paying a little more to do this
particular<00:01:51.750> function<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> machine<00:01:53.159> but

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
particular function in the machine but

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.880 
particular function in the machine but
it's<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> different<00:01:54.810> different<00:01:55.350> jar

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
it's got a different different jar

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.740 
it's got a different different jar
design<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.610> different<00:01:56.939> blade<00:01:57.119> design<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
design and a different blade design and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
design and a different blade design and
it<00:01:57.840> works<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.320> well<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.649> these<00:01:59.070> grains<00:01:59.430> so

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it works really well for these grains so

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.340 
it works really well for these grains so
that's<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.240> we're<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.899> using

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that's the one we're going to be using

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.569 
that's the one we're going to be using
for<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:02.340> test<00:02:04.009> all<00:02:05.009> we're<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.460> be

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
for this test all we're going to be

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.540 
for this test all we're going to be
doing<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.000> putting<00:02:06.240> some<00:02:06.479> dry<00:02:07.280> brown<00:02:08.280> rice

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
doing is putting some dry brown rice

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.830 
doing is putting some dry brown rice
about<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> cup<00:02:09.390> into<00:02:10.140> each

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.270 

now<00:02:16.840> what<00:02:17.109> we're<00:02:17.260> going<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.530> be<00:02:17.680> doing<00:02:17.889> in<00:02:18.129> this

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
now what we're going to be doing in this

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.399 
now what we're going to be doing in this
test<00:02:18.639> is<00:02:19.409> running<00:02:20.409> both<00:02:20.680> machines<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:23.230> the

this test is completely up to us

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.089 
this test is completely up to us
depending<00:02:46.389> on<00:02:46.750> how<00:02:46.870> fine<00:02:47.139> or<00:02:47.169> coarse<00:02:47.379> you<00:02:47.709> want

depending on how fine or coarse you want

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.550 
depending on how fine or coarse you want
your<00:02:48.280> flower<00:02:48.579> that<00:02:49.329> will<00:02:49.599> depend<00:02:50.019> on<00:02:50.349> how<00:02:50.530> long

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
your flower that will depend on how long

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.470 
your flower that will depend on how long
you<00:02:50.980> let<00:02:51.129> it<00:02:51.280> run<00:02:51.459> obviously<00:02:51.699> the<00:02:52.060> longer<00:02:52.239> it

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
you let it run obviously the longer it

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.990 
you let it run obviously the longer it
runs<00:02:52.689> the<00:02:52.989> finer<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.409> flower<00:02:53.680> will<00:02:53.949> get<00:02:54.189> this

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
runs the finer the flower will get this

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.939 
runs the finer the flower will get this
is<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.209> completely<00:02:55.840> arbitrary<00:02:56.019> test<00:02:56.590> we<00:02:56.799> could

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:56.949 
is a completely arbitrary test we could

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.860 
is a completely arbitrary test we could
run<00:02:57.159> fifteen<00:02:57.639> seconds<00:02:58.120> or<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> three-minute

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
run fifteen seconds or a three-minute

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.959 
run fifteen seconds or a three-minute
test<00:02:59.109> it<00:02:59.260> doesn't<00:02:59.469> matter<00:02:59.889> the<00:03:00.579> Blendtec

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
test it doesn't matter the Blendtec

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.030 
test it doesn't matter the Blendtec
however<00:03:01.540> when<00:03:01.689> you<00:03:01.780> use<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.260> manual<00:03:02.469> speeds

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
however when you use the manual speeds

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.550 
however when you use the manual speeds
will<00:03:03.459> shut<00:03:03.790> itself<00:03:03.939> off<00:03:04.299> after<00:03:04.510> fifty<00:03:05.109> seconds

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
will shut itself off after fifty seconds

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.129 
will shut itself off after fifty seconds
so<00:03:05.709> we'll<00:03:05.889> just<00:03:06.129> use<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.639> as<00:03:06.879> our<00:03:07.540> arbitrary

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
so we'll just use that as our arbitrary

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.949 
so we'll just use that as our arbitrary
time<00:03:08.829> for<00:03:09.159> this<00:03:09.280> particular<00:03:09.579> test<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.750> once

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
time for this particular test so once

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.869 
time for this particular test so once
again<00:03:11.139> I'm<00:03:11.379> going<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.560> run<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:12.280> Blendtec<00:03:12.699> on

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
again I'm going to run the Blendtec on

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.640 
again I'm going to run the Blendtec on
speed<00:03:13.180> ten<00:03:13.480> for<00:03:13.659> fifty<00:03:13.930> seconds<00:03:14.379> when<00:03:14.500> it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
speed ten for fifty seconds when it

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.219 
speed ten for fifty seconds when it
stops<00:03:14.949> and<00:03:15.189> shuts<00:03:15.459> itself<00:03:15.759> off<00:03:16.030> we'll<00:03:16.840> run<00:03:17.079> the

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.229 
stops and shuts itself off we'll run the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.050 
stops and shuts itself off we'll run the
Vitamix<00:03:17.680> for<00:03:17.859> fifty<00:03:18.129> seconds<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:18.729> then<00:03:18.849> we

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
Vitamix for fifty seconds and then we

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.719 
Vitamix for fifty seconds and then we
will<00:03:19.209> compare<00:03:19.479> the<00:03:19.750> two<00:03:20.079> flowers<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:21.489> see

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:21.729 
will compare the two flowers to see

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.599 
will compare the two flowers to see
exactly<00:03:22.180> how<00:03:22.389> both<00:03:22.720> machines<00:03:23.109> worked<00:03:23.609> here's

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
exactly how both machines worked here's

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.069 
exactly how both machines worked here's
the<00:03:24.849> bottom<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.359> Blendtec<00:03:25.780> we'll<00:03:25.930> go<00:03:26.019> to

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
the bottom of the Blendtec we'll go to

00:03:26.079 --> 00:04:16.030 
the bottom of the Blendtec we'll go to
speed<00:03:26.319> ten

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.340 

and<00:04:17.040> now<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.550> Vitamix<00:04:18.150> will<00:04:18.330> put<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:19.110> same

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
and now the Vitamix will put the same

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.230 
and now the Vitamix will put the same
amount<00:04:19.530> one<00:04:19.950> cup<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:21.870> brown<00:04:22.170> rice<00:04:22.500> into<00:04:23.250> it

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.800

now<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.210> won't<00:05:44.360> get<00:05:44.599> this<00:05:44.810> advantage<00:05:45.289> with

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
now you won't get this advantage with

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.339 
now you won't get this advantage with
the<00:05:45.680> Vitamix<00:05:46.190> but<00:05:46.460> on<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:46.699> Blendtec<00:05:47.210> it<00:05:48.110> has<00:05:48.319> a

the Vitamix but on the Blendtec it has a

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.350 
the Vitamix but on the Blendtec it has a
counter<00:05:49.129> that<00:05:49.629> number<00:05:50.629> right<00:05:50.870> there

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
almost 19,000 200 times now I haven't

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.450 
almost 19,000 200 times now I haven't
done<00:06:05.599> the<00:06:05.900> math<00:06:05.930> on<00:06:06.379> that<00:06:06.409> but<00:06:06.830> if<00:06:06.979> you<00:06:07.129> divide

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
done the math on that but if you divide

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.080 
done the math on that but if you divide
19<00:06:08.030> thousand<00:06:08.889> 172<00:06:09.889> by<00:06:10.930> 365<00:06:11.930> days<00:06:12.770> a<00:06:12.979> year

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.070 
you're going to come up with a number
that's<00:06:16.490> over<00:06:16.879> 50<00:06:17.090> which<00:06:17.449> means<00:06:17.750> if<00:06:17.930> you<00:06:18.050> use

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
that's over 50 which means if you use

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.909 
that's over 50 which means if you use
these<00:06:18.560> machines<00:06:19.039> every<00:06:19.490> single<00:06:19.909> day<00:06:20.830> for<00:06:21.830> the

the two flowers that was the point of

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.790 
the two flowers that was the point of
this<00:06:37.520> demonstration<00:06:40.150> put<00:06:41.469> flour<00:06:42.469> on<00:06:42.710> the

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
this demonstration put flour on the

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.890 
this demonstration put flour on the
Blendtec<00:06:43.219> on<00:06:43.400> one<00:06:43.580> side<00:06:43.849> of<00:06:44.000> this<00:06:44.120> plate<00:06:46.900> and

as<00:07:07.120> you<00:07:07.300> can<00:07:07.420> see<00:07:07.860> that<00:07:08.860> flower<00:07:09.730> is<00:07:10.060> fine

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
as you can see that flower is fine

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.670 
as you can see that flower is fine
enough<00:07:10.720> to<00:07:10.780> bake<00:07:11.110> with<00:07:12.960> now<00:07:13.960> just<00:07:14.200> feeling<00:07:14.590> the

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
enough to bake with now just feeling the

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.290 
enough to bake with now just feeling the
textures<00:07:15.250> of<00:07:15.340> these<00:07:17.760> they<00:07:18.760> are<00:07:18.790> almost

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
textures of these they are almost

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.710

identical the Vitamix texture may be
ever<00:07:23.170> so<00:07:23.590> slightly<00:07:24.160> finer<00:07:24.870> which<00:07:25.870> would<00:07:26.110> make

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:26.320 
ever so slightly finer which would make
