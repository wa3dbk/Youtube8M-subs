00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:10.890
 Today it is 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.840
 Woeste European football calendar day the final of the UEFA Champions 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.179
 League 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.199
 this is great and even with Hansi Küpper when I play the game 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.199
 commented 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.720
 now the oil companies 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 but already on the way down there would be no evidence 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.010
 the two twin towers not that we were here something new car 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.010
 already in its interior 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.430
 the formation of the two teams 0 0 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.340
 The investors of the two teams are looking forward to their shops as if it was not a morning 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.950
 give 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.450
 the purpose is for the first time 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.990
 Hardy made his decision on the shield software 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.570
 70 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.090
 Ute and 000 people only 90 minutes natural coalition in

 Berlin 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.090
 Munich ddp bay 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.960
 neither of the two teams could score the crucial goal with their friend 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.260
 it is said 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.070
 Penalties 7000 spectators to say exactly this year are 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.140
 Getting fit again would be important if he transforms important 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.539
 for the Dortmund colleagues 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.479
 well way and he kept the ball from the keeper 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.749
 "I do not know to what extent the goalkeeper cheat sheet in advance 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.280
 was informed but he has just the right idea 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.280
 The ball passed in the box 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.769
 Andrae Forsten 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.909
 The goalkeeper was already beaten but here he had the luck of 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.909
 clever 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.989
 no problem for the goalkeeper 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.040
 he tries the snotty in the middle but the goalkeeper had the protect 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.699
 apparently studied carefully 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.799
 and should be considered no problems 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.799
 advises Kitz pushed left corner 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.929
 incredible after such a great parade on the ground 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.510
 The Cyber ​​Games now apparently studied closely and so in this duel the 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:08.799
 Keep your upper hand 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.799
 but real took the hint over 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.149
 and again brilliantly parry from the Dolder 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.279
 It's always a risky thing to shoot in the middle, says the goalkeeper 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:24.589
 stand like this 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:27.109
 then he lowers the ball with his cap 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.039
 magnificent parade 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.830
 You always say a goalkeeper does not necessarily have to hold a penalty here 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.159
 He was, however, defending himself he makes BP receives 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.159
 it's a pretty upset 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:47.839
 Here comes the goalkeeper to be on the scales 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.269
 If he is now himself everything is over and he can become indirect 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.709
 the Icelanders and it goes on 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.039
 everything back up and listen to the scenery they are 46 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.409
 but real took the hint over 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.269
 if he fails then there out 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:16.359
 he skin neither a deep breath of his crew 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.479
 because the goalkeeper does not arrive at the barrier 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.400
 it is the first one that would have violated 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.279
 if he called the fish it 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.529
 last was and we still live as we wish 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.400
 he is a so-called natural Born liege but who he holds on the shipyards 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.229
 from pop 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.229
 Robert Neuber is in the wrong corner 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.360
 and he himself is then Wars for her 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.639
 even they were and still live as they want 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.430
 the ball is set 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.650
 we were completely alone epd 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.960
 he makes detail 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.960
 later, the milk should be up 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.090
 so and now it is called goalie they are on site 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.509
 are allowed over 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.999
 he can not believe that cheaper the worst time he does not look up 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.839
 the ground 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.800
 and is completely finished 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800
 Eventually bursting there threw 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.050
 they have to take Europe by storm 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.020
 the animals and allowed them to act football but to play short dresses other bands 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.409
 keep up 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.279
 the goal is the best 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:43.279
 what European football has to offer 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.380
 and she did it, our celebrities are celebrating her 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.949
 he was supposed to be the picture 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:02.569
 These problems are probably no better place in the world that is 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.159
 experiencing everything is just great 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.240
 this competition has lost nothing of its fascination 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.240
 One would like to be with the players 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:14.869
 they are neither in the Rue de Bercy again 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.809
 I will never repeat that moment 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.439
 because they do not move 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.749
 Anni Friesinger 

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:27.749
 this is the summer break opposite the picture 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.430
 Vienna 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.059
 next to JEM
