00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
tricks today we're gonna be learning the

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:15.620 
tricks today we're gonna be learning the
backflip<00:00:13.429> so<00:00:14.429> up<00:00:14.610> until<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.969> point<00:00:15.330> I've

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
backflip so up until this point I've

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.870 
backflip so up until this point I've
been<00:00:15.780> kind<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.800> order<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.490> tricks

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
been kind of going in order and tricks

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.070 
been kind of going in order and tricks
from<00:00:18.270> easiest<00:00:19.640> hardest<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.880> guess<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
from easiest hardest I guess and the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200 
from easiest hardest I guess and the
backflip<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.560> kind<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.100> order<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.850> would

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
backflip is kind of out of order I would

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.970 
backflip is kind of out of order I would
not<00:00:24.449> suggest<00:00:24.689> learning<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.410> if<00:00:25.560> all<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.859> can

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
not suggest learning it if all you can

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.120 
not suggest learning it if all you can
do<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> jump<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> 360<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:28.230> at<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> same

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
do on a jump is a 360 but at the same

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.950 
do on a jump is a 360 but at the same
time<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> super<00:00:30.090> cool<00:00:30.240> trick<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.779> think

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
time it's a super cool trick and I think

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.540 
time it's a super cool trick and I think
a<00:00:31.019> ton<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> people<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.040> learn<00:00:32.130> how<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> do

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
a ton of people want to learn how to do

crash so let's get into the trick I find
it<00:01:29.340> easiest<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.030> backflip<00:01:30.600> poppy<00:01:30.930> jumps

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it easiest to backflip poppy jumps

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.550 
it easiest to backflip poppy jumps
bigger<00:01:32.189> jumps<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.970> maybe<00:01:33.509> scarier<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.409> it's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
bigger jumps and maybe scarier but it's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
bigger jumps and maybe scarier but it's
definitely<00:01:34.740> gonna<00:01:35.040> make<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.400> easier<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:35.939> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
definitely gonna make it easier for you

definitely gonna make it easier for you
this<00:01:37.320> trick<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:38.369> about<00:01:38.700> commitment<00:01:39.090> if

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
this trick is all about commitment if

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.700 
this trick is all about commitment if
you<00:01:39.509> don't<00:01:39.689> commit<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> you're<00:01:40.500> probably

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
you don't commit to it you're probably

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469 
you don't commit to it you're probably
gonna<00:01:41.130> end<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.610> your<00:01:41.759> head<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.270> your

when you come into the jump again find a

when you come into the jump again find a
jump<00:01:57.299> you're<00:01:57.420> super<00:01:57.750> comfortable<00:01:58.170> with<00:01:58.229> if

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
jump you're super comfortable with if

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.920 
jump you're super comfortable with if
it's<00:01:59.100> smaller<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.939> fine<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.719> bigger

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
it's smaller that's fine if it's bigger

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.289 
it's smaller that's fine if it's bigger
that's<00:02:01.290> also<00:02:01.680> fine<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.280> again<00:02:02.850> try<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.119> get<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
that's also fine and again try to get a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.209 
that's also fine and again try to get a
day<00:02:03.509> where<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.170> snow<00:02:04.409> soft<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.159> not

day where the snow soft and it's not

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.310 
day where the snow soft and it's not
gonna<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:05.850> painful<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.960> when<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.170> come

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
gonna be as painful but when you come

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380 
gonna be as painful but when you come
into<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> jump<00:02:07.890> as<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.239> you're

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
into the jump as you can see here you're

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.760 
into the jump as you can see here you're
gonna<00:02:09.479> want<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:09.840> crouched<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.649> you're

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
gonna want to be crouched and you're

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.390 
gonna want to be crouched and you're
gonna<00:02:10.979> want<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.700> hands

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
gonna want to get your hands

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.399 
gonna want to get your hands
behind<00:02:12.640> your<00:02:12.790> back<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.900> going<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.260> give

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
behind your back this is going to give

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.920 
behind your back this is going to give
you<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.860> good<00:02:15.250> pop<00:02:15.489> off<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.879> lip<00:02:16.120> as<00:02:16.360> well<00:02:16.420> as<00:02:16.900> a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
you a good pop off the lip as well as a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.550 
you a good pop off the lip as well as a
good<00:02:17.530> start<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.519> your<00:02:18.549> flip<00:02:19.170> what<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.200> find

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
good start to your flip what I find

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.960 
good start to your flip what I find
useful<00:02:20.739> is<00:02:21.099> when<00:02:21.250> you're<00:02:21.400> back<00:02:21.549> flipping<00:02:21.909> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
useful is when you're back flipping a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.699 
useful is when you're back flipping a
new<00:02:22.180> jump<00:02:22.540> for<00:02:22.689> the<00:02:22.750> first<00:02:22.989> time<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.439> to<00:02:23.560> kind

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
new jump for the first time is to kind

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.619 
new jump for the first time is to kind
of<00:02:23.769> hit<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.069> straight<00:02:24.459> area<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.760> few<00:02:25.000> times<00:02:25.329> and

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
of hit it straight area a few times and

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.990 
of hit it straight area a few times and
envision<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.739> amount<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.250> force<00:02:27.760> you're

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
envision the amount of force you're

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.610 
envision the amount of force you're
going<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.420> have<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.689> throw<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.079> flip<00:02:29.379> with

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
going to have to throw the flip with

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.979 
going to have to throw the flip with
some<00:02:30.340> jumps<00:02:30.640> may<00:02:30.879> require<00:02:31.269> less<00:02:31.569> because

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
some jumps may require less because

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.599 
some jumps may require less because
they're<00:02:32.079> super<00:02:32.439> steep<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:32.920> super<00:02:33.189> pop<00:02:33.400> ease

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
they're super steep and super pop ease

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.789 
they're super steep and super pop ease
some<00:02:33.970> jumps<00:02:34.269> may<00:02:34.420> require<00:02:34.959> more<00:02:35.290> because

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
some jumps may require more because

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.069 
some jumps may require more because
they're<00:02:35.980> not<00:02:36.129> as<00:02:36.370> poppy<00:02:36.659> now<00:02:37.659> when<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.930> hit

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
they're not as poppy now when you hit

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.300 
they're not as poppy now when you hit
the<00:02:38.230> lip<00:02:38.409> of<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.590> jump<00:02:38.769> you're<00:02:38.980> gonna<00:02:39.040> want<00:02:39.280> to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
the lip of the jump you're gonna want to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.220 
the lip of the jump you're gonna want to
get<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.459> good<00:02:39.670> pop<00:02:39.970> with<00:02:40.180> your<00:02:40.209> legs<00:02:40.629> and<00:02:40.959> then

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
get a good pop with your legs and then

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.470 
get a good pop with your legs and then
throw<00:02:41.500> your<00:02:41.739> entire<00:02:42.099> upper<00:02:42.730> body<00:02:42.760> backwards

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
throw your entire upper body backwards

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.300 
throw your entire upper body backwards
but<00:02:43.750> make<00:02:43.959> sure<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.409> get<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.829> pop<00:02:45.069> with<00:02:45.250> your

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
but make sure you get that pop with your

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.220 
but make sure you get that pop with your
legs<00:02:45.579> first<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.569> is<00:02:46.690> gonna<00:02:46.810> prevent<00:02:47.109> you

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
legs first this is gonna prevent you

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.509 
legs first this is gonna prevent you
from<00:02:47.319> hitting<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.739> back<00:02:47.980> your<00:02:48.159> head<00:02:48.370> off<00:02:48.489> the

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
from hitting the back your head off the

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.899 
from hitting the back your head off the
lip<00:02:48.849> which<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.980> mean<00:02:50.980> just<00:02:51.400> think<00:02:51.579> about<00:02:51.670> that

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
lip which I mean just think about that

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.149 
lip which I mean just think about that
that's<00:02:52.239> that's<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:52.870> not<00:02:53.440> gonna<00:02:53.620> feel<00:02:53.920> good

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
that's that's just not gonna feel good

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.119 
that's that's just not gonna feel good
so<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:55.000> get<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.840> good<00:02:55.900> pop<00:02:56.319> with<00:02:56.500> your<00:02:56.620> legs<00:02:56.859> and

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
so I get a good pop with your legs and

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.410 
so I get a good pop with your legs and
then<00:02:57.340> throw<00:02:57.609> your<00:02:57.760> entire<00:02:58.030> upper<00:02:58.389> body

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
then throw your entire upper body

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.420 
then throw your entire upper body
backwards<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.620> motion<00:02:59.950> on<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.159> flip

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
backwards and the motion on the flip

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.550 
backwards and the motion on the flip
depending<00:03:01.150> on<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.299> jump<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:01.750> may<00:03:01.959> need<00:03:02.230> to

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
depending on the jump you may need to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.490 
depending on the jump you may need to
throw<00:03:02.859> a<00:03:02.920> harder<00:03:03.370> or<00:03:03.579> softer<00:03:03.909> use<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.049> jump<00:03:05.319> to

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
throw a harder or softer use the jump to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.179 
throw a harder or softer use the jump to
your<00:03:05.620> advantage

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
your advantage

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.879 
your advantage
don't<00:03:06.519> fight<00:03:06.939> it<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.329> it's<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.810> poppy<00:03:08.019> jump<00:03:08.439> use

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
don't fight it if it's a poppy jump use

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.679 
don't fight it if it's a poppy jump use
the<00:03:09.280> steepness<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.879> the<00:03:09.939> jump<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.420> get<00:03:10.569> the

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
the steepness of the jump to get the

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.229 
the steepness of the jump to get the
flip<00:03:10.900> around<00:03:11.079> it<00:03:11.769> makes<00:03:12.099> it<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.370> lot<00:03:12.609> easier

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
flip around it makes it a lot easier

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.360 
flip around it makes it a lot easier
I<00:03:13.389> know<00:03:13.689> sometimes<00:03:14.079> I'll<00:03:14.560> hit<00:03:14.709> a<00:03:14.739> pop<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.099> jump

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.219 
around and spot that landing again this
is<00:03:51.669> where<00:03:51.849> a<00:03:51.879> bigger<00:03:52.150> jump<00:03:52.479> comes<00:03:52.750> into<00:03:53.019> play

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229 
is where a bigger jump comes into play

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.899 
is where a bigger jump comes into play
and<00:03:53.470> makes<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.829> easier<00:03:54.190> because<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.639> gives<00:03:54.790> you

and makes it easier because it gives you

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.909 
and makes it easier because it gives you
more<00:03:55.120> time<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.540> see<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.019> landing<00:03:56.409> and<00:03:56.590> see<00:03:56.620> if

more time to see the landing and see if

you need to slow down the flip or speed

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.259 
you need to slow down the flip or speed
up<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.959> flip<00:03:59.199> but<00:03:59.799> spotting<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.819> landing<00:04:01.150> is

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
up the flip but spotting the landing is

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.839 
up the flip but spotting the landing is
in<00:04:02.019> my<00:04:02.500> opinion<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.949> most<00:04:03.129> important<00:04:03.609> part<00:04:03.790> of

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
in my opinion the most important part of

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.399 
in my opinion the most important part of
the<00:04:03.940> flip<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.329> makes<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:04.659> a<00:04:04.690> lot<00:04:04.870> less<00:04:04.930> scary

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
the flip that makes it a lot less scary

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.349 
the flip that makes it a lot less scary
once<00:04:06.099> you<00:04:06.220> get<00:04:06.370> your<00:04:06.489> head<00:04:06.609> around<00:04:06.879> and<00:04:07.120> spot
