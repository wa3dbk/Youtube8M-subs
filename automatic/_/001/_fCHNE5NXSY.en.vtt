00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.230
 we saw at the beginning of the week the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.049
 children stopped during the summer to sports 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.610
 nautical we saw the baby water ski 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.309
 with tristan and well today at 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.840
 exhale samena direction since figure 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.090
 you that during the summer the youngest ones 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:24.090
 are tried at scuba diving 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.680
 the almost tiny projects 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.220
 but if you say that diving is a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.080
 child's play 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.280
 because you believe me I do not believe 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.199
 I have never done but I have 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.969
 the impression that it was there listen to me 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.249
 I actually went to see me 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.659
 I went to samena ago 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:41.670
 some time to meet precisely 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:44.239
 to help children who were going to try 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 tried to dive so it's true that 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.300
 all to have what I noticed 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.059
 first is that we adults that we 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.729
 always has a kind of apprehension 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.319
 to go so go in the water for them 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.399
 kids it's a little bit more a little 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.559
 a little quieter a little bit more a 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.299
 little bit cooler and then it's true 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.489
 that they are more soothed they go over 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.420
 easily then before we see a 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.710
 little bit the pictures and we see 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.049
 how was it going I met 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.570
 eric vastine then Eric he is a monitor 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.360
 diving for the association little 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.530
 neemo marseille and we will listen to him he goes 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.659
 tell us a little bit about yourself 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.689
 explain the nearness of diving and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.760
 kids in listening eric then there the law 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.730
 imposes that 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.780
 we start to dive from the age of 8 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.400
 against 8 years they are a little young 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.100
 despite struggling to adapt to 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.090
 material and from 10 years old it 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.520
 really becomes a good age for 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.570
 start diving from 12 years 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.299
 we can pass level 1 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.070
 the briefing is the same since we do 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.900
 the same way to dive that we are 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.610
 power against by not lending at 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.770
 learning is a little more 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.720
 slow at the level of children because they 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.580
 have trouble catching all of a sudden 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.540
 while at the level of adults it's going 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.640
 to be a little faster 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.409
 and when the in his plan for the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.659
 first time you occupied dive 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.520
 by how much time it depends on 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.030
 the temperature of the water so when she 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.110
 is at 12 2 at 18 degrees it does not last very 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.149
 a long time it lasts a quarter of an hour and 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.070
 otherwise when she is 25 to 26 and can 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.320
 dive half an hour ago there are widely 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.539
 what to do with the bottle and then 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.920
 after often reducing the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.720
 diving is the cold of which two 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.310
 policemen and three of the from this 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.540
 moment we hear his place there 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.040
 physical condition does not have 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.769
 particularly simply as he 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.900
 must have a medical certificate of no 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.400
 against indication to the practice of 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.819
 boards of underwater diving 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.040
 know physics 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.360
 then good physical condition papin not 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.799
 especially senio what i want 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.660
 to say yes it must not be 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.070
 sick necessarily it's just certificate 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.350
 medical and look at the level at the level 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.660
 ears that everything everything is ok 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.880
 since children like adults 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.790
 besides are going to have to go have to 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.220
 to decompress it is necessary to know that the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.160
 children who are going to dive are going to have the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.079
 same brief as the adults let's say a 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.640
 little more a little further 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.290
 we will see it in pictures a little bit 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.079
 how how is it going 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.880
 since we filmed it so there diving 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:06.040
 with the with with the brief there so I 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.720
 greet them we wanted the oea victor 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.880
 and Roman so it was from 8 years 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.910
 we will say that children will be more 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.620
 comfortable in the water around 9-10 years old so there 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.480
 Eric is teaching them 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.430
 gestures since there are good gestures 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.970
 specific so that means if you have 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.670
 cold 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.960
 so you have to rub it you have to scrub it 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.520
 kiss on arm there 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.020
 he teaches children to decompress 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.930
 it's one of the most 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.420
 important in diving since the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.990
 children actually when we go to proceed 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.780
 casting 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.630
 at first they will go down to about 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.980
 a meter of me if Ã©ric here children 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.200
 feel good they're still going 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.950
 go up to 5 6 meters and compared 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.510
 to adults 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.060
 so what's the difference 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.220
 then an annual baptism for some 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.920
 it's the same man is a baptism 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.090
 adults we will go up to 6 meters 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.470
 kids will go up to 5 even 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.180
 on the other hand at the level of 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.680
 level of duration that's pretty much 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.280
 same if the water is good if the children 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.310
 feel good at that moment this is the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.040
 baptism will last between 20 and 30 minutes 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.000
 so it's really a dive especially 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.860
 that funds in Marseille are 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.570
 relatively are relatively good 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.950
 so and it's true that children 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.290
 much less apprehension finally I 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.570
 noticed that as adults they there 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.710
 really go more easily and that's 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.360
 very soothing 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.140
 it's very soothing catherine you have 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.570
 a question and his grandchildren 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.310
 must know very very 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.950
 very well swam ah yes that's not it 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.170
 this is the condition with with the with the 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.910
 combination we float but we well 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.160
 obviously the sinequanone condition 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.720
 it is to know how to swim very advantageously 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.430
 well not really no to know how to swim 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.590
 that's all but I 'm fine I got my 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.400
 girl cac tested who knows how to swim homeland 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.300
 lyannaj and Roman still has 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.560
 and she knows how to swim but not perfect 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.840
 I mean it's not a big 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.699
 swimmer yes but that's enough 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:58.259
 watch out the monitor is holding the kids 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:59.669
 at the well-being is very framed valentino 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.289
 and leclerc which are very interesting 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.550
 for diving ben then everything has to 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.199
 the time will be given to the address at its 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.639
 little nemo marseille but just before 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.020
 easter it'll give them a little bit 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.610
 no longer want to show a little 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.600
 rightly from what the 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.860
 of what children feel 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.490
 when they are launched very short 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.490
 look 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.000
 e 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.110
 Oh 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.550
 the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.670
 but it was really great in Hamilton 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.690
 thing it was 11 but you go 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.690
 some of Santa Claus 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.450
 we know as superman the children 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.010
 really feel the gravity the 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.800
 present pampering hours so is there one 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.970
 had had the victor and who conquered who 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.190
 dive regularly 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.590
 so that we register there by 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.370
 example is the association little nemo 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.740
 marseille 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.360
 a dive baptism for children 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.910
 it costs 20 euros 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.380
 baptism then children can 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.580
 register to pass so what we 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.220
 call level 1 I believe this to 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.160
 from 10-12 years old and everything is provided 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.920
 the material is provided the combination 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.850
 is provided and eric so that is very 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.830
 very pedagogue 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.870
 we will really explain put the 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.340
 confident children so that's 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.340
 the association to buy furniture 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.570
 bought then combination for that 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.710
 the children begin to put themselves at the 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.510
 dives and since the material is provided 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.510
 so leeson worlds marseille
