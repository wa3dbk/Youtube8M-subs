00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
munch and I think by then I might

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.449 
munch and I think by then I might
probably<00:04:04.840> repurchase<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:06.040> game<00:04:06.220> or

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
probably repurchase the game or

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.539 
probably repurchase the game or
reinstall<00:04:07.060> well<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.080> do<00:04:08.140> mean<00:04:08.549> repurchase

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549
