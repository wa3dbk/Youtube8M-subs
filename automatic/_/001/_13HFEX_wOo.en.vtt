i think they what they do is they they
kind<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> hide<00:01:48.030> their<00:01:48.270> legs<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.840> what<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.979> be

swimwear<00:01:52.680> well<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.070> cut<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> slight<00:01:53.729> bit

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
swimwear well the cut is a slight bit

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.510 
swimwear well the cut is a slight bit
higher<00:01:54.180> where<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:55.049> legs<00:01:55.320> become<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.070> focus

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
higher where your legs become the focus

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
higher where your legs become the focus
and<00:01:56.850> become<00:01:57.270> longer<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.930> they<00:01:58.170> yeah<00:01:58.350> they

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and become longer that they yeah they

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.100 
and become longer that they yeah they
become<00:01:58.710> number<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.820> idea<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.149> not<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> cut

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
become number so the idea is not to cut

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.980 
become number so the idea is not to cut
you<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.530> two<00:02:01.649> halves<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.460> don't<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.820> to
