00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.630
 Today I want to show you how to 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.910
 expertly changes a shock absorber 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.740
 as with all repairs around the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.290
 Suspension we also need in this 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.020
 if there is a lift we use one 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.300
 A commercial stage 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.970
 car jack is also necessary to her 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.710
 See why it is important to me 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.710
 secure vehicle against rolling away 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.329
 I remove first 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.190
 side trim and trunk 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.950
 cladding around the bumper 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.159
 expose 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.159
 [Music] 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.920
 so that the shock absorber is exposed and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.920
 I have enough space to work 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.700
 [Music] 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.400
 So the vehicle is left high 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:17.770
 I use the moment to check Hinterachs 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:21.040
 bushes brakes components and all 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.100
 other things components so and now 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.360
 the choice comes to the use of the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.360
 rear axle made of feathers 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.310
 [Music] 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.590
 Now I take a suitable one 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.220
 margin of error possibly the spring 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.220
 can remove 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:57.499
 [Music] 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.390
 the removal of the spring is required 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.400
 to jump out a dangerous one 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.630
 prevent 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.570
 Be sure to pay attention to a good and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.810
 fitting seat of resistance and 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:21.230
 now we can expand in shock absorbers 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:23.510
 [Music] 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.290
 Now I can see the mother in the vehicle 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.290
 unscrew the interior 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.650
 Now the vehicle is again so far 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.460
 raised christi rear axle 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.460
 has gone out 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.520
 Now I can do the lower bolt on 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.560
 Release shock absorber imex body and 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:03:06.729
 remove 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:03:06.729
 [Music] 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.380
 By the way, never important to you 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.540
 both sides of the shock absorber 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.340
 Unscrew the rear axle bearings 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.350
 the rear axle did not hold her 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.610
 destroyed and also brake pipes and 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.220
 other components will be in 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.120
 affected and so now 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.160
 installation logically I use it too 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.239
 shock absorbers of the company maco autotechnik 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.690
 This gets in the online shop at www 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.520
 mappus auto parts punkt.de with the new 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.690
 I also use shock absorbers macro 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.780
 Shock absorber attachments such as dust cap 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.570
 and shock absorber stop i mount 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.140
 continued to put the shock absorber in the 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.240
 leg 1 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.529
 but do not fix the bolt yet 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.529
 [Music] 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.390
 the vehicle has to be drained the world 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.390
 become 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.340
 [Music] 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.470
 that the mounted shock absorber and the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.490
 Ax body at an angle of 95 degrees 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.500
 to stand by each other 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.420
 this is important for the rubber bushing 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.490
 the shock absorber camp not with a 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.190
 screwed to high torsion voltage 

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:28.570
 the bolt will come with 40 newton meters 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:28.570
 and another 90 degrees tightened 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.740
 The feather will be back in the error 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.720
 spanner tense pays attention again 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.570
 on a good and fitting fit of the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.680
 error now i can do that 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:47.270
 Suspension springs with the error span in 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.470
 insert the rear axle and the error 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.280
 relax again 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.420
 pay attention to a good seat in the 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:04.620
 scores 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:08.130
 [Music] 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.410
 so now I'm almost done the 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.350
 Fehlerspanne is removed and he was 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.639
 can be completely drained 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:19.850
 the upper screw of the mappus 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.850
 shock absorber and tightened with 20 mm 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.990
 [Music] 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:34.650
 the trunk and side panel iss 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:34.650
 mounted and off we go to the test drive 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.430
 So I saw a shock absorber 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.020
 Change is not that hard 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.790
 We from macro have as manufacturer one 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.120
 wide assortment of excellent 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.700
 shock absorbers for almost every car type 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.140
 under maco auto parts point de you can 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.600
 convince yourself 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.950
 So friends good ride on all wheels 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.950
 wishes you the screwdriver
