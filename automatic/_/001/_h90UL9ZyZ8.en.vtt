do the same thing United States so what
I<00:01:39.720> told<00:01:40.079> people<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.740> was<00:01:40.920> I'm<00:01:41.130> somewhat

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
I told people here was I'm somewhat

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.249 
I told people here was I'm somewhat
optimistic<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.630> turn<00:01:43.020> things

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
optimistic that we can turn things

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.530 
optimistic that we can turn things
around<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.950> other<00:01:44.490> countries<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.000> done<00:01:45.329> that

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
around as other countries have done that

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.210 
around as other countries have done that
a<00:01:45.600> face<00:01:45.869> crisis<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.619> mean<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:46.979> we're<00:01:47.100> not

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
a face crisis I mean if we're not

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.340 
a face crisis I mean if we're not
problem<00:01:47.700> solvers<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.600> might<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.810> well<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.320> home

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
problem solvers we might as well go home

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.649 
problem solvers we might as well go home
and<00:01:50.100> buy<00:01:50.280> our<00:01:50.310> gold<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.820> silver<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.210> our<00:01:51.390> guns

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and buy our gold and silver and our guns

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.539 
and buy our gold and silver and our guns
and<00:01:51.990> our<00:01:52.170> survival<00:01:52.799> food<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.220> head<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and our survival food and head for the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.660 
and our survival food and head for the
hills<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.540> don't<00:01:54.689> think<00:01:54.869> Americans<00:01:55.409> are

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
hills and I don't think Americans are

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.920 
hills and I don't think Americans are
doing<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> think<00:01:57.180> we're<00:01:57.299> problem<00:01:57.540> solvers

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
doing that I think we're problem solvers

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.580 
doing that I think we're problem solvers
and<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.430> relatively<00:02:00.149> bullish<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.840> stocks

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and so I'm relatively bullish on stocks

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.499 
and so I'm relatively bullish on stocks
and<00:02:01.920> traditional<00:02:02.549> investments<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.210> somewhat

and<00:02:22.969> I've<00:02:23.540> always<00:02:23.750> been<00:02:24.079> a<00:02:24.439> little<00:02:24.769> bit<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.159> an

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
and I've always been a little bit of an

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
enfant turi bleh in the sense that like

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.050 
enfant turi bleh in the sense that like
when<00:02:30.170> Reagan<00:02:30.650> was<00:02:30.680> elected<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.549> saw<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.909> as<00:02:32.030> a

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
when Reagan was elected I saw that as a

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.479 
when Reagan was elected I saw that as a
sea<00:02:32.359> change<00:02:32.659> and<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.439> I<00:02:33.470> said<00:02:33.799> sell<00:02:34.129> your<00:02:34.340> gold

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
sea change and so I said sell your gold

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.220 
sea change and so I said sell your gold
and<00:02:34.730> silver<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.120> buy<00:02:35.420> stocks<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.049> bonds

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
and silver and buy stocks and bonds

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.690 
and silver and buy stocks and bonds
which<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.650> think<00:02:36.859> was<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.010> very<00:02:37.220> good<00:02:37.310> mood<00:02:37.519> but

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
which I think was a very good mood but

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.280 
which I think was a very good mood but
it<00:02:37.790> was<00:02:37.879> very<00:02:37.939> unpopular<00:02:38.450> there<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.139> I<00:02:39.170> was

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
it was very unpopular there and I was

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.229 
it was very unpopular there and I was
kind<00:02:39.439> of<00:02:40.540> disenfranchised<00:02:41.540> from<00:02:42.019> the

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
kind of disenfranchised from the

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.270 
kind of disenfranchised from the
gold-bug<00:02:44.239> movement<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.049> so<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:45.889> sense<00:02:46.069> I'm

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
gold-bug movement and so in a sense I'm

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.770 
gold-bug movement and so in a sense I'm
doing<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.549> little<00:02:46.730> bit<00:02:46.939> now<00:02:47.090> look<00:02:47.420> we've<00:02:47.599> had<00:02:47.750> a

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
doing a little bit now look we've had a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.960 
doing a little bit now look we've had a
great<00:02:48.049> run<00:02:48.260> on<00:02:48.470> gold<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:48.859> silver<00:02:49.280> I'm<00:02:49.519> a<00:02:49.790> big

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
great run on gold and silver I'm a big

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.670 
great run on gold and silver I'm a big
believer<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.510> gold<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.049> silver<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:51.439> an

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
believer in gold and silver as an

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.679 
believer in gold and silver as an
insurance<00:02:51.829> policy<00:02:52.189> but<00:02:53.120> as<00:02:53.269> far<00:02:53.510> as<00:02:53.569> a

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
insurance policy but as far as a

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.390 
insurance policy but as far as a
short-term<00:02:54.049> investment<00:02:54.799> it<00:02:54.950> looks<00:02:55.189> like<00:02:55.370> a

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
short-term investment it looks like a

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.729 
short-term investment it looks like a
topping<00:02:55.939> pattern<00:02:56.359> to<00:02:56.510> me<00:02:56.689> I<00:02:56.870> don't<00:02:57.319> see<00:02:57.470> gold

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
topping pattern to me I don't see gold

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.580 
topping pattern to me I don't see gold
and<00:02:57.889> silver<00:02:58.510> going<00:02:59.510> back<00:02:59.720> up<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.139> hitting<00:03:00.379> its

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
and silver going back up and hitting its

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.830 
and silver going back up and hitting its
previous<00:03:01.220> high<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:01.909> that<00:03:01.939> suggests<00:03:02.389> to<00:03:02.720> me

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
previous high so that suggests to me

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.629 
previous high so that suggests to me
that<00:03:02.989> maybe<00:03:03.829> we're<00:03:04.069> in<00:03:04.129> a<00:03:04.189> trading<00:03:04.489> range

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
that maybe we're in a trading range

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.050 
that maybe we're in a trading range
maybe<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.650> premium<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.950> crisis<00:03:07.430> premium<00:03:07.909> on

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
maybe the premium the crisis premium on

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.940 
maybe the premium the crisis premium on
gold<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:08.419> silver<00:03:08.720> may<00:03:08.900> start<00:03:09.169> to<00:03:09.230> drop<00:03:09.560> here

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
gold and silver may start to drop here

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.339 
gold and silver may start to drop here
if<00:03:10.099> indeed<00:03:10.939> we<00:03:10.970> do<00:03:11.389> try<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.750> solve<00:03:12.109> some<00:03:12.319> of

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
if indeed we do try to solve some of

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.960 
if indeed we do try to solve some of
these<00:03:12.470> problems<00:03:12.530> okay<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:13.489> you're<00:03:13.790> seeing

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
these problems okay so you're seeing

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.990 
these problems okay so you're seeing
short<00:03:14.389> term<00:03:14.629> forecasts<00:03:15.500> bearish<00:03:16.040> forced<00:03:16.639> gold

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
short term forecasts bearish forced gold

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.309 
short term forecasts bearish forced gold
and<00:03:17.120> silver<00:03:17.419> then<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:18.319> would<00:03:18.829> say<00:03:19.129> a<00:03:20.319> more

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
and silver then I would say a more

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.800 
and silver then I would say a more
long-term<00:03:22.040> than<00:03:22.879> short-term<00:03:23.209> I'm<00:03:23.479> really<00:03:23.690> not

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
long-term than short-term I'm really not

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.140 
long-term than short-term I'm really not
sure<00:03:23.870> where<00:03:24.470> our<00:03:24.979> short<00:03:25.280> term<00:03:25.459> but<00:03:25.699> what<00:03:26.030> I've

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
sure where our short term but what I've

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.530 
sure where our short term but what I've
noticed<00:03:26.389> is<00:03:26.750> that<00:03:27.220> gold<00:03:28.220> was<00:03:28.370> at<00:03:28.579> over<00:03:28.879> 1900

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
noticed is that gold was at over 1900

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.000 
noticed is that gold was at over 1900
almost<00:03:29.840> two<00:03:29.989> thousand<00:03:30.440> dollars<00:03:30.769> an<00:03:30.919> ounce

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
almost two thousand dollars an ounce

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.789 
almost two thousand dollars an ounce
silver<00:03:31.729> got<00:03:32.090> up<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.329> 50<00:03:32.720> bucks<00:03:32.959> immediately

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
silver got up to 50 bucks immediately

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.909 
silver got up to 50 bucks immediately
retraced<00:03:34.430> but<00:03:35.090> they<00:03:35.419> have<00:03:35.750> they've<00:03:36.229> struggled

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
retraced but they have they've struggled

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.339 
retraced but they have they've struggled
to<00:03:37.099> go<00:03:37.250> back<00:03:37.459> up<00:03:37.699> to<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:37.879> previous<00:03:38.389> eyes<00:03:38.599> so

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
to go back up to the previous eyes so

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.770 
to go back up to the previous eyes so
that<00:03:39.379> ABC<00:03:39.979> pattern<00:03:40.760> is<00:03:40.970> very<00:03:41.180> typical<00:03:41.359> of

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
that ABC pattern is very typical of

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.199 
that ABC pattern is very typical of
technical<00:03:42.379> topping<00:03:42.979> out<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.519> marketplace

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
technical topping out of the marketplace

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.170 
technical topping out of the marketplace
why<00:03:44.900> would<00:03:45.169> that<00:03:45.260> be<00:03:45.470> because<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.280> pre<00:03:46.879> the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
why would that be because the pre the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.319 
why would that be because the pre the
crisis<00:03:47.629> premium<00:03:48.199> it<00:03:48.470> may<00:03:48.769> be<00:03:48.829> declining<00:03:49.489> if<00:03:49.909> in

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
crisis premium it may be declining if in

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.369 
crisis premium it may be declining if in
fact<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:51.260> mean<00:03:52.010> even<00:03:52.669> in<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.849> United<00:03:53.180> States<00:03:53.379> we

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
fact I mean even in the United States we

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.379 
fact I mean even in the United States we
could<00:03:54.620> see<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.889> Republicans<00:03:55.609> my<00:03:55.849> predictions

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
could see the Republicans my predictions

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.479 
could see the Republicans my predictions
Republicans<00:03:57.019> will<00:03:57.229> clean<00:03:57.470> house<00:03:57.709> they<00:03:58.310> will

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
Republicans will clean house they will

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.009 
Republicans will clean house they will
take<00:03:58.609> over<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:59.000> house<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.510> Senate<00:03:59.870> and

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
take over the house and the Senate and

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.580 
take over the house and the Senate and
the<00:04:00.109> presidency<00:04:00.889> I<00:04:01.099> think<00:04:01.939> it's<00:04:02.229> Obama<00:04:03.229> unless

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
the presidency I think it's Obama unless

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.949 
the presidency I think it's Obama unless
he<00:04:03.769> changes<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.400> improves<00:04:05.120> things<00:04:05.239> he<00:04:05.629> cannot

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
he changes and improves things he cannot

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.749 
he changes and improves things he cannot
be<00:04:06.139> reelected<00:04:07.299> now<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.750> Fed<00:04:09.049> is<00:04:09.099> falling<00:04:10.099> over

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:10.759 
be reelected now the Fed is falling over

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:15.219 
be reelected now the Fed is falling over
backwards<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:11.930> help<00:04:11.959> Obama<00:04:12.680> by<00:04:13.669> a<00:04:14.120> with<00:04:15.079> all

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
backwards to help Obama by a with all

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.490 
backwards to help Obama by a with all
this<00:04:15.379> easy<00:04:15.739> money<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.489> if<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:18.079> unemployment

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
this easy money and if the unemployment

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.610 
this easy money and if the unemployment
rate<00:04:18.680> drops<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.760> we<00:04:19.909> can<00:04:20.090> see<00:04:20.329> progress<00:04:20.659> Obama

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
rate drops and we can see progress Obama

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.600 
rate drops and we can see progress Obama
could<00:04:22.070> get<00:04:22.340> reelected<00:04:22.789> so<00:04:23.090> I'm

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
could get reelected so I'm

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.540 
could get reelected so I'm
saying<00:04:23.969> for<00:04:24.689> sure<00:04:25.099> this<00:04:26.099> is<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.430> situation

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
saying for sure this is the situation

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.550 
saying for sure this is the situation
but<00:04:27.090> if<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.300> election<00:04:27.659> were<00:04:27.719> held<00:04:27.780> today<00:04:28.020> he's

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
but if the election were held today he's

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.159 
but if the election were held today he's
gone<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:29.159> the<00:04:29.610> way<00:04:29.939> I<00:04:29.969> look<00:04:30.300> at<00:04:30.479> it<00:04:30.509> and<00:04:30.719> that

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
gone is the way I look at it and that

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.719 
gone is the way I look at it and that
means<00:04:31.379> the<00:04:31.500> Republicans<00:04:32.099> get<00:04:32.250> in<00:04:32.460> they

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
means the Republicans get in they

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.050 
means the Republicans get in they
retrenched<00:04:33.389> they<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:35.610> know<00:04:35.639> they<00:04:35.729> have<00:04:35.939> to

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
retrenched they you know they have to

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.499 
retrenched they you know they have to
cut<00:04:36.270> back<00:04:36.319> they<00:04:37.319> have<00:04:37.439> to<00:04:37.650> increase<00:04:38.189> the<00:04:38.520> they

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
cut back they have to increase the they

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.320 
cut back they have to increase the they
have<00:04:39.599> to<00:04:39.780> reduce<00:04:40.439> the<00:04:40.710> welfare<00:04:41.340> benefits<00:04:42.090> of

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
have to reduce the welfare benefits of

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.670 
have to reduce the welfare benefits of
Social<00:04:42.629> Security<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.139> Medicare<00:04:43.530> and

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
Social Security and Medicare and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.020 
Social Security and Medicare and
Medicaid<00:04:44.069> and<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.370> think<00:04:44.580> they'll<00:04:44.729> do<00:04:44.879> all

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
Medicaid and I think they'll do all

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.749 
Medicaid and I think they'll do all
those<00:04:45.270> things<00:04:45.330> if<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:46.289> happens<00:04:46.639> gold<00:04:47.639> and

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
those things if that happens gold and

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.550 
those things if that happens gold and
solar<00:04:48.060> is<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> cry<00:04:48.659> doesn't<00:04:49.169> pay<00:04:49.289> any<00:04:49.439> interest

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
solar is a cry doesn't pay any interest

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.119 
solar is a cry doesn't pay any interest
as<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.550> crisis<00:04:51.270> hedge<00:04:51.539> is<00:04:51.810> is<00:04:52.560> going<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.889> decline

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
as a crisis hedge is is going to decline

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.459 
as a crisis hedge is is going to decline
in<00:04:53.280> value<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:54.090> overall<00:04:54.419> Republican<00:04:55.080> win<00:04:55.259> would

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
in value so overall Republican win would

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:58.129 
in value so overall Republican win would
not<00:04:55.710> be<00:04:55.889> good<00:04:55.919> news<00:04:56.400> for<00:04:56.430> these<00:04:57.090> metals<00:04:57.419> that's

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
not be good news for these metals that's

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.929 
not be good news for these metals that's
correct<00:04:58.529> but<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:58.919> could<00:04:59.129> be<00:04:59.279> good<00:04:59.520> for<00:04:59.789> the

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
correct but it could be good for the

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.189 
correct but it could be good for the
stock<00:05:00.180> market<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:01.020> could<00:05:01.229> be<00:05:01.379> good<00:05:01.590> for

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
stock market it could be good for

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.600 
stock market it could be good for
industrial<00:05:04.199> commodities<00:05:04.560> because<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.279> think

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
industrial commodities because I think

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.029 
industrial commodities because I think
the<00:05:05.729> economy<00:05:06.029> could<00:05:06.659> could<00:05:07.349> respond<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:07.919> that

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
the economy could could respond to that

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.209 
the economy could could respond to that
so<00:05:08.370> for<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.729> basic<00:05:09.270> base<00:05:10.199> commodities<00:05:11.039> it

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
so for the basic base commodities it

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:12.709 
so for the basic base commodities it
might<00:05:11.400> actually<00:05:11.550> be<00:05:11.759> pretty<00:05:12.060> good<00:05:12.300> but<00:05:12.509> for

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
might actually be pretty good but for

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:14.600 
might actually be pretty good but for
gold<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.229> silver<00:05:13.560> i'm<00:05:13.680> not<00:05:13.889> i'm<00:05:14.129> not<00:05:14.189> as
