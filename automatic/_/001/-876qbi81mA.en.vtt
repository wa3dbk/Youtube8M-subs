00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I'm going to comb out my hair and then

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.299 
I'm going to comb out my hair and then
I'm<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.020> split<00:00:58.020> my<00:00:58.170> hair<00:00:58.379> down<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> back

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
I'm going to split my hair down the back

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.450 
I'm going to split my hair down the back
into<00:00:59.699> two<00:00:59.969> sections<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.780> then<00:01:01.430> remember<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
into two sections and then remember that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.390 
into two sections and then remember that
if<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.390> take<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> shower

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
if you take a shower

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.060 
if you take a shower
make<00:01:05.400> sure<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.820> 70%<00:01:06.240> dry<00:01:06.930> before<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.770> do

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
make sure it's 70% dry before you do

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.340 
make sure it's 70% dry before you do
this<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:08.790> else<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> won't<00:01:09.330> dry<00:01:09.810> overnight

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this or else it won't dry overnight

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.230 
this or else it won't dry overnight
so<00:01:10.920> basically<00:01:11.280> I'm<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.760> spraying<00:01:11.970> one

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
so basically I'm just spraying one

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.690 
so basically I'm just spraying one
section<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> my<00:01:12.810> hair<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:14.070> wetter<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
section of my hair and the wetter it is

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.170 
section of my hair and the wetter it is
the<00:01:15.180> better<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.380> curls<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.770> hold<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.640> just

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the better the curls will hold so just

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.030 
the better the curls will hold so just
remember<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.869> make<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> too<00:01:19.200> dry<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.799> else

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
remember not to make it too dry or else

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.670 
remember not to make it too dry or else
it<00:01:20.340> probably<00:01:21.060> won't<00:01:21.240> hold<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.470> I'm

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it probably won't hold and then I'm

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.520 
it probably won't hold and then I'm
tying<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.580> section<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.030> my<00:01:24.150> hair<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.689> then

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
tying one section of my hair and then

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.980 
tying one section of my hair and then
making<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.250> hole<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> middle<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.090> flipping

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
making a hole in the middle and flipping

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.969 
making a hole in the middle and flipping
it<00:01:28.140> inwards<00:01:28.920> through<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> hole<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.150> then

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
it inwards through the hole and then

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.109 
it inwards through the hole and then
after<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.100> done<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.030> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
after I'm done that I'm just going to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.640 
after I'm done that I'm just going to
pull<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> hair<00:01:33.869> tie<00:01:34.079> down<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.689> then<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:37.200> just

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
pull the hair tie down and then I'm just

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.710 
pull the hair tie down and then I'm just
going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> flip<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.340> through<00:01:38.700> again<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.509> then

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
going to flip it through again and then

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.210 
going to flip it through again and then
you're<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.259> gonna<00:01:40.470> repeat<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.979> process

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you're just gonna repeat this process

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.179 
you're just gonna repeat this process
until<00:01:41.640> you're<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.079> bottom<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.619> your<00:01:43.979> hair

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
until you're at the bottom of your hair

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.260

and if your hair gets dry you can spray

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.630 
and if your hair gets dry you can spray
it<00:01:48.299> again<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:48.840> water<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.369> curls

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640

lighting the Sun was being pretty crazy

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.679 
lighting the Sun was being pretty crazy
but<00:02:31.159> basically<00:02:31.579> I<00:02:31.700> just<00:02:31.939> put<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.269> clamp<00:02:32.540> on

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
so first I took out the clamp and then I

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.569 
so first I took out the clamp and then I
took<00:02:41.720> out<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.140> hair<00:02:42.319> tie<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.560> did<00:02:43.189> that<00:02:43.370> to

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
took out the hair tie and did that to

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.050 
took out the hair tie and did that to
both<00:02:43.970> sides<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.980> just<00:02:46.310> took<00:02:46.459> my<00:02:46.670> fingers

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
and just separated the curl because I

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.399 
and just separated the curl because I
don't<00:02:50.060> think<00:02:50.299> you'd<00:02:50.450> want<00:02:50.689> to<00:02:50.780> go<00:02:50.930> out<00:02:51.140> looking

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
don't think you'd want to go out looking

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.410 
don't think you'd want to go out looking
like<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:52.870> before<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.079> separate<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.799> and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
like that before you separate it and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.940 
like that before you separate it and
they're<00:02:56.420> pretty<00:02:56.750> tight<00:02:57.079> right<00:02:57.319> now<00:02:57.379> but<00:02:57.560> they

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
they're pretty tight right now but they

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.920 
they're pretty tight right now but they
do<00:02:58.010> loosen<00:02:58.519> up<00:02:58.639> throughout<00:02:58.909> the<00:02:59.090> day<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.510> if

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930
