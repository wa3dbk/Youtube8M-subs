00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello my love in this video today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.480
 I would like to give you my ten tips 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.670
 betrayed her as well through the summer 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.290
 could come and I would say so 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.049
 also launches directly 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.910
 The first tip is probably one 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.340
 tip to anyway every child and still 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.990
 everyone is heeding such and all 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.020
 Drink the best water or 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.939
 unsweetened tea and you should as well 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.830
 take care that the water is not too 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.779
 is cold but rather room temperature 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.550
 because if you have the water too cold 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.679
 Drinking is natural in the first moment 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.370
 nice refreshing but that 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.200
 one produces even more sweat and that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.920
 then beats exactly the opposite 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.710
 So always drink plenty of water on 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.350
 best with room temperature the second 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.090
 Tip is also widespread and indeed 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.079
 it's just a sunscreen 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.670
 apply 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.730
 you can choose if we are 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.960
 Here's what I never want to use 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.730
 then always for the poor and for the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.760
 both because i also have sun allergy 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.129
 and for the face I use of 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.080
 avent 50 + sunscreen 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.530
 you just have to get on your skin 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.049
 vote and watch like him today 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.060
 I am how the office could stay and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.000
 So what but sunscreen is on everyone 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.740
 always very important tip number 3 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.030
 helps especially well with 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.220
 circulation problems 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.049
 I'm so human I always gets total 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.299
 dizzy in the summer though I am very 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.880
 Drink a lot and that is 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.040
 showers and you can either 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.729
 so handle that cold water 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:38.310
 About the canteen wrist 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.740
 running inside surfaces or just after 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.570
 Just take a shower on the shower again 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 were cold shower and then again 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.350
 warm and always in change but completely 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.270
 It is important that you use warm water 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.320
 ends 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.220
 he cranks up the stop again 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.759
 cycle on 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.979
 and yes that's a very good one too 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.649
 I also always take my own advice 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.780
 in summer tip number four he targeted 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.320
 if you are on the way 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.380
 and you totally hot it and that's it 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.539
 thermal water thermal water there thinking 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.159
 many yes 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.129
 what that is just normal water 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.260
 but thermal water has just so healing 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.379
 healing properties are said 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.299
 and i also have a water theme here 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.769
 also mentioned by that is the smallest 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.290
 size it only costs two fifty euros 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.030
 and you just push yourself into it 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.150
 face that cools really nice or 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.040
 even if their skin irritation characterized 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.200
 protect by sun whatever that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.709
 calms your skin and had just this 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.870
 really nice cool effect and that is 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.720
 totally enjoyable then too and if you are 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.670
 Now do not start running extra-volt around you 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.639
 You can also get something like that in such a way 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.590
 pump bottle just green tea 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.950
 Boil up and the fridge next to it 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.900
 put 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.060
 But then you have to do just that every 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.549
 make day and that's just a bit 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.370
 impractical here it is directly 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.769
 bottled and that can not be that fast 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.129
 are bad therefore makes 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.230
 just as you like the fifth tip is 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.419
 especially important to me I am 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.919
 nobody I always have with me and me 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.959
 can only recommend you take one 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.790
 fan or tinker with one 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.310
 paper or something is there is nothing 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.049
 more pleasant to sit in the sun 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.609
 if it is hot in one, and you just 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.959
 not so thermal water or something 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.979
 just always has one with the fan 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.169
 little air to choose 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.599
 that just does good and cools the body 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.250
 also a bit down 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.229
 Tip number six is ​​for yours 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.720
 thought at home and that I live 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:35.359
 right under the roof and it is in 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.250
 Summer at 35 degrees even at night 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.049
 partly and you just can not get it 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.000
 Cooled properly , I can give you that 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.489
 give either tip he airs very early 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.079
 in the morning until 9 o'clock is the air 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:50.150
 really cool and fresh outside 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:51.560
 and if you still sleeping because no idea 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.479
 now just makes the evening, however, 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.819
 you should use the window during the day 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.890
 keep completely closed 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.780
 best still with blinds or 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.760
 curtains to do that too 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.069
 really the heat stays out there and 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.109
 not in your room so either 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.230
 air early in the morning or late at night 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.719
 when it has cooled down a bit 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.900
 Tip number seven is something synonymous 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:15.639
 Everyone can heed and that is in the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.160
 summer a lot more pleasant if you 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.289
 wearing airy clothes is it now 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.609
 linen or cotton or otherwise 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.470
 Something in any case, it is very 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.780
 much more pleasant if you something in something 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.330
 not so tight is not what you are 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.610
 not restricted because the more material 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.360
 directly on the body is sweating all the more 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.150
 you just 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.500
 and that is why it is advisable quite airy 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.539
 Wear clothes best of course 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.620
 also bright because then the sun is not like that 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.139
 is attracted 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.210
 Tip number eight is thought impoverished and 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.759
 Although before going to sleep such a 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.800
 hour or so of going to sleep 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.210
 can you do your pajamas or what 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.590
 Whatever attracts her to sleep in 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.599
 Put the fridge that sounds now 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.669
 funny at first but he does not believe how 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.789
 it is pleasant when it is warm outside 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.009
 is and then you are really nice 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.539
 fresh t-shirt just dont pick something up 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.070
 a bit cool so of course not now 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.409
 into the freezer because otherwise you will 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.539
 afterwards still sick or so simple 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.270
 in the fridge and then one 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.280
 home before going to sleep and then 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.740
 is that really cool the t-shirt 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.800
 and you have at least one 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.620
 some time then a cool with it 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.389
 Number 9 has something to do with your hair or hair 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.620
 he to do with your luggage and that 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.330
 can you hope so that's right 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.520
 right it says in your shampoo 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.440
 given a few drops of tea tree oil though 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.909
 I would only do a few and what 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.490
 the effect if you know your hair 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.199
 that the topic of oil on the scalp, so to speak 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.449
 stays lying and thus really nice 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.940
 It cools and that lasts all day long 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.520
 so that we are really beautiful 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.139
 have the fresh feeling on the head 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.759
 last tip also applies again 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:49.449
 more to go to sleep and that 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.860
 can bedsheet her a wet intended 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.880
 of course not dripping or something like that 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.060
 just a little bit 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.460
 were thinned out for the time being 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.860
 Now it's up to the curtains or how 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.419
 also for such windows 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.460
 completely cover once 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.160
 that has the effect that the air 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.080
 flowing into the window 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.120
 is cooled and thereby cool room 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.890
 come and you just have one 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.040
 more pleasant night and you do not have to 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.870
 to roll around because that was how hot they were 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.550
 now my ten tips for you as you 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.200
