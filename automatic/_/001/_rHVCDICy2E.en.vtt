00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.590 
polished the UI is a lot nicer to look
at<00:02:37.489> flipping<00:02:37.880> through<00:02:38.030> everything<00:02:38.359> is<00:02:38.450> really

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
at flipping through everything is really

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.660 
at flipping through everything is really
nice<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:39.079> have<00:02:39.560> run<00:02:39.769> into<00:02:39.799> some<00:02:40.010> performance

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
nice I have run into some performance

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.000 
nice I have run into some performance
bugs<00:02:40.940> here<00:02:41.329> and<00:02:41.480> there<00:02:41.660> some<00:02:42.350> little<00:02:42.470> hiccups

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
bugs here and there some little hiccups

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.470 
bugs here and there some little hiccups
but<00:02:43.430> I'm<00:02:43.549> sure<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.730> they'll<00:02:43.940> kind<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.209> squish

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
but I'm sure that they'll kind of squish

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.020 
but I'm sure that they'll kind of squish
that<00:02:44.660> as<00:02:44.900> they<00:02:45.200> go<00:02:45.440> through<00:02:45.799> what<00:02:46.489> really

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
that as they go through what really

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.500 
that as they go through what really
stands<00:02:47.359> to<00:02:47.600> be<00:02:47.690> seen<00:02:47.989> is<00:02:48.380> what<00:02:49.190> exactly<00:02:50.030> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
stands to be seen is what exactly the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.840 
stands to be seen is what exactly the
freemium<00:02:51.019> model<00:02:51.049> looks<00:02:51.680> like<00:02:51.980> because

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
freemium model looks like because

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.479 
freemium model looks like because
usually<00:02:53.150> those<00:02:53.630> types<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.320> things<00:02:54.530> don't<00:02:54.890> rear

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
usually those types of things don't rear

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.400 
usually those types of things don't rear
their<00:02:55.730> head<00:02:55.970> until<00:02:56.450> after<00:02:56.930> you've<00:02:57.049> played<00:02:57.260> the

throw you into a situation and then if

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.130 
throw you into a situation and then if
you<00:04:23.100> can<00:04:23.280> win<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.670> get<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:24.150> food<00:04:24.450> for<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:24.900> day

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
you can win you get a food for that day

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.530 
you can win you get a food for that day
you<00:04:25.500> also<00:04:26.400> have<00:04:26.670> the<00:04:26.760> single-player<00:04:27.270> mode

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
you also have the single-player mode

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.840 
you also have the single-player mode
which<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:28.200> some<00:04:28.860> number<00:04:29.190> of<00:04:29.220> waves<00:04:29.580> I'm

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
which is some number of waves I'm

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.880 
which is some number of waves I'm
guessing<00:04:30.240> 50<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.600> haven't<00:04:30.990> seen<00:04:31.200> anything<00:04:31.800> to

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
guessing 50 I haven't seen anything to

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.120 
guessing 50 I haven't seen anything to
indicate<00:04:32.130> otherwise<00:04:32.760> but<00:04:33.750> 50<00:04:34.530> was<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.830> blast

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
indicate otherwise but 50 was the blast

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.190 
indicate otherwise but 50 was the blast
game<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:35.850> I'm<00:04:35.940> guessing<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.510> this<00:04:36.630> game<00:04:37.110> is

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
game so I'm guessing that this game is

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.220 
game so I'm guessing that this game is
good<00:04:37.350> as<00:04:37.560> well<00:04:37.770> there's<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:38.520> multiplayer<00:04:39.060> mode

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
good as well there's a multiplayer mode

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.110 
good as well there's a multiplayer mode
which<00:04:40.230> you<00:04:40.440> can<00:04:40.650> play<00:04:40.890> with<00:04:41.250> as<00:04:41.550> they<00:04:41.880> say

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
which you can play with as they say

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.700 
which you can play with as they say
you're<00:04:42.360> friends<00:04:42.660> now<00:04:42.840> I've<00:04:43.050> activated<00:04:43.650> this

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
you're friends now I've activated this

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.070 
you're friends now I've activated this
mode<00:04:43.950> and<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.700> couldn't<00:04:44.970> find<00:04:45.210> any<00:04:45.480> cut<00:04:45.720> type<00:04:45.900> of

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
mode and I couldn't find any cut type of

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.620 
mode and I couldn't find any cut type of
online<00:04:46.370> server<00:04:47.370> based<00:04:47.730> play<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.390> looks

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
online server based play so it looks

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.050 
online server based play so it looks
like<00:04:48.720> it's<00:04:49.050> local<00:04:49.470> Wi-Fi<00:04:49.950> only<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.580> could<00:04:50.940> be

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
like it's local Wi-Fi only I could be

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.550 
like it's local Wi-Fi only I could be
corrected<00:04:51.240> on<00:04:51.570> that<00:04:51.630> again<00:04:52.080> this<00:04:52.200> is<00:04:52.380> just<00:04:52.500> a

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
corrected on that again this is just a

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.160 
corrected on that again this is just a
first<00:04:52.710> look<00:04:52.950> and<00:04:53.220> that's<00:04:54.060> what<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.270> came<00:04:54.930> to

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
first look and that's what I came to

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.610 
first look and that's what I came to
understand<00:04:55.890> as<00:04:56.190> I<00:04:56.310> played<00:04:56.550> with<00:04:56.730> it<00:04:57.410> so<00:04:58.410> at<00:04:58.590> a
