00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.710
 video tags and as you could the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.380
 guess is the disney tags 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.420
 I had never done this tag on the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.490
 chain i am a big fan of disney 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.139
 and besides if you know I'm in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.449
 right now working at 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.220
 disneyland paris for all summer and I 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.109
 to film this video before leaving 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.939
 so there are ten questions lying on my 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.830
 portable and I'm starting right now 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.560
 first question what is your film 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.330
 disney favorites so they admit they 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.309
 gain a little bit on this but 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 I have no problem it always has 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.820
 been the same since I was everything 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.309
 little and that's the little mermaid 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.989
 I do not know it's always been disney 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.930
 favorite when I was little I 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.280
 dreamed of becoming a siren ariane I 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.930
 found it super g but all 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.399
 songs I really loved all 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.739
 characters it's really a disney who 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.579
 really marked me and it's my favorite 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.100
 always 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.100
 question number 2 what scene of a movie 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.559
 disney would you want to live there I'm 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.620
 am a little bit to break my head for 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.489
 think about this question I have not 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.250
 want to say a bit like everyone 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.380
 and suddenly thinking well 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.020
 looking at the questions I thought about a 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.490
 scene in the movie the worlds of ralph 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.320
 I do not know if you saw this disney 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.220
 it's pretty new but I love it 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.290
 because they are the theme of the games 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.840
 video and I really like that and so 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.509
 it's the scene of the race card 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.979
 in the game sugar rush and that makes 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.450
 really think a lot about mario kart and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.460
 he loves this game I would love to live too much 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.170
 a scene like that in my life where we 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.000
 throws the ice balls a little kart 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.470
 during the snow and where I loved 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.759
 this movie scene and it's really 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.070
 is that I wanted but wanted to live 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.810
 question number 3 an unforgettable moment 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.270
 that you spent in the parks 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.149
 of attraction I laugh already in fact 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.350
 must know that I am a fan of space 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.360
 mountain said stern paris and 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.060
 last year I went to disney 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.530
 world to orlando with my parents and we have 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.360
 since there was also space 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.380
 mountain of the blow the studio mathieu meleu 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.450
 are going to do it and everyone thanks 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.000
 exactly as in France if all 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.070
 content and everything and when I'm 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.450
 arrived it was not at all 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.550
 like it's really weird the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.860
 difference elsewhere it shocked me in 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.410
 does it's a are inquired trolley or one 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.030
 is not even with the harness and 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.060
 individual charles us about but 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.890
 what's that thing is actually it's these 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.950
 roller coaster but really for baby 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.440
 does that go up it goes down to 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.300
 nothing to do with that in France of the coup 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.340
 it made me run a lot 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.600
 marked it's really a great memory 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.730
 that I can not wait for the match is so 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.069
 nothing I was super surprised 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.650
 number 4 if you were to be a prince 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:44.239
 which one would you be I think I 'll be 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.910
 hercules because there is still the 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.310
 class c1 2010 e 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:55.370
 he has strength he is nice he travels 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.030
 I say he rolls with Pegasus this is a 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.829
 White horse 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.500
 I think there is a pretty cool city 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.019
 so tuner that question number 5 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.890
 if you were to be a princess which 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:10.100

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.079

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.609
 the fear she sings ally bernac the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.190
 animals and will yield so I'd like 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:25.310

 passionate about the hand it's more for the 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.239
 character I chose pocahontas whose 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.299
 the physics kicked me off 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.670

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.590
 7 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.470
 already if you could choose a character 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.829
 disney your friend who would choose 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.350

 I cheated people choose several who 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.000
 managed the mice dance brilliantly 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.639
 they are too cute especially gus gus 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.320
 and when it's jack I think like that 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.280
 and could undermine me in my life of 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.739
 every day they could do me 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.799

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.090
 to cry every time I cry 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.340
 easily so it's not very hard like 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.440
 question but I would still say the 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.199
 sadder movie it's bambi when his

 children really I cried a lot 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.199

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.620
