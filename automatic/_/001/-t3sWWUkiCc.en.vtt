00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.980
 the transfer between PSV and Vitesse quickly 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.570

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.130
 Netherlands to make ends meet in person 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.260
 with the people from Eindhoven 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.910

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.329
 switch 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.309
 t took a while yes but yes actually 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.309
 it is also going very fast 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.770

 threw him to play sleek 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:55.379
 those are all very big challenges 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.969

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.480
 fun abroad but in the Netherlands 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.840
 was pacing 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.430
 yes no it was not a specific choice 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.490
 for the Dutch team is the buyer 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:12.170
 in principle for abroad at the start, yes 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.960
 but yes as it got closer it seems 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.850

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.250
 boys at psv 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.560
 you happen to just notice that 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.229
 sat on it that there were a few 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.850

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.850
 coincidentally, the young also succeed 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.070

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.660
 Yes know a few and what is 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.060
 Funny if you now have social media 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.710
 a little bit on top of them just leave them on 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.330

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.740

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.470
 yes then you are certainly proud of it and completely 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.720
 as you see the few years ago 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.190
 when she was very different on one 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.340
 that I just call it trainer over years 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.570

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.980
 little painting 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.090
 A lot has changed there 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.760
 i those guys tell your teammates the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.720
 most of them already got something tower through 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.720
 the media natural 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.860

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.890

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.530
 see passing by and yes I am there 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.400
 happy with it and they will always 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.650
 stay friends with a few bags 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.360
 many contacts about sure and and 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.800
 the peter bos wants one of its best 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.480
 players that you go away and 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.030
 of course all because of you 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.390

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.370
 We have just over hole and 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.920
 think naturalness 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.330
 skilled she who and but for the rest 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.200
 find this also a very nice step 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.080
 for me and yes i think that one too 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.610

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.980

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.190
 the own youth education 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.870
 we stand up even more 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.340
 At the age of 11 you came to mind 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.989
 Vitesse inside if you look back on that 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.950

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.050

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.959
 natural 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.140

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.380
 played and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.500
 in the years before I also as European 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:51.300
 football we met but I had something 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:54.090
 fewer shares and now it 's a bit more 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.670

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.519

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.919
 who has barely been on the ball 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.470
 in the first 25 minutes but now whole 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.229
 surprisingly scores at the first post 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.820
 stekelenburg actually no way 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.660
 rubber cover that ball is excellent 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.270

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.900
 young boy standing there 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.030
