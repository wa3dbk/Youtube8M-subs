other<00:00:45.420> thing<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.870> built<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.350> this

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
other thing that I built is this

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.000 
other thing that I built is this
staircase<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.329> ladder<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.320> mean<00:00:49.710> that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
staircase right this ladder I mean that

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.400 
staircase right this ladder I mean that
goes<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.809> then<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> glass

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
goes up and then you have a glass

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.540 
goes up and then you have a glass
overpass<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:54.289> it<00:00:55.289> leads<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.920> into<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
overpass and it leads you into the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.029 
overpass and it leads you into the
bunker<00:00:57.109> so<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.469> from<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.829> room

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
bunker so you can get from that room

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.520 
bunker so you can get from that room
into<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> bunker<00:00:59.730> quickly<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.750> here's<00:01:01.260> where

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
into the bunker quickly now here's where

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.280 
into the bunker quickly now here's where
the<00:01:01.680> glass<00:01:01.890> overpasses<00:01:02.460> right<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.390> right<00:01:04.260> in

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
the glass overpasses right here right in

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
the glass overpasses right here right in
this<00:01:04.470> tunnel<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.949> would<00:01:05.100> lead<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this tunnel that would lead you to the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.840 
this tunnel that would lead you to the
may<00:01:06.150> from<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> main<00:01:07.020> base<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> bunker<00:01:07.920> so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
may from the main base to the bunker so

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.640 
may from the main base to the bunker so
that's<00:01:09.030> actually<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:09.720> know<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.439> it

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
