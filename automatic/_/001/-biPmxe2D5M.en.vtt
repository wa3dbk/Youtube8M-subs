yeah<00:00:08.450> if<00:00:08.630> you<00:00:08.809> know<00:00:08.900> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.970 

located<00:00:13.980> in

located in
in<00:00:16.039> Montreal<00:00:16.369> Canada<00:00:16.820> we<00:00:17.300> have<00:00:17.330> done<00:00:18.140> a<00:00:18.349> lot<00:00:18.619> of

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
in Montreal Canada we have done a lot of

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.370 
in Montreal Canada we have done a lot of
measurements<00:00:19.509> during<00:00:20.509> the<00:00:20.689> past<00:00:20.930> years

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
measurements during the past years

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.990 
measurements during the past years
working<00:00:22.160> with<00:00:22.430> Mills<00:00:23.110> suppliers<00:00:24.110> and<00:00:24.880> we<00:00:25.880> have

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
working with Mills suppliers and we have

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.189 
working with Mills suppliers and we have
measured<00:00:26.360> up<00:00:26.599> to<00:00:26.829> 200<00:00:27.829> ground<00:00:28.550> rolls<00:00:28.900> so<00:00:29.900> if<00:00:30.050> we

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
measured up to 200 ground rolls so if we

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.310 
measured up to 200 ground rolls so if we
compare<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:31.220> amplitude<00:00:32.089> of<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.629> variations

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
compare the amplitude of the variations

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.509 
compare the amplitude of the variations
around<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.430> roll<00:00:35.019> surface<00:00:36.019> so<00:00:36.949> if<00:00:37.070> we<00:00:37.160> compare

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
around the roll surface so if we compare

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.210 
around the roll surface so if we compare

the level of variation at the surface of

the level of variation at the surface of
the<00:00:55.760> roll<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.719> principle<00:00:57.170> is<00:00:57.199> really

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
the roll so the principle is really

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.910 
the roll so the principle is really
simple<00:00:57.920> it's<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.820> rigid<00:00:59.270> plate<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.410> we<00:01:00.590> put<00:01:00.800> the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
simple it's a rigid plate so we put the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.979 
simple it's a rigid plate so we put the
plate<00:01:01.129> in<00:01:01.160> contact<00:01:01.640> with<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.969> roll<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:02.449> has

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
plate in contact with the roll and has

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.680 
plate in contact with the roll and has
the<00:01:03.170> roll<00:01:03.320> turns<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:04.039> enters<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.180> contact<00:01:05.570> with

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
the roll turns it enters in contact with

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.139 
the roll turns it enters in contact with
the<00:01:05.840> plate<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:06.680> rests<00:01:07.009> on<00:01:07.100> four<00:01:07.160> supports<00:01:08.000> we

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
the plate that rests on four supports we

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.749 
the plate that rests on four supports we
have<00:01:08.300> four<00:01:08.600> supports<00:01:09.140> or<00:01:09.229> rigid<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:09.950> in<00:01:10.640> the

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
have four supports or rigid and in the

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.430 
have four supports or rigid and in the
middle<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:11.270> plate<00:01:11.509> we<00:01:11.929> have<00:01:11.960> a

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
middle of the plate we have a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.279 
middle of the plate we have a
displacement<00:01:13.130> sensor<00:01:13.869> this<00:01:14.869> displacement

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
displacement sensor this displacement

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.919 
displacement sensor this displacement
sensor<00:01:15.860> will<00:01:16.520> move<00:01:16.789> and<00:01:17.000> we'll<00:01:17.570> pick<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:17.780> up

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
sensor will move and we'll pick it up

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.130 
sensor will move and we'll pick it up
all<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.800> residual<00:01:19.220> boring<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.569> accuracy<00:01:21.110> of

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
all the residual boring the accuracy of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.550 
all the residual boring the accuracy of
this<00:01:21.410> sensor<00:01:22.009> is<00:01:22.330> two<00:01:23.330> millionths<00:01:23.690> of<00:01:23.929> an<00:01:24.440> inch

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
this sensor is two millionths of an inch

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.480 
this sensor is two millionths of an inch
so<00:01:25.280> this<00:01:25.429> is<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:25.610> really<00:01:25.880> accurate<00:01:26.119> sensor<00:01:26.810> this

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
so this is a really accurate sensor this

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.779 
so this is a really accurate sensor this
