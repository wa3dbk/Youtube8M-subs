sneak peek so I've already have already
been<00:00:37.620> inside<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.580> box<00:00:39.740> so<00:00:40.740> very<00:00:41.190> simple<00:00:43.100> open

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
been inside this box so very simple open

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.390 
been inside this box so very simple open
it<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.310> here<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:47.030> boom<00:00:48.030> there<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.540> go<00:00:49.400> so

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
it up here and boom there you go so

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.710 
it up here and boom there you go so
that's<00:00:50.880> the<00:00:52.040> modem<00:00:53.040> right<00:00:53.250> there<00:00:53.520> really<00:00:54.360> thin

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
that's the modem right there really thin

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.870 
that's the modem right there really thin
one<00:00:55.410> thing<00:00:55.650> that's<00:00:55.860> pretty<00:00:56.040> cool<00:00:56.280> about<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
one thing that's pretty cool about it is

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.200 
one thing that's pretty cool about it is
it<00:00:57.210> rotates<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.710> way<00:00:58.860> so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.550> mean

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it rotates all the way so I mean

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.400 
it rotates all the way so I mean
essentially<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.840> plug<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.200> in<00:01:01.380> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
essentially you can plug this in and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.609 
essentially you can plug this in and
have<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.770> kind<00:01:02.040> of<00:01:02.100> flat<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:04.500> know

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
have it kind of flat on your you know

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.389 
have it kind of flat on your you know
your<00:01:04.649> computer<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.430> laptop<00:01:05.610> your<00:01:06.210> netbook

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399

your computer your laptop your netbook
but<00:01:08.780> another<00:01:09.780> device<00:01:10.139> little<00:01:10.439> bit<00:01:10.560> later<00:01:10.859> ah

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
but another device little bit later ah

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.779

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
really nice it's like carbon fiber look

on<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.409> your<00:02:24.090> laptop<00:02:25.090> I'm<00:02:25.599> assuming<00:02:26.079> this<00:02:28.379> USB

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
on to your laptop I'm assuming this USB

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.020 
on to your laptop I'm assuming this USB
card<00:02:29.950> slides<00:02:30.819> in<00:02:31.120> there<00:02:31.329> I<00:02:32.190> guess<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.549> rotate

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
card slides in there I guess you rotate

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.470 
card slides in there I guess you rotate
this<00:02:34.180> all<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.599> way<00:02:34.629> down<00:02:36.000> slide<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.150> guy<00:02:37.329> in

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
this all the way down slide that guy in

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.270 
this all the way down slide that guy in
there<00:02:37.599> like<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.739> then<00:02:39.489> this<00:02:39.760> part<00:02:40.060> hooks

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
there like that and then this part hooks

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.330 
there like that and then this part hooks
and<00:02:42.280> on<00:02:42.400> your<00:02:42.670> computer<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:44.040> guess<00:02:45.040> if<00:02:45.189> you're

in and approach we use this this is

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.330 
in and approach we use this this is
actually<00:02:55.510> USB<00:02:55.840> cable<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.349> you<00:02:56.950> would<00:02:57.129> use

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
start guide let's tell us what

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.860 
start guide let's tell us what
everything<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.190> right<00:03:15.519> here<00:03:15.790> in<00:03:15.970> case<00:03:16.780> you

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
everything is right here in case you

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.150 
everything is right here in case you
didn't<00:03:17.109> know<00:03:17.669> and<00:03:18.669> then<00:03:19.449> we<00:03:19.599> got<00:03:20.160> installation

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
didn't know and then we got installation

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.059 
didn't know and then we got installation
so<00:03:21.879> it<00:03:22.060> says<00:03:22.209> XP<00:03:22.629> and<00:03:22.750> Vista<00:03:23.019> right<00:03:23.349> there<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:23.799> I

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
so it says XP and Vista right there so I

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.750 
so it says XP and Vista right there so I
guess<00:03:24.190> that's<00:03:24.489> why<00:03:24.699> seven<00:03:25.239> did<00:03:25.389> not<00:03:25.510> work<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:27.220> 7

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
guess that's why seven did not work so 7

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.949 
guess that's why seven did not work so 7
