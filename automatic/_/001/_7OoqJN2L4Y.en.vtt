00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.170 
means even after you lock that down and
immobilize<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.530> it's<00:02:11.739> actually<00:02:12.430> off-center

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
immobilize it it's actually off-center

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.720 
immobilize it it's actually off-center
with<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> mass<00:02:13.840> off<00:02:14.170> center<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:14.920> that's<00:02:15.400> going

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
with a mass off center and that's going

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.880 
with a mass off center and that's going
to<00:02:15.820> cause<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.330> vibration<00:02:17.110> problems

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
to cause you vibration problems

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.180 
to cause you vibration problems
so<00:02:18.580> really<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.720> thing<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.110> do<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.830> turn

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
so really the thing to do is to turn

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.330 
so really the thing to do is to turn
with<00:02:21.730> our<00:02:21.880> wood<00:02:22.090> lathe<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.630> new<00:02:23.620> bushing<00:02:24.190> to

I<00:02:47.050> have<00:02:47.830> grabbed<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.400> scrap<00:02:48.730> piece<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.030> wood<00:02:49.420> in

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
I have grabbed a scrap piece of wood in

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.060 
I have grabbed a scrap piece of wood in
a<00:02:49.810> four<00:02:50.260> jaw<00:02:50.440> Chuck

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
a four jaw Chuck

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.620 
a four jaw Chuck
and<00:02:51.959> using<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.760> beading<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.880> parting<00:02:55.209> tool<00:02:55.360> I

and using a beading and parting tool I

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.560 
and using a beading and parting tool I
have<00:02:55.750> brought<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.230> tenon<00:02:56.950> down<00:02:57.220> to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
have brought that tenon down to

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.370 
have brought that tenon down to
five-eighths<00:02:58.570> of<00:02:58.750> an<00:02:58.870> inch

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
five-eighths of an inch

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
using this wrench which will actually

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.520 
using this wrench which will actually
put<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.410> over<00:03:02.800> sized<00:03:03.070> for<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.489> 5/8<00:03:04.030> hole<00:03:04.270> I<00:03:04.570> then

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
put it over sized for a 5/8 hole I then

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.699 
put it over sized for a 5/8 hole I then
reduced<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.280> until<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.700> have<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> nice<00:03:07.540> snug<00:03:08.440> fit

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
reduced it until I have a nice snug fit

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.550 
reduced it until I have a nice snug fit
that<00:03:09.610> I'm<00:03:09.730> sort<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.300> pressing<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.140> bushing

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
that I'm sort of pressing that bushing

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.270 
that I'm sort of pressing that bushing
on<00:03:11.680> there<00:03:11.950> like<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.570> I'll<00:03:13.570> now<00:03:13.900> use<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> bowl

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
on there like that I'll now use a bowl

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.600 
on there like that I'll now use a bowl
gouge<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:16.780> bring<00:03:17.320> this<00:03:17.470> down<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.220> correct

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
gouge to bring this down to the correct

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
gouge to bring this down to the correct
diameter<00:03:20.280> there<00:03:21.930> we<00:03:22.930> have<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.080> nice<00:03:24.630> tight

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
diameter there we have a nice tight

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.880 
diameter there we have a nice tight
slide<00:03:26.049> fit<00:03:26.380> with<00:03:27.310> no<00:03:27.850> play<00:03:29.850> there<00:03:30.850> we<00:03:31.890> ring

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
slide fit with no play there we ring

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.910 
slide fit with no play there we ring
test<00:03:33.160> our<00:03:33.519> wheel<00:03:34.450> one<00:03:34.750> more<00:03:34.959> time<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.680> make

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
test our wheel one more time and make

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.259 
test our wheel one more time and make
sure<00:03:36.100> that<00:03:36.220> nothing<00:03:36.549> happened<00:03:36.970> while<00:03:37.120> we<00:03:37.150> were

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
sure that nothing happened while we were

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.080 
sure that nothing happened while we were
turning<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:38.140> bushing<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.760> will<00:03:39.910> just

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
turning this bushing and that will just

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.900 
turning this bushing and that will just
slip<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.720> wheel<00:03:40.900> right<00:03:41.200> on<00:03:41.880> there<00:03:44.910> install

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
slip that wheel right on there install

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.660 
slip that wheel right on there install
the<00:03:46.090> flange<00:03:48.720> we'll<00:03:49.720> just<00:03:49.959> tighten<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:51.010> snug

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
the flange we'll just tighten that snug

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.539 
the flange we'll just tighten that snug
but<00:03:52.150> not<00:03:52.260> crazy<00:03:53.260> that<00:03:53.560> we'd<00:03:53.739> crack<00:03:54.040> that<00:03:54.280> wheel

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
but not crazy that we'd crack that wheel

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.090 
but not crazy that we'd crack that wheel
in<00:03:54.820> anyway<00:03:55.239> I've<00:03:55.750> turned<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.290> guard<00:03:56.530> here<00:03:56.890> to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
in anyway I've turned the guard here to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.470 
in anyway I've turned the guard here to
get<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.370> out<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.730> way<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.450> can

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
get it out of the way so that you can

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.110 
get it out of the way so that you can
see<00:03:58.840> this<00:03:59.019> next<00:03:59.440> very<00:03:59.769> important<00:04:00.430> operation

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
called a tongue guard by OSHA because it

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.720 
called a tongue guard by OSHA because it
looks<00:04:07.390> like<00:04:07.570> a<00:04:07.600> tongue<00:04:08.130> sticking<00:04:09.130> down<00:04:09.459> from

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
that I've been in a number of shops

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.379 
that I've been in a number of shops
lately<00:05:32.810> where<00:05:33.349> they've<00:05:33.590> mounted<00:05:34.009> the<00:05:34.389> grinder

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
lately where they've mounted the grinder

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.779 
lately where they've mounted the grinder
very<00:05:35.779> high<00:05:36.110> like<00:05:36.499> this<00:05:36.800> with<00:05:37.099> the<00:05:37.189> idea<00:05:37.550> that

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
very high like this with the idea that

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.879 
very high like this with the idea that
you<00:05:37.909> can<00:05:38.120> see<00:05:38.449> better<00:05:38.689> what<00:05:39.050> you're<00:05:39.199> doing<00:05:39.650> I

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.580 
think that's very unwise all this is
sort<00:05:43.189> of<00:05:43.279> thought<00:05:43.669> out<00:05:43.909> over<00:05:44.449> a<00:05:44.479> long<00:05:44.810> period

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
sort of thought out over a long period

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.830 
sort of thought out over a long period
of<00:05:45.650> time<00:05:45.889> to<00:05:46.310> get<00:05:46.460> all<00:05:46.520> this<00:05:46.879> stuff<00:05:47.029> down<00:05:47.449> here

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
of time to get all this stuff down here

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.200
