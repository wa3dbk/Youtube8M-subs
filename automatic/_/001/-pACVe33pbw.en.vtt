there have discovered a way to use blast
off<00:04:28.540> in<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:29.110> forming<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.590> Bruticus<00:04:30.100> but<00:04:30.370> I

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
off in the forming of Bruticus but I

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.610 
off in the forming of Bruticus but I
wanted<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.030> only<00:04:31.540> show<00:04:31.840> you<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.020> building<00:04:32.500> of

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
wanted to only show you the building of

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.200 
wanted to only show you the building of
the<00:04:32.680> character<00:04:33.070> with<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.430> included<00:04:33.880> parts

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
the character with the included parts

now<00:04:35.050> this<00:04:35.169> combiner<00:04:35.530> sets<00:04:35.830> are<00:04:36.010> again<00:04:36.580> really

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
now this combiner sets are again really

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.270 
now this combiner sets are again really
well<00:04:37.360> done<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:38.080> while<00:04:38.200> some<00:04:38.470> fans<00:04:38.770> may<00:04:38.950> find
