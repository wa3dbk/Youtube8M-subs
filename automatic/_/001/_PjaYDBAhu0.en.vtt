00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello today i will show you 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:11.870
 how to make a stylus for the screen 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.870
 Touch so for a touch screen touch 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:21.750
 for that you will need a sponge 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:28.710
 which you do not know of a pair of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:34.230
 scissors of a wooden crime or a stick 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:42.989
 who will serve you to whom you will serve 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:45.809
 like stiletto and tape so we 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.809
 let's start taking the sponge and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.489
 we are going to cut into rectangles of 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.260
 the sponge like those like this one 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.910
 so with all parties the part 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 green and the elbows part then you 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.720
 go take your stylus that will finally 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.210
 your pencil who have your stick that is going 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.580
 do that will allow you to hold 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.630
 your stylus you will take your 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.860
 piece of sponge and the green part 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.080
 will get inside the glass the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.570
 night so and the yellow part towards 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.299
 the outside so broken like that you 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.600
 fold and with tape we will do everything 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.259
 the turn like that it hooked well to the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.710
 stylus you will take a long enough 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.100
 piece of tape and want to roll everything 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100
 around 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.509
 the roll all around like these 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:05.619
 Scotch and support you well and that's it 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.880
 so we created our style and that 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.009
 hold well it's perfect 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.230
 so why did we choose 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.810
 the sponge to make the stylus because 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.470
 the touch screen will believe that the sponge 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.380
 and the surface of your skin so that's 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.080
 so that's why we've created a 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.080
 touch screen stylus goodbye
