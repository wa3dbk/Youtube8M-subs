displayed<00:01:07.650> properly<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.150> actually

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
displayed properly so and actually

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.510 
displayed properly so and actually
actually<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.320> got<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.650> right<00:01:10.860> rank<00:01:11.130> but

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
actually you got your right rank but

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.660 
actually you got your right rank but
showing<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.570> different<00:01:12.840> tag<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:14.310> example<00:01:14.640> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
showing a different tag for example you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.950 
showing a different tag for example you
could<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.060> over<00:01:15.180> two<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.750> showing

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
could be in over two but it's showing

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.740 
could be in over two but it's showing
that<00:01:16.290> you're<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.710> LEM<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.450> another

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
that you're in a LEM so this is another

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.440 
that you're in a LEM so this is another
thing<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.080> fucks<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.619> even<00:01:19.890> more<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
thing that fucks it up even more and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.870 
thing that fucks it up even more and
yeah<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.500> want<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> say<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.979> don't<00:01:23.610> worry

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
yeah so all I want to say is don't worry

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.429 
yeah so all I want to say is don't worry
too<00:01:24.060> much<00:01:24.090> about<00:01:24.210> rank<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.320> little

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
too much about rank it's just a little

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.800 
too much about rank it's just a little
patch<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.090> know<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.540> kind<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
patch and as we all know it's kind of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.149 
patch and as we all know it's kind of
hard<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.880> determine<00:01:29.880> skill<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:31.020> by<00:01:31.320> having<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
hard to determine skill just by having a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.539 
hard to determine skill just by having a
couple<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> matches<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.720> especially<00:01:34.549> when

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
couple of matches and especially when

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.039 
couple of matches and especially when
it's<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:36.060> game<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.750> strike<00:01:37.020> because

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
it's a game like on strike because

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.190 
it's a game like on strike because
you're<00:01:38.009> getting<00:01:38.159> an<00:01:38.430> individual<00:01:39.329> skill<00:01:39.750> rank

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
you're getting an individual skill rank
