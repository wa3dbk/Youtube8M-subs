mounting sleeve for the ipad on the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
keyboard and I thought this was actually

magnetic<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.059> iPad<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.960> fit<00:00:40.230> in

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
magnetic that the the iPad would fit in

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.290 
magnetic that the the iPad would fit in
there<00:00:40.469> but<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.370> way<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.520> ipad

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
there but it's not the way the ipad

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000 
there but it's not the way the ipad
slips<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> things<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> can

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
slips in and one of the things you can

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.190 
slips in and one of the things you can
see<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.300> has<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.719> bit<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.989> this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
see here is it has a little bit of this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.940 
see here is it has a little bit of this
kind<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> black<00:00:46.890> felt<00:00:47.579> lining<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.770> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
kind of black felt lining so that you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.770 
kind of black felt lining so that you
don't<00:00:50.129> scratch<00:00:50.280> some<00:00:50.700> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> microfiber

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.470 
don't scratch some kind of microfiber
ish<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.739> scratch<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> iPad<00:00:54.059> but

ish so you don't scratch up the iPad but

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.689 
ish so you don't scratch up the iPad but

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
since the ipad has this thin bezel on

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.119 
since the ipad has this thin bezel on
that<00:00:59.940> side<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:01.050> only<00:01:01.199> you'd<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.980> these

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
that side you can only you'd have these

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.670 
that side you can only you'd have these
two<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.670> feet<00:01:03.199> holding<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> front

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
two little feet holding in the front

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.870 
two little feet holding in the front
because<00:01:04.920> otherwise<00:01:05.129> you'll<00:01:05.400> you'll<00:01:05.670> block

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
because otherwise you'll you'll block

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.080 
because otherwise you'll you'll block
the<00:01:06.060> screen<00:01:06.390> one<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> issues<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:08.090> that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the screen one of the issues is that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
the screen one of the issues is that
there's<00:01:09.420> no<00:01:09.600> nothing<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.229> self<00:01:10.560> centers

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
there's no nothing that self centers

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.200 
there's no nothing that self centers
does<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.280> you've<00:01:11.400> got<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.060> on

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
does so you've got to kind of do it on

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.670 
does so you've got to kind of do it on
your<00:01:12.390> own<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
your own and then it's just that the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.670 
your own and then it's just that the
edge<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.970> mount<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.990> really

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
edge of the the mount here is really

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.670 
edge of the the mount here is really
tight<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.970> iPad<00:01:24.360> fits<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.229> stays<00:01:25.439> in

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
place by just kind of being jammed into

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.319 
place by just kind of being jammed into
that<00:01:28.710> sucker<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.909> won't<00:01:30.090> fall

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
to move in and out but as you can see it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.850 
to move in and out but as you can see it
does<00:01:35.579> leave<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> little<00:01:36.090> bit<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> mark<00:01:36.600> and

when<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.159> centered<00:01:38.549> you're<00:01:38.729> gonna<00:01:38.880> have

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
when it's not centered you're gonna have

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.499 
when it's not centered you're gonna have

again the iPad screen is a little too

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.170 
again the iPad screen is a little too
vertical<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.360> me<00:02:03.509> that's<00:02:03.810> one<00:02:04.229> problem<00:02:05.180> you

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
vertical for me that's one problem you

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.690 
vertical for me that's one problem you
you<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.140> deal<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.129> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you can you can deal with it it's not a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.940 
you can you can deal with it it's not a
deal<00:02:09.090> breaker<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.929> are<00:02:10.110> looking<00:02:10.440> down<00:02:10.890> on

the iPad

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.540 
the iPad
it<00:02:12.930> doesn't<00:02:13.200> really<00:02:13.470> go<00:02:13.709> back<00:02:13.950> kind<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.280> far

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
it doesn't really go back kind of far

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.339 
it doesn't really go back kind of far
enough<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.909> give<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.239> straight<00:02:16.140> on

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
enough to give you a straight on

enough to give you a straight on
direction<00:02:16.799> right<00:02:16.950> now<00:02:17.159> it's<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.299> the

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
direction right now it's this is the

direction right now it's this is the
this<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.230> pretty<00:02:19.470> normal<00:02:19.830> table<00:02:20.129> this<00:02:20.250> is

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
this is a pretty normal table this is

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.220 
this is a pretty normal table this is
where<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.580> would<00:02:20.700> actually<00:02:20.940> sit<00:02:21.299> and<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.840> typing

anyway<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:39.329> keys<00:02:39.599> which<00:02:39.989> are<00:02:40.140> chiclet<00:02:40.560> style

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
anyway the keys which are chiclet style

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.990 
anyway the keys which are chiclet style
are<00:02:41.010> actually<00:02:41.310> pretty<00:02:41.489> nice<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:41.940> is

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
are actually pretty nice this is

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.610 
are actually pretty nice this is
actually<00:02:42.150> one<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.599> nicer<00:02:42.959> keyboards<00:02:43.500> I

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually one of the nicer keyboards I

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.170 
actually one of the nicer keyboards I
found<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.549> then<00:02:45.379> physically<00:02:46.379> my<00:02:47.129> issues<00:02:47.760> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
found but then physically my issues and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.610 
found but then physically my issues and
the<00:02:48.329> reason<00:02:48.599> I<00:02:48.720> won't<00:02:48.900> probably<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.319> sticking

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
the reason I won't probably be sticking

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.009 
the reason I won't probably be sticking
with<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:50.910> know<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.239> cheap<00:02:51.510> thin

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
with this you know it's a cheap thin

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.699 
with this you know it's a cheap thin
plastic<00:02:52.590> painted<00:02:53.459> silver<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.349> it<00:02:55.349> doesn't

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
plastic painted silver and it doesn't

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.830 
plastic painted silver and it doesn't
take<00:02:55.950> much<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.459> tip<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.760> over<00:02:56.819> not<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.720> that's

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
take much to tip it over not that that's

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.660 
take much to tip it over not that that's
a<00:02:57.989> big<00:02:58.140> deal<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.739> understand<00:02:59.220> why<00:02:59.430> they

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
a big deal and I understand why they

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.640 
a big deal and I understand why they
made<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.030> hinge<00:03:00.329> only<00:03:00.959> go<00:03:01.109> that<00:03:01.349> far<00:03:01.500> because

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
made the hinge only go that far because

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.949 
made the hinge only go that far because
any<00:03:01.920> other<00:03:02.129> further<00:03:02.459> than<00:03:02.819> that<00:03:02.849> and<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.629> iPad

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
any other further than that and the iPad

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.509 
any other further than that and the iPad
wouldn't<00:03:04.260> even<00:03:04.319> be<00:03:04.560> able<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.739> stand<00:03:04.890> up<00:03:05.099> on<00:03:05.280> its

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
wouldn't even be able to stand up on its

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.099 
wouldn't even be able to stand up on its
own<00:03:05.640> way<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:06.269> really<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:06.750> really<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
own way but really it's really the

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.910 
own way but really it's really the
deal-breaker<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.720> switch<00:03:10.680> here

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
deal-breaker is the the switch here

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.039 
deal-breaker is the the switch here
itself<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.400> here's<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.790> power<00:03:11.970> switch<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:12.599> and

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
itself so here's the power switch on and

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.430 
itself so here's the power switch on and
off<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.459> there's<00:03:15.030> really<00:03:15.299> no<00:03:15.629> way<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.900> tell<00:03:16.230> if

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
off and there's really no way to tell if

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.990 
off and there's really no way to tell if
it's<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:16.709> or<00:03:16.739> off<00:03:16.980> by<00:03:17.190> looking<00:03:17.370> at<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:17.970> way

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
it's on or off by looking at it the way

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.800 
it's on or off by looking at it the way
you<00:03:18.180> can<00:03:18.480> tell<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:19.880> when<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.030> switch<00:03:21.269> on<00:03:21.510> the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
you can tell is when you switch on the

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.259 
you can tell is when you switch on the
lights<00:03:22.500> flash<00:03:22.889> blue<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:23.669> a<00:03:23.700> second<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.180> then

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
lights flash blue for a second and then

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.000 
lights flash blue for a second and then
they<00:03:24.389> go<00:03:24.540> away<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:25.560> kind<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.739> hard<00:03:25.950> to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
they go away so it's kind of hard to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.250 
they go away so it's kind of hard to
remember<00:03:26.190> if<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.579> on<00:03:26.700> or<00:03:26.880> off<00:03:27.000> but<00:03:27.720> that's

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
remember if it's on or off but that's

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.839 
remember if it's on or off but that's
not<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.709> problem<00:03:28.889> but<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.519> like<00:03:29.669> some<00:03:29.819> of

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
not the problem but just like some of

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.909 
not the problem but just like some of
the<00:03:29.970> other<00:03:30.180> keyboards<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.470> has<00:03:31.709> this

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
the other keyboards it has this

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.309 
the other keyboards it has this
Bluetooth<00:03:32.489> connect<00:03:32.819> button<00:03:33.060> here<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.840> for

Bluetooth connect button here and for

Bluetooth connect button here and for
whatever<00:03:34.530> reason<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:38.130> can

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
whatever reason so it's on and you can

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.430 
whatever reason so it's on and you can
see<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.970> says<00:03:39.150> keyboard<00:03:39.750> not<00:03:39.930> connected

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440

what<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.620> actually<00:03:40.859> have<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.310> do<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.639> know<00:03:41.790> if

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
what I actually have to do you know if

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.729 
what I actually have to do you know if
paired<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.389> hit<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.019> pairing<00:03:43.530> button

paired it is hit this pairing button

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:44.680 
paired it is hit this pairing button
that<00:03:43.919> one<00:03:44.069> more<00:03:44.280> time

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
that one more time

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.990 
that one more time
it<00:03:45.690> goes<00:03:45.930> into<00:03:46.139> pairing<00:03:46.530> mode<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:47.010> at<00:03:47.819> that

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
it goes into pairing mode and at that

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.900 
it goes into pairing mode and at that
point<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:49.889> iPad<00:03:50.310> seems<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.760> find<00:03:51.000> it

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
point the iPad seems to find it

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.869 
point the iPad seems to find it
it<00:03:53.910> doesn't<00:03:54.209> make<00:03:54.299> you<00:03:54.470> reinvent<00:03:55.470> er<00:03:55.590> that

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
it doesn't make you reinvent er that

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:01.280 
it doesn't make you reinvent er that
four-digit<00:03:56.879> code<00:03:57.079> but<00:03:58.079> that<00:03:59.900> has<00:04:00.900> happened<00:04:01.260> on

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
four-digit code but that has happened on

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.509 
four-digit code but that has happened on
other<00:04:01.500> keyboards<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.069> I<00:04:02.099> don't<00:04:02.220> know<00:04:02.310> if<00:04:02.400> it's

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
other keyboards and I don't know if it's

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.500 
other keyboards and I don't know if it's
just<00:04:02.579> this<00:04:02.790> hardware<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:03.359> that's

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
just this hardware but that's

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.330 
just this hardware but that's
unacceptable<00:04:03.930> when<00:04:04.349> I<00:04:04.379> turn<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.889> keyboard

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
unacceptable when I turn on the keyboard

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.210 
unacceptable when I turn on the keyboard
I<00:04:05.549> want<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.419> to<00:04:06.959> turn<00:04:07.139> on<00:04:07.349> immediately<00:04:08.099> and

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
I want it to turn on immediately and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.309 
I want it to turn on immediately and
that's<00:04:08.790> one<00:04:09.329> of<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:09.449> problems<00:04:09.780> turning<00:04:10.199> it

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
that's one of the problems turning it

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.069 
that's one of the problems turning it
off<00:04:10.440> no<00:04:10.709> problem<00:04:11.599> and<00:04:12.599> then<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.959> will

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
off no problem and then it will

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.120 
off no problem and then it will
automatically<00:04:13.680> disconnect<00:04:14.250> as<00:04:14.430> expected<00:04:14.970> but

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
automatically disconnect as expected but

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.500 
automatically disconnect as expected but
when<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.250> turn<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.519> back<00:04:17.639> on<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.970> just<00:04:18.120> doesn't

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
when you turn it back on it just doesn't

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.180 
when you turn it back on it just doesn't
automatically<00:04:19.019> connect<00:04:19.410> that's<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.799> that's

automatically connect that's a that's

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.229 
automatically connect that's a that's
pretty<00:04:20.489> that's<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:20.909> pretty<00:04:21.030> big

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
pretty that's a pretty big

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.810 
pretty that's a pretty big
disappointment<00:04:21.930> for<00:04:21.989> me<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.440> then<00:04:22.820> lastly

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
disappointment for me and then lastly

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.450 
disappointment for me and then lastly
the<00:04:24.390> switches

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
the switches

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.700 
the switches
for<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:26.030> power<00:04:26.210> button<00:04:26.660> in<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.110> pairing<00:04:27.530> and

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
for the power button in the pairing and

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.100 
for the power button in the pairing and
all<00:04:27.830> that<00:04:28.070> are<00:04:28.280> pretty<00:04:29.000> small<00:04:29.479> and<00:04:29.810> kind<00:04:30.080> of

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
all that are pretty small and kind of

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.140 
all that are pretty small and kind of
flimsy<00:04:30.350> like<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.770> said<00:04:30.979> it's<00:04:31.460> pretty<00:04:31.699> easy<00:04:31.970> to

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
flimsy like I said it's pretty easy to

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.360 
flimsy like I said it's pretty easy to
knock<00:04:32.479> this<00:04:32.690> around<00:04:33.020> up<00:04:33.410> here<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:34.220> actually

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
knock this around up here and I actually

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.550 
knock this around up here and I actually
prefer<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.300> little<00:04:35.630> bit<00:04:35.750> when<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:36.020> pairing

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
prefer a little bit when that pairing

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.770 
prefer a little bit when that pairing
button<00:04:36.770> is<00:04:36.979> on<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.190> top<00:04:37.550> of<00:04:37.759> the<00:04:38.300> case<00:04:38.479> here<00:04:38.750> so

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
button is on the top of the case here so

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.260 
button is on the top of the case here so
that<00:04:39.110> you're<00:04:39.289> not<00:04:39.460> accidentally<00:04:40.460> hitting<00:04:41.030> it

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
that you're not accidentally hitting it

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.060 
that you're not accidentally hitting it
on<00:04:41.419> stuff<00:04:41.720> this<00:04:41.930> is<00:04:42.110> really<00:04:42.380> kind<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.620> in<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.800> in

feet on the bottom kind of kind of a
quick<00:04:56.570> release<00:04:56.900> on<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.199> iPad<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.979> know<00:04:58.190> much

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
quick release on the iPad you know much

quick release on the iPad you know much
more<00:04:58.639> quick<00:04:58.910> release<00:04:59.240> than<00:04:59.449> some<00:04:59.660> of<00:04:59.750> the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
more quick release than some of the

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.490 
more quick release than some of the
others<00:04:59.990> but<00:05:00.229> all-in-all<00:05:01.070> it's<00:05:02.110> it<00:05:03.110> has<00:05:03.259> too

big hinge on the side it's a little bit
like<00:05:11.780> those<00:05:11.960> old<00:05:12.190> defunct<00:05:13.190> Sony<00:05:13.870> tablets<00:05:14.870> that
