00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.649

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:40.079
 There we go 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:49.860
 the map gives you over those stops 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:53.310
 street like this, oh no, I'm not down today, it's 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.750
 contaminated me is not having a fall 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:02.240
 on the way back to these guys it's not worth yet 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.240
 that rages even more is 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.420
 the talent of this car through the reader 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.420
 good but could not now have time to 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:21.030
 stay in first is so you here in 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:33.310
 my front was there, it's slutty 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:39.250
 our little pebble is stealing the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:41.290
 ball and put one back only yes 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.620
 The guy who already got the check can speak 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.310
 the other side will win is not if the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:58.510
 man thus wins a spot 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:03:01.140
 the only one not expensive bench and I here only 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.140
 fucking me 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:24.480
 according to there was the third worst 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:39.610
 a bug in alan takes and when you pass 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.450
 the first there in the para no no 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.489
 container a for that ramp and the back 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.030
 So until the end to go to the second 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.299
 squid 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.519
 I think it's going to be easier this is a tip 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:56.140
 to move the position for the third right 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:58.510
 and the tip pro the mining team is not 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.350
 just leave the place the car in the middle not 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.660
 need to move the car only leaving half 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.860
 there 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:13.230
 while squid because old calculus 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:15.480
 This is the way the car jumped there. 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.530
 the guy broke up on the trick 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:25.650
 face ending the trick there and 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:32.490
 I'll wait for you, opa 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:39.480
 now I'm going to end up in water, right? 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:42.240
 I almost fell here, I'm going to give up, I'm going to stay. 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:51.690
 waiting here in the room is also never 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:57.570
 It will go to 'guy' and finally passed 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:05:00.150
 all I remember now that I spent the last 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.860
 The time I ran I got the last 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.840
 starting the car did not come to 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.610
 check point here has nothing on the verge of 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:14.940
 sea and the assange is that if we do not pay 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:17.370
 the speed will not go but the guy who 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.169
 plant is dwarf good and superior 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.760
 I was waiting here not to tell 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:28.860
 I do not know for you is the guy would see almost 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:33.630
 there went to the quiet guy now 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:39.690
 but I do not think it's going to come as a good 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:43.650
 part of the race but this is not why 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:48.419
 saw that the long run 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.300
 I thought I ended up here. 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:56.000
 that turning around has to come up to the 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.000
 town like lab truce like this 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.610
 There's another guy there coming from the league. 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.319
 Good, I was able to complete that stop. 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.509
 to me as if I had stayed in 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.479
 first quiet then go there to 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:18.990
 pressure on our car hit the plate 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:21.449
 this purpose is a pressure that human 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.960
 dispute of 1st 2nd place known seventh 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.960
 placed 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:40.919
 she will not miss just did not see the end 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.509
 aa we had a lot of focus if we did not beat up 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:48.440
 there at the end of the lan 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:48.440
 Yes, I finished the race. 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:07:03.210
 I think those who stayed in mine 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:07:08.969
 front they did stealing then we 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:10.560
 three stole stay aston villa do not know 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:12.690
 the second robot but the first and the 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:21.240
 third certainty that he stole because they 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:24.150
 It is only here that I did the part 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.590
 main of the race that was oo raid do 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:30.360
 about a student who was very crazy and 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.669
 I'll leave the channel here for bruno cecotti 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:39.120
 in the description that was insane he does everything 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:41.669
 first in the same I do not think 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:46.380
 now he goes there he knows everything, right? 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:49.139
 better but do not go in this ease to 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.270
 me i do not is not born 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:55.020
 so it's okay so that's what it says 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:56.580
 Czech spoke the talk guys 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:03.110
 That 's it folks we see each other in the 

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:03.110
