00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 To be sure and message all 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.900
 you have to come back 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 First of all, note the following 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 driving technique in the entrance to the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.940
 At the top I press my bike on 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.309
 handlebar strong to curves inside through 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.440
 this presses the wheel touches my 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.950
 thigh and thereby I have one 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.590
 fifth contact point to the bike my view 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.949
 goes far beyond the bend in 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.179
 direction of rotation out through it 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.710
 my upper body around the vertical axis 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.500
 I need imperfect control 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.760
 a lot of pressure on the front wheel 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.510
 second, the line selection in the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.790
 Spitzkehre The line choice is whole 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.890
 crucial for a successful one 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.200
 driving through the Spitzkehre I drive with 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.780
 the front wheel the curve so far outside 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.940
 as possible and only tax from the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.399
 vertex of the curve the front wheel in 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.649
 the new direction is important because 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.960
 you are backing the way of the front wheel 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.240
 always abbreviates and otherwise at the curves 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.399
 inside hang naturally 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.590
 also influences the underground and the 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.560
 Obstacles decisive line selection in 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:37.210
 the sharp-end sweep puts the rear wheel in 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.460
 offset the pointed corner on the rear wheel 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.300
 I can go straight to the bend 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.940
 give in 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.640
 I'm looking for a point with me 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.399
 good traction where i use my front wheel 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.920
 The front brake can then block 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.679
 I jump out of my knee and knee 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.289
 as soon as my rear wheel in the air 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.080
 My hip goes into the new one 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.810
 direction that I reach through mine 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.250
 look the view should again far ahead 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.250
 go in the new direction
