00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.469 
off and when things are written off in
in<00:01:31.049> Melbourne<00:01:31.530> Australia<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.909> go<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> an

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
in Melbourne Australia they go to an

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
in Melbourne Australia they go to an
auction<00:01:33.990> place<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> was<00:01:35.880> auctioned<00:01:36.240> off<00:01:37.400> we

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
auction place so I was auctioned off we

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.370 
auction place so I was auctioned off we
went<00:01:38.549> cheap<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.180> obviously<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
went cheap so obviously because it

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.870 
went cheap so obviously because it
doesn't<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> register<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.759> not

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
doesn't have a register it's not

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690 
doesn't have a register it's not
registered<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.420> doesn't<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.890> indicators<00:01:43.890> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
registered it doesn't have indicators it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.210 
registered it doesn't have indicators it
looks<00:01:44.939> likely<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> being<00:01:45.600> crashed<00:01:46.220> obviously

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
looks likely to being crashed obviously

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.889 
looks likely to being crashed obviously
