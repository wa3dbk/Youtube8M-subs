00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.710 

divide<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> length<00:00:37.560> by<00:00:37.920> four<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.910> use<00:00:39.480> that

divide the length by four then use that

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.930 
divide the length by four then use that
measurement<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.560> space<00:00:40.860> out<00:00:41.130> four<00:00:41.489> vertical

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
slits this list should be about three

00:00:44.790 --> 00:01:09.260 
slits this list should be about three
inches<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.390> length

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.569 

now<00:01:09.930> we'll<00:01:10.140> round<00:01:10.380> off<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> corners<00:01:10.799> while

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
now we'll round off the corners while

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.090 
now we'll round off the corners while
leaving<00:01:11.820> points<00:01:12.360> at<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.780> top<00:01:12.990> your<00:01:13.740> sweater

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
take one of your middle points and sew

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.220 
take one of your middle points and sew
it<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.430> an<00:01:41.520> adjacent<00:01:42.030> point<00:01:42.300> right<00:01:42.870> sides

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
it to an adjacent point right sides

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.830 
it to an adjacent point right sides
together<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.950> other<00:01:44.850> words<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.540> should<00:01:45.570> be

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
together in other words you should be

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.720 
together in other words you should be
looking<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.440> inside<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> sweater<00:01:47.550> as

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
looking at the inside of the sweater as

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.330 
looking at the inside of the sweater as
you<00:01:48.090> sell<00:01:48.530> sew<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.800> to<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.160> top<00:01:50.370> of<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.820> point

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
you sell sew up to the top of the point

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.800 
you sell sew up to the top of the point
this<00:01:53.340> would<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.730> a<00:01:53.760> good<00:01:54.030> project<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.540> use<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this would be a good project to use a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.990 
this would be a good project to use a
serger<00:01:55.260> on<00:01:55.410> but<00:01:56.010> since<00:01:56.190> I<00:01:56.280> don't<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.820> I'm

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
serger on but since I don't have one I'm

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.360 
serger on but since I don't have one I'm
using<00:01:57.240> an<00:01:57.450> overcast<00:01:57.930> stitch<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.070> also

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
using an overcast stitch you can also

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.520 
using an overcast stitch you can also
use<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.940> zig<00:02:00.180> zag<00:02:00.210> stitch

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.820 

now<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.060> next<00:02:07.270> pointed<00:02:07.750> panel<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.679> one

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
now so the next pointed panel to the one

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.490 
now so the next pointed panel to the one
you<00:02:08.950> just<00:02:09.160> finish<00:02:09.490> selling<00:02:09.720> again<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.260> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
you just finish selling again so to the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.420 
you just finish selling again so to the
top<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.070> plate

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.830 

returned<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.790> first<00:02:20.060> point<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.599> sewed

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
returned to that first point you sewed

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.050 
returned to that first point you sewed
and<00:02:21.080> will<00:02:21.680> attach<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.220> point<00:02:22.489> on<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.879> other

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
and will attach the point on the other

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:38.420 
and will attach the point on the other
side

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.240

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
on the stud so this last point to the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.500 
on the stud so this last point to the
others

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.170 

finally<00:02:46.510> we'll<00:02:46.840> sew<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.260> two<00:02:47.440> sides<00:02:47.739> together

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
finally we'll sew the two sides together

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.760 
finally we'll sew the two sides together
