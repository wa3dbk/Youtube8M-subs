rift support a lot of people are asking

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.680 
rift support a lot of people are asking
like<00:04:03.130> well<00:04:03.340> why<00:04:03.730> aren't<00:04:03.970> there<00:04:04.150> more<00:04:04.180> games<00:04:04.510> on

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
like well why aren't there more games on

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.240 
like well why aren't there more games on
this<00:04:04.810> list<00:04:04.870> because<00:04:05.320> we<00:04:05.470> know<00:04:05.799> that<00:04:05.830> there<00:04:06.220> are

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
this list because we know that there are

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.009 
this list because we know that there are
more<00:04:06.519> games<00:04:06.850> that<00:04:07.120> have<00:04:07.299> virtual<00:04:07.630> reality

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
more games that have virtual reality

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.170 
more games that have virtual reality
support<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:09.070> think<00:04:09.280> basically<00:04:09.489> it's<00:04:09.940> just

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
support and I think basically it's just

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.670 
support and I think basically it's just
the<00:04:10.299> games<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.720> are<00:04:10.840> on<00:04:11.049> there<00:04:11.230> right<00:04:11.410> now

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
the games that are on there right now

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.620

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
that have a proven good virtual reality

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.810 
that have a proven good virtual reality
system<00:04:20.950> they're<00:04:21.130> not<00:04:21.280> ones<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.609> are<00:04:21.789> still

sort of list is able to be populated at
this<00:04:28.110> point<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:29.280> fact<00:04:29.520> that<00:04:29.669> we<00:04:29.880> don't<00:04:30.120> have<00:04:30.510> a

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
this point the fact that we don't have a

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.520 
this point the fact that we don't have a

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
can get an oculus rift not everybody has

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.950 
can get an oculus rift not everybody has
an<00:04:42.840> oculus<00:04:43.230> rift<00:04:43.440> so<00:04:44.100> it's<00:04:44.639> it's<00:04:45.600> interesting

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960
