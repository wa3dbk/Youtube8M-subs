00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.930
 ramallah 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.269
 but and 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.920
 Let's get to the sco los angeles 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.120
 that means a few must haves the 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.829
 roaming should have it 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.780
 For me it is definitely one 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.670
 I always have one in the hand cream 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.769
 my bag is from la vera and 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.450
 so you can always between in there 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.040
 for example, if you have a long time or 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.290
 that is also very good at living 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.599
 Just listen and cream your hands 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.790
 the year must have for school 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.349
 definitely a dry shampoo and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.879
 if you are not so fresh 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.170
 and your hair just a little 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.180
 bit fat or even one 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.170
 It can really be a long school day 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.060
 to be lifesaver 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.629
 especially in such a small packaging 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.299
 and julia is sure to find a hand 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.849
 or lip cream should always be there 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:36.219
 eg you are here from nivea thus you are 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:40.739
 always well groomed and now I show 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:40.739

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.959

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.180
 bought at h &amp; m and my line battery 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.230
 is a little bit longer from h &amp; m 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.230
 I think that's very cool 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.500
 behind 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.810
 and I have mine very easily 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.430
 brought nothing complicated 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.350
 just so that the hair is out of the way 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.290

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.530
