the core if you have a lot of elixir

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.620 
the core if you have a lot of elixir
vice<00:01:40.229> versa<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.310> CC<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.210> pretty<00:01:42.509> much

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630

vice versa the CC is pretty much
unlivable<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.619> basically<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.189> to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
unlivable so basically they have to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.090 
unlivable so basically they have to
enter<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> base<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.320> CC<00:01:46.710> out<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
enter the base to get your CC out and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.389 
enter the base to get your CC out and
you<00:01:47.549> got<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> couple<00:01:47.990> double<00:01:48.990> bombs<00:01:49.399> double

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you got a couple double bombs double

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
you got a couple double bombs double
bond<00:01:50.549> double<00:01:50.880> bomb<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.479> could<00:01:51.689> change<00:01:51.899> those

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
bond double bomb you could change those

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.569 
bond double bomb you could change those
around<00:01:52.380> there's<00:01:52.649> multiple<00:01:53.040> different<00:01:53.189> spots

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
around there's multiple different spots

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.999 
around there's multiple different spots
and<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.360> put<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> dark<00:01:54.869> elixir<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.619> snuck

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
and we put the dark elixir kind of snuck

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.139 
and we put the dark elixir kind of snuck
us<00:01:56.310> tucked<00:01:57.090> away<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:59.159> barge<00:01:59.729> attack

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
us tucked away so that if a barge attack

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.359 
us tucked away so that if a barge attack
comes<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.810> know<00:02:00.960> you'll<00:02:01.170> hit<00:02:01.320> it'll<00:02:01.770> meet

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
comes you know you'll hit it'll meet

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.160 
comes you know you'll hit it'll meet
some<00:02:02.640> bombs<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:03.689> have<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.049> in

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
some bombs as if they have to get in

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.050 
some bombs as if they have to get in
that<00:02:04.350> way<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.979> that's<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.280> nice<00:02:05.490> feature<00:02:05.759> in

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
that way so that's a nice feature in

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.600 
that way so that's a nice feature in
this<00:02:06.210> base<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.079> like<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.350> does<00:02:07.860> come

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
this base I really do like it does come

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.720 
this base I really do like it does come
out<00:02:08.640> well<00:02:09.319> now<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.979> speed<00:02:11.220> things<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.580> i'm

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
out well now to to speed things up i'm

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.460 
out well now to to speed things up i'm
going<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.940> show<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.060> my<00:02:12.270> war<00:02:12.480> base<00:02:12.720> this

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
going to show you my war base this

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.920 
going to show you my war base this
the<00:02:13.620> war<00:02:13.890> base<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.700> video<00:02:14.970> thank<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.780> for

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
the war base in the video thank you for

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.080 
the war base in the video thank you for
redoing<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.950> now<00:02:17.460> you'll<00:02:17.640> notice<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:18.060> couple

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
redoing it now you'll notice a couple

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.970 
redoing it now you'll notice a couple
things<00:02:18.480> about<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.900> war<00:02:19.140> based<00:02:19.410> there<00:02:19.710> it's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
things about this war based there it's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.610 
things about this war based there it's
very<00:02:20.430> interchangeable<00:02:20.730> with<00:02:21.570> my<00:02:21.780> traps<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.470> my

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
very interchangeable with my traps in my

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.210 
very interchangeable with my traps in my
Tesla's<00:02:23.130> which<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.720> much<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.380> loved<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.040> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
Tesla's which is so much I loved it so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.370 
Tesla's which is so much I loved it so
much<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.550> really<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.910> now<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> couple<00:02:28.200> things

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
much I really do now a couple things

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.020 
much I really do now a couple things
that<00:02:28.620> you'll<00:02:28.800> see<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.280> air<00:02:29.430> seeking<00:02:29.850> mines

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
that you'll see is the air seeking mines

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.810 
that you'll see is the air seeking mines
on<00:02:30.300> top<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> Aedes<00:02:31.460> because<00:02:32.460> basically

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
on top of the Aedes because basically

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.460 
on top of the Aedes because basically
the<00:02:33.120> only<00:02:33.210> thing<00:02:33.450> you're<00:02:33.570> protecting<00:02:34.050> if<00:02:34.200> they

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the only thing you're protecting if they

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.990 
the only thing you're protecting if they
want<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.890> hit<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.070> from<00:02:35.190> air<00:02:35.490> because<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.880> do

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
want to hit you from air because you do

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.240 
want to hit you from air because you do
have<00:02:36.030> three<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.900> got<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.200> kill<00:02:37.350> those<00:02:37.530> lava

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
have three you got to kill those lava

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.010 
have three you got to kill those lava
hounds<00:02:38.640> as<00:02:38.730> quick<00:02:39.210> as<00:02:39.360> possible<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.900> that's

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
hounds as quick as possible so that's

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.410 
hounds as quick as possible so that's
why<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> couple<00:02:40.980> black<00:02:41.730> minds<00:02:42.090> as

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
why you do have a couple black minds as

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.140 
why you do have a couple black minds as
close<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.900> ad<00:02:43.080> as<00:02:43.260> possible<00:02:43.770> now<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.880> air

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
close to the ad as possible now this air

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.480 
close to the ad as possible now this air
sweeper<00:02:45.660> does<00:02:45.990> protect<00:02:46.560> from<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.160> bottom

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
sweeper does protect from the bottom

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.280 
sweeper does protect from the bottom
down<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:47.940> when<00:02:48.060> they<00:02:48.150> try<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.420> get<00:02:48.600> at<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:49.050> air

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
down so when they try to get at this air

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.199 
down so when they try to get at this air
defense<00:02:49.709> they<00:02:49.980> get<00:02:50.160> pushed<00:02:50.370> away<00:02:50.550> or<00:02:50.940> if<00:02:51.090> they

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
defense they get pushed away or if they

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.030 
defense they get pushed away or if they
try<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.450> come<00:02:51.600> at<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.990> air<00:02:52.140> sweeper<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.800> kill

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
try to come at the air sweeper to kill

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.520 
try to come at the air sweeper to kill
it<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.940> protect<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.600> well<00:02:54.810> there<00:02:55.320> is

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
it it can protect that as well there is

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.750 
it it can protect that as well there is
a<00:02:55.560> little<00:02:55.800> bit<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.040> funneling<00:02:56.340> into<00:02:56.490> space

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
a little bit of funneling into space

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.850 
a little bit of funneling into space
which<00:02:56.970> works<00:02:57.209> out<00:02:57.390> nicely<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.020> then<00:02:58.650> but

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
which works out nicely and then but

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.740 
which works out nicely and then but
depending<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.459> work<00:02:59.700> what<00:03:00.000> area<00:03:00.390> they<00:03:00.540> come

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
depending on work what area they come

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.150 
depending on work what area they come
from<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:00.959> giant<00:03:01.380> bombs<00:03:01.500> will<00:03:01.680> get<00:03:01.800> popped<00:03:01.980> at

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
from the giant bombs will get popped at

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.150 
from the giant bombs will get popped at
all<00:03:02.280> times<00:03:02.520> now<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.209> will<00:03:03.690> this<00:03:04.500> will<00:03:04.860> this

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
all times now you will this will this

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.130 
all times now you will this will this
base<00:03:05.430> might<00:03:06.090> look<00:03:06.270> familiar<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.900> guys

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140

but<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.410> base<00:03:10.709> um<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.610> found<00:03:12.390> when<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.170> made

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
but this base um I found when I made

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.910 
but this base um I found when I made
this<00:03:13.650> base<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.250> works<00:03:14.580> out<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:15.000> well<00:03:15.150> I

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
this base it works out really well I

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.330 
this base it works out really well I
took<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.310> concept<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.630> four<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.739> the

way sometimes I'll put spring traps up
there<00:04:11.480> just<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.570> change<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.959> up<00:04:13.049> you'll<00:04:13.200> see<00:04:13.410> if

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
there just to change it up you'll see if

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.770 
there just to change it up you'll see if
I<00:04:13.680> why<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.190> have<00:04:14.459> spring<00:04:14.700> traps<00:04:14.940> here's<00:04:15.180> if<00:04:15.570> they

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
I why I have spring traps here's if they

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.750 
I why I have spring traps here's if they
wall<00:04:16.080> break<00:04:16.380> then<00:04:16.919> they<00:04:17.040> come<00:04:17.220> up<00:04:17.370> here<00:04:17.580> it's

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
wall break then they come up here it's

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.900 
wall break then they come up here it's
the<00:04:17.820> same<00:04:18.000> thing<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.390> gets<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:19.200> explodes<00:04:19.890> so<00:04:20.609> it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
the same thing it gets it explodes so it

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.610 
the same thing it gets it explodes so it
works<00:04:21.150> out<00:04:21.359> nicely<00:04:21.660> like<00:04:22.020> that<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:22.380> this<00:04:22.470> is

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
works out nicely like that so this is

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.770 
works out nicely like that so this is
just<00:04:22.770> something<00:04:23.250> for<00:04:23.640> 8.5<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.479> really

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
just something for 8.5 that I really

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.450 
just something for 8.5 that I really
wanted<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.080> stress<00:04:25.320> for<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:25.590> guys<00:04:25.770> because<00:04:26.340> a

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
farming base you bill what should my war

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.720 
farming base you bill what should my war
based<00:04:31.230> look<00:04:31.440> like<00:04:31.650> well<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.340> one

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
based look like well this is one

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.630 
based look like well this is one
variation<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.810> I<00:04:33.870> found<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.860> work<00:04:34.890> out<00:04:35.370> so

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
variation that I found to work out so

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.510 
variation that I found to work out so
nicely<00:04:35.850> for<00:04:36.240> me<00:04:36.360> having<00:04:37.050> both<00:04:37.260> expose<00:04:37.890> is<00:04:38.190> I

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
nicely for me having both expose is I

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.390 
nicely for me having both expose is I
think<00:04:38.580> it's<00:04:38.940> more<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:39.960> benefit<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:40.470> 8.5<00:04:41.100> and

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
think it's more of a benefit to 8.5 and

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.100 
think it's more of a benefit to 8.5 and
