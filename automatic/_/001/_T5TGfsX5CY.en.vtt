 Alba comes by his meanwhile government 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.740
 the Transformer in the middle of the egg 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.209
 there are in certain 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.359
 shops 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.099
 "They certainly do not have any copies of them, they just patterns 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.310
 Example Hello Kitty Uder 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.279
 Tinkerbell or 8 he noticed almost every Kiesow Lackas I think there is 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.099
 also 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.099
 yes, and there are Transformers too 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.060
 As you know it so this surprise eggs is panning box 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.080
 thrown over with lecturers 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.020
 Knight Tebbe from this part 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.370
 the egg is her blue one 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.300
 According to the search, they did not find Borghorst 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.890
 per square meter 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.530
 a lot of time left 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.720
 Split times 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.530
 or no, everyone on it is here 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.990
 12 and I have all complete 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.380

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.789
 Percent of BP 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.600
 the romance but not Peter Sanders behind what is behind it 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.580
 the format third place of us could be scarce 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.400
 Heiligs z 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.090
 there it is probably one percent a legal variant than usual 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.510
 After all, not at all - and that at every election is the license at Astro 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.510
 yes not really bought the license and you can see that too 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.650
 I can give you the topic now 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.950
 No No the cameras will disappear 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.240
 do not enjoy it that way 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.140
 exactly when to pick 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.600
 Bremen's mayor and there are just try it 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.850
 Optimus element 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.860
 especially Harald Optimus Prime IndyMac he was dead 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.350
 and I know how Ringier Bobic sees all of them in part 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.400
 Trimester not imagine that here are two small points in it 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.060
 represent the headlights 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.100
 the Turks of Greens separately in addition veiled Kraus 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 sees a black line while there are three black lines 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.450
 and that's about mim quantities 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.440
 the partly 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.610
 inside for this backdrop 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.150
 You can also frame the feet so 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.440
 that's amazing 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.150
 Cornelia Mitschka m 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.880
 3 para 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.349
 Colombia 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.349
 again 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.019
 also here systemd 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.439
 clearly he probably does not see anything in his head that really 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.680
 the outside view and also the mask where the eyes are pretty much in Lions 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.049
 trouble for the muslims 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.079
 because of a bit 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.829
 can make bigger 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.579
 nevertheless with the partly insane also during the execution the 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.449
 Paintings like that 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.189
 and already madness 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.189
 So we've got Dirk in 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:47.359
 we notice that among these we have read all the figures 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:48.659
 such topic is 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.370
 that only the bottom 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.370
 to transform the Autobots 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.809
 and they are also more or less blind complete francs 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.749
 SuS initially team Paltrow 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.749
 Optimist especially the castles parquet 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.270
 I said I find 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.209
 these parts 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.209
 true to the insane 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:19.739
 what he dead the plastic is not it can not be 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.379
 good quality 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.169
 I mean only that for now 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.199
 like this 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:32.259
 over copy of itself the tracks whether quiet touch Steinach scene stable so 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.830
 nice off 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.059
 it is for tenants with figures 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.059
 where they admit a few times 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.629
 even at over 10 that heats 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.480
 the face is not quite as good for me but who does not me 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.839
 giving tired is almost impossible 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.779
 but his 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.779
 Pushed the vehicle 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.749
 it's just time 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.939
 But Mesut will be like 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.099
 his robot shape 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.939
 where Obama wants to have to admit she is satisfied 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.829
 I do not know anymore variants of bombardiers now 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.830
 Williamson previously painted with her eyes, not quite the eyes 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.870
 You also get a bit of high choke sperm from a PR 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.630
 can happen when i exercise i have to work for days now 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.029
 the hand painted verso 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:39.779
 filigree red 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.779
 Galler Festspiele Mirco not crazy 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.919
 especially what I also noticed even that they do not de 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.889
 is he front seats the consoles Wulff hopes or easter otherwise 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.889
 stunned managed 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.309
 another time it is not that it is me 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.400
 Trau Flyers 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.729
 the car to the boat 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.009
 Recall even that tests the consumer culture 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.009
 Nolle at so 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.809
 yes what should I do and not 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:15.809
 me very solid thing so 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.870
 I do not want to say that Transpromo had to deny it 

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:21.270
 Not 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.520
 I think it's a cool thing "It should be already Kuppenheim 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.479
 Andersen still gets somewhere 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.380
 around 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.380
 I know and Kellan Lutz not so easy 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.199
 Obama 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.960
 Although one sees oneself there permanently Brandenburg it pulls there's the Merkur 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.520
 the wise 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.050
 you just have to go 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.349
 Cotendo's time with you 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.349
 Mandy Lane got it through Frost tour guide 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.120
 scans hard while it becomes impossible but no 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.860
 as I said all matches Wacker is always Striebich so percent yes that 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.719
 Right 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.979
 as the complete series complete 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.979
 Alheit to get all the figures completely is unnatural 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.629
 At least that's almost impossible 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.719
 it was like that for me two 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.629
 Figures Echtz until the end 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:13.909
 If you need nerves I've gone mad 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.949
 this was a gang of beast percent 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.360
 auto-mode 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.750
 Does this live a small minor Transformer variant 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.699
 rather not the last one 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.249
 Allah makes you ten times like that 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:33.499
 but the two agreed that Gutach had complete 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:36.499
 not so easy 

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:42.689
 Minute for the one I have to I grade it to the whole thing when you have it 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.050
 she has complete 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.050
 Classic effort around 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.270
 In terms of money, it was not quite 50 cents plus minus through teams 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.270
 no idea what costs him as abnormal costs 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.439
 now well over the terrace evening test 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.689
 except not-op from all applicants gets by no note I have to place 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:08.659
 listen now for only the little ones at two but never get in the way 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:10.050
 stand otherwise 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.639
 not all live here is stable 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.349
 the bike can 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:16.669
 to stand up 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.680
 more does not work 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.979
 actually it should be through Kadir parents with stroller 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:25.729
 the thing is her dear the rest there 

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:28.980
 Preview researchers this little how 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.749
 Heaven fallen 

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:33.749
 "I was not spared with this bad joke 

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:35.479
 Contactor until then
