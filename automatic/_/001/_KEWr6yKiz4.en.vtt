they<00:00:30.929> take<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.650> scientists<00:00:32.189> take<00:00:32.340> electrodes

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
they take the scientists take electrodes

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.420 
they take the scientists take electrodes
and<00:00:33.590> what<00:00:34.590> do<00:00:34.649> they<00:00:34.770> do<00:00:34.829> with<00:00:35.100> them<00:00:35.250> they

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and what do they do with them they

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.330 
and what do they do with them they
implant<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:35.969> where<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:37.070> sounds<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.160> they

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
implant them where it sounds like they

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
implant them where it sounds like they
plant<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> electrodes<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.570> brain<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.440> in

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
plant the electrodes in the brain and in

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.740 
plant the electrodes in the brain and in
the<00:00:40.620> muscles<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.219> kind<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.120> attached<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the muscles and kind of attached to the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.740 
the muscles and kind of attached to the
back<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.590> beetle<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.510> little<00:00:45.510> radio

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
back of the beetle as a little radio

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.680 
back of the beetle as a little radio
transmitter<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.649> scientist<00:00:47.690> standing

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
transmitter and the scientist standing

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.270 
transmitter and the scientist standing
off<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> side<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> remote<00:00:49.860> controller

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
off to the side with a remote controller

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.970 
off to the side with a remote controller
can<00:00:50.550> tell<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.360> fly<00:00:51.539> left<00:00:51.809> fly<00:00:52.260> right<00:00:52.500> fly<00:00:52.800> up

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
can tell it to fly left fly right fly up

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
can tell it to fly left fly right fly up
fly<00:00:53.190> down<00:00:53.520> everything<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.539> yeah

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
fly down everything like that yeah

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.439 
fly down everything like that yeah
takeoff<00:00:55.320> landing<00:00:55.829> turns<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.940> mean<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.270> really

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
takeoff landing turns I mean it's really

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.709 
takeoff landing turns I mean it's really
incredible<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:59.039> can<00:01:00.000> they<00:01:00.030> control<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
incredible can can they control the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.020 
incredible can can they control the
Beatles<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> beetle<00:01:02.039> performs<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
Beatles so that the beetle performs in a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
Beatles so that the beetle performs in a
way<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:04.019> otherwise<00:01:04.549> perform

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
way that it would not otherwise perform

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.859 
way that it would not otherwise perform
for<00:01:05.850> example<00:01:06.330> sustained<00:01:06.960> flight<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:09.570> sounds

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
for example sustained flight it sounds

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.210 
for example sustained flight it sounds
like<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.080> mean<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> beetle<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:10.979> still

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
like I mean I think the beetle is still

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
like I mean I think the beetle is still
limited<00:01:11.430> by<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.570> he<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.590> by

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
limited by what he can what if by

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890 
limited by what he can what if by
physics<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.850> can't<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
physics what it can and can't do but it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.690 
physics what it can and can't do but it
sounds<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.229> these<00:01:16.590> electrodes<00:01:17.040> would<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
sounds like these electrodes would it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.149 
sounds like these electrodes would it
pretty<00:01:17.970> much<00:01:18.090> overtakes<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.619> Beatles<00:01:19.890> free

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
pretty much overtakes the Beatles free

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.740 
pretty much overtakes the Beatles free
will<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.610> people<00:01:20.880> about<00:01:21.119> where<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.420> wants<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
will if people about where it wants to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.710 
will if people about where it wants to
go<00:01:21.869> yeah<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:23.850> wondering<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.420> what

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
go yeah so what I'm wondering is what

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.469 
go yeah so what I'm wondering is what
are<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> potential<00:01:25.320> military<00:01:25.950> uses<00:01:26.939> how<00:01:27.330> can

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
are the potential military uses how can

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.289 
are the potential military uses how can
we<00:01:27.570> use<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.409> our<00:01:28.439> advantage<00:01:29.270> well<00:01:30.270> I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
we use this to our advantage well I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
we use this to our advantage well I
think<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.750> far<00:01:31.350> away<00:01:31.380> off<00:01:31.710> from<00:01:31.950> uh<00:01:32.130> from

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
think it's so far away off from uh from

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.679 
think it's so far away off from uh from
the<00:01:32.400> battlefield<00:01:32.850> right<00:01:33.030> now<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.270> project

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the battlefield right now this project

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
the battlefield right now this project
is<00:01:33.780> being<00:01:33.990> funded<00:01:34.259> through<00:01:34.500> DARPA<00:01:35.009> which<00:01:35.189> is

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
is being funded through DARPA which is

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
is being funded through DARPA which is

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
kind of the pentagon's research and

project<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.210> darkest<00:01:48.869> website<00:01:49.229> they<00:01:50.130> talked

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
project on darkest website they talked

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.710 
project on darkest website they talked
about<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.759> possibility<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.210> implanting

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
about the possibility of implanting

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.840 
about the possibility of implanting
maybe<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.409> microphone<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> chemical

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
maybe a microphone on it or a chemical

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.639 
maybe a microphone on it or a chemical
sensor<00:01:54.210> right<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.140> see<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.530> kind

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
sensor right they really see this kind

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.560 
sensor right they really see this kind
of<00:01:55.740> as<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> next<00:01:56.460> step<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.820> evolution<00:01:56.969> between

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
of as the next step in evolution between

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.620 
of as the next step in evolution between
human<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.409> animal<00:01:59.299> cooperation<00:02:00.299> really<00:02:00.600> I

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
human and animal cooperation really I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.420 
human and animal cooperation really I
mean<00:02:00.810> they<00:02:00.960> reference<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> horse<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.189> buggy

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
mean they reference the horse and buggy

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.350 
mean they reference the horse and buggy
and<00:02:02.729> maybe<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.740> bird<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.399> coal<00:02:05.610> mine<00:02:05.640> yeah

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
and maybe you a bird in a coal mine yeah

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.690 
and maybe you a bird in a coal mine yeah
I<00:02:06.390> mean<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.899> could<00:02:07.200> implant<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.890> microphone<00:02:08.369> on

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
I mean you could implant a microphone on

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.020 
I mean you could implant a microphone on
a<00:02:08.780> beetle<00:02:09.780> fly<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.200> into<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:11.030> suspected

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
a beetle fly it into a suspected

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.370 
a beetle fly it into a suspected
terrorists

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
terrorists

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.370 
terrorists
an<00:02:13.590> enemy's<00:02:14.040> location<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.360> simply<00:02:15.750> listen<00:02:16.230> in

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
an enemy's location and simply listen in

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.020 
an enemy's location and simply listen in
on<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.590> conversations<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> planned

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
on the conversations and the planned

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.950 
on the conversations and the planned
attacks<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.690> amazing<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.500> they<00:02:19.800> never<00:02:19.980> know

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
attacks it's amazing and they never know

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.570 
attacks it's amazing and they never know
absolutely<00:02:21.960> right<00:02:22.590> let<00:02:23.010> me<00:02:23.100> ask<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.460> about

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
absolutely right let me ask you about

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.450 
absolutely right let me ask you about
human<00:02:24.210> applications<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.320> mean<00:02:25.500> someday<00:02:25.860> might

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
human applications I mean someday might

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.190 
human applications I mean someday might
they<00:02:26.810> might<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:27.870> use<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.950> human<00:02:29.400> beings

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
they might they use this on human beings

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.690 
they might they use this on human beings
well<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.220> they're<00:02:32.310> quite<00:02:32.460> ready

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
well I don't think they're quite ready

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.180 
well I don't think they're quite ready
to<00:02:32.820> say<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.150> yet<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.840> think<00:02:34.080> insect<00:02:34.950> brains

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
to say that yet I think insect brains

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.190 
to say that yet I think insect brains
are<00:02:35.370> Ted<00:02:35.700> simpler<00:02:36.360> than<00:02:36.480> humans<00:02:36.900> or<00:02:37.020> at<00:02:37.080> least

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
are Ted simpler than humans or at least

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.030 
are Ted simpler than humans or at least
I<00:02:37.290> hope<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.930> budget<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.230> some<00:02:40.470> guests<00:02:40.890> we've

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
I hope so and budget I some guests we've

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.690 
I hope so and budget I some guests we've
had<00:02:41.340> oh<00:02:41.730> that's<00:02:42.660> true<00:02:43.130> go<00:02:44.130> ahead<00:02:44.310> but<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.640> think

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
had oh that's true go ahead but I think

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.070 
had oh that's true go ahead but I think
we're<00:02:44.970> still<00:02:45.150> await<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:45.750> we're<00:02:45.870> still<00:02:46.050> a

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
we're still await I think we're still a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.740 
we're still await I think we're still a
ways<00:02:46.140> off<00:02:46.530> before<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.820> maybe<00:02:48.030> applying

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
ways off before you know maybe applying

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.050 
ways off before you know maybe applying
certain<00:02:48.960> things<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.500> more<00:02:50.310> advanced<00:02:50.760> more

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
certain things to more advanced more

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.330 
certain things to more advanced more
veins<00:02:51.360> creatures<00:02:51.690> including<00:02:51.840> mammals<00:02:52.380> yeah<00:02:52.920> I

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
veins creatures including mammals yeah I

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.700 
veins creatures including mammals yeah I
mean<00:02:53.550> it's<00:02:53.670> really<00:02:54.210> pretty<00:02:54.540> incredible<00:02:55.230> I've

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
mean it's really pretty incredible I've

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.650 
mean it's really pretty incredible I've
also<00:02:55.920> been<00:02:56.190> reading<00:02:56.550> they<00:02:56.880> might<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.330> able<00:02:57.510> to

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
also been reading they might be able to

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.010 
also been reading they might be able to
use<00:02:57.960> these<00:02:58.440> as<00:02:58.680> couriers<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.940> get<00:03:00.630> information

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
use these as couriers to get information

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.100 
use these as couriers to get information
to<00:03:01.520> inaccessible<00:03:02.520> locations<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.930> that

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
to inaccessible locations that that

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.510 
to inaccessible locations that that
sounds<00:03:04.470> plausible<00:03:04.680> doesn't<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.340> oh

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
sounds plausible doesn't it oh

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.730 
sounds plausible doesn't it oh
absolutely<00:03:06.450> i<00:03:06.900> mean<00:03:06.960> if<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.290> think<00:03:07.320> about<00:03:07.560> it

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
absolutely i mean if you think about it

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.310 
absolutely i mean if you think about it
just<00:03:08.100> many<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.030> advances<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:10.050> flash

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
just many of the advances in on flash

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.990 
just many of the advances in on flash
drives<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:10.830> have<00:03:10.920> now<00:03:11.070> make<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.910> know

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
drives we have now make you know

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.330 
drives we have now make you know
gigabytes<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.660> storage<00:03:12.860> you<00:03:13.860> know<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.100> size

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
gigabytes of storage you know the size

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.280 
gigabytes of storage you know the size
of<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:15.000> coin<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.660> know<00:03:15.780> maybe<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.080> can

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
of a coin and you know maybe you can

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.190 
of a coin and you know maybe you can
tape<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.510> know<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.750> bottom<00:03:18.870> of

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
tape it to the you know the bottom of

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.620 
tape it to the you know the bottom of
one<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.470> these<00:03:19.650> bugs<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.280> fly<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:21.510> know

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
one of these bugs and fly it you know

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.330 
one of these bugs and fly it you know
somewhere<00:03:21.960> where<00:03:22.200> no<00:03:22.890> one<00:03:22.920> will<00:03:23.100> know<00:03:23.190> what's

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
somewhere where no one will know what's

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.970 
somewhere where no one will know what's
coming<00:03:23.580> yeah<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.510> ensure<00:03:25.260> release<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.800> is

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
coming yeah and ensure release of you is

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.160 
coming yeah and ensure release of you is

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
the Defense Department funding this how

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.530 
the Defense Department funding this how
does<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.530> work<00:03:29.120> yeah<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.240> Defense

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
does this work yeah the Defense

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.420 
does this work yeah the Defense
Department<00:03:30.990> has<00:03:31.170> like<00:03:31.860> said<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.100> research

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
Department has like said the research

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.920 
Department has like said the research
and<00:03:32.550> development<00:03:32.940> wing<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.150> called<00:03:33.360> DARPA<00:03:33.810> and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
and development wing is called DARPA and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.040 
and development wing is called DARPA and
they<00:03:34.710> give<00:03:35.220> grants<00:03:35.550> usually<00:03:35.820> for<00:03:36.060> for

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
they give grants usually for for

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.840 
they give grants usually for for
projects<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.530> last<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:37.980> few<00:03:38.160> years<00:03:38.580> but

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
projects that last just a few years but

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.580 
projects that last just a few years but
they<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.570> idea<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.020> just<00:03:40.380> kind<00:03:40.560> of
