 Dante emerged and was changing 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.719
 in the second round 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.739
 sometimes by placing the first in the second qualifying series of 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.109
 tourism remains

 the third qualifying series ever participation the green flag 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:21.800
 yes 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.299
 that will affect the last row 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.740
 with the local selection program that ran according to 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.289
 practically the same 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:29.909
 but quickly 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.809
 I wanted to go to the tail of Pablo Barrientos 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:34.729
 It is important to note that today 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.429
 tourism to 128 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.639
 that takes care of the rope very well 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.419
 Tehran the first 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.419
 the first round of this third series 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.020
 in the Shanghai circuit 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.950
 some first words when I opened my second 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.420
 we saw it to cristian venturini further back we see it also ap 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.159
 we do not reach marcelo lorenzo 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.139
 I was looking for it strictly imported sideways 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.139
 except April 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.409
 very good to walk in sucre 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.319
 a fiat 128 but Pablo bathrobe wrong to not be able 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.369
 there we will see what 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:17.739
 was delayed by the title chemically housing a difference Pablo Ávila 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.979
 we see that the conjuncture 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.419
 internal powder magazine half of 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.999
 is the pointer of the championship Herrón 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.860
 cyclically well and I want to take advantage of that situation 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.900
 and at the end of the main straight 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.949
 then yes the competition does not take off 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.840
 they call turin and go on to command the competition as we will see 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.259
 how are they going to go through bushehr's rent 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.129
 First 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.360
 Cristiam in Turin 2nd Pablo Angel 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.539
 3rd marcelo risso 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:46.550
 quarter 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.300
 the fifth deal sergio ferrero was the placement is 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.340
 Until now 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.550
 who commanded 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.699
 physically from when you chabás the local driver 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.630
 ginobili 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.370
 a good president for bad luck was never roof cities intently 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.229
 that seemed to be the getafe this second date but the defensive 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.540
 luck, despite the fact that he has the plus of chabás 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.540
 and its great handling 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.669
 made oscense what will happen to win makes very warm third series 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:18.979
 qualifying 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.979
 a fiat 128 came to be the fastest 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:26.580
 where the great final 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.900
 in the slowest series by the pilot of chabás 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.460
 that he won with a time of 5 minutes 36 seconds recently eight thousandths 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.069
 according 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.460
 why marcelo turned out to be a time fourth time opposes variety fifth 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.039
 sergio ferrero 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.089
 sixth 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:43.830
 fruit factory 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.599
 the debutante who had so much debutante theory on this seventh date 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.620
 7th March would be minimal 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.750
 8th carrillo frame and did not come 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.490
 when he got like that he urged without a lap time came when he drops the flag 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.240
 plaid winner cristian venture in the match-fixing won the third and 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.430
 last series 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.430
 the tourism remains them 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.369
 there is comparison with you in the images 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:21.079
 what were the three qualifying series of tourism fiat 128 in 

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:26.469
 the previous one was seen that was going away to dispute this seventh end a fascinating end 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.389
 with many 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.850
 that happened to him with many inconveniences all the pilots take out the pointer of the 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.490
 championship could not be of the game for this final to 15 laps norberto 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.300
 britos designs but that we will see in the next flight that in the last 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.319
 block of zonal track with the band are won 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.610
 so what is the worst on television that we are going to return with the 14 laps 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.580
 the final of tourism science 128 and the other the theory that we are going to cover in 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.319
 this stretch to today what will be the tc2000 santafesina continues to grow the band 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.389
 he does not miss that the ceo wet him more
