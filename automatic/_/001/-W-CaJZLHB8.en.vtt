00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.510
 so 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.280
 2 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.500
 the evil demo 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.779
 the woman must work for 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.349
 have to eat herself take herself in 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.750
 charge 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.130
 the woman must also take herself 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.160
 in charge to better deal with 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.160
 children 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.349
 it is not allowed in Ivory Coast 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.469
 that the woman makes cocoa in the country dida 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.610
 with us but I struggled to 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:39.270
 the woman of today is the earth and 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.270
 to take charge 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.570
 the candidate 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.809
 we have a lot of relationships we got 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.760
 relationships with styles and or to 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.350
 get them on a mission to see as 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.859
 actor and the college and in relation to their 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.469
 job 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.960
 it encouraged us a lot and 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:07.060
 today we have a lot of ideas 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.970
 on cocoa coffee work in our 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.729
 southern region in the hand she is the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.850
 first woman chaos in front of all 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.100
 women who created an association that has 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.649
 undermined women to work 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.549
 all women had the courage to 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.549
 get to work 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.369
 I started again introduced women 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.479
 saying because I was with the yellow 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.860
 when it 's not going to work they have me 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.689
 abandoned the cooperative 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.119
 when I come like that we'll see 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.590
 do you have to atari so share the 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.580
 partition 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.180
 but I'm a little bit of 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.210
 we see that in the future we will be 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.120
 happy because it's something 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.100
 who even keeps us boys 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.330
 beat you are it's in our 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.430
 association we see cocoa and this 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.880
 gives us to publish free of charge 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.540
 nestle made a plan of plants there is 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.460
 we followed that so I do not know if 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.130
 I could find we will do it 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.480
 extraordinary because this word to 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.290
 those who characterize it is first of all 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.480
 his truly agate courage he is 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.880
 the most extraordinary because 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.810
 go against a woman who had the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.620
 courage to go to the whole region of 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.140
 kivu go explain to men that he 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.220
 is needed as unworthy to women 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.990
 economical activities 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.930
 see, it's a woman who is 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.770
 strongly committed highly motivated and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.720
 in fact there is a capacity 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.720
 extraordinary organization
