00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.590
 you will now follow to evaluate your 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.690
 number 28 staying on the top drive and video of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.690
 today is jetta highline ts 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.340
 inside the gts and can see that the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.320
 even inside the jetta comfortline who 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.700
 already tested this because jetta 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.489
 comfortline that we thought that 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.230
 day was with the exclusive package ie the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.949
 top line package 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.650
 the jec has the gps here in the middle will have a 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.640
 screen is a bit different maybe even 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.410
 slightly smaller 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.330
 I really like the screen much bigger 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.729
 I do not understand why Volkswagen 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.430
 top line version that has a gps 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.409
 make a smaller screen should be for sure 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.400
 in fact for the sake of 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.990
 costs 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.090
 so if I can within that 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.420
 way here it is identical to jetta 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.000
 comfortline but we will limit more 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.760
 the differences it with them where the purchase 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.170
 online starting here in dsg exchange 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.680
 that actually makes a difference 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.369
 gigantic in on performance in that car 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.280
 and in addition the sunroof and wheels rim 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.799
 17 cars could see in the picture now 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.770
 and the two pipes are going to be 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.570
 taken to win those fine cannes 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.609
 and you can not tell from the jetta 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.409
 comfortline in this video we go 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.060
 show all the internal parts that are 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.640
 exactly the same as the jetta comfortline 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.439
 because we want to focus more on the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.590
 performance of the skal wanted him to have a 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.409
 other engine the 2.0 turbo engine and if it is 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.659
 a totally different car 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.939
 today not only think of the day tse 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.219
 India tested this but comfortline 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.719
 just for you to see what a 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.840
 another completely different car 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.520
 when equipped with this motor the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.420
 motor 2.0 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.420
 showed the 28 goals in its territory 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.470
 or that car that gives sleep too 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.239
 here the video 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.879
 j comfortline with that engine 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.459
 exceeded noisy exchange of eight 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.290
 valve can not take a goal or 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.299
 You can not even compare it with this one. 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.810
 car turns through despite 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.220
 inside them it's very similar 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.959
 equality another very positive point of 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.340
 which, in addition to changing the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.410
 marches too fast 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.180
 he accepts any reduction what is the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.040
 time to accept very well the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.110
 driver 's commands is that many do not 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.150
 automatic and stay working on reffis 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.190
 which is reduced as it is button in 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.099
 third now to win the second 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.709
 followed and first he also signs the 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.110
 Even though he already has five books, he looks at it. 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.700
 accept all that production there 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.150
 makes it much easier to work with 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.670
 he not even here in the sport he 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.069
 expects almost 7 thousand spins from the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.940
 even if the 6 from 6 g6 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.799
 red 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.810
 so there are characteristics that 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.120
 also leave it is very good to 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.829
 work with the car be it work 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.190
 very well with this engine contemplated us 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:19.430
 ezequiel gino 2014 and is testing it 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.319
 precisely because of the fact that jetta 2015 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.549
 this new arrived he kept this engine 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.829
 2.0 turbo 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.900
 what will change will be the 2.0 engine 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.760
 aspirated and if exceeded 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.950
 Those who have already tested it will actually go 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.709
 start seeing with 1.4 turbo engine 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.440
 then how this game was kept by the way 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.389
 in the video is the following made the plane jetta 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.519
 b which were only aesthetic changes 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.200
 here in the interior mainly only 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.450
 that the legal direction of the 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.410
 golf to the little screen also gives a little 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.340
 different 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.730
 the back too 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.440
 and a little of the lights but the question 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.090
 of mechanics is the same 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.430
 and this car here is a reference in 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.590
 sportiness or is it the perfect car 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.569
 that father of a family who likes to 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.319
 speed up the car and press 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.049
 even eliana more or equal to 3 1.8 turbo 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.269
 which has expanded in the selection and 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.549
 complement the interior of the jetta 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.650
 first can see this big screen of it 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.199
 dual zone air conditioning 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.180
 of the automatic headlights is a shame that 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.430
 This one she 's testing he does not have 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.740
 leds have one thing turns guy 's face 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.810
 car I think it makes a lot of difference 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.810
 When the jetta gets angry, it seems 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.229
 an even more expensive car but he was a 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.450
 package is one below that led item that already 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.160
 comes with sunroof and wheels that goes 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.780
 transferring the stuck over the wheel 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.490
 cool than highline the price of 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.590
 cigarette is 93 1990 from of course 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.320
 that packets when it is complete 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.930
 will go from 100 thousand reais but it compensates 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.050
 really do not doubt it here at 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.930
 Instead of the plate 2 10 because the difference and 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.520
 driving is even difficult to explain 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.350
 there are none that doubted performance 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.389
 monthly that surprised from the moment 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.490
 that I gained scale that although already 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.130
 It will be very well he does not spend on gasoline 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.260
 How much did you expect to get in town? 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.660
 served well let's go with the liter while 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.490
 the stay in the house of the subjects 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.590
 politicians then president askar the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.780
 he does not spend Brazilian joy 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.030
 also some jetta 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.700
 six air bags and passes the feeling of being 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.500
 more stable than jetta comfortline is 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.900
 Of course I already checked it used to 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.490
 come with the torsion axis situation and 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.520
 now there is an equal expansion of 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.840
 highline independent situation but I 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.910
 I think the feeling of greater 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.039
 instability must be rainy 17 and 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.389
 tax which is equipped with door but 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.280
 as we had already spoken in a 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.590
 another jetta video also the point 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.400
 510 liters and is one of the largest 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.229
 luggage carrier of category 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.600
 another thing that is a strong point 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.190
 is the sound of it is a strong point of the 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.620
 Volkswagen in general 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.050
 despite notorious and not so good for 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.150
 her category but the project is very 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.340
 good for his category including not 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.280
 It does not even compare to the c4 sound 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:04.889
 Whoever tested Alisson did not want to 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.639
 to the sound of strong dj helton no doubt 12 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.639
 13 and was 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:19.290
 the day has 53 and authorize that sasha 10 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.780
 so it was pretty impressive right? 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.870
 I also hoped it would be up to 76 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.090
 out there but with a street factory 7.3 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.140
 in this house and we will make a 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.360
 timer that is not yet the 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.010
 professional that the android iphone is 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.780
 of course it 's to be a little below 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.240
 but even so I did not expect this 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.650
 without the same three takes all of them 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.180
 were down 7 seconds 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.640
 so I was here so fast 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.790
 You can even see that, I 'm sure. 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.350
 I'm going to wait for a sedan for the family below. 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.970
 six thousand reais has no doubt 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.950
 such japan airlines cal me 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.750
 was very impressed with the intention of 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.760
 video then follow our channel that all 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.470
 boys that even appear new 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.570
 on Sunday that anger is going to have a 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.730
 special release version 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.730
 here in brazil he is worth it
