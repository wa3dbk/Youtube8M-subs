was<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.329> over<00:00:39.629> 1<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> black<00:00:40.920> ops<00:00:41.190> 2<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.790> was

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
was just over 1 and black ops 2 it was

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.229 
was just over 1 and black ops 2 it was
about<00:00:42.149> 1.4<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.770> great<00:00:43.890> stats<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.969> too

into a late game with little to no
chance<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.879> turning<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.270> around<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:55.079> gonna

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
chance of turning it around it's gonna

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
chance of turning it around it's gonna
be<00:00:55.440> an<00:00:55.530> instant<00:00:55.890> loss<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.340> how<00:00:56.789> many<00:00:56.850> games

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
be an instant loss so how many games

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.660 
be an instant loss so how many games
have<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.510> joined<00:00:57.989> where<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> spawn<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.520> and

getting wrecked from air support so in

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.130 
getting wrecked from air support so in
my<00:02:30.610> opinion<00:02:30.730> players<00:02:31.390> would<00:02:31.570> just<00:02:31.720> simply<00:02:31.900> not

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
my opinion players would just simply not

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.590 
my opinion players would just simply not
pick<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:32.620> option<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:33.550> here<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.360> how<00:02:34.570> I

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
pick this option so here is how I

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.300 
pick this option so here is how I
personally<00:02:35.290> think<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.590> win-loss<00:02:35.980> should<00:02:36.190> be

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
personally think the win-loss should be

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.700 
personally think the win-loss should be
corrected<00:02:36.490> to<00:02:37.300> show<00:02:37.480> more<00:02:37.870> inaccurate<00:02:38.170> step

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
corrected to show more inaccurate step

as I said lobbies need to be filled so
the<00:02:41.680> game<00:02:41.860> should<00:02:42.070> just<00:02:42.280> continue<00:02:42.460> as<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.000> is

game where you have no hope of winning I
do<00:03:16.660> only<00:03:17.350> think<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.739> should<00:03:17.920> be<00:03:17.950> win-loss<00:03:18.489> that

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
do only think it should be win-loss that

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.180 
do only think it should be win-loss that
counts<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.150> not<00:03:19.420> kvr<00:03:19.989> reason<00:03:20.800> being<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.160> that

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
counts and not kvr reason being is that

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.220 
counts and not kvr reason being is that
if<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.580> did<00:03:21.730> not<00:03:21.910> count<00:03:22.120> people<00:03:22.870> would<00:03:23.020> join

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
if it did not count people would join

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.199 
if it did not count people would join

session in progress just to boost as it

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.850 
session in progress just to boost as it

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
well let's be honest there is going to

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.050 
well let's be honest there is going to
be<00:03:29.050> boosters<00:03:29.560> in<00:03:29.709> every<00:03:30.130> single<00:03:30.459> call<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:30.820> duty

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
be boosters in every single call of duty

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.080 
be boosters in every single call of duty
game<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.570> did<00:03:32.500> them<00:03:32.770> I<00:03:32.980> did<00:03:33.400> originally<00:03:33.940> have

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
game I did them I did originally have

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.210 
game I did them I did originally have
the<00:03:34.209> idea<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.660> KD<00:03:34.959> not<00:03:35.230> counting<00:03:35.650> however<00:03:35.890> but

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
the idea of KD not counting however but

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.610 
the idea of KD not counting however but
I<00:03:36.430> mean<00:03:37.120> because<00:03:37.540> why<00:03:37.840> should<00:03:37.870> someone<00:03:38.320> join

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
I mean because why should someone join

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.960 
I mean because why should someone join
the<00:03:38.709> late<00:03:38.860> game<00:03:39.130> always<00:03:39.310> get<00:03:39.580> destroyed<00:03:39.910> by

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
the late game always get destroyed by

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.060 
the late game always get destroyed by
air<00:03:40.300> support<00:03:40.720> but<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.260> thought<00:03:41.590> about<00:03:41.800> it<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.040> bit

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
air support but I thought about it a bit

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.220 
air support but I thought about it a bit
more<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.730> how<00:03:43.120> many<00:03:43.180> people<00:03:43.660> were<00:03:43.780> joining

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
more and how many people were joining

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.560 
more and how many people were joining
and<00:03:44.410> troll<00:03:44.860> die<00:03:45.310> on<00:03:45.489> purpose<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.450> enemy

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
and troll die on purpose that the enemy

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.449 
and troll die on purpose that the enemy
get<00:03:46.900> streaks<00:03:47.200> boost<00:03:47.560> for<00:03:47.709> titles<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.310> emblems

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
get streaks boost for titles and emblems

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.180 
get streaks boost for titles and emblems
so<00:03:49.390> boosted<00:03:49.840> gameplays<00:03:50.440> would<00:03:50.620> be<00:03:50.739> worse<00:03:50.980> than

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
so boosted gameplays would be worse than

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.280 
so boosted gameplays would be worse than
ever<00:03:51.370> on<00:03:51.550> YouTube<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:52.330> because<00:03:52.959> of<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.140> way

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
ever on YouTube but because of the way

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.870 
ever on YouTube but because of the way
the<00:03:53.440> windows<00:03:53.770> system<00:03:54.130> would<00:03:54.250> work<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.790> would

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
the windows system would work you would

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.120 
the windows system would work you would
not<00:03:55.000> have<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.330> worry<00:03:55.510> about<00:03:55.630> KD<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:56.830> spawn

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
not have to worry about KD you spawn

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.560 
not have to worry about KD you spawn
into<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.430> game<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.850> do<00:03:57.970> not<00:03:58.120> like<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.420> other

should<00:04:40.379> be<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.500> lot<00:04:40.860> more<00:04:40.889> I<00:04:41.370> was<00:04:41.789> dashed<00:04:42.060> on<00:04:42.270> at

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
should be a lot more I was dashed on at

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.540 
should be a lot more I was dashed on at
50<00:04:42.810> I've<00:04:42.990> been<00:04:43.110> dashed<00:04:43.379> on<00:04:43.590> at<00:04:43.710> 49<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.370> being

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
50 I've been dashed on at 49 and being

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.240 
50 I've been dashed on at 49 and being
dashed<00:04:44.849> on<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> few<00:04:45.300> times<00:04:45.539> in<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.750> mid<00:04:45.930> 30s

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
dashed on a few times in the mid 30s

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.409 
dashed on a few times in the mid 30s
obviously<00:04:47.250> this<00:04:47.340> is<00:04:47.490> not<00:04:47.520> me<00:04:47.759> playing<00:04:47.970> solo

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
obviously this is not me playing solo

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.119 
obviously this is not me playing solo
but<00:04:48.659> I<00:04:48.840> know<00:04:49.080> not<00:04:49.289> everyone<00:04:49.650> cares<00:04:49.889> about

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
but I know not everyone cares about

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.040 
but I know not everyone cares about
win-loss<00:04:50.550> but<00:04:50.879> I<00:04:51.000> know<00:04:51.090> myself<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:51.900> was

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
win-loss but I know myself and I was

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.809 
win-loss but I know myself and I was
dude<00:04:52.229> like<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.590> keep<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.889> high<00:04:53.069> so<00:04:53.550> what<00:04:53.669> do<00:04:53.729> you

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
dude like to keep it high so what do you

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.580 
dude like to keep it high so what do you
guys<00:04:53.970> think<00:04:54.030> about<00:04:54.360> this<00:04:54.599> system<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:55.470> be

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
guys think about this system to be

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.830 
guys think about this system to be
honest<00:04:55.919> in<00:04:56.069> reality<00:04:56.699> it<00:04:56.849> seems<00:04:57.330> like<00:04:57.599> it's<00:04:57.750> a

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
honest in reality it seems like it's a

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.779 
honest in reality it seems like it's a
simple<00:04:58.139> fix<00:04:58.199> and<00:04:58.800> I'm<00:04:59.099> wondering<00:04:59.610> why

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
simple fix and I'm wondering why

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.749 
simple fix and I'm wondering why
win-loss<00:05:00.509> could<00:05:00.750> not<00:05:00.870> be<00:05:01.020> more<00:05:01.259> accurate

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
win-loss could not be more accurate

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.339 
win-loss could not be more accurate
surely<00:05:02.759> they<00:05:02.909> have<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.330> programming<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.080> fix

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
surely they have the programming to fix

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.830 
surely they have the programming to fix
some<00:05:04.620> pink<00:05:04.949> which<00:05:05.159> seems<00:05:05.460> quite<00:05:05.759> simple<00:05:06.330> verb

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
some pink which seems quite simple verb

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.510 
some pink which seems quite simple verb
or<00:05:07.380> does<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.620> really<00:05:07.889> fly<00:05:08.190> over<00:05:08.400> the

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
or does it really fly over the

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.670 
or does it really fly over the
developers<00:05:08.970> head<00:05:09.150> do<00:05:09.690> they<00:05:09.810> want<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:10.259> nice<00:05:10.440> and

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
developers head do they want it nice and

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.680 
developers head do they want it nice and
easy<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:11.190> game<00:05:11.400> says<00:05:11.669> you<00:05:11.789> look<00:05:11.909> lost<00:05:12.120> so

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
easy the game says you look lost so

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.960 
easy the game says you look lost so
that's<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.139> you<00:05:13.380> lost<00:05:13.530> will<00:05:14.099> it<00:05:14.220> cause<00:05:14.490> extra

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
that's it you lost will it cause extra

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.020 
that's it you lost will it cause extra
work<00:05:15.319> probably<00:05:16.319> but<00:05:16.800> God<00:05:17.219> makes<00:05:17.550> millions<00:05:17.789> and

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
work probably but God makes millions and

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.909 
work probably but God makes millions and
millions<00:05:18.060> each<00:05:18.659> year<00:05:18.719> sure<00:05:19.349> they<00:05:19.620> can<00:05:19.770> add

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
millions each year sure they can add

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.740 
millions each year sure they can add
little<00:05:20.190> touches<00:05:20.729> just<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.210> make<00:05:21.389> the<00:05:21.569> plane

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
little touches just to make the plane

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.689 
little touches just to make the plane
experience<00:05:22.259> just<00:05:22.469> that<00:05:22.650> little<00:05:22.919> bit<00:05:23.129> better<00:05:23.430> I

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
experience just that little bit better I

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.969 
experience just that little bit better I
don't<00:05:24.539> know<00:05:24.599> but<00:05:24.840> maybe<00:05:25.259> I<00:05:25.440> just<00:05:25.620> want<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.800> fall

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
don't know but maybe I just want to fall

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.830 
don't know but maybe I just want to fall
in<00:05:26.099> accurate<00:05:26.460> package<00:05:26.819> but<00:05:27.030> take<00:05:27.449> care<00:05:27.479> guys
