00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
right back to the white and now I just

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:17.510 
right back to the white and now I just
unlocked<00:05:10.290> a<00:05:14.330> door<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:16.350> right<00:05:16.979> there<00:05:17.220> is<00:05:17.370> the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
unlocked a door and right there is the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.190 
unlocked a door and right there is the
finish<00:05:17.970> but<00:05:18.210> before<00:05:18.660> we<00:05:18.780> can<00:05:18.840> get<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.110> the

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
finish but before we can get to the

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.480 
finish but before we can get to the
finish<00:05:19.410> we<00:05:19.710> gotta<00:05:19.889> unlock<00:05:20.220> something<00:05:25.490> and

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
finish we gotta unlock something and

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.029 
finish we gotta unlock something and
that's<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:27.000> -<00:05:27.210> button<00:05:27.510> and<00:05:27.780> the<00:05:28.350> cheat<00:05:28.560> on<00:05:28.740> and

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
that's the - button and the cheat on and

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.120 
that's the - button and the cheat on and
a<00:05:29.160> she<00:05:29.340> turns<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.660> transforms<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:31.500> so<00:05:32.070> you

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
a she turns and it transforms and so you

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.670 
a she turns and it transforms and so you
can<00:05:32.250> have<00:05:32.400> two<00:05:32.639> balls<00:05:32.880> at<00:05:33.180> once<00:05:33.410> and<00:05:34.410> then<00:05:34.500> this

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
can have two balls at once and then this

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.719 
can have two balls at once and then this
can<00:05:34.979> come<00:05:35.220> in<00:05:35.250> handy<00:05:35.700> in<00:05:35.789> some<00:05:36.060> situations<00:05:37.729> so

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
can come in handy in some situations so

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.680 
can come in handy in some situations so
this<00:05:38.880> is<00:05:39.030> going<00:05:39.270> to<00:05:39.389> be<00:05:39.510> difficult<00:05:40.050> you<00:05:41.690> can

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
this is going to be difficult you can

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.480 
this is going to be difficult you can
see<00:05:42.840> I'm<00:05:42.960> being<00:05:43.169> very<00:05:43.530> patient<00:05:43.800> being<00:05:44.130> very

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.900 
see I'm being very patient being very
careful<00:05:45.800> to<00:05:46.800> get<00:05:47.010> this<00:05:47.160> through<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.580> level

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
careful to get this through the level

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:56.710 
careful to get this through the level
and<00:05:50.150> you<00:05:51.150> can<00:05:51.479> see<00:05:51.599> now<00:05:51.900> I<00:05:51.930> need<00:05:52.169> to<00:05:52.229> go<00:05:53.870> whoops
