00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
see we have sold that system one has a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.460 
see we have sold that system one has a
400<00:00:24.269> make<00:00:24.420> some<00:00:24.570> decent<00:00:24.720> profit<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:25.289> about

400 make some decent profit I'm about

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.070 
400 make some decent profit I'm about
500<00:00:25.949> quid<00:00:26.070> these<00:00:26.730> Sesay<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.300> still<00:00:27.570> failing<00:00:27.840> to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
500 quid these Sesay is still failing to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.980 
500 quid these Sesay is still failing to
sell<00:00:28.289> I'm<00:00:28.560> probably<00:00:28.859> gonna<00:00:29.039> realistic<00:00:29.609> for

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
sell I'm probably gonna realistic for

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.319 
sell I'm probably gonna realistic for
750<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.260> more<00:00:31.470> time<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:32.189> hand<00:00:32.430> last-ditch

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
750 one more time just a hand last-ditch

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.270 
750 one more time just a hand last-ditch
hopefully<00:00:34.320> trying<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> sell<00:00:34.920> them<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.130> without

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
hopefully trying to sell them on without

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.490 
hopefully trying to sell them on without
any<00:00:35.610> loss<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.780> can't<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> one

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
any loss but if we can't do that one

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.720 
any loss but if we can't do that one
will<00:00:37.860> probably<00:00:38.129> end<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.340> selling<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.700> for

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
will probably end up selling them for

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.630 
will probably end up selling them for
700<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:40.710> arrange<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> squad<00:00:41.460> now

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
700 so we do not arrange the squad now

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.160 
700 so we do not arrange the squad now
we're<00:00:41.760> gonna<00:00:41.850> play<00:00:42.000> two<00:00:42.059> games<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.809> visions

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
we're gonna play two games and visions

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
we're gonna play two games and visions
and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.550> think<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:44.969> gonna<00:00:45.270> be

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and then then I think I'm gonna be

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.450 
and then then I think I'm gonna be
playing<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.780> first<00:00:46.140> ever<00:00:46.469> wager<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:47.309> will

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
be pretty cool with the first wager in

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.959 
be pretty cool with the first wager in

player<00:01:53.220> being<00:01:53.460> Bernard<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.090> he<00:01:54.240> could<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.509> a

much better than Manoj he scored in like
his<00:05:13.190> first<00:05:13.430> game<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:13.820> mother<00:05:13.970> didn't<00:05:14.210> even
