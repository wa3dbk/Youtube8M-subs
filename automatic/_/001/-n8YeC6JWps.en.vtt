00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.319
 hi dear friend friends i am 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.270
 cristian duque of the page frank arex 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.920
 dotcom I just trained chest and 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.900
 shoulders and you know that I do not 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.910
 like to train shoulders but train them 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.129
 in a supplemental way at the end of 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.600
 my chest training the 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.119
 breast training extremely 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.529
 important because it requires a lot of weight 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.929
 requires very strategic repetitions and 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.730
 with that I mean the following you 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.499
 if you can give the body time to 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.050
 chest to rest but I do not 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:34.750
 I recommend that it take more than a minute to 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.910
 90 seconds and between repetitions because 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.370
 because the chest is one of the muscles 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.670
 that cools down faster because of that when 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.640
 I made you a set I tried to make between 8 and 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.340
 10 repetitions try to put emphasis 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.050
 in the negative is not the rise so much 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.090
 as in the descent because the descents 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.910
 where one destroys the muscle so that 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.000
 then I can regenerate and recover and 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.899
 that is the process that growth rim 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.350
 of muscle mass 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.390
 that's why the positive one time up 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.740
 it's important but the bottom part is 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.950
 more important for example if you are 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.439
 lifting is possible 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.299
 you go up there you have to be careful 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.159
 but where you destroy the muscle 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.440
 where the muscle breaks so that 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.840
 then it regenerates and it 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.550
 increase muscle mass is the negative with 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.820
 1 goes down but that is extremely 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.890
 important chest training 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.810
 because it is a muscle that requires a lot 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.620
 weight and that requires as it has already 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.510
 reiterated strategic repetitions what 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.610
 next the declined is not so 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.280
 important and many people actually 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.590
 they do not even use it but the flat bench 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.350
 and the incline banking are the most 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.300
 important also try to use weights 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.980
 not only bars the weights are 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.890
 important because they make the body 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.870
 especially the chest make the balance 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.440
 rather than just do a bar or 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.480
 machine 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.630
 finally try to implement the 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.940
 cables the cables should use them to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.070
 high repetitions with low weights and 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.530
 Cable exercises do not require weight 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.110
 high and are actually the exercises 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.780
 end of training if you can do 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.600
 this start with the flat bar 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.300
 inclined then after using weights 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.240
 where they can use weight in medium to heavy 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.330
 and finish with cables under weight to that of 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.980
 repetition you will be able to achieve a 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.770
 chest training that is going to 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.319
 yield muscle growth and you will 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.329
 perform in aesthetics and symmetry 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.790
