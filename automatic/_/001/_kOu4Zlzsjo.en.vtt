00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
flying with the cargo bub as you can see

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.190 
flying with the cargo bub as you can see
i<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.590> got<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.750> what<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.870> need<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.049> do

i just got it and what you need to do

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.289 
i just got it and what you need to do
then<00:02:32.409> is<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.680> want<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.189> go<00:02:33.670> with<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
then is you want to go with the

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.170 
then is you want to go with the
container<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.170> with<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.500> helicopter<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.459> the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
container and with the helicopter to the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.360 
container and with the helicopter to the
station<00:02:37.810> where<00:02:38.109> you<00:02:38.200> need<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.590> bring<00:02:39.129> the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
station where you need to bring the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.990 
station where you need to bring the
container<00:02:39.849> it<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:41.049> I<00:02:41.409> just<00:02:42.099> give<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.670> again

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
container it so I just give it again

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.940 
container it so I just give it again
allow<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.599> little<00:02:43.870> bit<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.170> make<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.349> a<00:02:44.650> little

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
allow a little bit to make it a little

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:56.540 
allow a little bit to make it a little
bit<00:02:45.099> faster

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.420 

so<00:02:57.450> once<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.350> containers<00:02:58.800> down<00:02:58.980> here<00:02:59.220> just

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
so once it containers down here just

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.100 
so once it containers down here just
past<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.880> mission<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.780> will<00:03:00.930> see<00:03:01.080> I

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
past the mission and you will see I

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.460 
past the mission and you will see I
won't<00:03:01.500> get<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.740> lot<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:01.950> money<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.520> just<00:03:03.090> get<00:03:03.240> like

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
won't get a lot of money I just get like

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.630 
won't get a lot of money I just get like
12,000<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:06.110> 1,200<00:03:07.110> RP<00:03:07.470> but<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.160> do<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.460> on

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
12,000 and 1,200 RP but if we do it on

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.460 
12,000 and 1,200 RP but if we do it on
another<00:03:08.880> difficulty<00:03:09.630> if<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.870> do<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.020> on<00:03:10.140> hard

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
another difficulty if you do it on hard

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.130 
another difficulty if you do it on hard
you<00:03:11.010> will<00:03:11.100> get<00:03:11.220> three<00:03:11.430> times<00:03:11.790> more<00:03:12.240> hour<00:03:12.540> p<00:03:12.960> so

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
you will get three times more hour p so

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.530 
you will get three times more hour p so
you<00:03:13.200> get<00:03:13.350> around<00:03:13.590> for<00:03:13.860> Adela<00:03:14.130> sleepy<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.820> more

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
you get around for Adela sleepy and more

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.410 
you get around for Adela sleepy and more
money<00:03:15.780> for<00:03:16.170> completing<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.920> mission<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.550> if

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
money for completing the mission and if

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.730 
money for completing the mission and if
you<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.660> with<00:03:18.780> friends<00:03:19.050> you<00:03:19.230> will<00:03:19.290> get<00:03:19.440> more

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
you do it with friends you will get more

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.000 
you do it with friends you will get more
so<00:03:20.520> this<00:03:21.270> is<00:03:21.300> pretty<00:03:21.540> much<00:03:21.660> all<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.290> my<00:03:22.470> trick

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
so this is pretty much all of my trick

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.380 
so this is pretty much all of my trick
or<00:03:23.130> tip<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.490> you<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.820> this<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.240> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
or tip to you and this is like the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.480 
or tip to you and this is like the
fastest<00:03:24.900> method<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.380> think<00:03:25.650> that's<00:03:26.280> all<00:03:26.430> the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
fastest method I think that's all the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.670 
fastest method I think that's all the
right<00:03:26.730> now<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:26.970> get<00:03:27.210> a<00:03:27.270> lot<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.570> RP<00:03:28.170> this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
right now to get a lot of RP this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.350 
right now to get a lot of RP this
mission<00:03:29.010> takes<00:03:29.160> your<00:03:29.370> like<00:03:29.490> three<00:03:29.790> three<00:03:30.210> to

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
mission takes your like three three to

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.600 
mission takes your like three three to
five<00:03:30.570> minutes<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.260> it's<00:03:31.410> not<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.560> lot<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.070> it

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
five minutes so it's not a lot and it

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.730 
five minutes so it's not a lot and it
makes<00:03:32.850> fun<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.480> if<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.290> enjoy<00:03:34.500> this<00:03:34.590> video
