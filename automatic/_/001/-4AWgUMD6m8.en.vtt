00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.440
 Greetings from the modest flavors 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.800
 in this part of the Green River adorned ... 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800
 we will reach our beautiful Amyamız 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.160
 and "Amasya Cake" recipe 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.400
 But as always before the materials 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.080
 half a pack of margarine, half a pack of butter 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.080
 1 pack of quick yeast 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.240
 1.5 cups of warm milk 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.720
 1 teaspoon powdered sugar 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.040
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 1 cup of thinly drawn walnut 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.800
 and as much flour as possible 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 For the above; 1 piece of egg 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.400
 now we can proceed to the production of Amasya 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.320
 firstly milk ... 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 melted margarine, butter mix 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.640
 Let's transfer to kneading bowl 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.040
 over; After adding sugar to sugar 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.520
 let's mix our yeast with some flour 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.760
 and start combining all the materials 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 Let's add some more flour 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.520
 we'll add a fine walnut 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 especially if you recommend fine tattooing 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.840
 dough starts to integrate 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.840
 now on the walnut 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.360
 we use finely ground walnuts, especially for dough integration 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.200
 walnuts spread in dough in a balanced manner 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.200
 now we'll cover it 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.240
 and rest in a warm environment for at least 45 minutes 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 45 minutes later 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.360
 our time is up, let's see 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.880
 blistering 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.520
 Let's now top-bottom 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.640
 We're doing it the easy way 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.960
 there is also a ribbon and auger. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.320
 we take half a lemon 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.040
 we are rounding 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.960
 oiled or greaseproof paper 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.000
 We have made 30 pieces of Amasya 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.120
 now we cover it and hold it for half an hour 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.120
 then we're going to lay eggs on it and give it to the oven. 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.120
 After half an hour 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.480
 half an hour has passed, our whole egg is flapped 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.560
 and Amasya are working on our donuts 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.000
 only egg yolk is driven in the region 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.560
 Amasyalı viewers do not react 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.960
 do not do it, but now we are throwing scratches in the form of plus 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.880
 every time we wipe our blade so that our line is clear 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.680
 now we have pre-warmed 200 degrees to the oven 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.640
 and bake until golden brown 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.400
 35 minutes later 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 Our buns are out of the oven, they smell like 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.640
 can now transfer to the serving plate 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.640
 fluffy... 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.680
 appetite 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 Modest Flavors in this section of cuisine 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.600
 We reached out to our country and shared a recipe for a donut 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.400
 "Amasya Cake" 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.000

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.480
