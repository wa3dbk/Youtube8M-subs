quart pressure cooker and you have to
modify<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.700> obviously<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:13.849> be<00:00:14.849> prepared<00:00:15.269> for

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
it's worth it name we got a rubber tube

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.849 
it's worth it name we got a rubber tube
so<00:00:23.550> climb<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.150> top<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:27.140> clamped<00:00:28.140> be

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
so climb to the top of it and clamped be

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.939 
so climb to the top of it and clamped be
the<00:00:29.070> copper<00:00:29.340> tube<00:00:29.699> running<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.439> way<00:00:31.470> over

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the copper tube running all the way over

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.030 
the copper tube running all the way over
into<00:00:32.309> ice<00:00:33.270> water<00:00:34.550> was<00:00:35.550> ice<00:00:35.760> water<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:37.040> you

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
into ice water was ice water and you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.180 
into ice water was ice water and you
pull<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.430> down<00:00:38.610> through<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:39.120> run<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> out

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
pull it down through there run it out

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.860 
pull it down through there run it out
silk<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.489> both<00:00:41.730> sides<00:00:42.030> when<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.660> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
silk on both sides when you do it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.590 
silk on both sides when you do it
because<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.500> not<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.890> leaks<00:00:44.510> learning<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
because it's not it leaks learning the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
because it's not it leaks learning the
hard<00:00:45.750> way<00:00:45.899> through<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:48.260> then<00:00:49.489> someone<00:00:50.489> down

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
hard way through that then someone down

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.240 
hard way through that then someone down
here<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.739> comes<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.250> right<00:00:54.320> there<00:00:55.320> I'm

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
here and it comes out right there I'm

doesn't matter one pack of yeast and you
fill<00:01:59.660> it<00:01:59.780> about<00:01:59.840> an<00:02:00.020> inch<00:02:02.200> yeah<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.440> a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
the quarter its core out to yeast and

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.180 
the quarter its core out to yeast and
you<00:02:09.560> fill<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:10.690> kind<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:11.780> warm<00:02:12.050> water<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.740> want

about<00:02:16.850> an<00:02:17.030> inch<00:02:17.120> from<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.480> top<00:02:17.950> seal<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.190> make

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
about an inch from the top seal it make

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.670 
about an inch from the top seal it make
sure<00:02:19.730> everything's<00:02:20.090> field<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:21.470> good

sure everything's field and it's good
idea<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.190> bend<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.520> outside<00:02:23.590> like<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.740> have<00:02:24.950> mine

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
idea to bend it outside like I have mine

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.530 
idea to bend it outside like I have mine
running<00:02:25.550> out<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.840> window<00:02:27.200> because<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:29.360> don't

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
running out the window because you don't

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.229 
running out the window because you don't
want<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.900> smell<00:02:30.200> inside<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:31.489> just<00:02:31.760> here<00:02:31.970> to

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
want the smell inside it's just here to

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.690 
want the smell inside it's just here to
sometimes<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:33.110> can<00:02:33.290> sting<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:36.970> there<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.239> go

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
sometimes you can sting and there you go

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.850 
sometimes you can sting and there you go
that<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:41.000> how<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.300> do<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:42.250> short<00:02:43.250> version

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
that is how you do it short version

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:53.410 
that is how you do it short version
costs<00:02:45.860> maybe<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:48.850> hours<00:02:50.020> so<00:02:51.100> 110<00:02:52.100> maybe<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:53.270> do

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
costs maybe and hours so 110 maybe to do

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.770 
costs maybe and hours so 110 maybe to do
everything<00:02:54.010> alright<00:02:55.209> hope<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.390> learn<00:02:56.540> will
