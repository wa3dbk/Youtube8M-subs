00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
at home of his own so not it's going to

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.690 
at home of his own so not it's going to
go<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.559> here<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.769> drop<00:00:13.920> some<00:00:14.190> glass<00:00:14.429> behind

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
go in here and drop some glass behind

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.340 
go in here and drop some glass behind
his<00:00:14.940> supply<00:00:15.179> line<00:00:15.360> looks<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.049> his<00:00:16.170> prime

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
his supply line looks like his prime

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.080 
his supply line looks like his prime
just<00:00:16.529> going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.710> pick<00:00:16.830> up<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> few<00:00:17.220> SC<00:00:17.400> vs<00:00:17.670> before

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
just going to pick up a few SC vs before

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.130 
just going to pick up a few SC vs before
he's<00:00:18.210> going<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.600> lift<00:00:18.840> off<00:00:19.020> again<00:00:20.060> but

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
he's going to have to lift off again but

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.820 
he's going to have to lift off again but
actually<00:00:22.140> might<00:00:22.260> not<00:00:22.380> be<00:00:22.500> able<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.710> stop

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
actually might not be able to stop

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.460 
actually might not be able to stop
because<00:00:23.160> up<00:00:24.119> magic<00:00:24.480> just<00:00:24.660> has<00:00:24.779> those<00:00:24.960> glass<00:00:25.230> as

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
because up magic just has those glass as

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.900 
because up magic just has those glass as
well<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.859> he<00:00:25.949> does<00:00:26.099> pick<00:00:26.310> up<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.640> he's<00:00:26.760> going

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
well so he does pick up and he's going

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.820 
well so he does pick up and he's going
to<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.570> Dodge<00:00:27.720> doing<00:00:28.710> his

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
to just get out of Dodge doing his

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.230 
to just get out of Dodge doing his
damage<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.369> doesn't<00:00:29.640> want<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> lose<00:00:29.939> any<00:00:30.179> of

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
his minute so that was very smart move

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.240 
his minute so that was very smart move
by<00:00:31.710> nada<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:33.469> taking<00:00:34.469> out<00:00:34.559> several<00:00:34.770> STDs<00:00:35.219> and

almost more importantly able to keep up

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.660 
almost more importantly able to keep up
magic<00:00:39.390> back<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.629> his<00:00:39.899> baseball<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.410> bit<00:00:40.680> keep<00:00:41.430> up

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670

magic back in his baseball a bit keep up
magic<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.270> putting<00:00:42.629> pressure<00:00:42.899> back<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.200> him

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
magic from putting pressure back on him

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.299 
magic from putting pressure back on him
and<00:00:43.680> uh<00:00:44.539> yeah<00:00:45.539> magic<00:00:46.500> has<00:00:46.530> those<00:00:46.800> glasses<00:00:47.129> over

and uh yeah magic has those glasses over
there<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.640> well<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:49.079> be

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
there as well so not as not gonna be

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.209 
there as well so not as not gonna be
able<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> drop<00:00:49.559> there<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> moment

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
able to drop there at the moment

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.340 
able to drop there at the moment
although<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.180> magic<00:00:51.510> may<00:00:51.629> bring<00:00:51.870> his<00:00:51.989> forces

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
although out magic may bring his forces

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.810 
although out magic may bring his forces
out<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.590> his<00:00:52.680> main<00:00:52.860> basin<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.430> leave<00:00:53.670> that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
out of his main basin and leave that

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.930 
out of his main basin and leave that
opportunity<00:00:54.329> again<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.489> meantime<00:00:56.640> he

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
opportunity again so in the meantime he

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.160 
opportunity again so in the meantime he
is<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.210> back<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.600> another<00:00:57.719> job<00:00:57.960> here

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
is going back for another job here

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380 
is going back for another job here
actually<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.850> taking<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> couple<00:01:00.120> more<00:01:00.270> hits

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
actually and taking a couple more hits

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.320 
actually and taking a couple more hits
on<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.949> Wow<00:01:02.270> on<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.660> um<00:01:04.670> on<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.729> dropship

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
on that Wow on that um on the dropship

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.730 
on that Wow on that um on the dropship
that<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:06.960> kind<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> clever<00:01:07.290> using<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that was kind of clever using the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.820 
that was kind of clever using the
dropship<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> spot<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.560> actually<00:01:10.560> attacking

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
dropship to spot and actually attacking

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.740 
dropship to spot and actually attacking
with<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> Alliance<00:01:12.000> over<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> ridge<00:01:12.479> there

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
with the Alliance over the ridge there

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.560 
with the Alliance over the ridge there
interestingly<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> not<00:01:14.970> I'm<00:01:15.090> not<00:01:15.119> making<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
interestingly so not I'm not making it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.330 
interestingly so not I'm not making it
more<00:01:15.780> dropships<00:01:16.320> at<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> moment<00:01:17.009> he<00:01:17.100> probably

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
more dropships at the moment he probably

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.120 
more dropships at the moment he probably
figures<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.939> um<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:19.080> uh<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.619> magic<00:01:19.950> just

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
figures that um that uh up magic just

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.600 
figures that um that uh up magic just
has<00:01:20.880> too<00:01:21.630> many<00:01:21.770> horses<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.979> magic<00:01:23.310> coming<00:01:23.520> in

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
has too many horses up magic coming in

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.120 
has too many horses up magic coming in
for<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> drop<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.119> now<00:01:24.270> though<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.659> nada<00:01:25.530> it's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
for a drop here now though and nada it's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.469 
for a drop here now though and nada it's
gonna<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.549> those<00:01:26.759> SUVs<00:01:26.939> out<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
gonna have to get those SUVs out of the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.940 
gonna have to get those SUVs out of the
way<00:01:27.570> pretty<00:01:27.869> quickly<00:01:28.049> he<00:01:28.259> pulls<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.590> lot<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> him

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
way pretty quickly he pulls a lot of him

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.760 
way pretty quickly he pulls a lot of him
out<00:01:29.150> he<00:01:30.150> doesn't<00:01:30.479> okay<00:01:31.200> he<00:01:31.259> drops<00:01:31.500> his<00:01:31.680> own

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
out he doesn't okay he drops his own

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.530 
out he doesn't okay he drops his own
forces<00:01:32.100> back<00:01:32.340> there<00:01:32.610> he<00:01:33.000> had<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.299> drop

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
forces back there he had that drop

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.940 
forces back there he had that drop
shipping<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.900> bias<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.259> was<00:01:34.409> able<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.770> drop

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
shipping your bias and was able to drop

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.560 
shipping your bias and was able to drop
and<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.579> looks<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.850> he<00:01:35.939> only<00:01:36.090> dropped<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.420> few

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and it looks like he only dropped a few

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.499 
and it looks like he only dropped a few
voltar's<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.680> uh<00:01:37.710> nada<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.000> able<00:01:39.329> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
voltar's there so uh nada is able to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.510 
voltar's there so uh nada is able to
does<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.350> comps<00:01:40.680> at<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.130> he's<00:01:41.280> able<00:01:41.340> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
does have comps at now so he's able to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.620 
does have comps at now so he's able to
take<00:01:41.640> care<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.820> those<00:01:41.970> mines<00:01:42.180> pretty<00:01:42.360> easily

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
take care of those mines pretty easily

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.800 
take care of those mines pretty easily
so<00:01:43.430> not<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> lot<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.759> damage<00:01:44.970> done<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.659> this

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
so not a lot of damage done here on this

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.590 
so not a lot of damage done here on this
drop<00:01:46.079> by<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.710> magic<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> loading<00:01:48.479> his

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
drop by up magic and not a loading his

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.100 
drop by up magic and not a loading his
forces<00:01:49.049> back<00:01:49.229> up<00:01:49.439> again<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.960> leaving<00:01:51.960> that

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
forces back up again and leaving that

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
forces back up again and leaving that
vulture<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.590> some<00:01:52.710> reason<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.189> guess<00:01:53.880> he's<00:01:54.030> got

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
vulture for some reason I guess he's got

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.370 
vulture for some reason I guess he's got
the<00:01:54.329> siege<00:01:54.509> tanks<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.049> he's<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.200> going

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the siege tanks there so he's just going

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.539 
the siege tanks there so he's just going
to<00:01:55.439> deal<00:01:55.619> with<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.950> siege<00:01:56.159> tanks<00:01:56.460> he

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
to deal with it with the siege tanks he

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.520 
to deal with it with the siege tanks he
might<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.850> other<00:01:57.030> business<00:01:57.450> for<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.290> drop

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
might have other business for that drop

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.039 
might have other business for that drop
ship<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.890> attend<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.850> magic<00:02:00.240> though<00:02:00.390> having

ship to attend to up magic though having
three<00:02:01.290> dropships<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.189> don't<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.460> if

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
three dropships now I don't know if

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.039 
three dropships now I don't know if
those<00:02:02.700> are<00:02:02.880> loaded<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:03.270> or<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.540> they<00:02:03.689> probably

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
those are loaded up or not they probably

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.170 
those are loaded up or not they probably
are<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.920> magic<00:02:05.280> looks<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.549> be<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.119> a

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
are up magic looks to be going in for a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.690 
are up magic looks to be going in for a
huge<00:02:06.509> drop<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.869> he<00:02:07.079> may<00:02:07.200> may<00:02:07.860> end<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:08.069> burying

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
huge drop in he may may end up burying

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.400 
huge drop in he may may end up burying
the<00:02:08.849> rest<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.179> those<00:02:09.270> forces<00:02:09.599> up<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.229> Ridge

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the rest of those forces up that Ridge

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.760 
the rest of those forces up that Ridge
as<00:02:10.530> well

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
as well

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.350 
as well
not<00:02:12.770> only<00:02:12.950> has<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.430> one<00:02:13.670> drop<00:02:13.970> ship<00:02:14.180> though

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
not only has that one drop ship though

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.380 
not only has that one drop ship though
right<00:02:14.930> now<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.380> this<00:02:16.130> could<00:02:16.460> be<00:02:16.970> bad<00:02:17.180> again

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
right now and this could be bad again

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.810 
right now and this could be bad again
for<00:02:17.750> Renata<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.710> those<00:02:18.890> drop<00:02:19.100> ships<00:02:19.160> are<00:02:19.490> full

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
for Renata so those drop ships are full

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.420 
for Renata so those drop ships are full
he<00:02:19.970> drops<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.300> few<00:02:20.450> tanks<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.990> some<00:02:21.830> glass<00:02:22.100> and

he drops a few tanks and some glass and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.270 
he drops a few tanks and some glass and
i'm<00:02:23.360> not<00:02:23.540> sure<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:23.810> not<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:23.990> house<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.920> forces

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
i'm not sure if not a house the forces

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.950 
i'm not sure if not a house the forces
right<00:02:25.460> now<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.670> take<00:02:25.850> care<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.210> he<00:02:26.360> he's

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
right now to take care of this he he's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.930 
right now to take care of this he he's
probably<00:02:27.140> gonna<00:02:27.350> be<00:02:27.500> able<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.710> OSHA<00:02:27.830> he<00:02:28.760> may

probably gonna be able to OSHA he may

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.820 
probably gonna be able to OSHA he may

have lost the glide in that dropship but

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.450 
have lost the glide in that dropship but
I<00:02:30.860> does<00:02:31.310> drop<00:02:31.550> all<00:02:31.730> on<00:02:31.970> top<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:32.920> top<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.100> up

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
I does drop all on top of top of up

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.330 
I does drop all on top of top of up
magic<00:02:34.880> forces<00:02:35.480> there<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.930> gotta<00:02:36.470> give<00:02:36.650> kudos<00:02:37.100> to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
magic forces there I gotta give kudos to

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.720 
magic forces there I gotta give kudos to
up<00:02:37.580> magic<00:02:38.060> for<00:02:38.300> targeting<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.730> dropship

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
up magic for targeting that dropship

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.420 
up magic for targeting that dropship
there<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.150> lot<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:42.020> time<00:02:42.320> you'll<00:02:42.590> see<00:02:42.650> players

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
there a lot of time you'll see players

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.540 
there a lot of time you'll see players
will<00:02:43.850> some<00:02:44.630> Terran<00:02:44.900> players<00:02:45.110> will<00:02:45.410> not<00:02:46.130> target

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
will some Terran players will not target

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.810 
will some Terran players will not target
the<00:02:47.170> dropship<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.380> they'll<00:02:49.160> just<00:02:49.370> target<00:02:49.730> the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
the dropship and they'll just target the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.040 
the dropship and they'll just target the
first<00:02:50.000> unit<00:02:50.240> that<00:02:50.390> pops<00:02:50.600> out<00:02:50.780> with<00:02:50.930> their

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
first unit that pops out with their

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.500 
first unit that pops out with their
goliaths<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.640> it's<00:02:52.640> really<00:02:52.970> more<00:02:53.090> effective

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
goliaths and it's really more effective

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.930 
goliaths and it's really more effective
to<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:54.560> attack<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.890> drop<00:02:55.100> ships<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.580> take<00:02:55.820> out

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
to to attack the drop ships and take out

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.130 
to to attack the drop ships and take out
a<00:02:55.970> lot<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.240> units<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.540> are<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:56.780> those<00:02:56.900> drop

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
a lot of units that are in those drop

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.580 
a lot of units that are in those drop
ships<00:02:57.460> more<00:02:58.460> quickly<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.080> so<00:03:00.080> I'm<00:03:00.230> magic

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
ships more quickly and so I'm magic

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.350 
ships more quickly and so I'm magic
taking<00:03:00.830> out<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:00.950> dropship<00:03:01.460> killing<00:03:02.120> off<00:03:02.240> of

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
taking out that dropship killing off of

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.630 
taking out that dropship killing off of
Goliath<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:02.960> think<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.950> was<00:03:04.040> inside<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.520> it

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
Goliath I think that was inside of it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.780 
Goliath I think that was inside of it
and<00:03:04.930> more<00:03:05.930> importantly<00:03:05.990> not<00:03:06.500> allowing<00:03:07.070> nodded

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
and more importantly not allowing nodded

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.880 
and more importantly not allowing nodded
to<00:03:07.880> get<00:03:08.000> those<00:03:08.180> glance<00:03:08.510> on<00:03:08.660> top<00:03:09.110> of<00:03:09.350> his<00:03:09.470> tanks

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
to get those glance on top of his tanks

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.260 
to get those glance on top of his tanks
because<00:03:10.070> if<00:03:10.430> he<00:03:10.580> was<00:03:10.730> able<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:10.940> get<00:03:11.060> them<00:03:11.180> on

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
because if he was able to get them on

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.080 
because if he was able to get them on
top<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.630> his<00:03:11.720> tanks<00:03:12.050> then<00:03:12.820> he<00:03:13.820> wouldn't<00:03:14.030> have

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
top of his tanks then he wouldn't have

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.370 
top of his tanks then he wouldn't have
been<00:03:14.270> able<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.890> attack<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:17.450> Goliath<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:18.200> the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380

territory<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.320> get<00:03:42.530> there<00:03:42.709> basically<00:03:43.070> so<00:03:43.430> it's

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
territory to get there basically so it's

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.060 
territory to get there basically so it's
not<00:03:43.730> going<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:44.050> scream<00:03:45.050> Lee<00:03:45.290> easy<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.739> get<00:03:45.860> over

not going to scream Lee easy to get over
there<00:03:46.190> it<00:03:46.580> looks<00:03:46.730> like<00:03:46.850> he<00:03:47.000> might<00:03:47.209> be<00:03:47.390> going

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
there it looks like he might be going

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.270 
there it looks like he might be going
for<00:03:47.780> no<00:03:47.900> he's<00:03:48.110> turning<00:03:48.650> his<00:03:48.739> dropships<00:03:49.100> back

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.560 
for no he's turning his dropships back
around<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:50.570> both<00:03:51.440> players<00:03:51.910> pretty<00:03:52.910> even<00:03:53.420> right

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
now actually not i think is a little bit

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.670 
now actually not i think is a little bit
behind<00:03:57.430> economically<00:03:58.430> but<00:03:59.150> in<00:04:00.080> general<00:04:00.350> both

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
behind economically but in general both

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.170 
behind economically but in general both

avoid SCV's from hitting them so it bit

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.390 
avoid SCV's from hitting them so it bit

give<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.240> momentum<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.990> up<00:05:13.200> magic<00:05:13.620> he's<00:05:14.520> just

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
give the momentum to up magic he's just

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.460 
give the momentum to up magic he's just
been<00:05:14.880> doing<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.180> little<00:05:15.330> bit<00:05:15.510> more<00:05:15.660> harassment

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
been doing a little bit more harassment

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.170 
been doing a little bit more harassment
here<00:05:16.920> and<00:05:17.040> there<00:05:17.160> getting<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.820> science

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
here and there getting a science

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.510 
here and there getting a science
facility<00:05:18.570> up<00:05:18.690> there<00:05:18.720> interestingly<00:05:19.650> uh<00:05:20.010> I'm

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
facility up there interestingly uh I'm

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.830 
facility up there interestingly uh I'm
not<00:05:20.700> sure<00:05:20.760> he's<00:05:21.030> going<00:05:21.180> to<00:05:21.270> get<00:05:21.390> science

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
not sure he's going to get science

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.770 
not sure he's going to get science
vessels<00:05:22.200> or<00:05:22.440> he's<00:05:23.040> just<00:05:23.480> doing<00:05:24.480> that<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:24.720> you

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
vessels or he's just doing that so you

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.430 
vessels or he's just doing that so you
can<00:05:24.870> get<00:05:24.960> upgrades<00:05:26.660> so<00:05:27.660> not<00:05:27.840> as<00:05:27.960> still<00:05:28.170> having

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
can get upgrades so not as still having

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.820 
can get upgrades so not as still having
only<00:05:28.560> those<00:05:28.800> two<00:05:28.830> drop<00:05:29.190> ships<00:05:30.710> really<00:05:31.710> he

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
only those two drop ships really he

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.350 
only those two drop ships really he
needs<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.190> get<00:05:32.400> some<00:05:32.430> more<00:05:32.610> dropships<00:05:33.060> I<00:05:33.180> think

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
needs to get some more dropships I think

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.940 
needs to get some more dropships I think
so<00:05:33.510> we<00:05:33.600> can<00:05:33.720> do<00:05:33.810> kind<00:05:34.110> of<00:05:34.140> a<00:05:34.230> major<00:05:34.440> drop<00:05:34.770> on

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
so we can do kind of a major drop on

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.610 
so we can do kind of a major drop on
Donna<00:05:35.160> not<00:05:35.670> a<00:05:35.700> is<00:05:36.360> getting<00:05:37.050> dropped<00:05:37.230> on<00:05:37.440> out

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
Donna not a is getting dropped on out

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.010 
Donna not a is getting dropped on out
here<00:05:37.770> by<00:05:37.920> out<00:05:38.070> magic<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:38.580> he<00:05:39.180> only<00:05:39.270> has<00:05:39.780> those

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
here by out magic and he only has those

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.510 
here by out magic and he only has those
okie<00:05:40.350> does<00:05:40.530> have<00:05:40.680> another<00:05:40.890> dropship<00:05:41.280> but<00:05:41.400> that

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
okie does have another dropship but that

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.850 
okie does have another dropship but that
one<00:05:41.640> is<00:05:41.670> not<00:05:41.850> full<00:05:42.060> of<00:05:42.090> anything<00:05:42.240> and<00:05:42.600> nada<00:05:43.500> is

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
one is not full of anything and nada is

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.680 
one is not full of anything and nada is
going<00:05:44.760> to<00:05:44.820> have<00:05:44.940> a<00:05:44.970> little<00:05:45.120> bit<00:05:45.300> of<00:05:45.330> difficulty

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
going to have a little bit of difficulty

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.320 
going to have a little bit of difficulty
finding<00:05:45.990> this<00:05:46.230> off<00:05:46.700> magix<00:05:47.700> forces<00:05:48.060> are<00:05:48.180> going

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
finding this off magix forces are going

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.720 
finding this off magix forces are going
to<00:05:48.390> go<00:05:48.480> down<00:05:48.770> he<00:05:49.770> doesn't<00:05:50.310> have<00:05:50.400> quite<00:05:50.610> enough

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
to go down he doesn't have quite enough

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.550 
to go down he doesn't have quite enough
to<00:05:51.060> overwhelm<00:05:51.270> not<00:05:51.600> at<00:05:51.780> this<00:05:51.870> point<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:52.350> not

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
to overwhelm not at this point and not

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.860 
to overwhelm not at this point and not
doing<00:05:52.770> a<00:05:52.890> very<00:05:52.920> good<00:05:53.040> job<00:05:53.160> of<00:05:53.340> a

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
doing a very good job of a

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.630 
doing a very good job of a
counter-attacking<00:05:54.870> there<00:05:55.140> if<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:56.220> Magic<00:05:56.520> has

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
counter-attacking there if I Magic has

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.160 
counter-attacking there if I Magic has
more<00:05:56.820> forces<00:05:57.180> in<00:05:57.300> those<00:05:57.450> dropships<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:58.020> this

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
more forces in those dropships so this

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.420 
more forces in those dropships so this
could<00:05:58.290> be<00:05:58.350> very<00:05:58.440> bad<00:05:58.740> he<00:05:58.890> does<00:05:59.070> have<00:05:59.250> more

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
could be very bad he does have more

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.930 
could be very bad he does have more
forces<00:05:59.820> in<00:05:59.940> those<00:06:00.060> job<00:06:00.270> ships<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:01.430> wow<00:06:02.430> okay

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940
