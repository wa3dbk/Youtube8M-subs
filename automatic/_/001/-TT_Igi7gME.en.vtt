and<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.840> actually<00:00:52.079> adjust<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.739> spring

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
and you can actually adjust the spring

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.150 
and you can actually adjust the spring
stiffness<00:00:53.539> to<00:00:54.539> suit<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.320> stability<00:00:55.559> and

your expertise level
I<00:00:58.320> actually<00:00:58.680> took<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.070> two<00:00:59.280> Springs<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> I

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
I actually took out two Springs and I

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.880 
I actually took out two Springs and I
only<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.300> four<00:01:00.570> gives<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> board<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.710> nice

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
only go with four gives the board a nice

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.439 
only go with four gives the board a nice
little<00:01:02.070> wobble<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> feels<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> very

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
little wobble and it feels like a very

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.380 
little wobble and it feels like a very
tippy<00:01:03.780> race<00:01:03.960> boy<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.320> me<00:01:04.939> we<00:01:05.939> also<00:01:07.850> have<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.180> nice

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
tippy race boy to me we also have a nice

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
tippy race boy to me we also have a nice
long<00:01:09.720> stand-up<00:01:10.560> paddle<00:01:10.860> shaft<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
long stand-up paddle shaft it is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.030 
long stand-up paddle shaft it is
adjustable<00:01:12.420> right<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.290> spin<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.710> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
adjustable right here you spin this you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.749 
adjustable right here you spin this you
can<00:01:14.220> make<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> shaft<00:01:14.700> longer<00:01:15.180> or<00:01:15.810> shorter<00:01:15.869> and

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
can make the shaft longer or shorter and

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.190 
can make the shaft longer or shorter and
if<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> shots<00:01:18.119> longer<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.900> creates

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
if the shots longer it actually creates

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.749 
if the shots longer it actually creates
more<00:01:19.409> resistance<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.040> that's<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> first<00:01:20.549> way

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
more resistance so that's the first way

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.510 
more resistance so that's the first way
that<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:21.030> would<00:01:21.270> adjust<00:01:21.710> this<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.220> fit<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that we would adjust this to fit the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.960 
that we would adjust this to fit the
resistance<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.090> desire<00:01:24.570> second<00:01:25.560> way<00:01:25.759> is<00:01:26.759> if

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
resistance you desire second way is if

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.429 
resistance you desire second way is if
you<00:01:27.090> look<00:01:27.240> right<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.450> we've<00:01:28.110> got<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> nice
