00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.309
 trolling 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.130
 in short 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.300
 Belarusian woods on after with a toe 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.710
 polygon finds 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:30.420
 real groin the main road is one of 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.270
 difficult sections springboard yesterday 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.530
 all cars went in the opposite direction 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.660
 side of it all not going to the other side 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.870
 but yesterday there go down to and jumped very 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.780
 big town 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.780
 and here we were allowed to jump 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.960
 removed daughter-in-law I warn 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.380
 results, I will show you the video as they 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.579
 everything 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.539
 so is another interesting point 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.539
 confused parts 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.340
 here after jumping alone land 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.430
 shock absorbers here you see 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.840
 activator on dangling rings with two 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.410
 the parties he is hot and I can not before him 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.990
 touch 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.760
 he had just been interrupted during a jump here 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.320
 from this here 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.700
 springboard 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.590
 burst out all two sides spilled out here 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.840
 rubber bands 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.329
 rings and all you can 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 so here it is not so simple 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.400
 tramplinchik and it seems to everyone 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.650
 I will insert video pieces 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.230
 positive is it either 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.600
 [music] 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.100
 positively either red or cherokee 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.100
 black him 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 because u suzuki 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.300
 I landed very hard wanted tall 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.300
 landed hard 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.820
 payment you found after 20 years on 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.030
 [music] 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.740
 here comes 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.740
 but we will see 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.500
 three show down 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.620
 you will pass down 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.060
 otherwise they take off to every where rushed 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.370
 here is nothing extreme except 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:17.810
 Now I'll show this springboard how 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:21.350
 they drove so did not come here so opa 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.350
 here is this springboard 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.630
 and here the road went down 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.810
 knew whether the video will show some bias 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:37.100
 it seems that a small but elevation difference 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.100
 seven meters I think so 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.530
 that's probably life on 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.220
 meters all overpay bald on here 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.220
 there are roads 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.610
 he is extremely here 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.720
 near too dangerous 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.720
 stones fly in all directions 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.319
 and 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.940
 [music] 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.470
 here is the flight here is the field here 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.470
 [music] 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.730
 [music] 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:29.430
 and sing this number here so they can get there 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.650
 from not spare so after springboard 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.480
 after jumping from a springboard I do not know which one 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.330
 cars but what about shock absorbers like that 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.530
 here 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.850
 don't take hot hands on the side 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.810
 show photos you haven't moved 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.460
 do you hear someone pulling out 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:58.460
 gum shock absorbers across the road 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.460
 roll gum from the shock absorber copy 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:08.360
 this is some of the latest machines here 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.360
 such jumps are made here yet 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.450
 in short, he hears I get cold 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:20.519
 Ivanko to move 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.680
 bulk let it cool here we collect 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.620
 spare parts 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:32.340
 so another rushing a desperate guy 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.830
 hear lions cars and so next 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.070
 a machine 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.070
 [music] 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.560
 union of leaves or not 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.030

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.500

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.500
 [music] 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.790
 [music] 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.220
 [music]
