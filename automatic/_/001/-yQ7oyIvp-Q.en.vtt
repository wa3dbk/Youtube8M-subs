00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.920
 hello, let's now study the principle of 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.540
 functioning of the technique or fpm in a 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.239
 agile system of m 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.629
 the data beam being transmitted is 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.600
 divided into n parallel bundles that 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.580
 turn module in importers 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.220
 orthogonal to each other 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:54.500
 these importers are in turn 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:57.650
 summed and then forming the symbol fpm 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.020
 we will see here in this drawing the 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.750
 block diagram of a system of 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.860
 transmission and reception of 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.590
 fpm 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.710
 here we have an input vector 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.330
 called Bekaa through that 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.600
 digital pain model 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.410
 here we have the formation of the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.229
 complex serial symbol we call cn 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.460
 it consists of a real part and a 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.759
 imaginary part 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.539
 this serial symbol it will pass through 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.789
 this series parallel converter to power 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.550
 separate the symbol into ennis bundles of 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:38.750
 data which are here called severe and 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.989
 1 to cn - one here at that point we 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.970
 we see several complex subcarriers 

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:46.940
 formed by a scene and cosine function 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.950
 of the same regular frequency by which 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.789
 we will multiply our faces 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.520
 data 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:56.239
 the sum of these rises then 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.280
 will result in our fbm symbol here 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:05.119
 so we have a sum and at the end 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.110
 then on the output of that sum 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:14.750
 the fdm which is nothing more than the symbol o 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.849
 enem for this to occur 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.580
 we need the separation and 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.280
 frequency of the sub-coordinator is 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.510
 equal to 1 / t 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.989
 the fdm this your fdm then it is the time of 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.020
 symbol or fpm 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.849
 this was the part of coding, ie 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.980
 the part of the transmission 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.530
 let's now see how it stands apart from 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.980
 t qualification of the qualification of the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.000
 signal 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.159
 bn here we call rdm is made 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.220
 by a bank of n with rapporteurs 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.830
 complexes that are those here in which 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.920
 then each with the rapporteur the complex is 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.780
 responsible for receiving information from the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.480
 respective carrier 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.000
 this method we see now is a 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.989
 method that we call the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.980
 brute force in communications systems 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.690
 that use the rdm technique exists 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.329
 the need to have a high level of 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.629
 number to climb up hras ta so that 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.750
 the system becomes less susceptible to 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.780
 action of this interference 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.739
 interference and symbolic is the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.049
 overlapping adjacent symbols of one 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.709
 easier way to understand - this is 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.319
 that we reduce the frequency component 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.879
 of a sign 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.510
 consequently we will increase the 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:44.239
 duration of the signal in the same way 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.549
 if we reduce the duration of a pulse we 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.310
 we will take the band he occupies 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.980
 with this we leave our system more 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.799
 susceptible to interference or 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.450
 is a temporal overlap of the 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.720
 adjacent symbols 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.120
 the consequence of such interference 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.750
 soft is the limitation of the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.530
 transmission in lt is the number go up by 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.470
 hras ta ta 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.690
 it varies between 128 and 2048 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.430
 when we talk about an implementation 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.130
 through the brute force method 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.010
 we have to keep in mind that the number 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.050
 The 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.620
 number of oscillators that we have a 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.360
 system and consequently to avoid 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.570
 interference action intense ball 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.240
 we have to have a high number of climbing 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.789
 consequently the number of 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.460
 of donors 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:42.560
 only the technique to maintain the 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.710
 synchronization between the 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.669
 oscillators is very complex with this 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.409
 brute force method becomes unfeasible 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.340
 an alternative to minimize this 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.980
 problem 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.160
 is we to use the other method that the 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.550
 method that we call transform 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:07.370
 inverse to escape and discreet or 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:10.580
 call from and dft this transformed instead 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.350
 to escape and discreetly it will be 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.620
 place of the oscillator bank in the 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.570
 transmission and reception shall be inserted 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.229
 transformed from smoking and discreet 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.780
 known as dft in place of the bank of 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:26.750
 that the rapporteur is where the coefficients of 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:31.090
 corresponds to the information that will 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:34.220
 be transmitted in phase and quadrature 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.010
 here we can see a diagram 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.930
 which presents this method 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.669
 here we see then we modulated 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.639
 digital 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:46.340
 here we parallel series converter however 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.650
 here we see that the 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.330
 quick transform to escape 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:57.350
 called fft then in place of e bft 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:00.080
 we have there is fft that is transformed 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.160
 I went back and forth and here in 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.250
 reception 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.840
 we have the fft that is used in place 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.610
 from ft 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.610
 so we put the transform 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.789
 I went quickly and in the place of the 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:18.229
 discreet because we do it because 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:21.800
 fft is an algorithm used to calculate 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:24.349
 the dft but decreases the complexity of 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.590
 transformed with this we conclude the 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:30.320
 our studies in relation to the principles 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:34.630
 of the rmm technique 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.630
 good studies to all and until the next
