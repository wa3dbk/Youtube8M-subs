problem<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.770> car<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.510> that<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
problem with this car was that when you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.830 
problem with this car was that when you
would<00:00:43.770> start<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.789> engine<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.300> put<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.660> over

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
would start the engine and put it over

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.220 
would start the engine and put it over
to<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> air-conditioning<00:00:47.250> turned<00:00:47.940> on

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
to have the air-conditioning turned on

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.229 
to have the air-conditioning turned on
that<00:00:49.230> green<00:00:49.530> light<00:00:49.770> would<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.010> light<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.879> next

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that green light would not light up next

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.520 
that green light would not light up next
to<00:00:51.329> AC<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:53.449> you<00:00:54.449> know<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:54.780> obviously<00:00:55.140> then

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
to AC and you know then obviously then

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.930 
to AC and you know then obviously then
the<00:00:55.559> compressor<00:00:55.920> wouldn't<00:00:56.340> turn<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the compressor wouldn't turn on so you

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
the compressor wouldn't turn on so you
wouldn't<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.329> any<00:00:57.510> cooling<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
wouldn't have any cooling and the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.439 
wouldn't have any cooling and the
problem<00:00:59.609> ended<00:00:59.940> up<00:01:00.059> being<00:01:01.129> that<00:01:02.149> 10<00:01:03.149> amp<00:01:03.390> fuse

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
problem ended up being that 10 amp fuse

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.300 
problem ended up being that 10 amp fuse
right<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.439> whoops<00:01:06.560> anyway<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:08.040> one

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
right there whoops anyway it's this one

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.539 
right there whoops anyway it's this one
right<00:01:08.340> next<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> 15<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
can see it says 10 amp HVAC so that was

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.310 
can see it says 10 amp HVAC so that was
it<00:01:18.500> popped<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> new<00:01:19.860> fuse<00:01:20.659> a/c<00:01:21.659> works<00:01:22.080> good

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
it popped in a new fuse a/c works good

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:35.100
