toshiba satellite s 55 T and the s 75 T

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.269 
toshiba satellite s 55 T and the s 75 T
I<00:00:17.420> do<00:00:17.480> yes<00:00:18.020> both<00:00:18.439> of<00:00:18.470> these<00:00:18.680> are<00:00:18.860> in<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.039> same

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
I do yes both of these are in the same

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.029 
I do yes both of these are in the same
series<00:00:19.699> and<00:00:20.240> they<00:00:20.930> are<00:00:21.050> both<00:00:21.289> they're

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
series and they are both they're

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.069 
series and they are both they're
basically<00:00:22.430> desktop<00:00:22.970> replacement<00:00:23.689> machines

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.079 
basically desktop replacement machines

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.380 
basically desktop replacement machines
because<00:00:24.470> those<00:00:24.710> still<00:00:25.099> exist<00:00:25.369> yeah

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
because those still exist yeah

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.919 
because those still exist yeah
personally<00:00:27.080> I<00:00:27.310> like<00:00:28.310> to<00:00:28.369> separate<00:00:28.910> out<00:00:29.089> the<00:00:29.119> PC

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
personally I like to separate out the PC

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.300 
personally I like to separate out the PC
that<00:00:30.080> I<00:00:30.140> build<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:30.830> then<00:00:30.919> I<00:00:30.949> have<00:00:31.189> an

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
that I build and then I have an

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.369 
that I build and then I have an
ultrabook<00:00:31.669> that<00:00:32.029> I<00:00:32.059> carry<00:00:32.330> with<00:00:32.570> me<00:00:32.599> forwards

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
ultrabook that I carry with me forwards

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.259 
ultrabook that I carry with me forwards
do<00:00:33.680> you<00:00:33.739> want<00:00:33.890> superlight<00:00:34.400> because<00:00:34.970> I<00:00:35.059> want

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
do you want superlight because I want

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.750 
do you want superlight because I want
superlight<00:00:35.720> these<00:00:36.320> are<00:00:36.620> not<00:00:36.890> that<00:00:37.250> laptop

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
superlight these are not that laptop

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.420 
superlight these are not that laptop
these<00:00:38.089> are<00:00:38.390> both<00:00:38.660> around<00:00:39.320> 5<00:00:39.680> volt<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.190> small

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
these are both around 5 volt the small

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.220 
these are both around 5 volt the small
ones<00:00:40.640> about<00:00:40.820> 5<00:00:41.059> pounds<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.659> large<00:00:41.870> one<00:00:42.050> is<00:00:42.199> a

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
ones about 5 pounds the large one is a

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.170 
ones about 5 pounds the large one is a
little<00:00:42.649> bit<00:00:43.100> heavier<00:00:43.460> than<00:00:43.520> that

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
little bit heavier than that

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.150 
little bit heavier than that
so<00:00:44.629> it's<00:00:45.230> 17<00:00:45.800> inches<00:00:46.190> right<00:00:47.770> its<00:00:48.770> lucky<00:00:49.129> that

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
so it's 17 inches right its lucky that

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.790 
so it's 17 inches right its lucky that
city<00:00:49.489> still<00:00:49.730> makes<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.059> 17<00:00:50.539> I<00:00:50.570> mean<00:00:53.620> really<00:00:54.620> big

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
city still makes a 17 I mean really big

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.130 
city still makes a 17 I mean really big
sizes<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:55.730> they<00:00:55.879> have<00:00:56.030> very<00:00:56.300> comparable<00:00:56.690> specs

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
sizes so they have very comparable specs

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.990 
sizes so they have very comparable specs
as<00:00:57.320> far<00:00:57.500> as<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.710> insides<00:00:58.070> go<00:00:58.340> they<00:00:58.640> both<00:00:58.789> have

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
as far as the insides go they both have

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.689 
as far as the insides go they both have
intel<00:00:59.329> core<00:00:59.570> i7<00:00:59.690> s<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.379> fourth<00:01:00.829> generation<00:01:00.920> so

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
intel core i7 s the fourth generation so

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.939 
intel core i7 s the fourth generation so
new<00:01:01.940> ones<00:01:02.210> very<00:01:02.780> fast<00:01:02.989> they<00:01:03.289> also<00:01:03.440> have<00:01:03.710> one

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
new ones very fast they also have one

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.469 
new ones very fast they also have one
terabyte<00:01:04.339> hard<00:01:04.550> drives<00:01:04.850> they<00:01:05.000> do<00:01:05.059> not<00:01:05.300> have

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
terabyte hard drives they do not have

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.260 
terabyte hard drives they do not have
solid-state<00:01:05.990> drives<00:01:06.350> surprisingly<00:01:07.179> can<00:01:08.179> you

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
solid-state drives surprisingly can you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.749 
solid-state drives surprisingly can you
tell<00:01:08.479> use<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.229> can<00:01:09.560> tell<00:01:09.830> when<00:01:10.399> whenever

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
tell use it you can tell when whenever

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.400 
tell use it you can tell when whenever
you're<00:01:11.060> booting<00:01:11.240> up<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.750> whenever<00:01:12.050> you're

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
you're booting up and whenever you're

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.260 
you're booting up and whenever you're
changing<00:01:12.860> around<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.250> little<00:01:13.369> bit

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
changing around a little bit

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.910 
changing around a little bit
between<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.959> different<00:01:15.229> programs<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:15.770> can

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
between the different programs you can

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.430 
between the different programs you can
definitely<00:01:16.490> see<00:01:16.729> a<00:01:16.759> bit<00:01:17.149> of<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.360> lag<00:01:17.569> boot<00:01:18.259> up

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
definitely see a bit of a lag boot up

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.230 
definitely see a bit of a lag boot up
times<00:01:18.679> I'm<00:01:19.069> a<00:01:19.099> little<00:01:19.399> spoiled<00:01:19.640> from<00:01:19.940> having

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
times I'm a little spoiled from having

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.419 
times I'm a little spoiled from having
the<00:01:20.360> solid<00:01:20.660> state<00:01:20.810> machines<00:01:21.289> so<00:01:21.740> now<00:01:22.009> I<00:01:22.039> tried

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
the solid state machines so now I tried

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:23.919 
the solid state machines so now I tried
one<00:01:22.550> of<00:01:22.580> these<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:22.940> I<00:01:23.000> go<00:01:23.119> God<00:01:23.330> what's<00:01:23.599> taking

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
one of these and I go God what's taking

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.380 
one of these and I go God what's taking
so<00:01:23.959> long<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:24.259> started<00:01:25.039> is<00:01:25.160> frozen<00:01:25.640> but<00:01:26.060> it's<00:01:26.209> not

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
so long I started is frozen but it's not

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.290 
so long I started is frozen but it's not
it's<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:26.720> taking<00:01:27.319> forever<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:28.610> small<00:01:29.030> one

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
it's just taking forever the small one

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.139 
it's just taking forever the small one
has<00:01:29.539> a<00:01:29.569> pretty<00:01:30.080> interesting<00:01:30.849> graphics<00:01:31.849> card

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
has a pretty interesting graphics card

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.169 
has a pretty interesting graphics card
in<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:32.690> includes<00:01:32.959> a<00:01:33.349> nvidia<00:01:33.830> geforce<00:01:34.179> GT

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
in it it includes a nvidia geforce GT

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.809 
in it it includes a nvidia geforce GT
740<00:01:35.780> m<00:01:35.929> which<00:01:36.679> is<00:01:36.830> really<00:01:37.220> nice<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.580> has<00:01:37.700> the

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
740 m which is really nice it has the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.120 
740 m which is really nice it has the
optimist<00:01:38.209> technology<00:01:39.020> it<00:01:39.560> actually<00:01:39.920> works

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
optimist technology it actually works

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.609 
optimist technology it actually works
very<00:01:40.250> well<00:01:40.550> whenever<00:01:40.970> you're<00:01:41.209> running<00:01:41.619> like

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
very well whenever you're running like

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.540 
very well whenever you're running like
seven<00:01:43.060> 720p<00:01:44.060> II<00:01:44.349> graphics<00:01:45.349> so<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:46.069> works<00:01:46.250> quite

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
seven 720p II graphics so it works quite

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.490 
seven 720p II graphics so it works quite
well<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:47.060> larger<00:01:47.390> one<00:01:47.569> does<00:01:47.780> not<00:01:48.020> include

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
well the larger one does not include

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.770 
well the larger one does not include
that<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:49.099> one<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:49.459> has<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.640> regular<00:01:49.940> intel

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
that that one just has a regular intel

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.469 
that that one just has a regular intel
graphics<00:01:51.099> inside<00:01:52.099> of<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.340> it's<00:01:52.940> very<00:01:53.090> strange

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
graphics inside of it it's very strange

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.419 
graphics inside of it it's very strange
that<00:01:53.660> they<00:01:53.810> didn't<00:01:54.200> include<00:01:54.349> the<00:01:54.920> nice<00:01:55.160> and

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
that they didn't include the nice and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.130 
that they didn't include the nice and
video<00:01:55.940> graphics<00:01:56.479> in<00:01:56.629> the<00:01:56.690> larger<00:01:56.929> that's

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
video graphics in the larger that's

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.839 
video graphics in the larger that's
puzzling<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:57.800> got<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.009> lot<00:01:58.250> of<00:01:58.280> room<00:01:58.550> in<00:01:58.640> there

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
puzzling you got a lot of room in there

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.660 
puzzling you got a lot of room in there
I<00:01:58.910> know<00:01:59.030> yeah<00:01:59.420> very<00:01:59.810> very<00:01:59.929> strange<00:02:00.670> the

I know yeah very very strange the
smaller<00:02:02.209> one<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:03.399> resolution<00:02:04.399> on<00:02:04.550> this<00:02:04.759> guy

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
smaller one the resolution on this guy

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.820 
smaller one the resolution on this guy
and<00:02:05.149> you<00:02:05.209> can<00:02:05.360> probably<00:02:05.660> tell<00:02:06.080> from<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:06.619> as

believe<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.720> RAM<00:02:47.930> might<00:02:48.170> have

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
believe that the RAM might have

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.200 
believe that the RAM might have
something<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.680> do<00:02:48.860> with<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.010> yeah<00:02:49.550> smaller

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
something to do with that yeah smaller

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.379 
full and both of them have that nice
numeric<00:05:31.979> keypad<00:05:32.190> which<00:05:32.639> is<00:05:32.789> great<00:05:33.030> if<00:05:33.180> you're

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
numeric keypad which is great if you're

an<00:05:33.719> accountant<00:05:34.409> or<00:05:34.530> something<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:35.009> you're

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
an accountant or something and you're

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.459 
an accountant or something and you're
working<00:05:35.250> from<00:05:35.520> home<00:05:35.789> on<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.659> con<00:05:36.840> side<00:05:36.870> there

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
working from home on the con side there

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.260 
working from home on the con side there
is<00:05:37.560> a<00:05:37.590> very<00:05:37.860> high<00:05:38.069> lip<00:05:38.310> on<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.520> touchpad<00:05:38.759> so

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
is a very high lip on the touchpad so

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.300 
is a very high lip on the touchpad so
using<00:05:39.659> your<00:05:39.690> charms<00:05:40.110> bar<00:05:40.289> is<00:05:40.530> going<00:05:41.009> to<00:05:41.130> be<00:05:41.280> a

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
using your charms bar is going to be a

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.709 
using your charms bar is going to be a
little<00:05:41.610> bit<00:05:41.759> irritating<00:05:42.330> whenever<00:05:42.569> you're

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 
little bit irritating whenever you're

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.180 
little bit irritating whenever you're
trying<00:05:42.840> to<00:05:42.990> push<00:05:43.139> it<00:05:43.289> out<00:05:43.380> so<00:05:43.680> you<00:05:43.770> can<00:05:43.919> notice

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
trying to push it out so you can notice

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.040 
trying to push it out so you can notice
that<00:05:44.340> sometimes<00:05:44.849> it<00:05:45.000> doesn't<00:05:45.150> register<00:05:45.419> or<00:05:45.930> it

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
that sometimes it doesn't register or it

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.930 
that sometimes it doesn't register or it
registers<00:05:46.529> a<00:05:46.560> little<00:05:46.919> bit<00:05:47.039> late<00:05:47.250> low

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
registers a little bit late low

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.149 
registers a little bit late low
resolution<00:05:48.630> it's<00:05:49.139> slow<00:05:49.500> to<00:05:49.560> startup<00:05:50.039> of

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
resolution it's slow to startup of

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.249 
resolution it's slow to startup of
course<00:05:50.400> that's<00:05:50.580> because<00:05:50.969> of<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.270> the

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
course that's because of the the

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.769 
course that's because of the the
terabyte<00:05:52.949> hard<00:05:53.159> drive<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:53.819> then<00:05:54.029> battery

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
terabyte hard drive and then battery

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.870 
terabyte hard drive and then battery
life<00:05:55.050> is<00:05:55.229> not<00:05:55.409> that<00:05:55.560> great<00:05:55.740> it's<00:05:55.949> about<00:05:56.159> four

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
life is not that great it's about four

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.749 
life is not that great it's about four
hours<00:05:57.090> or<00:05:57.419> so<00:05:57.539> four<00:05:57.779> to<00:05:57.840> five<00:05:57.990> so<00:05:58.740> yeah<00:05:59.190> you

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
hours or so four to five so yeah you

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.370 
hours or so four to five so yeah you
would<00:05:59.909> definitely<00:06:00.300> be<00:06:00.419> leaving<00:06:00.779> this<00:06:00.930> at<00:06:01.139> home

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
would definitely be leaving this at home
