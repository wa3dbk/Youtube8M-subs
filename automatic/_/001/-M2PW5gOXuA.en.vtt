00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
some improvement in all three phases we

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.339 
some improvement in all three phases we
we<00:00:28.380> did<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.769> run<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> ball<00:00:29.880> effectively<00:00:30.349> you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.829 
receivers did a very nice job protection
was<00:00:37.290> very<00:00:37.530> good<00:00:37.830> and<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> done<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.720> that

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
was very good and we got it done in that

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.469 
was very good and we got it done in that
area<00:00:40.220> special<00:00:41.220> teams<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:42.150> know<00:00:42.180> made<00:00:42.449> a

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:42.479 
area special teams you know made a

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.420 
area special teams you know made a
game-changing<00:00:43.229> play<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.830> what<00:00:43.949> that<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.250> one

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
game-changing play and what that was one

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.250 
game-changing play and what that was one
of<00:00:44.460> our<00:00:44.699> keys<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.269> victory<00:00:45.449> going<00:00:45.900> into<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
of our keys to victory going into the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.360 
of our keys to victory going into the
game<00:00:46.409> that<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.830> was<00:00:46.949> going<00:00:47.040> to<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
game that that was going to have to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.250 
game that that was going to have to
happen<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.150> I<00:00:48.269> thought<00:00:48.449> our<00:00:48.600> defense<00:00:48.750> stepped

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
happen and I thought our defense stepped

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.320 
happen and I thought our defense stepped
up<00:00:49.440> when<00:00:49.589> they<00:00:49.680> had<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.030> throw<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
up when they had to but we can throw the

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.579 
up when they had to but we can throw the
ball<00:00:51.510> around<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.869> a<00:00:51.900> lot<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.199> different<00:00:52.470> people

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
ball around to a lot of different people

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.649 
ball around to a lot of different people
I<00:00:52.830> don't<00:00:53.040> think<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:54.030> know<00:00:54.119> that<00:00:54.330> they<00:00:54.479> can

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
I don't think you know that they can

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.500 
I don't think you know that they can
zero<00:00:54.839> in<00:00:55.229> on<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.799> guy<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> feel<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.360> can

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
zero in on one guy so I feel like we can

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.670 
zero in on one guy so I feel like we can
you<00:00:57.750> know<00:00:57.839> we<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.110> spread<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.409> ball<00:00:58.619> around

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you know we can spread the ball around

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
you know we can spread the ball around
and<00:00:59.250> Austin<00:01:00.089> has<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.479> know<00:01:00.570> has<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> good

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and Austin has it you know has a good

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.189 
and Austin has it you know has a good

feel for everybody Virginia's pretty
good<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.439> front<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.890> mean<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.159> were<00:01:05.220> pretty

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
good up front I mean they were pretty

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.280 
good up front I mean they were pretty
good<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.670> front<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:06.030> knew<00:01:06.180> they<00:01:06.360> were<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.869> we

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
good up front we knew they were and we

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.500 
good up front we knew they were and we
knew<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.439> was<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:08.010> tough<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.150> know

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
knew that was going to be tough you know

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.880 
knew that was going to be tough you know
we<00:01:09.630> thought<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.990> would<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.320> able<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.710> some

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
we thought we would be able to get some

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.250 
we thought we would be able to get some
things<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> perimeter<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> then<00:01:12.690> be<00:01:13.170> able

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
things on the perimeter and then be able

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.510 
things on the perimeter and then be able
to<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.590> know<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.830> them<00:01:13.950> running<00:01:14.100> east<00:01:14.370> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to you know get them running east and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.770 
to you know get them running east and
west<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.910> then<00:01:14.970> soften<00:01:15.330> them<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.750> little

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
west and then soften them up a little

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
west and then soften them up a little
bit<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.490> but<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.580> never<00:01:17.730> got<00:01:17.970> anything<00:01:18.180> going

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
bit and but we never got anything going

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.840 
bit and but we never got anything going
on<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> perimeter<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.410> you<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.160> that<00:01:20.370> kind

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
on the perimeter so you know that kind

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.960 
on the perimeter so you know that kind
of<00:01:20.940> backfired<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.570> us<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.370> I<00:01:23.400> still

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
of backfired on us but you know I still

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.430 
of backfired on us but you know I still
think<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.510> have<00:01:24.660> an<00:01:24.810> opportunity<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.410> be

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
think that we have an opportunity to be

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.200 
think that we have an opportunity to be
a<00:01:25.560> good<00:01:25.770> running<00:01:25.980> football<00:01:26.370> team<00:01:26.610> still<00:01:26.910> early

against<00:05:23.089> it<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:23.419> because<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.139> i'm<00:05:24.259> sure<00:05:24.289> it

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:24.559 
against it and because it i'm sure it

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.619 
against it and because it i'm sure it

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
it's a mean I'm sure it's based on

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.379 
it's a mean I'm sure it's based on
numbers<00:05:37.490> whether<00:05:37.699> you<00:05:37.969> know<00:05:38.089> because<00:05:38.270> they

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
numbers whether you know because they

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.029 
numbers whether you know because they
were<00:05:38.449> balanced<00:05:38.990> up<00:05:39.139> and<00:05:39.319> you<00:05:39.409> didn't<00:05:39.709> we<00:05:39.830> had

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
were balanced up and you didn't we had

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.649 
were balanced up and you didn't we had
more<00:05:40.399> over<00:05:40.669> here<00:05:40.699> than<00:05:40.969> we<00:05:41.059> had<00:05:41.209> over<00:05:41.389> there

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
more over here than we had over there

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.269 
more over here than we had over there
and<00:05:41.899> so<00:05:42.020> they<00:05:42.169> just<00:05:42.409> took<00:05:42.889> it<00:05:42.949> and<00:05:43.099> threw<00:05:43.159> it

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
and so they just took it and threw it

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.100 
and so they just took it and threw it
out<00:05:43.490> there<00:05:43.669> you<00:05:43.729> know<00:05:44.029> so<00:05:44.300> now<00:05:44.479> we<00:05:44.839> weren't
