other operating systems these two files
would<00:02:17.530> be<00:02:17.680> enough<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.160> install<00:02:18.489> any

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
would be enough to install any

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.600 
would be enough to install any
application<00:02:19.000> or<00:02:19.600> game<00:02:19.930> but<00:02:20.709> samsung<00:02:21.220> corby<00:02:21.370> is

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
application or game but samsung corby is

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.970 
application or game but samsung corby is
a<00:02:21.670> java<00:02:22.090> mobile<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.260> will<00:02:23.470> not<00:02:23.620> allow<00:02:23.799> you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
a java mobile so it will not allow you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.000 
a java mobile so it will not allow you
to<00:02:24.100> do<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.610> easily<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:26.230> will<00:02:26.410> require<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.980> to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
to do that easily it will require you to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.850 
to do that easily it will require you to
download<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.700> app<00:02:27.850> from<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.269> internet<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:29.380> in

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
download the app from the internet so in

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.580 
download the app from the internet so in
so<00:02:30.400> another<00:02:30.820> way<00:02:31.060> around<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:32.049> just<00:02:32.350> create

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
so another way around is to just create

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.569 
so another way around is to just create
a<00:02:32.709> text<00:02:33.250> file<00:02:33.630> which<00:02:34.630> will<00:02:34.930> fool<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.890> Corby

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
a text file which will fool the Corby

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.229 
a text file which will fool the Corby
mobile<00:02:37.920> thinking<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.549> is<00:02:39.579> downloading

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
mobile thinking that it is downloading

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.800 
mobile thinking that it is downloading
the<00:02:40.390> app<00:02:40.480> from<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> internet<00:02:41.320> so<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.600> be<00:02:43.600> sure

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
the app from the internet so and be sure

however if you install it in this mode

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.779 
however if you install it in this mode
you<00:05:03.080> are<00:05:03.169> most<00:05:03.410> likely<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:04.250> get<00:05:04.400> a<00:05:04.460> virtual

you are most likely to get a virtual
keyboard<00:05:05.360> in<00:05:06.140> your<00:05:06.200> in<00:05:06.710> your<00:05:06.740> application<00:05:07.580> but
