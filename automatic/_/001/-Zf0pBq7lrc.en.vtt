00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
I did it in this order only because I

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.600 
I did it in this order only because I
only<00:04:36.960> wanted<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.350> first<00:04:37.620> layer<00:04:37.889> of<00:04:38.130> dye<00:04:38.310> in

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
only wanted the first layer of dye in

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.430 
only wanted the first layer of dye in
for<00:04:38.849> 15<00:04:39.270> minutes<00:04:39.539> because<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.780> really<00:04:40.139> wanted<00:04:40.380> a

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440
