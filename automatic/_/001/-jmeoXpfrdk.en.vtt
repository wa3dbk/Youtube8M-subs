00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.499
 hello friends welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.480
 in santi's kitchen we are going to make some 

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:11.600
 exquisite meatballs that we can 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.420
 serve as much as for appetizer or for 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.460
 a starter the ingredients that 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.179
 we are going to need for these meatballs 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:24.169
 how do I do it, I have a kilo 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:26.150
 of bread crumbs a principle that 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.140
 can be from the previous day or old not 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.509
 it is no problem a clove of garlic 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.920
 parsley 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:38.800
 pepper salt a whole egg water and a 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.440
 source to mix 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.320
 As a first step, what we are going to do is 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.160
 grab the bread that we have here and what 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.160
 let's cut into small pieces this well 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.500
 so we cut it because it 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.550
 we are going to add water so that 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.829
 moisten the bread in the meatball is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.589
 essential if we do not put bread 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.899
 mojadito in water the problem that we are going to 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.930
 have is going to come out dry and 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.950
 then the bread brings the moisture that 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.950
 You have to have the meatball 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.579
 One little thing I wanted to tell you was if 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.179
 the bread is old, try to get it out 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.369
 the crumb 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:21.590
 this bread is from today but good does not happen 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.630
 nothing try to get all this friend 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.649
 because it's going to be a little bit like more 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.049
 durita ok 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.479
 good to the pancito that we had cut what 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:34.219
 What we do is add enough water 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:37.039
 so that the bread softens and so on 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.020
 this way we move it a little bit and what 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.170
 let's leave while we prepare the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.289
 meat let's let it absorb everything 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.420
 the water all these proportions that I 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.500
 I gave them to before it's going to be for a kilo of 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.079
 meat 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.049
 This is ground or minced meat that I 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:57.140
 I have you can choose the cut of 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.560
 meat they want and tell the butcher 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.170
 sorry, it's ok ok 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.900
 we disarm like this and now we're going to start 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.030
 add all the ingredients 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.940
 then short 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.370
 We put the parsley to taste to me if I 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.110
 like with a lot of parsley, let's try 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.390
 cut it very small because if we go to 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.390
 make some digita of this size for 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.000
 that the parsley is not so grotesque 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.090
 we are going to salt amount necessary always 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.450
 they have to prove they do not overdo it and 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.400
 Pepper pepper is cute a 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.180
 little finger but also not 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.650
 exceed the and now we are going to beat a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.650
 egg and we're going to add it 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.560
 let's beat the egg 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.270
 perfect , we will also add 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:58.100
 and they saw that this is super easy garlic 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.830
 parsley salt black pepper a little egg and 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.750
 now let's drain the bread we're going to 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.140
 take out all the water and we're going to 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.670
 add to the preparation very well my 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:14.129
 Drained pancito the how is disarmed 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.329
 perfect inside the sources and you're 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:20.129
 and now to mix squeeze and do so 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.010
 like when we play with the bar that 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:26.099
 we were small we sold like this 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.209
 very well to mix well that all the 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:34.950
 meat have egg black pepper garlic 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.010
 and the parsley together with the bread 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.840
 well I recommend this as 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.090
 prepare in an hour before so that the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.810
 garlic the parsley and the meat everything I shot 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.239
 all the flavor and remain mass are addicted or 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.790
 at this moment I'm going to do them so that 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.800
 you see how the work is finished 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.670
 okay 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.610
 good as I'm going to make some meatballs 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.790
 of copetín the ideal is that they are 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.400
 copetín and chiquititas ok then what 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.280
 we do we grab a piece of meat 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.890
 with the mosque and we do well we do 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.630
 a small ball as if it were a 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.459
 you snack this you quietly what 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.590
 can they put in the mouth then of the 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.829
 bite size and pass them 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:24.380
 bodies have grated so is we paid 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.380
 by contracted so perfect 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.849
 we are booking it in a quote source 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.700
 this recipe guys also starts to be 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.880
 so the tiny meatballs can 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.070
 do as I told you before big the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.880
 advantage of this is that you can 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.880
 make a million albondiguitas and the 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.210
 they can separate separately once they 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.670
 glass they put in a bag and there the 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.250
 have prepared then whenever 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.890
 have this some event what they do is 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.140
 today I'm going to take some meatballs or I'm going to 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.410
 take some meatballs for dinner or 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.870
 for lunch and good ok food 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.570
 I'm going to make this last albondiguitas and 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.400
 I'm going to fry them to show you 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.700
 I left of course a lot of 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.320
 filling if you prepare quantity and 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.210
 they are left and they say good I do not want to do 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.050
 more meatball I freese it as well as 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.440
 they can use it 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.990
 I have my pan with sunflower oil 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.690
 ready to fry as we know when the 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.509
 oil is hot wooden spoon 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.090
 in the center when we see that it starts to 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.699
 frying the wooden spoon means 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.750
 which is ideal for frying any other 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:48.289
 little thing they see said this we are going to put 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.950
 very carefully the meatballs 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:55.510
 trick not to burn 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:06:00.780
 we support it and let it fall like a 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.780
 slide ok if they come together we separate them 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.870
 guys, this is controlled and they're going 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:17.310
 turning so they do not burn 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.440
 if it was in a fryer 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.810
 they put it to even kitchen predators 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.060
 but here you have to control and 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:29.360
 turning around and try to stay 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:31.280
 golden couples albondiguitas are 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.719
 I'm going to take them out, I have prepared 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.820
 supposed a quote source with paper 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:39.289
 absorbent 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.689
 and I'm going to put it there 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.490
