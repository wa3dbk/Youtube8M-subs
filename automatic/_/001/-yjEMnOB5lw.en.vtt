bit so I'm going to use the rubber bands
I<00:00:36.239> hold<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.540> down<00:00:37.370> now<00:00:38.450> in<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.690> first<00:00:40.050> video

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
I hold that down now in the first video

I hold that down now in the first video
is<00:00:40.530> yammering<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.070> about<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.610> e<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:45.420> C<00:00:46.579> knowing

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
is yammering on about the e is C knowing

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
is yammering on about the e is C knowing
whether<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> was<00:00:48.030> three<00:00:48.570> years<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> us

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
whether it was three years of to us

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.189 
whether it was three years of to us
where<00:00:49.860> they<00:00:49.950> had<00:00:50.070> an<00:00:50.160> auto<00:00:50.570> self<00:00:51.570> detect<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
where they had an auto self detect and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.799 
where they had an auto self detect and
would<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.280> cut<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:55.879> appropriately<00:00:56.879> well

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
would it cut out appropriately well

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.920 
would it cut out appropriately well
apparently<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.379> did<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:59.480> this<00:01:00.480> little<00:01:00.750> 3

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
apparently it did because this little 3

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.500 
apparently it did because this little 3
cell<00:01:01.109> life<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.559> down<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.960> 9.15<00:01:04.430> volts

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
cell life I was down to one 9.15 volts

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.260 
cell life I was down to one 9.15 volts
so<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.750> 9-volt<00:01:08.360> el<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.869> C<00:01:10.260> cut<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.180> that

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
so the 9-volt el the C cut in so that

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.140 
so the 9-volt el the C cut in so that
knows<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.490> 3<00:01:14.490> cell<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.740> go<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
knows that it's a 3 cell so here we go a

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.550 
knows that it's a 3 cell so here we go a
little<00:01:18.150> beers<00:01:18.450> would<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.720> try<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> bit<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.439> win

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
little beers would I try a bit of win

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.789 
little beers would I try a bit of win

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that way I'm it whoop I will get out of

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.580 
that way I'm it whoop I will get out of
that<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.759> go

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:42.410

going to fly in flat well maybe not

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:04.960 
going to fly in flat well maybe not
let's<00:01:53.790> give<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> bit<00:01:54.119> more<00:01:54.210> sticky

got a bit of wind here we go love look
at<00:02:14.959> those<00:02:15.170> tree<00:02:15.440> lines<00:02:16.450> okay<00:02:17.560> try3<00:02:21.010> s21<00:02:22.010> 80<00:02:22.190> so

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
at those tree lines okay try3 s21 80 so

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.050 
at those tree lines okay try3 s21 80 so
I<00:02:22.520> shouldn't<00:02:22.940> fly<00:02:23.090> for<00:02:23.300> too<00:02:23.450> long

another Doppler I'm right over the tree

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.840 
another Doppler I'm right over the tree
line<00:03:06.799> here

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.960
