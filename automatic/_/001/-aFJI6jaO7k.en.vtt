00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:09.870
 greetings to all readers of 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:12.469
 tuttoandroid.net we are here at the meeting 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.370
 envy to show you the new console 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.530
 presented a few months ago we are 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.080
 obviously talking about media shield 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.599
 so portable console that has like 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.250
 processor the new tegra 4 so much 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.359
 very powerful brought obviously 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.070
 especially for gaming for this 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.900
 reason they mounted on the device of the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.580
 generally they do n't do a little overview 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.599
 what are the doors the keys like 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.780
 first of all it's enough 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.760
 mighty just like as thick as 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 but let's say that it holds well 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.500
 if it is not in hand the display is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.840
 a 5-inch unit obviously we have 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.930
 physical keys to play in the keys 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.170
 directional two analog four sticks 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.199
 physical keys to xd and y two speakers 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.940
 then the stereos and five keys 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.500
 this one serves practically for 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.699
 enter directly into the degradation a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.280
 home button back button key to adjust 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.780
 the volume in the back part instead 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.670
 we have four other physical keys 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.820
 these here practically have triggers 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.620
 two other physical keys above like 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.180
 port instead we have a hdmi port one 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.890
 USB port in this case is connected 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.230
 because the battery is slightly discharged 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 a 3 mm jack and a half and as you see 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.740
 input for microsd to expand the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.450
 internal memory 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.220
 obviously we also have a socket for 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.300
 for the air below in the part 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.010
 lower instead we have nothing 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.450
 let's go for a moment to see what it is 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.160
 the operation of this one of this 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.840
 shield as you see am practically 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.730
 android stop in interface 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.690
 horizontal so it is also quite 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.390
 fluid 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.950
 we have various applications with which 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.570
 we can handle it shield 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.430
 obviously many many games installed 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.840
 first of all have many blue ones for 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.810
 the blue when we start it 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.610
 there will be 33 shield items displayed 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.320
 games child store and pc games 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.930
 we basically need these two styles 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.480
 to download games optimized for 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.160
 shield or classic for android and then 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.670
 to install points on the note 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.130
 on the console 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.260
 this item here a thousand pc games in phase 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.880
 beta as you can see serves as we will see for 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.860
 first carry out a stint one 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.510
 pci streaming on our console e 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.479
 play directly with the controls of the 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.370
 console directly on the PC demonstrates 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.230
 first of all some games 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.110
 let's start the new one, for example 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.530
 riptide gp 2 that we know to be 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.090
 it is practically optimized for 34 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.790
 let's start the game of course 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:32.640
 a little volume so we also see the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:36.390
 audio ability as you also see a lot 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.960
 very fast during loading ever 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.960
 Hello 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.900
 this Lazio accelerates with the key 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.900
 Rhaetian council that sent me first 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.190
 very very fluid no kind of 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.750
 input ament maybe I'll show you 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.750
 some acrobatics 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:21.160
 we see the effects of water indeed 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.660
 really beautiful we go out maybe show 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.190
 some other some other game 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:30.820
 we also have the real boxing we see a 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.270
 moment to start another game too 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.770
 this available for free though 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.560
 optimized for per 4 tegra 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.190
 capacity with graphic capabilities is a lot 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.190
 very high 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.090
 as you can see also in this case a lot 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.170
 very fluid even if we are 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.470
 taking it right to see yourself get done 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.070
 return was more quality, quality 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.070
 graphics on Fri. 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.580
 ok back to the home we show you 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.560
 another interesting feature that 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.180
 they explained us here at the meeting 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.890
 nvidia equal to say as we said it 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.280
 PC streaming to the console let's go to 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.390
 start and there games as you see there is the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.160
 possibility of streaming is 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.070
 especially this test game 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.630
 borderlands 2 let's start it 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.160
 we have already started on our own 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.200
 computer as we will see 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.640
 we have here when we move on 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.400
 console in real time 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.010
 we will also move within the 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.640
 our destiny and maybe we go in search 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.640
 of some enemy 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.740
 we found a little more area 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.740
 crowded we demonstrate in variation 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:03.230
 really very nice to be able to practically 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:05.630
 control the game on PC through gods 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.420
 commands all like those on the 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.980
 consortium 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.290
 I would say that for the moment it is all with 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.980
 nvidia shield emanuele capone for everything 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.980
 android puntonet
