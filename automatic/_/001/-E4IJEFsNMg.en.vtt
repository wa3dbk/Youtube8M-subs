00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.559
 Tell me guys, beauty juninho towers here and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.349
 Welcome and there's another video of ours. 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.960
 D series will buy or not if you are 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.900
 new does not know the series is a series that 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.939
 I'm talking about games that almost 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
 nobody knows the new games that are 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 throwing there and I do kind of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.170
 analysis, we are familiar with the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.140
 We have people here in gt here. 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.450
 2 million of your gay kiss me 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.750
 game already a little old 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.210
 if I'm not mistaken it's from 2006 is a game of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.250
 car cool simulator 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.320
 I already played it a little until r 2 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.480
 It's such a game that we're playing. 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.670
 and has gt r evolution is another game 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.600
 from top of very good car too 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.360
 come on 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.149
 We're meeting the game. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.530
 We are showing you the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:10.549
 people have to games 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:14.460
 We can choose kopschitz and we're going 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.780
 choose whether you want rotations per minute or 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.780
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:36.509
 so let's go racing with others 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.920
 Players also in our here then 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.259
 Let's go to the race. 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.820
 we have also a realism of the game 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.869
 not even 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:53.659
 ps also the option of gasoline in the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:02:08.000
 car do not fuel the car's gas 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:08.000
 ending with a steering wheel 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.900
 with him to simulate and even in a 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.860
 race car so let's go to the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:27.720
 our race 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:31.340
 Let me find here, you 'll touch the team. 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.340
 Look, we will not go here a little bit. 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:41.610
 very much this game I found is the cars 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.310
 they do not have a modeling it's drawings 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.820
 incomplete inside the car it does not 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.110
 is designed by so cute with 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.110
 all the details of the car 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.140
 so uploaded in our game 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.660
 What impresses in this game is the audio 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.400
 neither of the game and we can be 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.569
 choosing we want a better steering wheel 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.730
 lying on the bench lying down or else is 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.260
 close behind the wheel 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.120
 Let's leave here in the middle, let's go. 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.830
 thinking a lot about this game is the audio 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.110
 nor can you see that inside the 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.470
 car is not great things do not have 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.720
 that excellent final modeling for 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:36.180
 who is looking for and simulator of 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:40.459
 Running this game is very good because he 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.580
 Can you live a car perfectly? 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.930
 We have to go to the little 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.360
 right and left drive to 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.350
 Behind us, we 're braking and I put 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.350
 manual 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.310
 for who also likes to be training 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.250
 and it 's like going through these things 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.780
 In this game you can also offer 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:10.350
 you an idea of ​​how the exchange works 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.350
 of gears 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.400
 we have here our wine color 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.240
 so like I already said it 's a cool game 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.490
 for those who like game simulation 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.910
 racing is well in style and even 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.910
 smo singer right 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:44.610
 he is playing on a difficulty is 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.900
 will not be a rookie game stayed one 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.030
 bit easier but if you want 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.229
 have had to put a 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.870
 major difficulty 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:55.979
 just put it in semi pro por 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.220
 For example you will be there with more 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.039
 difficulty is 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:06.380
 and you can see the mother that until new 'and 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.380
 if the game can be difficult right? 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.099
 what helps here is that the game tells you which 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.419
 the male you have to wear in each 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:21.380
 for example now we have to 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:25.130
 decrease the first gear that the curve is 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.130
 well closed 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.770
 I have two videos from do gt r 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.789
 evolution is another game of 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.789
 car simulation 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.690
 in the video description if you want to see 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.090
 a video i spoke on ubs did not 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.199
 ps works the system and another one I said 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.430
 how the gearshift works and in a 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.740
 car right 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.020
 like the idea of ​​the gear shift 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.120
 so if you want to watch here in 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:06:00.890
 description of this video 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:02.960
 then the game is costing more and more. 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.200
 I do not mistake me 16 reais and ninety 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.540
 nine cents on steam is a game for 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.470
 Who really likes running and likes to 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.570
 Pass has a time and playing this game 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.930
 has the multiplayer option 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:22.730
 also 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:25.970
 and like I said to people who like games 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:29.840
 race has two options until the gt 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.410
 r evolution and has this gt r 2 nor faithful 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.410
 this game 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.040
 in my opinion gt r evolution wins 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.300
 not in the final game modeling 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.480
 he already has 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.810
 the pretty dashboard showing the numbering 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.980
 he already has much more final modeling 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.820
 elaborated right 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:56.630
 but in terms of gameplay is almost the 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.060
 same thing if I'm not mistaken already is 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.510
 revolution is kind of an apple mold 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.770
 and if that 7 that is another game of mind 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.010
 simulation run 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.170
 so it's no more for those who like 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.880
 The race will only find this 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.220
 game 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.200
 So if you like this video, let it 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.990
 its range to help in spreading the 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.160
 video and channel and if you go on the channel 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.460
 and signed up to receive the 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:26.000
 updates on your mouth left youtube 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.690
 see you in the next video and see you 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.690
 went
