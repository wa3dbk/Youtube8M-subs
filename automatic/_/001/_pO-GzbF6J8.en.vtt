 who find my works enough 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.220
 interesting to post them in the tape 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.470

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.240
 thank the company wargaming who made

 attention and assists which 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.359
 hard to overestimate and thank you 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.399

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.899
 curious visitors and in quality 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.239
 a little hello to everyone watching this 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.710
 Player in my group in contact until 15 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.050

 and get gold and chances to get a prize for 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.629
 not bad so take part 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.500
 subscribe to the channel subscribe 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.180
 on VKontakte group 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.590
 by the way all the review there goes for the day 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.120
 earlier therefore a separate line 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.620
 I invite all who can not wait to be in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 among the first viewers of new videos 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.670
 but this is certainly not all prevailing 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.020
 practice in the podcast I answer questions 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.430
 who ask me many times in 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.530
 comments and private messages 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 I'll start all the same with the fact that once again 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.739
 remind popular questions that I 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.359
 already answered they keep asking 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.890
 so just briefly list them and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.290
 I will tell you where you can find answers 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.760
 in the first podcast I told why 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.290
 shelling tanks and why at the same 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.420
 I spend time firing so few places in 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.650
 The review also said here that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.450
 happens with reviews in which 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.860
 found blatant errors or with 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.570
 reviews of tanks that undergo 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.270
 significant heavily influencing gameplay 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.189
 change the undisputed leader of all charts 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.659
 so many viewers urgently need a review 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.580
 for some tank of interest to them 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.650
 look for the answer to this question in the second 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.630
 podcast besides here I am talking 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.189
 why reviews are not funny why set 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.360
 skill or equipment may differ 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.579
 on which you expected to see 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.890
 and why opponents in my videos are blue 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.329
 they are red how to achieve this by the way in 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.530
 group vkontakte a few months ago 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.020
 laid out illustrated instructions 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.060
 how to do too if you have xvm in 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.899
 common reindeer 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.759
 finally the third and last for today 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.990
 podcast with answers to questions was 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.790
 released a couple of months ago 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.380
 I'm talking about it in response to the invitation 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.820
 play in a platoon and in a nutshell 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.470
 telling about the laborious creation 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.240
 reviews someday I probably write 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.280
 this process in more detail this topic 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.079
 many really interesting yet I do not know where 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.939
 maybe release a separate video 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.990
 to be told however watch out for the channel 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.299
 everything has its time 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.619
 besides the last podcast I started 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.090
 Gold for your best replays 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.670
 which can be used in reviews 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.200
 conditions are pretty harsh 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.670
 but also fights suitable such conditions 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.980
 every patch on any tank is played 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.780
 enough in principle such a practice to me 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.890
 I hope like it so 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.610
 foreseeable future stock will be 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.319
 continue 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.970
 the only reception of replays now 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.560
 maintained in the VKontakte group in 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.910
 channel header and in the description of this video 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.920
 that many save time on 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.120
 new site registration and replays 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.310
 mainly will be selected from 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.810
 more recent from version 90 too 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.150
 a lot of the improvement in graphics in the game happened 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.650
 so that they are neglected so better fights 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.330
 do not remove and wait for them 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.280
 will review share them with viewers and 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.750
 get gold for it just before 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.920
 read the replay carefully 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.780
 conditions of participation in the action 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.980
 if they donâ€™t perform tons of such replay 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.840
 I wo n't even waste time 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.870
 and now move on to a new popular 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.700
 their questions have accumulated quite a lot 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.049
 what kind of music in a video is usually in a review 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.739
 melodies are used immediacy 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.239
 game client 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.709
 the easiest way and and get downloading 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.810
 official fan kit by look it up 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.160
 site of the game or in Yandex except music 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.600
 there are still many interesting things that can 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.930
 useful beginner is not very happy 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.150
 to business 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.590
 the rest are not game works in volume 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.769
 the number and title of tones saver 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.690
 listed in the description of each video 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.680
 which review will be the next long-term 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.239
 perspective i try to stick 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.890
 orders which is named in the second 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.530
 podcast and which include 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.329
 Reviews of all tt and Fri-Sau 7 on level 10 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.769
 within each episode sometimes 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.269
 small changes are connected for example with 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.010
 release of new branch or game modes 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.359
 a couple of times there were pauses that allowed 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.530
 I need to catch up 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.000
 it was further to release a video on 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.530
 schedule for sure it will be 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.090
 continue to do much harm from 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.380
 I do not see this, however, in general 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.150
 planned order will remain 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.440
 unchanged and the selection sequence 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.850
 tank inside each series of reviews 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.470
 formed generally with rays 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.060
 and the curious viewer will be able to see 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.530
 and at least two weeks in advance 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.230
 it is during this period that I declare a fee 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.790
 replays on the upcoming review step further 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.500
 often not advised to show 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.540
 location of modules and crew in the tank 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.160
 frankly, I myself would be happy if 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.720
 it could be done in every review but 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.640
 unfortunately for most of these tanks 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.319
 data is simply not one time this 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.670
 the information was in the game client but already 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.260
 and for a long time and to get out there and 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.030
 it is not known for certain 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.590
 any changes to existing tanks and 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.620
 exactly how the interior looks 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.030
 new models one more hide nice 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.650
 question do i need any help 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.600
 or even where to transfer cash 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.639
 thank you start with the second part and 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.290
 meaningfully do not publish their financial 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.880
 details of my channel at this stage 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.919
 their development is a hobby they are a way 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.390
 earnings and it seems to me ugly what 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.049
 whatever the form ask you for payment 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.759
 this hobby 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.169
 maybe of course in time something 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.849
 will change but now I have more than 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.159
 enough of your thanks and your likes 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.659
 your subscriptions for help in 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:31.430
 making a video sometimes she really 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.810
 I need not so long ago I created a message 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.490
 with a proposal to participate creation 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.560
 new review on the wall in the group in 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.360
 Contact and people willing to help found 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.190
 very quickly that's why i will 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.530
 come in before glancing and there 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.210
 if there is time and desire and last on 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.430
 today question a favorite tank and 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.650
 perhaps that is no time for me 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.060
 really liked the game on t-44 and now 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.099
 I try to enjoy the game on those tanks 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.539
 who swing who previously could have me 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.789
 even annoy and in general then this 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.900
 It turns out I can give an example 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.520
 about half a year ago reviews almost 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.139
 completely took all the time that I 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.300
 I used to play the game and actually play 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.800
 practically stopped and now when 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.210
 reviews have come back to premium 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.280
 tanks where you need to show profitability 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.259
 cars in a dozen random fights had 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.539
 again take up checkers and such a succession 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.800
 lesions as in the test at15 and I probably 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.990
 not seen not just which of the past 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.610
 long pauses in the game however I give 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.199
 realize that you are guilty of defeat 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.969
 not the molotov tank in my hands 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.710
 who forgot which side of the mouse left 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.210
 the button is slow, not very convenient 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.279
 the car turned out to be quite capable to influence 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.840
 on will not be as I would like not 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:28.849
 as I used to on mobile tanks but 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.050
 not less and i'm sure my time like 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.479
 they will come back and try to pick up 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.279
 key and and gameplay and on this I have everything 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.409
 going back to the beginning of this podcast i 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.550
 once again thank all viewers 50,000 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.900
 Subscribers I perceive as 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.520
 absolute indication that my 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.590
 work is useful that my work is in demand 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.060
 and of course I am very happy about it therefore 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.590
 after completing scheduled reviews 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.000
 I will definitely offer you new topics 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.520
 new interesting and useful videos 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.120
 see you next review with respect 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.120
