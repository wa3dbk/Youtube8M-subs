00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.859
 in the sikkim 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.130
 the port 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.130
 now it's done it's done 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.740
 why the couple 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.020
 or not 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.890
 fathers 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.490

 m 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.520

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.280
 the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 race what 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.550
 for all 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.550
 is it possible 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.550
 two fleets 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.730
 it's a month so it does not come out 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.730
 almost automatically zone 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.160
 even if 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.020
 the media reports not all the bells like that would have even 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.000
 proposed passing through that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.110
 I'm wondering that six solutions 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.640
 but that's what I think I have a 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.640
 so I'm very happy with my goal both 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.060
 the afp the list of its victims is a bit it's not a joke the victims 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 minc at the same time the contest theme all starts 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.810
 three themes 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 besides in my 4th of the previous 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.800
 in week 3 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.989
 is that there is a degree of that 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.989
 but 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.969
 then these scenes 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.759
 this basin 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.939
 then cm

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.619
 united in a bus
