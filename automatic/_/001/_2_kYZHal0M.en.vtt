turnabout this is more commonly known as
a<00:00:23.550> three-point<00:00:24.090> turn<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.990> they've<00:00:25.140> changed

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
a three-point turn but they've changed

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.929 
a three-point turn but they've changed
the<00:00:25.619> name<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.070> because<00:00:26.250> you're<00:00:26.519> simply<00:00:26.849> you

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939

anymore if you find yourself for

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.269 
anymore if you find yourself for
narrower<00:00:30.660> road<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.500> main<00:00:31.740> aim<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.130> you

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
narrower road the main aim is that you

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.160 
narrower road the main aim is that you
don't<00:00:32.550> hit<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> kerb<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.390> if<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.840> takes<00:00:34.020> you

don't hit the kerb and if it takes you

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.229 
don't hit the kerb and if it takes you
five<00:00:34.380> points<00:00:34.829> or<00:00:34.980> sometimes<00:00:35.579> even<00:00:35.730> seven

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
five points or sometimes even seven

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.049 
five points or sometimes even seven
points<00:00:36.570> there's<00:00:36.989> no<00:00:37.140> problem<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:38.059> when

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
points there's no problem with that when

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.280 
points there's no problem with that when
you<00:00:39.180> took<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:39.450> you're<00:00:39.600> told<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.899> pull<00:00:40.140> into

you took when you're told to pull into

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
you took when you're told to pull into
the<00:00:40.530> turnabout<00:00:41.160> make<00:00:41.550> sure<00:00:41.730> you're<00:00:41.879> not

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the turnabout make sure you're not

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.560 
the turnabout make sure you're not
obstructing<00:00:42.570> any<00:00:42.690> entrances<00:00:44.210> for<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> turn

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
obstructing any entrances for the turn

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
obstructing any entrances for the turn
about<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.050> aim<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.649> drive<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.070> slow

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
about your aim is that you drive as slow

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.979 
about your aim is that you drive as slow
as<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.610> which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.420> done<00:00:48.629> by<00:00:48.780> controlling

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
as you can which is done by controlling

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.540 
as you can which is done by controlling
the<00:00:49.440> speed<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.890> car<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> clutch

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the speed of the car with the clutch

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
the speed of the car with the clutch
while<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.390> turning<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.780> wheel<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.079> quick<00:00:52.289> as

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
while it's turning the wheel as quick as

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.910 
while it's turning the wheel as quick as
you<00:00:52.559> can

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
you can

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.340 
you can
the<00:00:53.789> biggest<00:00:54.030> failing<00:00:54.570> points<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> test

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the biggest failing points in the test

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
the biggest failing points in the test
and<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.829> very<00:00:56.010> important<00:00:56.699> tend<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> be

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and this is very important tend to be

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.170 
and this is very important tend to be
observation<00:00:58.530> about<00:00:58.800> 50%<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> people<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.059> do

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
observation about 50% of people that do

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.849 
observation about 50% of people that do
the<00:01:00.329> turn<00:01:00.510> about<00:01:00.840> even<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.440> pass<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the turn about even if they pass the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:02.260 
the turn about even if they pass the
test

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
test

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.240 
test
jet<00:01:03.270> tend<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> fail<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> lack<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.589> observation

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
jet tend to fail and lack of observation

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.120 
jet tend to fail and lack of observation
so<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.689> I'm<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> simply<00:01:08.010> you've

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so what I'm going to do is simply you've

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.390 
so what I'm going to do is simply you've
got<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.400> watch<00:01:08.990> go<00:01:09.990> practice<00:01:10.530> watch<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.280> again

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
got to watch go practice watch it again

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.760 
got to watch go practice watch it again
and<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.909> aim<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> copy<00:01:12.840> exactly<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> do

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
and just aim to copy exactly what I do

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.130 
and just aim to copy exactly what I do
so<00:01:14.670> first<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.180> all<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> follow<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
so first of all I'm going to follow the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
so first of all I'm going to follow the
procedure<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.770> moving<00:01:16.950> off<00:01:17.220> which<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.610> check

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
procedure for moving off which is check

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.719 
procedure for moving off which is check
my<00:01:17.939> mirror<00:01:18.229> signal<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> first<00:01:20.490> gear

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
my mirror signal for the first gear

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.149 
my mirror signal for the first gear
check<00:01:20.970> my<00:01:21.119> side<00:01:21.360> mirror<00:01:21.659> check<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.560> blind<00:01:22.830> spot

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
check my side mirror check my blind spot

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.920 
check my side mirror check my blind spot
I'm<00:01:23.340> delaying<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.299> these<00:01:24.479> now<00:01:24.659> there<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.900> a

going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> avoid<00:01:46.799> dry<00:01:47.100> steering<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:48.000> is

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
going to avoid dry steering which is

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.249 
going to avoid dry steering which is
turning<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.570> wheel<00:01:48.720> when<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> car<00:01:49.170> is

road was a lot narrower when doing the

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.750 
road was a lot narrower when doing the
turn<00:04:09.510> about<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:10.200> key<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:11.100> drive<00:04:11.400> slowly

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
turn about the key is to drive slowly

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.070 
turn about the key is to drive slowly
steer<00:04:12.510> quickly<00:04:13.040> do<00:04:14.040> not<00:04:14.250> bump<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.700> car
