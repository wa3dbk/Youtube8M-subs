at<00:00:40.469> doing<00:00:40.559> something<00:00:41.040> special<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> near

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
at doing something special in the near

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.080 
at doing something special in the near
future<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.510> would<00:00:43.170> say<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.770> is

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
future I would say that this is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
future I would say that this is
supposedly<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> best<00:00:45.660> talented<00:00:46.230> most

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
supposedly one of the best talented most

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.319 
supposedly one of the best talented most
talented<00:00:47.100> teams<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.579> Quinnipiac<00:00:47.969> has<00:00:48.149> had

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
talented teams that Quinnipiac has had

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.869 
talented teams that Quinnipiac has had
and<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.079> while<00:00:49.610> certainly<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
and one in a while certainly with the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.900 
and one in a while certainly with the
leaders<00:00:51.620> such<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.649> r<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.949> egress<00:00:53.280> Ryan<00:00:53.610> Rizzo

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
leaders such as r and egress Ryan Rizzo

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.510 
leaders such as r and egress Ryan Rizzo
and<00:00:54.030> paddy<00:00:54.239> Egan<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.070> with<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.160> leadership

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and paddy Egan and with that leadership

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.619 
and paddy Egan and with that leadership
I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:56.820> they're<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> take<00:00:57.390> us

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
I think they're going to take us

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.810 
I think they're going to take us
definitely<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.500> NEC<00:00:58.829> championship<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.699> then

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
definitely to NEC championship and then

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.420 
definitely to NEC championship and then
hopefully<00:01:00.350> do<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.379> damage<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> regional

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
hopefully do some damage in the regional

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.880 
hopefully do some damage in the regional
tournament<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.260> you're<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> sophomore<00:01:04.619> now
