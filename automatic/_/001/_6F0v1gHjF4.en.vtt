00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.539
 we love trees and therefore 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.959
 we add value for what people throw in a museum or a daily product 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.779
 starting from recycled corrugated cardboard sequels and forms so 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:20.590
 versatile as 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.900
 a brick 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.119
 a shelf 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.109

 has a lot of pull coresponsables has a lot of translation engineering I'll have 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.090
 with works 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.190
 the corrugated cardboard that according to the technical data and final use of the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.780
 product compact the frequency in which they send corrugated on the backs of 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.500
 paper 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.860
 to provide 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.429
 more pressure distributor 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.129
 per surface people are used to corrugated cardboard as a box that 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.280
 it breaks all 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.500
 but you, well, your pressure on this 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.230
 short cheese thousand 700 kilos we have done in everyday products very 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.680
 simple 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.570
 what is a bank 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.740
 that has the advantage that beings aroma 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.990
 two floors 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.649
 and if it is successful to the fact I can leave hanging wish I hope people will say 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.310
 us or showed we use recycle we will reduce rethink 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.990
 we generate value to the product 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.170
 what you wanted the ecotrans rallies that 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.500
 There is a formula for many more to get more for less all cardboard 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.400
 all for the castreño 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370
 by the way a touch weigh 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.620
 less than five kilos that do not have nails that walk shipyards 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.620
 that however it costs less and they also would work as a 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.480
 foolish a banks chairs 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.460
 in total there are things like a recycled corrugated coffin for the dead not 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.040
