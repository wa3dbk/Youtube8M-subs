scale<00:01:21.640> we<00:01:22.539> were<00:01:22.660> hoping<00:01:22.780> it<00:01:22.960> was<00:01:23.080> going<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.289> be

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
scale we were hoping it was going to be

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.490 
scale we were hoping it was going to be
125th<00:01:24.069> scale<00:01:24.520> when<00:01:24.789> I<00:01:24.819> saw<00:01:25.149> it<00:01:25.210> but<00:01:26.020> as<00:01:26.259> you'll

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
125th scale when I saw it but as you'll

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.980 
125th scale when I saw it but as you'll
see<00:01:26.710> later<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:28.119> a<00:01:28.210> little<00:01:28.569> smaller<00:01:28.869> than

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
see later it's a little smaller than

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.930 
see later it's a little smaller than
that<00:01:29.170> even<00:01:29.440> here<00:01:30.009> it<00:01:30.100> is<00:01:30.160> with<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.460> sidecar

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
that even here it is with the sidecar

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.180 
that even here it is with the sidecar
out<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.270> sidecar<00:01:31.750> go-kart<00:01:32.229> Robin's<00:01:32.679> go<00:01:32.890> kart

out the sidecar go-kart Robin's go kart

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.790 
out the sidecar go-kart Robin's go kart
coming<00:01:33.970> out<00:01:34.090> it's<00:01:34.509> obviously<00:01:35.050> based<00:01:35.319> on<00:01:35.619> the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
coming out it's obviously based on the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.550 
coming out it's obviously based on the
original<00:01:35.920> Aurora<00:01:36.840> bat-cycle<00:01:37.840> molds<00:01:38.380> as<00:01:38.470> you

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
original Aurora bat-cycle molds as you

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.499 
original Aurora bat-cycle molds as you
can<00:01:38.709> see<00:01:38.830> here's<00:01:39.069> the<00:01:39.130> Aurora<00:01:39.490> which<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:39.850> 119

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
can see here's the Aurora which is 119

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.949 
can see here's the Aurora which is 119
scale<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.860> really<00:01:42.459> dwarfs<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.119> the

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
scale and it really dwarfs the the

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.809 
scale and it really dwarfs the the

next<00:01:48.819> to<00:01:48.940> it<00:01:49.060> but<00:01:49.360> obviously<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.289> same<00:01:50.530> molds

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
next to it but obviously the same molds

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.430 
next to it but obviously the same molds
were<00:01:51.100> used<00:01:51.340> or<00:01:51.610> scanned<00:01:52.000> here<00:01:52.720> is<00:01:52.869> this<00:01:53.259> is

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
were used or scanned here is this is

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.020 
were used or scanned here is this is
about<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.740> closest<00:01:54.130> Batmobile<00:01:54.550> I<00:01:54.610> could<00:01:54.789> find

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
about the closest Batmobile I could find

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.400 
about the closest Batmobile I could find
to<00:01:55.209> the<00:01:55.240> right<00:01:55.450> scale<00:01:55.780> it's<00:01:56.020> one<00:01:56.200> thirty

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
to the right scale it's one thirty

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.070 
to the right scale it's one thirty
second<00:01:56.890> scale<00:01:57.100> this<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.240> ideal<00:01:58.539> Batmobile

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
second scale this is the ideal Batmobile

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.870

which<00:01:59.259> is<00:01:59.440> exactly<00:01:59.709> the<00:02:00.160> same<00:02:00.340> as<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.520> Aurora

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
which is exactly the same as the Aurora

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.150 
which is exactly the same as the Aurora
Batmobile<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:02.289> as<00:02:02.560> people<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:02.890> been<00:02:03.009> asking

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.880 
Batmobile and as people have been asking
here<00:02:03.640> are<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.880> here<00:02:04.270> are<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.450> Aurora

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
here are the here are the Aurora

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
batcycle and as you can see they're way

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.949 
batcycle and as you can see they're way
too<00:02:09.130> big<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.209> that's<00:02:10.360> about<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.569> for<00:02:10.690> this

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
too big so that's about it for this
