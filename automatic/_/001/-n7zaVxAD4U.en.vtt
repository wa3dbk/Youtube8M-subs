00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.570
 hi of the gold world today i'm coming back 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.400
 for a little video idea that was me 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.290
 blown by someone on instagram 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.809
 it's a video about my perfumes 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.609
 favorite or perfumes of the moment so 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.789
 why both simply because 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.150
 that in my perfumes of the moment there is a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:30.179
 perfume especially that actually I put 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.160
 for more than 14 years and here I am 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.780
 for a very long time and I 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.880
 continue to see her in my collection and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.640
 when I have more I buy it and it's 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.829
 really my perfume so I will keep 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.030
 this one for the end I start with 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.430
 others 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.649
 the last one I bought in date is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 roberto cavalli's 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.940
 because this one bah it's not 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.219
 complicated it feels summer is here I find 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.719
 that he has an odor that makes I go 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.640
 go on vacation I go to the sea 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.590
 here I think it's really a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.530
 super nice fresh smell for 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.830
 continue on perfumes to his old 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.080
 in quotation marks my timeless water 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.330
 of issey miyake for women in a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.530
 flask trip a 5 that was it actually to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.549
 the base that's why it's a small 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.799
 which is almost empty 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.950
 and that's going to be the scent I had 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.060
 rather tend to put out 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.470
 before having roberto cavalli's 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.939
 because we were really good, here I am 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.590
 also for going out here they are that's it 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.689
 part of my darlings really there 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.700
 ceignac and I love the smells of his 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.340
 perfumes and this one especially I 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.200
 continue on basic for all 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.020
 days but an odor I find that makes 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.900
 cool that makes it clean that really gives 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.659
 yes that's a feeling of freshness 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.579
 and it's just white musk 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.590
 from the body shop 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.000
 so in fact it's not complicated the smell 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.200
 is so nice that I can even 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.790
 put to my four-year-old daughter 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.720
 is not something that shocks me 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.960
 find it's enough in other way a 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.090
 smell of fresh cleans it's really 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.439
 at not like fresh laundry 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.079
 out of the machine but which are a 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.250
 little bit the musk so very very nice 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.229
 if you do not know, I advise you 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.270
 to really smell is the perfume 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.129
 for every day to have on hand 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.830
 it's then the whole family can 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.210
 put it's great then a perfume 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.620
 is a little bit particular 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.170
 I do not know if from time to time you 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.210
 are curious and you like to feel 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.350
 a little bit of perfumes in the 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.180
 places where we are not supposed to find 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.280
 of perfume it turns out that I 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.180
 walking to zara for my kids and 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.410
 that when I saw that they had 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.820
 children's perfumes I told myself 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.100
 what does it feel like I'm going 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.970
 feel is actually the one for girls 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.400
 without really extremely good if you 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.030
 know the limited editions escada 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.730
 summer it reminds me downright one of 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.370
 old editions dia at least him 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.670
 saying easy it a kind of smells 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.590
 fruity style lemon grapefruit got very 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.180
 very cool and at least they love and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.710
 this limited edition of escada bah en 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.680
 did when I felt that I said to my 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.820
 girl 8 go ahead take it by telling me you 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.840
 waking up poking a little bit of time 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.030
 in time it will be cool 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.920
 so that's officially it's up to me 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.840
 girl but I assure you it centers at 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.100
 bound and the limit feel it on her 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.630
 it's even more fun because 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.130
 when I wear the perfume vaguely I 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.140
 meaning more so if you are curious 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.030
 go to zara who do perfumes for 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.710
 sarah kids leave the one for girls 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.270
 in any case without too much good I took 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.950
 that of a boy to my son after me 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.830
 here is it smell more boys so 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.800
 it's less my thing super deal is 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.720
 so my favorite perfume of all time 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.850
 well you'll guess what's my 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.650
 favorite perfume of all time all the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.060
 time but now and again 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.730
 it's because it's a fragrance 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.610
 remind the mother who reminds me I know 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.020
 not surfing really did not 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.220
 I can not explain to you that's it 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.810
 a crush I had for this perfume 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.940
 then it remained to me 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.950
 I still love it so much is the cool or 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.200
 height of davidoff I do not know if you 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.520
 know this smell it's a fragrance 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.240
 a little bit special 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.900
 it's not not really feminine 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.280
 even if it's the one for women 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.210
 yeah I do not know I could not 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.680
 you explain it should you 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.110
 go and smell it in store it's a 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.160
 particular smell but I even because 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.170
 that it seems like I'm nil for 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.960
 describe the smells but here it is 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.940
 it's my perfume the one I buy 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.470
 really every time so much he has 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.870
 I once had not bought them 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.670
 here is it there the bottle here 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.870
 this is one of my most recent bottle 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.820
 but I have empty bottles that are 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.320
 wander right and left and I like 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.540
 a lot for a mossi but that's it 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.730
 the one for women is just stop 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.030
 if I had to tell myself a perfume that would 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.440
 represents this is this one all 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.700
 for this little video a little bit 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.080
 short but at the same time I did not want 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.220
 not to present you all the perfumes 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.700
 from the collection because I have 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.620
 a lot 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.180
 I really stay on the 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.010
 essentials ie what I like 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.290
 is to take out my scent of all 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.240
 favorite times and then the few 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.820
 little perfume not too expensive as 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.410
 that of body shop and zahra that have 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.890
 smells that are just falling out and 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.870
 which are not excessively expensive so 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.130
 really accessible for all the boroughs 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.050
