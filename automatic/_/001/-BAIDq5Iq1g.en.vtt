00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
the phone and it performed fairly well

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.630 
the phone and it performed fairly well
you<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.860> listen<00:02:18.250> through<00:02:18.550> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
you do have to listen through the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.790 
you do have to listen through the
speaker<00:02:19.210> so<00:02:19.570> you're<00:02:20.140> not<00:02:20.260> going<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.500> be<00:02:20.650> able

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
speaker so you're not going to be able

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.030 
speaker so you're not going to be able
to<00:02:21.070> talk<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.550> people<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:22.170> public<00:02:23.170> as<00:02:23.350> it'll

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
to talk to people in public as it'll

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.220 
to talk to people in public as it'll
probably<00:02:24.280> add<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:25.090> lot<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.450> background<00:02:25.780> noise

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
probably add a lot of background noise

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.170 
probably add a lot of background noise
and<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:27.010> don't<00:02:27.340> think<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.700> want<00:02:27.880> people

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180

first<00:02:52.540> we're<00:02:52.840> trying<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.170> get<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.470> biggest

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
first we're trying to get the biggest

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.460 
first we're trying to get the biggest
biggest<00:02:54.640> phone<00:02:55.300> that<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.600> could<00:02:55.750> possibly<00:02:55.960> get

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
biggest phone that we could possibly get

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.800 
biggest phone that we could possibly get
with<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.800> biggest<00:02:57.160> screen<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.700> now<00:02:58.390> suddenly

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
with the biggest screen and now suddenly

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.680 
with the biggest screen and now suddenly
we're<00:02:59.620> kind<00:02:59.830> of<00:02:59.920> switching<00:03:00.430> back<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.700> the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
we're kind of switching back to the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.410 
we're kind of switching back to the
small<00:03:02.020> screens<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.620> feel<00:03:02.860> more<00:03:03.070> compact<00:03:03.760> so

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
small screens that feel more compact so

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.910 
small screens that feel more compact so
yeah<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.840> don't<00:03:05.050> think<00:03:05.230> any<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.680> thought

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
yeah I don't think any of you thought

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.070 
yeah I don't think any of you thought
two<00:03:06.220> years<00:03:06.250> ago<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:06.970> your<00:03:07.150> phone<00:03:07.510> would<00:03:07.900> be

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
two years ago that your phone would be

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.130 
two years ago that your phone would be
able<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.500> fit<00:03:09.100> on<00:03:09.340> your<00:03:09.490> wrist<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:10.270> I<00:03:11.020> know

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
able to fit on your wrist and I know

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.360 
able to fit on your wrist and I know
what<00:03:11.290> you're<00:03:11.380> thinking<00:03:11.800> how<00:03:12.100> are<00:03:12.250> you

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
what you're thinking how are you

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.700 
what you're thinking how are you
supposed<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:12.970> type<00:03:13.300> on<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.600> display<00:03:14.260> that's<00:03:14.500> so

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
supposed to type on a display that's so

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.580 
supposed to type on a display that's so
small<00:03:15.130> well<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.270> beginning<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.990> does<00:03:17.380> take

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
small well in the beginning it does take

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.280 
small well in the beginning it does take
some<00:03:17.620> learning<00:03:18.430> curve<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.700> get<00:03:19.030> used<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.510> but

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
some learning curve to get used to but

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.110 
some learning curve to get used to but
the<00:03:20.350> best<00:03:20.650> thing<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.400> do<00:03:21.640> get<00:03:21.820> a<00:03:21.850> plea

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
the best thing is that you do get a plea

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.270 
the best thing is that you do get a plea
store<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.020> can<00:03:23.230> go<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.590> install<00:03:23.980> any

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
store so you can go and install any

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.030 
store so you can go and install any
third-party<00:03:25.020> keyboard<00:03:26.020> that<00:03:26.230> there<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.680> and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
third-party keyboard that there is and

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.820 
third-party keyboard that there is and
there<00:03:27.760> are<00:03:27.880> specific<00:03:28.560> keyboards<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.739> are

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
there are specific keyboards that are

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.920 
there are specific keyboards that are
being<00:03:30.010> made<00:03:30.310> for<00:03:30.340> smartwatches<00:03:31.209> so

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
being made for smartwatches so

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.660 
being made for smartwatches so
definitely<00:03:32.380> stay<00:03:32.680> tuned<00:03:32.950> for<00:03:33.220> that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
definitely stay tuned for that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.660 
definitely stay tuned for that
so<00:03:34.600> now<00:03:34.780> let's<00:03:35.020> pop<00:03:35.290> up<00:03:35.470> into<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.980> settings<00:03:36.430> of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
options that we do get to customize on

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.580 
options that we do get to customize on
our<00:03:41.890> SmartWatch<00:03:42.520> if<00:03:43.330> we<00:03:43.570> pop<00:03:43.810> in<00:03:43.989> we<00:03:44.200> do<00:03:44.350> get

our SmartWatch if we pop in we do get

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.490 
our SmartWatch if we pop in we do get
some<00:03:44.800> different<00:03:45.190> sections<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:47.230> one<00:03:47.380> that

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
some different sections and the one that

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.020 
some different sections and the one that
I<00:03:47.560> want<00:03:47.770> to<00:03:47.830> focus<00:03:48.040> on<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:50.050> system<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.910> if

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
I want to focus on is the system so if

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.360 
I want to focus on is the system so if
we<00:03:52.150> open<00:03:52.420> up<00:03:52.510> system<00:03:53.080> this<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.709> where<00:03:53.920> most<00:03:54.130> of

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
we open up system this is where most of

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.570 
we open up system this is where most of
our<00:03:54.489> customization<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:55.930> gonna<00:03:56.260> happen<00:03:56.620> we<00:03:57.430> do

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
our customization is gonna happen we do

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.520 
our customization is gonna happen we do
get<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.790> customized<00:03:58.360> our<00:03:58.570> notification

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530

get a customized our notification
section<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.880> then<00:04:01.060> we<00:04:01.180> get<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.510> probably<00:04:01.750> the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
section and then we get to probably the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.750 
section and then we get to probably the
most<00:04:02.200> interesting<00:04:02.620> settings<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.580> that's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
most interesting settings and that's

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.030 
most interesting settings and that's
under<00:04:04.090> display<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.930> this<00:04:05.410> is<00:04:05.620> where<00:04:05.770> we<00:04:05.890> can

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
under display and this is where we can

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.490 
under display and this is where we can
go<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.580> change<00:04:07.030> our<00:04:07.330> clock<00:04:07.750> faces<00:04:08.080> as

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
go and change our clock faces as

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.360 
go and change our clock faces as
remember<00:04:09.370> this<00:04:09.550> still<00:04:09.850> is<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.420> smart<00:04:10.989> watch<00:04:11.530> so

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
remember this still is a smart watch so

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.699 
remember this still is a smart watch so
it<00:04:12.670> does<00:04:12.910> have<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.480> bunch<00:04:13.840> of<00:04:14.080> different<00:04:14.260> clock

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
it does have a bunch of different clock

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.180 
it does have a bunch of different clock
options<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.850> go<00:04:16.060> through<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:17.410> clock<00:04:17.650> options

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
options to go through the clock options

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.270 
options to go through the clock options
range<00:04:18.609> from<00:04:18.700> digital<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.630> analog<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.500> one

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
range from digital to analog and one

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.130 
range from digital to analog and one
that<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.489> chose<00:04:21.730> here<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.360> analog<00:04:22.810> clock

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
that I chose here is the analog clock

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.710 
that I chose here is the analog clock
and<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:24.070> looks<00:04:24.280> really<00:04:24.610> good<00:04:24.789> on<00:04:25.000> this<00:04:25.270> display

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
and it looks really good on this display

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.750 
and it looks really good on this display
one<00:04:27.320> option<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:27.710> will<00:04:27.920> hopefully<00:04:28.070> be<00:04:28.430> added

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
one option that will hopefully be added

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.940 
one option that will hopefully be added
in<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:28.970> near<00:04:29.180> future<00:04:29.420> is<00:04:29.840> for<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.380> clock<00:04:30.710> to

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
in the near future is for the clock to

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.370 
in the near future is for the clock to
always<00:04:31.280> be<00:04:31.520> seen<00:04:31.880> even<00:04:32.540> when<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:33.050> locked

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
always be seen even when it is locked

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.590 
always be seen even when it is locked
because<00:04:33.650> as<00:04:33.980> of<00:04:34.190> now<00:04:34.400> when<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.030> is<00:04:35.180> locked<00:04:35.390> you

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
because as of now when it is locked you

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.120 
because as of now when it is locked you
have<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.810> click<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.170> power<00:04:36.380> button<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.830> see

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
have to click the power button to see

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.690 
have to click the power button to see
the<00:04:37.160> time<00:04:37.640> which<00:04:38.300> can<00:04:38.570> be<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.750> problem<00:04:39.670> when<00:04:40.670> I

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
the time which can be a problem when I

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.340 
the time which can be a problem when I
mentioned<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.270> buttons<00:04:41.630> you<00:04:41.690> didn't<00:04:42.050> hear<00:04:42.230> me

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
mentioned the buttons you didn't hear me

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.200 
mentioned the buttons you didn't hear me
mention<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.890> back<00:04:43.100> button<00:04:43.490> or<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:43.880> Menu

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
mention the back button or the Menu

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.210 
mention the back button or the Menu
button<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.690> they<00:04:45.110> have<00:04:45.230> special<00:04:45.530> gestures

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
button and they have special gestures

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.640 
button and they have special gestures
for<00:04:46.520> that<00:04:46.670> so<00:04:47.390> here's<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.990> power<00:04:48.200> button<00:04:48.560> at

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
for that so here's the power button at

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.130 
for that so here's the power button at
the<00:04:48.770> top<00:04:49.010> as<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.340> showed<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:49.610> before<00:04:49.850> to<00:04:50.690> unlock

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
the top as I showed you before to unlock

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.250 
the top as I showed you before to unlock
the<00:04:51.320> device<00:04:51.650> then<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.820> bottom<00:04:53.480> button<00:04:53.780> is<00:04:53.990> for

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
the device then the bottom button is for

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.070 
the device then the bottom button is for
accessing<00:04:55.010> your<00:04:55.460> home<00:04:55.730> and<00:04:56.030> then<00:04:56.630> we<00:04:56.750> get<00:04:56.870> the

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
accessing your home and then we get the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.290 
accessing your home and then we get the
two<00:04:57.290> other<00:04:57.590> gestures<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:58.550> if<00:04:58.610> we<00:04:58.730> pop<00:04:58.940> up<00:04:59.120> into

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
two other gestures so if we pop up into

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.600 
two other gestures so if we pop up into
app<00:04:59.570> like<00:04:59.840> settings<00:05:00.350> if<00:05:00.620> you<00:05:00.830> swipe<00:05:01.280> from<00:05:01.520> the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
app like settings if you swipe from the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.060 
app like settings if you swipe from the
right<00:05:01.880> side<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.450> screen<00:05:02.630> then<00:05:03.590> you

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
right side of the screen then you

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.210 
right side of the screen then you
basically<00:05:04.820> hit<00:05:05.420> the<00:05:05.450> back<00:05:05.780> button<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.220> we

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
basically hit the back button and we

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.920 
basically hit the back button and we
could<00:05:07.400> do<00:05:07.490> this<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.670> couple<00:05:08.120> more<00:05:08.240> times<00:05:08.300> just

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
could do this a couple more times just

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.730 
could do this a couple more times just
to<00:05:09.110> show<00:05:09.410> you<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:10.010> it<00:05:10.880> does<00:05:11.240> sometimes<00:05:11.840> cause

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
to show you and it does sometimes cause

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.820 
to show you and it does sometimes cause
accidental<00:05:13.580> presses<00:05:14.300> so<00:05:14.840> if<00:05:14.960> we<00:05:15.080> go<00:05:15.230> into<00:05:15.440> an

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
accidental presses so if we go into an

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.290 
accidental presses so if we go into an
app<00:05:16.460> that<00:05:17.150> I<00:05:17.180> installed<00:05:17.690> like<00:05:17.990> XDA<00:05:19.300> which

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
app that I installed like XDA which

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.540 
app that I installed like XDA which
again<00:05:20.690> loads<00:05:20.990> fairly<00:05:21.410> quickly<00:05:21.680> with<00:05:22.040> the<00:05:22.250> fast

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
again loads fairly quickly with the fast

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.710 
again loads fairly quickly with the fast
processor<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:24.250> let<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.520> load<00:05:25.700> and<00:05:26.030> then<00:05:26.300> if<00:05:26.510> we

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
processor and let it load and then if we

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.140 
processor and let it load and then if we
go<00:05:26.900> into<00:05:27.080> any<00:05:27.290> section<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.040> swipe<00:05:28.850> from<00:05:29.060> the

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
go into any section and swipe from the

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.780 
go into any section and swipe from the
right<00:05:29.300> again<00:05:30.020> as<00:05:30.530> you<00:05:31.070> can<00:05:31.100> see<00:05:31.220> it<00:05:31.490> did<00:05:31.640> go

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
right again as you can see it did go

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.430 
right again as you can see it did go
back<00:05:32.000> but<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.360> did<00:05:32.510> accidentally<00:05:33.140> click

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
back but it did accidentally click

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.920 
back but it did accidentally click
something<00:05:33.890> too<00:05:34.160> so<00:05:35.000> that<00:05:35.180> might<00:05:35.390> be<00:05:35.540> a<00:05:35.570> problem

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
something too so that might be a problem

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.409 
something too so that might be a problem
sometimes<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:37.040> if<00:05:37.669> we<00:05:37.790> swipe<00:05:38.060> from<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.330> left

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
sometimes and if we swipe from the left

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.320 
sometimes and if we swipe from the left
that<00:05:38.990> opens<00:05:39.530> up<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:40.160> menu<00:05:40.550> so<00:05:40.880> if<00:05:40.910> we<00:05:41.060> swipe

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
that opens up the menu so if we swipe

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.080 
that opens up the menu so if we swipe
again<00:05:41.540> there's<00:05:42.320> the<00:05:42.560> menu<00:05:42.830> right<00:05:43.010> there<00:05:43.340> so

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
again there's the menu right there so

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.450 
again there's the menu right there so
that's<00:05:44.300> how<00:05:44.480> you<00:05:44.540> use<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.590> gestures<00:05:46.070> on<00:05:46.310> the

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
that's how you use the gestures on the

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.120 
that's how you use the gestures on the
device<00:05:46.900> so<00:05:47.900> as<00:05:48.020> I<00:05:48.140> mentioned<00:05:48.620> it<00:05:48.710> does<00:05:48.860> come

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
device so as I mentioned it does come

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.920 
device so as I mentioned it does come
with<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.310> camera<00:05:49.760> and<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.120> camera<00:05:50.150> is<00:05:50.540> a<00:05:50.660> 3

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
with a camera and the camera is a 3

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.560 
with a camera and the camera is a 3
megapixel<00:05:51.680> camera<00:05:52.100> now<00:05:52.700> I<00:05:52.730> don't<00:05:53.000> suggest<00:05:53.180> you

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
megapixel camera now I don't suggest you

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.480 
megapixel camera now I don't suggest you
using<00:05:53.960> it<00:05:54.080> as<00:05:54.200> it's<00:05:54.440> very<00:05:54.710> awkward<00:05:55.160> to<00:05:55.280> take

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
using it as it's very awkward to take

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.210 
using it as it's very awkward to take
pictures<00:05:56.000> on<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.350> SmartWatch<00:05:57.380> so<00:05:57.740> definitely

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
pictures on a SmartWatch so definitely

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.330 
pictures on a SmartWatch so definitely
carry<00:05:58.520> around<00:05:58.700> an<00:05:59.150> extra<00:05:59.630> camera<00:06:00.350> if<00:06:00.530> you<00:06:01.160> are

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
carry around an extra camera if you are

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.420 
carry around an extra camera if you are
gonna<00:06:01.490> use<00:06:01.730> this<00:06:01.910> as<00:06:02.150> your<00:06:02.330> main<00:06:02.540> device<00:06:03.430> last

but<00:06:04.730> definitely<00:06:04.850> not<00:06:05.210> least<00:06:05.419> was<00:06:06.110> the<00:06:06.140> battery

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
but definitely not least was the battery

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.580 
but definitely not least was the battery
life<00:06:06.919> and<00:06:07.280> it<00:06:07.820> was<00:06:08.060> great<00:06:08.480> I<00:06:08.690> was<00:06:08.720> able<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.410> get

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.610 
life and it was great I was able to get
around<00:06:10.070> three<00:06:10.730> days<00:06:11.000> of<00:06:11.270> heavy<00:06:11.720> use<00:06:11.840> with<00:06:12.440> this

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
around three days of heavy use with this

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.159 
around three days of heavy use with this
device<00:06:13.010> and<00:06:13.370> I<00:06:13.850> was<00:06:14.030> not<00:06:14.270> expecting<00:06:15.140> that

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
device and I was not expecting that

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.860 
device and I was not expecting that
other<00:06:16.100> smartwatches<00:06:16.669> for<00:06:17.150> example<00:06:17.600> like<00:06:17.720> the

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
other smartwatches for example like the

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.140 
other smartwatches for example like the
Galaxy<00:06:18.380> gear<00:06:18.410> could<00:06:19.100> go<00:06:19.280> for<00:06:19.520> one<00:06:19.550> day<00:06:19.970> but

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
Galaxy gear could go for one day but

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.780 
Galaxy gear could go for one day but
this<00:06:20.330> was<00:06:20.510> able<00:06:20.690> to<00:06:20.870> go<00:06:21.169> three<00:06:21.860> days<00:06:22.130> and<00:06:22.490> I<00:06:22.610> was

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790

using<00:06:23.000> it<00:06:23.270> as<00:06:23.390> my<00:06:23.690> main<00:06:23.990> phone<00:06:24.440> so<00:06:25.070> I<00:06:25.130> was<00:06:25.250> very

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
using it as my main phone so I was very

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.150

it<00:06:30.919> only<00:06:31.070> comes<00:06:31.490> in<00:06:31.700> at<00:06:31.850> 200<00:06:32.780> which<00:06:32.930> is<00:06:32.960> cheaper

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710

than the Galaxy gear and cheaper than
the<00:06:37.370> pebble<00:06:37.729> steel<00:06:38.060> so<00:06:38.720> it's<00:06:38.900> definitely<00:06:39.320> a

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
the pebble steel so it's definitely a

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.130
