00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
of the functionality for the CAD program

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350 
of the functionality for the CAD program
I've<00:01:10.500> never<00:01:10.680> used<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.010> CAD<00:01:11.220> program<00:01:11.670> before<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
I've never used a CAD program before and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.640 
I've never used a CAD program before and
this<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.689> definitely<00:01:12.810> something<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> made

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
this was definitely something that made

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.859 
this was definitely something that made
it<00:01:13.799> extremely<00:01:13.979> easy<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.760> I've<00:01:15.570> got<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
it extremely easy to do I've got the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.870 
it extremely easy to do I've got the
machine<00:01:16.170> pause<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.250> demonstration

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
machine pause now just for demonstration

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.170 
machine pause now just for demonstration
purposes<00:01:18.200> was<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:20.400> hit<00:01:20.549> start<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
purposes was going to just hit start and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
purposes was going to just hit start and
resume<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.840> cutting<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.710> let<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.009> guys

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
resume the cutting and let you guys

00:01:23.159 --> 00:02:50.630 
resume the cutting and let you guys
watch<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.610> little<00:01:23.759> bit<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> cut

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
as you can see pausing the cutting is as

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.920 
as you can see pausing the cutting is as
simple<00:02:55.030> as<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:57.010> falls<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.580> machine<00:02:57.940> for

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
simple as it falls on the machine for

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.690 
simple as it falls on the machine for
