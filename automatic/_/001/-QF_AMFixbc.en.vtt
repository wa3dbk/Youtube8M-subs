00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 davos people and therefore a hearty 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.819
 welcome my name lithiums lp and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.950
 I welcome you to a new round 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.230
 gta 5 and we make a little one 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.040
 Nebenmission today oh yes there is behind 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.120
 in prison 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.120
 there vista good 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.789
 yes okay I think that was not a mission 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.989
 you asshole it's slamming it 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.449
 that you are wasting my time 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.149
 damn it okay then i would 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.079
 say'll go before times to jail 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.579
 although we can also find a times 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.049
 Just look around the outside like that 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.549
 everything is because I find you 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.689
 always cares too little about the 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.280
 choose the actual game 

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:58.229
 you always drive through the area and 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 the whole country does not look at all 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.949
 and then you just miss so much 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.989
 like the prison in the back 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.720
 who knew who knew of you that yours 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.600
 imprisonment but I already important 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.819
 Of course I knew such a lonely one 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 I also think it is quite residential 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:15.330
 nice such random encounters of in 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.920
 which passers-by or as well as then 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.590
 just walk around here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.060
 or drive through the area with theirs 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.850
 bobbycars and think if cool 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.270
 yes yes these are the cool cool ones 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.049
 the new school yes yes yes yes yes we okay 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.939
 can even see if there anyway 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.939
 Guards are on the watchtowers and 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:45.209
 on the apparently not too 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:46.890
 far away why not there 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.459
 Otherwise there are always some on it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.660
 nobody will be on it 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.280
 funny i think in wet weather or 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.170
 so make yourself in the pants and then 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.080
 they do not bother anymore 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.000
 pity but no matter but cool thing 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.530
 In any case, I do not have a way 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.819
 found to do purely in the prison 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.190
 I think it will not 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.340
 fold over the airspace 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.509
 tries to make airspace everywhere 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.739
 be a bit of pressure then 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.569
 you get four stars 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.610
 and something and then shoot us too 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.209
 ever since back then yes happens four 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.680
 stars in any case, okay there in front me 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.810
 are in the task I see task there 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.129
 behind 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.040
 I am a vehicle I do not want that far 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.360
 We have to run back 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.970
 I hope the mission does not work now 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.080
 maybe away from the dogs and us 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.280
 take the little I would say would 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.400
 looks a bit quick though 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.530
 already a big difference or already 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.700
 In any case, the hippie will dare 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.270

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.180

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:57.560
 I would even have raped one 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.239
 portrait chance and I thought 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.900

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:12.159
 So people that really managed me really 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.280

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.090
 I thought of the ass of the world 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.460
 let's say we are really on the hook 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:37.820
 just like this video we are called 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:40.820

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.050

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.550
 I have the number of my marban 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.479

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.130
 Doctor Friedlander my therapist

 for that I am naked almost naked now 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.740
 I need a horse to come kill us 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.740
 just a few birds 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.300
 very nice ok I can not think of anything now 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.520
 what else we could do 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.780
 somehow we are just really in the ass 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.400
 I somehow feel as if I am 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.009
 one would have taken off the pants oh 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.599
 It was so even people too the 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.460

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.330
 sunrise is so nice 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.610
 priceless 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.250
 In any case, I'm upset 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.120
 counteract 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.090
 wait, we're on a flight 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.750
 Runway 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.939
 That could not be so bad 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.759
 even though I do not know if we are 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:52.629
 definitely something is clear from trevor 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.710
 we definitely have a few 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.469

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.849
 10 his son that will be me now 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.229
 somehow so far but take too long 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.210
 I also do not believe that we 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.979
 Do not play that clever somewhere 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.479
 a plane is because they belong yes 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.590
 strike more and disappearing yes 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.330
 usually always when you are 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.990
 it does not change with that either 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.219
 other club of course okay people me 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.840
 Let's say we will be the video 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.509
 here and we can still do some 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.300
 funny birds down there I see 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:23.710
 but just no doctor a shot 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.610
 Shot well that's because of the bullets 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.710
 because the so funny fly of course 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.300

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.569
