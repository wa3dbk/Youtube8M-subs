00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.190 
spinning is a natural detoxifier you
know<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.059> see<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.540> people<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.989> more

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
know if you see that people get more

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.590 
know if you see that people get more
sniffles<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.040> knows<00:00:38.250> drainage<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
sniffles and knows drainage in the

sniffles and knows drainage in the
spring<00:00:39.989> season<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.489> Mother<00:00:41.850> Nature<00:00:42.239> has

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
spring season and so Mother Nature has

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.810 
spring season and so Mother Nature has
designed<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.989> automatically<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.670> can

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
designed it automatically so if we can

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.869 
designed it automatically so if we can
aid<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.450> process<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.260> detoxification<00:00:46.879> that

aid that process of detoxification that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
aid that process of detoxification that
would<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.059> really<00:00:48.360> good<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.750> mother<00:00:49.559> nature

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
would be really good so mother nature

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.100 
would be really good so mother nature
already<00:00:50.309> has<00:00:50.579> designed<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.870> need<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
already has designed it we just need to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.170 
already has designed it we just need to
eat<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.920> see<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.059> know

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
eat it up and you see that you know

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.689 
eat it up and you see that you know
people<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.660> more<00:00:54.930> cold<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.680> flus<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
people get more cold and flus and and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
people get more cold and flus and and
allergies<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> season<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.050> basically

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
allergies in the season and basically

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.410 
allergies in the season and basically
what<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> Mother<00:00:59.699> Nature<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.059> saying<00:01:00.270> hey

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
what the Mother Nature is saying hey

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
what the Mother Nature is saying hey
have<00:01:00.840> too<00:01:01.109> much<00:01:01.230> accumulation<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.980> mean

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
have too much accumulation I mean

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.880 
have too much accumulation I mean
spinning<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> natural<00:01:03.589> detoxifier<00:01:04.589> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
spinning is a natural detoxifier you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.230 
spinning is a natural detoxifier you
know<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.610> people<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.030> more

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
know if you see that people get more

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.750 
know if you see that people get more
sniffles<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.080> knows<00:01:07.320> drainage<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
sniffles and knows drainage in the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.480 
sniffles and knows drainage in the
spring<00:01:09.060> season<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.560> Mother<00:01:10.920> Nature<00:01:11.310> has

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
spring season and so Mother Nature has

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.880 
spring season and so Mother Nature has
designed<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.060> automatically<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.740> can

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
designed it automatically so if we can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.940 
designed it automatically so if we can
aid<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.520> process<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.299> detoxification<00:01:15.950> that

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
aid that process of detoxification that

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.710 
aid that process of detoxification that
would<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.130> really<00:01:17.430> good<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.119> mother<00:01:18.630> nature

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
would be really good so mother nature

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.170 
would be really good so mother nature
already<00:01:19.170> has<00:01:19.650> designed<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.850> need<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
already has designed it we just need to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
already has designed it we just need to
eat<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.130> know

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
eat it up and you see that you know

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.760 
eat it up and you see that you know
people<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.729> more<00:01:24.000> cold<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.750> clothes<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.439> and

your<00:02:28.050> question<00:02:28.410> about<00:02:28.500> juicing<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.130> don't

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
your question about juicing I don't

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.250 
your question about juicing I don't
personally<00:02:29.940> don't<00:02:30.120> like<00:02:30.180> juicing<00:02:30.690> because<00:02:31.170> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
personally don't like juicing because I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.870 
personally don't like juicing because I
think<00:02:31.319> you're<00:02:31.560> making<00:02:31.739> concentrated<00:02:32.550> sugar

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
think you're making concentrated sugar

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.089 
think you're making concentrated sugar
but<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:33.959> you're<00:02:34.110> making<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.470> smoothie<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.980> know

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
but if you're making a smoothie you know

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.710 
but if you're making a smoothie you know
add<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.610> whole<00:02:35.760> fruit<00:02:36.120> together<00:02:36.480> or

add the whole fruit together or

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720 
add the whole fruit together or
vegtables<00:02:37.290> together<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.830> blend<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.220> with<00:02:38.400> a

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.949 
don't want it to detoxify with the high

70<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.230> 80<00:03:04.500> calories<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.760> has<00:03:05.849> around<00:03:06.000> 7

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
70 to 80 calories and it has around 7

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.110 
70 to 80 calories and it has around 7
grams<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.930> protein<00:03:07.349> if<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.310> take<00:03:08.489> 80<00:03:08.760> calories

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
grams of protein if you take 80 calories

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.720 
grams of protein if you take 80 calories
or<00:03:09.540> broccoli<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.099> one<00:03:11.310> head<00:03:11.580> of

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
broccoli and you know how much broccoli

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.530 
broccoli and you know how much broccoli
has<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.950> protein<00:03:14.280> what<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.670> head<00:03:14.850> has<00:03:15.209> 10

has the protein what the head has 10
grams<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.959> protein<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.440> you're<00:03:16.799> not<00:03:16.920> getting

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
grams of protein so you're not getting

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.250
