whether<00:02:08.320> I<00:02:08.800> type<00:02:09.790> in<00:02:10.000> chat<00:02:10.030> or<00:02:10.660> open<00:02:11.020> my<00:02:11.140> map<00:02:11.350> or

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
whether I type in chat or open my map or

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.390 
whether I type in chat or open my map or
whatever<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.100> need<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.340> do<00:02:12.750> which<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.950> very

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
whatever I need to do which is a very

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.820 
whatever I need to do which is a very
very<00:02:15.850> handy<00:02:16.360> feature<00:02:16.540> because<00:02:17.290> those<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:17.709> know

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
very handy feature because those we know

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.140 
very handy feature because those we know
tag<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.390> very<00:02:19.890> having<00:02:20.890> everything

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
tag is very having everything

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.110 
tag is very having everything
there's<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.270> match<00:02:23.800> it's<00:02:24.800> quite

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.120 

so<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.510> particular<00:02:31.690> joystick<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.620> SciTech

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
so this particular joystick is a SciTech

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.770 
so this particular joystick is a SciTech
cyborg<00:02:33.550> axe<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:34.090> actually<00:02:34.450> not<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.660> very

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
cyborg axe it's actually not a very

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.250 
cyborg axe it's actually not a very
great<00:02:35.260> joystick<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:37.090> problem<00:02:37.510> being<00:02:37.750> that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
great joystick the problem being that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.810 
great joystick the problem being that
when<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.710> fold<00:02:38.950> out<00:02:39.100> its<00:02:39.280> base

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
when you fold out its base

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.210 
when you fold out its base
there's<00:02:40.000> nothing<00:02:40.630> forward<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.710> so<00:02:42.040> it

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
there's nothing forward of it so it

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.420 
there's nothing forward of it so it
makes<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.700> tip<00:02:43.630> unless<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.620> give<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:44.860> downward

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
makes it tip unless you give it downward

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.800 
makes it tip unless you give it downward
pressure<00:02:45.730> which<00:02:46.000> can<00:02:46.210> be<00:02:46.300> annoying<00:02:46.570> at<00:02:46.780> times

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
pressure which can be annoying at times

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.660 
pressure which can be annoying at times
and<00:02:47.350> it's<00:02:47.440> really<00:02:47.770> terrible<00:02:48.190> for<00:02:48.310> flight

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
and it's really terrible for flight

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.520 
and it's really terrible for flight
games<00:02:48.970> but<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.390> seems<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.780> work<00:02:49.810> alright<00:02:50.290> for

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
games but it seems to work alright for

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.250 
games but it seems to work alright for
MechWarrior<00:02:51.010> it's<00:02:52.000> one<00:02:52.240> huge<00:02:52.540> saving<00:02:52.990> grace

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
MechWarrior it's one huge saving grace

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.400 
MechWarrior it's one huge saving grace
is<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.680> ability<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:54.310> adjust<00:02:55.200> pretty<00:02:56.200> much

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
is the ability to adjust pretty much

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.000 
is the ability to adjust pretty much
everything<00:02:56.950> on<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.280> between<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:59.770> width

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
everything on it between the the width

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.120 
everything on it between the the width
of<00:03:00.160> your<00:03:00.190> hand<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:01.240> make<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.920> larger<00:03:02.920> or

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
of your hand to make it larger or

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
whole button setup is it's all

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.290 
whole button setup is it's all
adjustable<00:03:19.140> very<00:03:20.160> very<00:03:21.160> handy<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.730> have<00:03:21.760> a

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
adjustable very very handy to have a

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.060 
adjustable very very handy to have a
very<00:03:22.810> adjustable<00:03:23.140> toy<00:03:23.530> stick<00:03:23.770> for<00:03:23.950> this

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
very adjustable toy stick for this

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.440 
very adjustable toy stick for this
because<00:03:24.280> most<00:03:24.610> joysticks<00:03:25.030> aren't<00:03:25.270> made<00:03:25.420> for

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
because most joysticks aren't made for

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.420 
because most joysticks aren't made for
left<00:03:25.870> hands<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:26.410> being<00:03:26.620> able<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.890> adjust<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.250> to

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
left hands so being able to adjust it to

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.460 
left hands so being able to adjust it to
be<00:03:27.550> more<00:03:27.730> comfortable<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.950> very<00:03:29.950> convenient

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
be more comfortable is very convenient

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.080 
be more comfortable is very convenient
it<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.680> important<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.280> find<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:33.670> joystick<00:03:34.030> that

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
it is important to find a joystick that

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.670 
it is important to find a joystick that
works<00:03:34.390> with<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.690> left<00:03:34.900> hand<00:03:35.140> because<00:03:35.290> again

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
works with the left hand because again

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.620 
works with the left hand because again
most<00:03:35.950> joysticks<00:03:36.130> are<00:03:36.790> not<00:03:37.030> designed<00:03:37.450> with

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
most joysticks are not designed with

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.360 
most joysticks are not designed with
that<00:03:37.780> in<00:03:37.930> mind<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:41.680> works<00:03:41.860> for<00:03:41.950> MechWarrior

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
that in mind so it works for MechWarrior

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.950 
that in mind so it works for MechWarrior
purposes<00:03:42.820> but<00:03:42.970> again<00:03:43.210> I'd<00:03:43.330> never<00:03:43.360> use<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.780> for

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
purposes but again I'd never use it for

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.500 
purposes but again I'd never use it for
something<00:03:44.230> like<00:03:44.440> star<00:03:44.740> citizen<00:03:44.770> where<00:03:45.760> I'd<00:03:46.390> be

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
something like star citizen where I'd be

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.610 
something like star citizen where I'd be
using<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.930> right<00:03:47.110> hand<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:48.030> need<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.620> get

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
using that right hand and need to get

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.430 
using that right hand and need to get
around<00:03:50.890> that<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.870> folding<00:03:52.870> forward<00:03:53.290> issue

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
around that a folding forward issue

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.590 
around that a folding forward issue
someone<00:03:54.220> actually<00:03:54.490> suggested<00:03:55.060> screwing<00:03:55.510> it

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
someone actually suggested screwing it

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.510 
someone actually suggested screwing it
down<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.870> my<00:03:55.990> desk<00:03:56.260> but<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.680> don't<00:03:57.250> think<00:03:57.430> I'm

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
down to my desk but I don't think I'm

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.050 
down to my desk but I don't think I'm
willing<00:03:57.850> to<00:03:58.270> take<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.660> quite<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.020> far<00:03:59.260> yet<00:04:00.060> so

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
willing to take it quite that far yet so

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.940 
willing to take it quite that far yet so
just<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.660> demonstrate<00:04:01.690> using<00:04:02.350> a<00:04:02.530> joystick<00:04:02.860> a

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
just to demonstrate using a joystick a

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:15.040 
just to demonstrate using a joystick a
little<00:04:03.160> bit<00:04:03.280> more

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.670 

it's<00:04:16.050> just<00:04:16.290> very<00:04:16.670> convenient<00:04:17.670> and<00:04:17.880> fluid<00:04:18.680> once

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
it's just very convenient and fluid once

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.990 
it's just very convenient and fluid once
you<00:04:19.800> get<00:04:19.920> the<00:04:20.010> hang<00:04:20.160> of<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.430> takes<00:04:20.489> about<00:04:20.730> 10

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
you get the hang of it it takes about 10

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.420 
you get the hang of it it takes about 10
matches<00:04:21.270> to<00:04:21.660> get<00:04:21.810> used<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:24.830> but<00:04:25.830> once<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.250> play

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
matches to get used to but once you play

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:39.740 
matches to get used to but once you play
those<00:04:34.910> available<00:04:35.910> all<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.450> time<00:04:38.540> having<00:04:39.540> your

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
those available all the time having your

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.200 
those available all the time having your
tag<00:04:39.960> laser<00:04:40.230> firing<00:04:40.650> all<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.070> time<00:04:41.930> it's<00:04:42.930> just

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
tag laser firing all the time it's just

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.400 
tag laser firing all the time it's just
that<00:04:45.210> much<00:04:45.390> better<00:04:45.450> than<00:04:45.750> playing<00:04:46.140> with<00:04:46.290> the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
that much better than playing with the

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:53.060
