technique of ragging it's very very

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.189 
technique of ragging it's very very
simple<00:00:13.380> all<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.309> need<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> rag<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.389> the

simple all you need is a rag and the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.439 
simple all you need is a rag and the
glaze<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.949> you've<00:00:17.070> desired<00:00:17.520> or<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.150> can<00:00:18.300> use

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
glaze that you've desired or you can use

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.349 
glaze that you've desired or you can use
a<00:00:18.480> full-strength<00:00:19.050> pigment<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.580> you

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
a full-strength pigment up to you you

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.450 
a full-strength pigment up to you you
can<00:00:21.510> vary<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.350> kind<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.830> effect<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.279> you'll

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
can vary the kind of effect that you'll

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.140 
can vary the kind of effect that you'll
get<00:00:23.640> based<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.769> you<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:25.890> also<00:00:26.039> dip<00:00:26.550> your<00:00:26.939> rag

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
get based on you can also dip your rag

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.140 
get based on you can also dip your rag
in<00:00:27.359> water<00:00:27.599> before<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.680> use<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.939> will

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
in water before you use it and that will

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.650 
in water before you use it and that will
give<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> more<00:00:30.689> subtle<00:00:31.040> less<00:00:32.040> defined

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
give you a more subtle less defined

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.180 
give you a more subtle less defined
effect<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:33.930> then<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.710> very<00:00:34.890> very

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
effect but then you have to be very very

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.119 
effect but then you have to be very very
careful<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.940> drips<00:00:36.390> especially<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.860> you're

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
careful of drips especially if you're

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.639 
careful of drips especially if you're
using<00:00:38.750> some<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:39.930> you're<00:00:40.079> painting<00:00:40.290> something

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
using some if you're painting something

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.060 
using some if you're painting something
on<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> vertical<00:00:40.980> surface<00:00:41.340> drip<00:00:41.850> edge<00:00:42.000> beware

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
on a vertical surface drip edge beware

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
on a vertical surface drip edge beware
so<00:00:44.070> what<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.700> kind<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.910> smudge

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
so what you do you just kind of smudge

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.549 
so what you do you just kind of smudge
the<00:00:45.239> paint<00:00:45.420> around<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.870> little<00:00:45.960> bit<00:00:46.230> sweep

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the paint around a little bit sweep

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.279 
the paint around a little bit sweep
gloves<00:00:46.860> because<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.820> messy<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.660> when

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
gloves because you get so messy so when

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.170 
gloves because you get so messy so when
you<00:00:49.469> put<00:00:49.829> your<00:00:49.950> rag<00:00:50.160> down<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.820> want<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> make

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
you put your rag down you want to make

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.110 
you put your rag down you want to make
sure<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.750> are<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.789> dragging<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
sure that you are not dragging it on the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.819 
sure that you are not dragging it on the
surface<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.660> want<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:54.989> kind<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.289> roll<00:00:55.530> it

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
surface you want to just kind of roll it

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:56.959 
surface you want to just kind of roll it
around<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.550> what's<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
around because that's what's going to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.819 
around because that's what's going to
give<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> these<00:00:57.390> defined<00:00:57.899> shapes

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
give you these defined shapes

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.119 
give you these defined shapes
that's<00:00:59.550> what<00:00:59.730> ragging<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.629> kind<00:01:00.870> of

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
that's what ragging is this is kind of

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.189 
that's what ragging is this is kind of
interesting<00:01:02.449> texture<00:01:03.449> sometimes<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.080> can

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
interesting texture sometimes it can

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.899 
interesting texture sometimes it can
kind<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.500> come<00:01:05.100> out<00:01:05.220> looking<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> little<00:01:05.729> bit

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
kind of come out looking a little bit

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
kind of come out looking a little bit
like<00:01:05.970> stone<00:01:08.570> especially<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> layer<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
like stone especially if you layer it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.929 
like stone especially if you layer it
with<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> different<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.340> bunch<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> different

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
with a different a bunch of different

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.539 
with a different a bunch of different
layers<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.390> tones<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.040> come<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.220> with

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
layers of tones you can come out with

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.660 
layers of tones you can come out with
all<00:01:14.700> kinds<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> different<00:01:15.680> effects<00:01:16.680> using

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
all kinds of different effects using

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.450 
all kinds of different effects using
this<00:01:17.909> very<00:01:18.210> simple

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
this very simple

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.490 
this very simple
kind<00:01:21.120> of<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.450> rolling<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.020> around<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.470> can

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
kind of just rolling it around you can

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.040 
kind of just rolling it around you can
also<00:01:22.740> use<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.580> subtractive<00:01:24.300> lis<00:01:24.420> too<00:01:24.660> if<00:01:24.900> you

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
also use it subtractive lis too if you

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.660 
also use it subtractive lis too if you
want<00:01:25.260> to<00:01:25.500> cover<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.950> surface<00:01:26.720> with<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> brush

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
want to cover a surface with a brush

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.520 
want to cover a surface with a brush
maybe<00:01:29.670> use<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:29.970> paint<00:01:30.330> extender<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.440> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
maybe use a paint extender so that you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410 
maybe use a paint extender so that you
can<00:01:31.680> work<00:01:31.830> with<00:01:31.980> it<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.370> longer<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.390> that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
can work with it for longer so that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
can work with it for longer so that
doesn't<00:01:33.690> dry<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.160> then<00:01:35.550> rag

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
doesn't dry but then you can then rag

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.440 
doesn't dry but then you can then rag
off<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.180> paint<00:01:36.870> that<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.050> just<00:01:37.260> put<00:01:37.440> on<00:01:38.450> all

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
off the paint that you just put on all

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
off the paint that you just put on all
right<00:01:39.660> so<00:01:40.050> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:40.950> you're<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.190> to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
right so this is what you're going to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
right so this is what you're going to
end<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:41.970> ragging<00:01:42.390> technique

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
end up with with a ragging technique

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.080 
end up with with a ragging technique
where<00:01:43.020> you're<00:01:43.170> using<00:01:43.350> similar<00:01:43.920> tones<00:01:44.220> it's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
where you're using similar tones it's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.700 
where you're using similar tones it's
kind<00:01:45.300> of<00:01:45.330> a<00:01:45.420> subtle<00:01:46.280> interesting<00:01:47.280> texture

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
kind of a subtle interesting texture

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.410 
kind of a subtle interesting texture
kind<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.830> nice<00:01:50.010> finish<00:01:50.400> not<00:01:50.910> difficult<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
kind of a nice finish not difficult to

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.950 
kind of a nice finish not difficult to
do<00:01:52.759> it<00:01:53.759> has<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.180> bit<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> spatter<00:01:54.720> from

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
do it has a little bit of spatter from
