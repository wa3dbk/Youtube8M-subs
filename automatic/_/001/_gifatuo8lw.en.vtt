here<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.310> see<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:17.580> happens<00:00:18.529> my<00:00:19.529> last<00:00:19.740> score

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
here and see what happens my last score

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.250 
here and see what happens my last score
i<00:00:20.460> wasn't<00:00:21.119> correct<00:00:21.449> i<00:00:21.750> was<00:00:21.840> running<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> wrong

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
i wasn't correct i was running the wrong

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.070 
i wasn't correct i was running the wrong
version<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.800> cinema<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.750> haven't<00:00:24.750> ran<00:00:24.900> any

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
version of cinema so I haven't ran any

stress<00:00:25.439> test<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.010> here<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.849> we'll<00:00:26.970> see<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.570> mean

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
stress test on here so we'll see I mean

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.820 
stress test on here so we'll see I mean
this<00:00:27.869> might<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.170> stress<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.740> enough<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:30.830> give

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
this might just stress it enough to give

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.630 
this might just stress it enough to give
me<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> blue<00:00:32.189> screen<00:00:32.489> let's<00:00:32.850> find<00:00:33.090> out

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
me a blue screen let's find out

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
me a blue screen let's find out
monitored<00:00:35.640> my<00:00:35.790> temps<00:00:36.149> over<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.480> right<00:00:36.600> now

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660

monitored my temps over there right now
I'm<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:37.020> 90<00:00:37.670> 93<00:00:38.670> seems<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.750> about<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I'm at 90 93 seems to be about the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.970 
I'm at 90 93 seems to be about the
average

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.410 

there<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.579> go

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.280 

alright<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.750> 10<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.440> far<00:00:52.740> are<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.910> 150<00:00:54.900> 4<00:00:55.170> is

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
alright so 10 so far are up to 150 4 is

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.960 
alright so 10 so far are up to 150 4 is
the<00:00:55.350> highest<00:00:58.010> 156<00:01:00.410> this<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> 5<00:01:02.100> gigahertz<00:01:02.490> on

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
the highest 156 this is a 5 gigahertz on

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.620 
the highest 156 this is a 5 gigahertz on
air<00:01:03.710> full<00:01:04.710> load<00:01:05.120> attempts<00:01:06.120> aren't<00:01:06.330> even<00:01:06.510> hit

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
air full load attempts aren't even hit

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.170 
air full load attempts aren't even hit
in<00:01:06.720> 16<00:01:07.170> well<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.620> go<00:01:07.800> 160<00:01:08.460> that's

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
in 16 well there go 160 that's

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.480 
in 16 well there go 160 that's
completely<00:01:09.630> safe<00:01:10.020> laptops<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.920> i7<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
completely safe laptops with the i7 is

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.660 
completely safe laptops with the i7 is
running<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> constant<00:01:12.330> 140<00:01:12.870> 150<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.800> it's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
running a constant 140 150 so it's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.890 
running a constant 140 150 so it's
amazing<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.110> bit<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.470> air<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.860> do

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
amazing what a little bit of air can do

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.050 
amazing what a little bit of air can do
anyway<00:01:18.900> let's<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.260> what<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.730> 4.8<00:01:20.730> put<00:01:20.940> me

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
anyway let's see what we do 4.8 put me

let's see what where we where we end up

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.570 
let's see what where we where we end up
at<00:01:28.670> 169<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> highest<00:01:30.630> temp<00:01:30.900> I'm<00:01:31.050> at<00:01:31.580> 9.63

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
at 169 is the highest temp I'm at 9.63

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.359 
at 169 is the highest temp I'm at 9.63
that's<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.330> that's<00:01:33.570> crazy<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.290> haven't<00:01:35.250> even

I haven't adjusted a whole lot on this
Maximus<00:01:38.040> extreme<00:01:38.430> board<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.330> mean<00:01:39.900> already

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
Maximus extreme board but I mean already

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.499 
Maximus extreme board but I mean already
it's<00:01:42.170> it's<00:01:43.170> pretty<00:01:43.560> stable<00:01:44.090> it's<00:01:45.680> pretty<00:01:46.680> good

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
it's it's pretty stable it's pretty good

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.030 
it's it's pretty stable it's pretty good
what<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.690> saying<00:01:48.900> yeah<00:01:49.710> there's<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> lot

what was I saying yeah there's a lot
more<00:01:50.070> i<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.400> adjust<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.940> haven't<00:01:51.330> even<00:01:51.390> gotten

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
more i can adjust on haven't even gotten

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.280 
more i can adjust on haven't even gotten
into<00:01:51.990> he<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> few<00:01:52.950> things<00:01:53.600> i<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:55.110> want

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
into he is just a few things i just want

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.320 
into he is just a few things i just want
to<00:01:55.350> see<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.560> i<00:01:55.680> could<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:56.010> it<00:01:56.160> stable<00:01:56.790> quickly

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
to see if i could get it stable quickly

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.050 
to see if i could get it stable quickly
at<00:01:57.600> five<00:01:57.900> gigahertz<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.800> obviously<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.730> so

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
at five gigahertz and obviously it is so

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.180 
at five gigahertz and obviously it is so
there<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> go<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.290> pretty<00:02:01.620> sick<00:02:01.890> score

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
there you go that's pretty sick score

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.960 
there you go that's pretty sick score
