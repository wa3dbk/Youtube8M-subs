these things is a tic tac bass and what

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.280 
these things is a tic tac bass and what
would<00:01:18.030> happen<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> guy<00:01:18.720> would<00:01:18.900> come<00:01:19.049> in

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
would happen is that guy would come in

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.010 
would happen is that guy would come in
and<00:01:19.610> they<00:01:20.610> would<00:01:20.700> most<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> recordings

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and they would most of the recordings

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.570 
and they would most of the recordings
were<00:01:22.110> done<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.380> upright<00:01:22.740> bass<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
were done with upright bass and so the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.980 
were done with upright bass and so the
guy<00:01:23.850> would<00:01:24.000> pay<00:01:24.119> down<00:01:24.299> put<00:01:24.570> down<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> bass

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
guy would pay down put down the bass

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.380 
guy would pay down put down the bass
line<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.950> produce<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.460> want<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.970> this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
line and it produce we want to have this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.170 
line and it produce we want to have this
on<00:01:27.659> top<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.500> kind<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
on top of that as kind of like a just a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.899 
on top of that as kind of like a just a
high-end<00:01:30.869> picking<00:01:31.500> sound<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.369> bass<00:01:32.579> note
