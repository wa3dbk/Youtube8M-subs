00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
coming together we've got some leaks of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.429 
coming together we've got some leaks of
swiftkey<00:02:06.240> coming<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.810> iphone<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
swiftkey coming to the iphone in the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.529 
swiftkey coming to the iphone in the
ipad<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.250> wait<00:02:08.789> right<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.390> not

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
ipad but wait right there it's not

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.170 
ipad but wait right there it's not
exactly<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.440> expect<00:02:10.920> swiftkey<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.849> my

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
exactly what you expect swiftkey is my

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.670 
exactly what you expect swiftkey is my
favorite<00:02:12.660> keyboard<00:02:13.200> on

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
favorite keyboard on

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.259 
favorite keyboard on
android<00:02:14.040> because<00:02:14.430> i<00:02:14.609> have<00:02:14.790> multiple

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
android because i have multiple

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.610 
android because i have multiple
languages<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:15.989> does<00:02:16.109> a<00:02:16.140> great<00:02:16.379> job<00:02:16.409> with

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
languages and it does a great job with

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.619 
languages and it does a great job with
text<00:02:17.040> prediction<00:02:17.280> without<00:02:17.939> having<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.329> swap

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
text prediction without having to swap

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.089 
text prediction without having to swap
the<00:02:18.780> languages<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:19.439> interestingly

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
the languages but interestingly

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.069 
the languages but interestingly
apparently<00:02:20.969> the<00:02:21.090> iphone<00:02:21.540> thing<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:21.989> going

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
apparently the iphone thing is not going

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.330 
apparently the iphone thing is not going
to<00:02:22.140> work<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.409> same<00:02:22.560> way<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.799> know<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.040> can't

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
to work the same way you know you can't

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.190 
to work the same way you know you can't
install<00:02:23.670> third-party<00:02:23.900> keyboards<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.049> your

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
install third-party keyboards on your

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.020 
install third-party keyboards on your
iphone<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.159> apparently<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.640> will<00:02:26.849> be<00:02:27.000> a

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
iphone so apparently this will be a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.220 
iphone so apparently this will be a
swiftkey<00:02:27.930> notetaking<00:02:28.680> application<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.780> we

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
swiftkey notetaking application and we

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.140 
swiftkey notetaking application and we
are<00:02:31.439> trying<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:32.129> understand<00:02:32.670> what<00:02:32.909> is<00:02:33.000> gonna

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
are trying to understand what is gonna

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.759 
are trying to understand what is gonna
be<00:02:33.299> great<00:02:33.510> about<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.019> thing<00:02:34.290> especially

be great about this thing especially

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.800 
be great about this thing especially
because<00:02:35.310> swifty<00:02:35.609> is<00:02:35.639> not<00:02:35.849> free<00:02:36.060> on<00:02:36.150> android<00:02:36.299> so

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
because swifty is not free on android so

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.470
