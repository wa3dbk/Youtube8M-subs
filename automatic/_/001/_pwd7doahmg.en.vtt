 how rather put the card such chip 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.180
 I micro sd carrier here on the galaxy or 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.960
 industry 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.939
 remembering that it accepts micro chip chip 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 is the one you have to cut or 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.769
 buy at the carrier 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.160
 a microchip then if you are user 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.770
 and everything else and have found the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.950

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:30.620
 ready here I would not enter because 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:41.530
 because I will only use one chip can 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:41.530
 place the battery close a touch well 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.370

 I will disable that the mobile data is 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.420
 whenever you enter it will activate then 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:17.700
 it's the carrier's data 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:22.210
