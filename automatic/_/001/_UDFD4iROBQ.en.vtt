hardware<00:03:09.550> keyboard<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.180> have<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.480> use<00:03:10.660> the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
hardware keyboard so you have to use the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.530 
hardware keyboard so you have to use the
touchscreen<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.970> typing<00:03:12.970> with<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.270> one<00:03:13.420> is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
touchscreen and typing with this one is

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.260 
touchscreen and typing with this one is
very<00:03:13.840> difficult<00:03:14.140> I<00:03:14.790> have<00:03:15.790> been<00:03:15.970> recent

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.080 
very difficult I have been recent
herzing<00:03:16.690> but<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.470> never<00:03:18.220> quite<00:03:18.550> get<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.819> it's

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
herzing but I never quite get it it's

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.990 
herzing but I never quite get it it's
always<00:03:20.020> difficult<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.340> hit<00:03:21.459> those<00:03:21.700> right

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
always difficult to hit those right

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.540 
always difficult to hit those right
buttons<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.830> could<00:03:24.450> use<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:26.310> shortcut<00:03:27.310> but

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550
