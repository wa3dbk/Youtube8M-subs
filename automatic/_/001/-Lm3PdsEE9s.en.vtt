00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
catch the inside of ball don't catch the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
catch the inside of ball don't catch the
string<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> outside<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.960> grab<00:00:28.710> inside

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
string on the outside of it grab inside

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.259 
string on the outside of it grab inside
of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.310> string<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.699> when<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.910> pull<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.210> around

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
of the string so when you pull it around

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.020 
of the string so when you pull it around
the<00:00:30.740> hole<00:00:31.740> when<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.160> pull<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.460> around<00:00:32.520> all

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the hole when you pull it around all

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
right I'll show you so if I grab the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.639 
right I'll show you so if I grab the
outside<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:36.079> then<00:00:37.079> when<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.380> pull

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
outside of it like this then when I pull

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.560 
outside of it like this then when I pull
it<00:00:37.680> up<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.520> hole<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.790> gonna<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:39.090> under<00:00:39.450> my

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
it up the hole is gonna be under my

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.360 
it up the hole is gonna be under my
hands<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.989> feel<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.649> spike<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
hands I feel like this to spike it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.910 
hands I feel like this to spike it
so<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.149> means<00:00:42.390> when<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> comes<00:00:43.350> around<00:00:43.500> then

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
so that means when it comes around then

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.639 
so that means when it comes around then
up<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.250> hole<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:46.110> go<00:00:46.289> spike

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
up the hole like this and then go spike

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.170 
up the hole like this and then go spike
it's<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> lot<00:00:47.129> harder<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.899> wanna<00:00:49.110> do

up all right so that's why you got the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.390 
up all right so that's why you got the
inside<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> ball<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.229> hold<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.369> this

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
inside of the ball so hold like this

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.880 
inside of the ball so hold like this
study<00:01:05.909> space<00:01:06.150> walk<00:01:06.390> pull<00:01:07.290> around<00:01:07.380> grab<00:01:07.680> inside

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
study space walk pull around grab inside

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.780 
study space walk pull around grab inside
of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> string<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:10.369> what<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> mean<00:01:11.549> by<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
of the string so what I mean by the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.960 
of the string so what I mean by the
inside<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.180> string<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:14.070> would<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.400> when

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
inside of string is this would be when

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.219 
inside of string is this would be when
it's<00:01:15.090> coming<00:01:15.299> around<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it's coming around like this this is the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.330 
it's coming around like this this is the
outside<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> string<00:01:16.860> your<00:01:17.040> handle<00:01:17.280> on

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
outside of the string your handle on

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.950 
outside of the string your handle on
this<00:01:17.520> side<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> outside<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
this side that's the outside of the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.210 
this side that's the outside of the
string<00:01:19.200> cause<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> outside<00:01:20.070> from

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
string cause it's on the outside from

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.020 
string cause it's on the outside from
you<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> inside<00:01:22.130> pull<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.340> holes

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
you this is the inside pull it up holes

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
you this is the inside pull it up holes
on<00:01:24.210> top<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.570> lot<00:01:24.720> easier<00:01:25.140> alright<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.040> once<00:01:26.189> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
on top a lot easier alright so once you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
on top a lot easier alright so once you
get<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> pull<00:01:28.350> it
