Anderson David works for the Department
of<00:00:26.840> Energy<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:27.500> now<00:00:27.619> this<00:00:27.800> vehicle<00:00:28.460> here<00:00:28.670> it

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
of Energy so now this vehicle here it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.329 
of Energy so now this vehicle here it
says<00:00:28.970> right<00:00:29.029> over<00:00:29.300> here<00:00:29.449> zero<00:00:30.230> emission<00:00:30.890> is

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:31.339 
says right over here zero emission is

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.040 
says right over here zero emission is
that<00:00:31.580> true<00:00:31.820> is<00:00:31.970> it<00:00:32.090> really<00:00:32.330> zero<00:00:32.540> emissions

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
that true is it really zero emissions

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.170 
that true is it really zero emissions
it's<00:00:33.440> a<00:00:33.500> gray<00:00:33.680> area<00:00:33.710> zero<00:00:34.340> emission<00:00:34.700> refers<00:00:34.969> to

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
it's a gray area zero emission refers to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.880 
it's a gray area zero emission refers to
the<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:35.629> tailpipe<00:00:36.020> emissions<00:00:36.410> there<00:00:36.559> are<00:00:36.710> no

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
the the tailpipe emissions there are no

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.350 
the the tailpipe emissions there are no
tailpipe<00:00:37.160> emissions<00:00:37.670> from<00:00:37.790> this<00:00:37.969> vehicle

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
tailpipe emissions from this vehicle

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.580 
tailpipe emissions from this vehicle
obviously<00:00:38.510> there<00:00:38.989> are<00:00:39.020> emissions

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
obviously there are emissions

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.260 
obviously there are emissions
potentially<00:00:40.250> from<00:00:40.399> whatever<00:00:40.579> electricity

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
potentially from whatever electricity

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.000 
potentially from whatever electricity
source<00:00:41.480> that<00:00:41.660> you<00:00:41.690> plug<00:00:42.230> into<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.710> recharge

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
source that you plug into to recharge

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.799 
source that you plug into to recharge
and<00:00:43.280> also<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.700> emissions<00:00:44.000> for<00:00:44.239> making<00:00:44.690> it

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
and also the emissions for making it

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.299 
and also the emissions for making it
right<00:00:45.020> yeah<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:46.190> Nissan<00:00:46.640> Leaf<00:00:46.670> gets<00:00:47.770> 99<00:00:48.770> miles

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
right yeah the Nissan Leaf gets 99 miles

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.119 
right yeah the Nissan Leaf gets 99 miles
per<00:00:49.730> gallon<00:00:50.530> it<00:00:51.530> doesn't<00:00:51.800> use<00:00:51.890> gasoline

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
per gallon it doesn't use gasoline

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.590 
per gallon it doesn't use gasoline
what's<00:00:52.520> that<00:00:52.609> about<00:00:52.789> right<00:00:53.090> right<00:00:53.329> since

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
what's that about right right since

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.209 
what's that about right right since
we're<00:00:53.719> all<00:00:53.840> familiar<00:00:54.020> with<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.649> miles<00:00:54.980> per

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
we're all familiar with the miles per

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.709 
we're all familiar with the miles per
gallon<00:00:55.399> metric<00:00:55.789> to<00:00:55.910> determine<00:00:56.359> vehicle

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
gallon metric to determine vehicle

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.599 
gallon metric to determine vehicle
efficiency<00:00:56.809> they<00:00:57.590> did<00:00:57.739> an<00:00:57.859> energy<00:00:58.129> conversion

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
efficiency they did an energy conversion

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.430 
efficiency they did an energy conversion
they<00:00:59.030> use<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.269> energy<00:00:59.570> content<00:00:59.719> of<00:00:59.960> gasoline

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
they use the energy content of gasoline

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.680 
they use the energy content of gasoline
33.7<00:01:01.430> kilowatt<00:01:01.760> hours<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.359> gallon<00:01:02.539> of

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
33.7 kilowatt hours and a gallon of

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.810 
33.7 kilowatt hours and a gallon of
gasoline<00:01:03.040> use<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.190> efficiency<00:01:04.640> of<00:01:04.670> the

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
gasoline use the efficiency of the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.910 
gasoline use the efficiency of the
vehicle<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.390> did<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.840> conversion<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.650> put<00:01:06.800> it

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
vehicle and did a conversion to put it

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.100 
vehicle and did a conversion to put it
into<00:01:07.160> terms<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.880> we<00:01:08.060> can<00:01:08.240> all<00:01:08.390> understand<00:01:08.900> so

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
into terms that we can all understand so

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.170 
into terms that we can all understand so
do<00:01:09.290> that<00:01:09.500> you've<00:01:09.830> got<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.010> calculate<00:01:10.550> the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
do that you've got to calculate the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.380 
do that you've got to calculate the
amount<00:01:11.900> of<00:01:12.140> carbon<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.710> admit<00:01:13.070> for<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.240> many

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
amount of carbon you admit for so many

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.420 
amount of carbon you admit for so many
watts<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:15.080> electricity<00:01:15.410> right<00:01:15.800> but<00:01:16.310> that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
watts of electricity right but that

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.620 
watts of electricity right but that
varies<00:01:16.820> depending<00:01:17.120> on<00:01:17.240> where<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:17.450> live<00:01:17.570> right

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
varies depending on where you live right

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.660 
varies depending on where you live right
the<00:01:18.020> electrical<00:01:18.350> grid<00:01:18.500> in<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:18.980> u.s.<00:01:19.190> varies

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
the electrical grid in the u.s. varies

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.980 
the electrical grid in the u.s. varies
regionally<00:01:19.700> based<00:01:20.270> on<00:01:20.540> what<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.840> energy

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
regionally based on what the energy

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.410 
regionally based on what the energy
input<00:01:21.410> is<00:01:21.530> whether<00:01:21.740> it's<00:01:21.920> coal<00:01:22.100> nuclear

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
input is whether it's coal nuclear

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.940 
input is whether it's coal nuclear
renewable<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:23.690> yeah<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.170> 99<00:01:24.620> miles<00:01:24.830> per

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
renewable so yeah the 99 miles per

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.440 
renewable so yeah the 99 miles per
gallon<00:01:25.190> really<00:01:25.670> refers<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.240> amount<00:01:26.330> of

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
gallon really refers to the amount of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.820 
gallon really refers to the amount of
energy<00:01:26.660> that<00:01:26.900> it<00:01:27.140> takes<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.470> go<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.620> certain

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
energy that it takes to go a certain

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.320 
energy that it takes to go a certain
distance<00:01:28.070> rather<00:01:28.730> than<00:01:28.910> the<00:01:29.000> carbon

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
distance rather than the carbon

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.390 
distance rather than the carbon
emissions<00:01:29.930> right<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.470> then<00:01:30.800> for<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:31.070> carbon

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
emissions right and then for the carbon

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.890 
emissions right and then for the carbon
emissions<00:01:31.760> if<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.150> live<00:01:32.330> in<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.510> place<00:01:32.630> where

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
emissions if you live in a place where

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.180 
emissions if you live in a place where
you<00:01:33.020> burn<00:01:33.230> a<00:01:33.260> lot<00:01:33.440> of<00:01:33.560> coal<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:33.920> going<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.100> be

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
you burn a lot of coal it's going to be

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.310 
you burn a lot of coal it's going to be
more<00:01:34.370> than<00:01:34.640> if<00:01:34.760> you<00:01:34.910> use<00:01:35.330> natural<00:01:35.540> gas<00:01:35.900> or

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
more than if you use natural gas or

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.140 
more than if you use natural gas or
solar<00:01:36.620> or<00:01:36.860> even<00:01:37.160> nuclear<00:01:37.460> right<00:01:37.640> sure<00:01:38.000> exactly

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
solar or even nuclear right sure exactly

per gallon that means if I can do the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.830 
per gallon that means if I can do the
math<00:01:52.980> right<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:54.030> Drive<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> hundred<00:01:54.660> miles

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
math right if I Drive a hundred miles

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.500 
math right if I Drive a hundred miles
i'm<00:01:55.110> using<00:01:55.410> about<00:01:55.650> one<00:01:55.970> gallon<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.090> gasoline

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
i'm using about one gallon of gasoline

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.570 
i'm using about one gallon of gasoline
equivalent<00:01:58.140> or<00:01:58.590> whatever<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.070> means<00:01:59.220> okay

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
equivalent or whatever that means okay

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.560 
equivalent or whatever that means okay
and<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.300> i<00:02:00.600> drive<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.490> toyota<00:02:02.490> camry<00:02:02.970> hybrid<00:02:03.150> i

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
and so i drive a toyota camry hybrid i

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.020 
and so i drive a toyota camry hybrid i
get<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.900> average<00:02:04.080> about<00:02:04.350> 37<00:02:05.310> miles<00:02:05.550> per<00:02:05.820> gallon

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
get on average about 37 miles per gallon

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.749 
get on average about 37 miles per gallon
so<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.990> means<00:02:07.229> i'm<00:02:07.410> using<00:02:07.680> about<00:02:07.920> two<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
so that means i'm using about two and a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.660 
so that means i'm using about two and a
half<00:02:08.869> gallons<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> hundred<00:02:11.009> mile<00:02:11.250> right<00:02:11.550> as

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
half gallons for a hundred mile right as

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.550 
half gallons for a hundred mile right as
opposed<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.330> one<00:02:12.540> right<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.170> then<00:02:13.350> if<00:02:13.470> you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
opposed to one right and then if you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.070 
opposed to one right and then if you
have<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.740> car<00:02:14.070> that's<00:02:14.580> driving<00:02:15.180> say<00:02:15.360> 25<00:02:15.810> miles

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
have a car that's driving say 25 miles

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.290 
have a car that's driving say 25 miles
per<00:02:16.230> gallon<00:02:16.470> using<00:02:16.860> about<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:18.120> gives

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
per gallon using about for that gives

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.580 
per gallon using about for that gives
you<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> sense<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.900> difference<00:02:19.350> if<00:02:19.500> you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
you a sense of the difference if you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.199 
you a sense of the difference if you
take<00:02:19.800> into<00:02:19.980> account<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.520> gasoline<00:02:20.850> costs

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
take into account that gasoline costs

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.000 
take into account that gasoline costs
about<00:02:21.270> three<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.720> half<00:02:21.750> dollars<00:02:22.200> per

headlights<00:02:52.050> here<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.440> shaped<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
headlights here is shaped just so the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.670 
headlights here is shaped just so the
air<00:02:53.850> flow<00:02:54.030> comes<00:02:54.360> over<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.019> directs<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
air flow comes over and it directs the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.410 
air flow comes over and it directs the
airflow<00:02:56.010> around<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.549> mirror<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.030> there<00:02:57.180> are

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
airflow around the mirror so there are

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.180 
airflow around the mirror so there are
tricks<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.750> Nissan<00:02:58.140> used<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.620> improve<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
tricks that Nissan used to improve the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.190 
tricks that Nissan used to improve the
aerodynamic<00:02:59.820> efficiency<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> vehicle<00:03:00.870> as

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
aerodynamic efficiency of the vehicle as

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.020 
aerodynamic efficiency of the vehicle as
well<00:03:01.260> as<00:03:01.620> low<00:03:01.799> rolling<00:03:02.010> resistance<00:03:02.160> higher<00:03:02.790> to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
well as low rolling resistance higher to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.750 
well as low rolling resistance higher to
make<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.330> vehicle<00:03:03.840> system<00:03:04.230> efficient<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.040> so

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
make the vehicle system efficient so so

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.190 
make the vehicle system efficient so so
I<00:03:06.000> think<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:06.510> probably<00:03:06.750> has<00:03:06.959> something<00:03:07.080> to

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
I think this probably has something to

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.259 
I think this probably has something to
do<00:03:07.320> with<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> power<00:03:07.739> right<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
do with the power right this is the the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.570 
do with the power right this is the the
charging<00:03:09.660> flat<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.080> we'll<00:03:10.170> open<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.530> up<00:03:10.680> okay

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
charging flat and we'll open it up okay

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.789 
charging flat and we'll open it up okay
so<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:11.910> see<00:03:12.180> these<00:03:12.360> these<00:03:12.810> two<00:03:13.080> receptacles

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
so now I see these these two receptacles

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.199 
so now I see these these two receptacles
tell<00:03:14.100> me<00:03:14.190> about<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.489> under<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> orange<00:03:15.030> flat

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
tell me about that under the orange flat

left<00:04:56.240> in<00:04:56.389> driving<00:04:56.810> range<00:04:57.020> but<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:57.349> notice

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
left in driving range but you notice

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.930 
left in driving range but you notice
this<00:04:57.680> little<00:04:57.830> thing<00:04:58.039> that<00:04:58.069> says<00:04:58.190> turn<00:04:58.789> up

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
this little thing that says turn up

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.300 
this little thing that says turn up

words<00:05:01.430> because<00:05:01.729> we<00:05:01.849> got<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.120> air

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
words because we got the air

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.999 
words because we got the air

11<00:05:04.460> miles<00:05:04.610> of<00:05:04.909> range<00:05:05.629> so<00:05:06.139> what<00:05:06.289> i<00:05:06.319> can<00:05:06.530> do<00:05:06.620> is<00:05:06.650> i

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
11 miles of range so what i can do is i

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.070 
11 miles of range so what i can do is i
can<00:05:06.830> go<00:05:07.039> down<00:05:07.220> over<00:05:07.490> here<00:05:07.819> and<00:05:08.030> turn<00:05:08.690> off<00:05:08.930> the

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
can go down over here and turn off the

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.550 
can go down over here and turn off the
air<00:05:09.229> conditioning<00:05:09.639> top<00:05:10.639> now<00:05:11.449> my<00:05:11.659> range<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:11.990> 95

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
air conditioning top now my range is 95

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.260 
air conditioning top now my range is 95
miles<00:05:12.830> but<00:05:13.250> i'm<00:05:13.370> also<00:05:13.520> kind<00:05:13.879> of<00:05:13.940> uncomfortable

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
miles but i'm also kind of uncomfortable

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.180 
miles but i'm also kind of uncomfortable
but<00:05:14.840> nevertheless<00:05:15.139> i<00:05:15.440> got<00:05:15.560> eleven<00:05:15.830> more<00:05:15.860> miles

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
but nevertheless i got eleven more miles

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.339 
but nevertheless i got eleven more miles
and<00:05:16.430> you<00:05:16.759> can<00:05:16.909> see<00:05:17.090> now<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.509> little<00:05:18.110> bit<00:05:18.229> of

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
and you can see now a little bit of

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.860 
and you can see now a little bit of
energy<00:05:18.500> is<00:05:18.770> being<00:05:18.919> used<00:05:19.220> about<00:05:19.550> 200<00:05:20.150> watts

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
energy is being used about 200 watts

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.689 
energy is being used about 200 watts
just<00:05:21.440> from<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.680> other<00:05:21.860> stuff<00:05:22.220> that's<00:05:22.370> going

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
just from the other stuff that's going

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.029 
just from the other stuff that's going
on<00:05:22.789> like<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.300> lights<00:05:23.569> and<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.110> electronics

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
on like the lights and the electronics

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.860 
on like the lights and the electronics
and<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:25.340> on<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:25.550> so<00:05:25.639> forth<00:05:25.729> so<00:05:26.150> then<00:05:26.599> you<00:05:26.720> can

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
and so on and so forth so then you can

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.050 
and so on and so forth so then you can
go<00:05:26.990> back<00:05:27.020> to<00:05:27.199> your<00:05:27.409> math<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:28.250> normal<00:05:28.580> one<00:05:28.729> see

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
go back to your math the normal one see

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.270 
go back to your math the normal one see
where<00:05:29.210> you're<00:05:29.330> at<00:05:29.360> and<00:05:29.780> we're<00:05:29.990> ready<00:05:30.139> to<00:05:30.259> go<00:05:30.500> so

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
where you're at and we're ready to go so

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.339 
where you're at and we're ready to go so
look<00:05:31.729> at<00:05:31.849> this<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:32.120> now<00:05:32.270> have<00:05:32.479> three<00:05:32.780> levels<00:05:33.199> on

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
look at this I now have three levels on

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.399 
look at this I now have three levels on
my<00:05:33.530> tree<00:05:34.030> which<00:05:35.030> is<00:05:35.240> very<00:05:35.539> very<00:05:35.630> exciting<00:05:36.289> as

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
my tree which is very very exciting as

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.649 
my tree which is very very exciting as
you<00:05:36.500> can<00:05:36.650> see<00:05:36.889> driving<00:05:37.699> really<00:05:38.000> radically

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
you can see driving really radically

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.260 
you can see driving really radically
because<00:05:38.870> I'm<00:05:38.990> so<00:05:39.139> excited<00:05:39.849> driving<00:05:40.849> this<00:05:40.969> car

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
because I'm so excited driving this car

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.460 
because I'm so excited driving this car
is<00:05:41.539> a<00:05:42.699> major<00:05:43.699> disappointment

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
is a major disappointment

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.170 
is a major disappointment
because<00:05:46.470> it's<00:05:46.680> just<00:05:46.770> like<00:05:47.100> driving<00:05:47.310> a<00:05:47.640> car<00:05:47.670> I

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
because it's just like driving a car I

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.950 
because it's just like driving a car I
mean<00:05:48.780> you<00:05:49.020> know<00:05:49.140> a<00:05:49.790> little<00:05:50.790> quieter<00:05:51.240> a<00:05:51.390> little

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
mean you know a little quieter a little

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.780 
mean you know a little quieter a little
smoother<00:05:52.380> I<00:05:52.560> got<00:05:52.920> trees<00:05:53.220> on<00:05:53.400> my<00:05:53.550> dashboard

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
smoother I got trees on my dashboard

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.500 
smoother I got trees on my dashboard
I've<00:05:54.720> got<00:05:54.960> range<00:05:55.440> anxiety<00:05:55.770> I<00:05:56.310> guess<00:05:56.640> not<00:05:57.300> too

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
I've got range anxiety I guess not too

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.800 
I've got range anxiety I guess not too
much<00:05:57.690> I've<00:05:57.930> got<00:05:58.110> 91<00:05:58.620> miles<00:05:58.980> to<00:05:59.250> go<00:05:59.430> and<00:05:59.810> about

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
much I've got 91 miles to go and about

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.210 
much I've got 91 miles to go and about
two<00:06:00.990> miles<00:06:01.230> away<00:06:01.380> from<00:06:01.560> where<00:06:01.710> i<00:06:01.860> need<00:06:02.070> to<00:06:02.100> go

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
two miles away from where i need to go

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.310 
two miles away from where i need to go
so<00:06:02.790> i<00:06:02.850> guess<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.030> car<00:06:03.330> like<00:06:03.540> this<00:06:03.720> really<00:06:04.050> makes

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
so i guess a car like this really makes

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.020 
so i guess a car like this really makes
sense<00:06:04.650> if<00:06:04.800> you've<00:06:04.950> got<00:06:05.070> a<00:06:05.100> short<00:06:05.430> commute<00:06:05.640> now

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
sense if you've got a short commute now

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.110 
sense if you've got a short commute now
I<00:06:06.620> have<00:06:07.620> to<00:06:07.770> go<00:06:07.890> about<00:06:08.130> two<00:06:08.370> miles<00:06:08.610> to<00:06:08.850> get<00:06:09.060> to

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
I have to go about two miles to get to

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.220 
I have to go about two miles to get to
work<00:06:09.330> so<00:06:09.540> because<00:06:10.140> this<00:06:10.500> would<00:06:10.680> work<00:06:10.830> for<00:06:11.100> me
