00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.119
 This is it people these days it's raining 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.100
 A little here in Florida and me. 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.910
 I needed to use the windshield wiper 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.710
 Of car 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.449
 only those who are unbalanced also look 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.740
 only as it is the highest part of the 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.220
 driver 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.960
 never audits surpassing here the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.619
 limit is beating is proof flÃ¡vio 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.419
 lopes 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.390
 So we're going to fix the car . 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:40.010
 rental car just look how I like justice is 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:43.879
 easy do-it-yourself entirely catch 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.170
 a very simple right key your 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.629
 car is happening this type of 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.059
 just do it yourself 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.399
 Look who is in the ideal position and 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.239
 if in the passenger the driver 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.520
 even in the rest position it is not 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.680
 correctly supporting what happens in the 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.629
 time you turn on and go over the limit 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.200
 of the glass making noise 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:10.549
 alas you loose loosen it bolt 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.280
 of the arm of yesterday a bag is 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.460
 a sack of nobody left under a little 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.340
 But here you have to give to the one who 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.680
 beat down that the arm did not drop the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.500
 arm and I think the maximum he goes 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:31.800
 if here he has a kind of hangover 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:35.820
 which helps a lot in the pulling of the arm 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.770
 Then beauty of the leila saquinha has already released and 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.180
 Look how the regulation regulation took 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.560
 He's straightened and he 's already in a position 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.910
 best 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.910
 now just come back with 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.320
 a fixing port for the position 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.420
 ideal look only 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.070
 how wonderful 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.540
 will now stop bothering me 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.009
 fill the bag here at the ball that 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.880
 horrible noise hitting the column 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.670
 Of car 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.260
 Thank you, leave it to yourself. 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.050
 Calm people, calm down, calm down. 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.980
 Time I thought I 'd finish here. 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.550
 enjoy this video since people 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.330
 showed that the regulation procedure 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.500
 plus the windshield wiper harness 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.340
 and talk a little bit about the mechanics of 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.239
 cross where curiosity 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.530
 Looks simple mechanical lots of space and 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.800
 in the motor safe insulated battery 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.270
 thermal and metal 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.860
 detail that for the control part of 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.570
 mixture that uses a sensor here in the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.700
 pressurizing looks interesting 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:00.500
 and the pressurizing of lior 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.690
 plastic pressurizing systems here 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.140
 also in admission the air that is breathed 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.590
 here also has a sensor and 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.890
 also in the collector there is another sensor 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.630
 then three sensors 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.540
 working by informing the module 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.950
 time the whole condition is not the quantity 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.920
 dismissed daily 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.430
 he uses a coil that single package 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.000
 that entire coil in the case of some 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.829
 defect rewind full bobbin exchange 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.560
 here the detail of the location of the turbo 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.590
 very simple compressor plenty of space for 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.280
 work here 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.010
 a curiosity of chevrolet cars 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.709
 and if known in Brazil as overflows 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.959
 pain in it serves to be able to 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.320
 vibrations from the 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.910
 pressurizing the fuel and it does not 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.620
 there is direct injection it has a tube 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.500
 distributor with electrons 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.819
 directors in the admission collector nothing of 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.739
 direct injection 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.780
 Electronic throttle raining in the wet 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.049
 Of course it 's an old thing. 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.780
 never in the American chaos does not use 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.510
 only running belt can 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.579
 see the accessories race and he also 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.000
 does not have power steering but 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:20.039
 electric drive that huge box of 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.009
 direction there with an electric motor 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.740
 integrated close to the box you can see 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.860
 in the center of the video a probe is a probe 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.900
 oxygen sensor and also a 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.750
 another oxygen sensor here, not all 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.349
 world already knows a probe before the 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.930
 catalyst and a post catalyst probe 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.820
 to check the service is not the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.630
 monitoring and power supply 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.270
 the engine in gas emissions and here 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.599
 injection center the location of the 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:58.080
 very simple injection center 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:00.479
 located at a point where the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.270
 contact with high temperature despite 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:06.889
 of the motor of enough space 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.889
 earned guys even more
