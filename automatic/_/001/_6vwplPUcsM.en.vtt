00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.580
 the exciting thing about research is that you can discover something new for them 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.260
 is a crime thriller more has some evidence but still does not know exactly 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.869
 Most and how it happened 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.269
 since 2009 Professor of Developmental Biology at the Biozentrum 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:17.890
 great 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.590
 I lead a team of about 15 people from Poland who work for us 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.689
 no Mexico America 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.339
 Percent come and the uta of course is that these different 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.420
 Cultures also involve AndrÃ©'s ways of thinking or contributing, that is to say 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.510
 we are looking for solutions also various 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.980
 brought soon 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.630
 we compared her work 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.000
 are pretty transparent 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.489
 we explain 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.550
 the Sharia 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.070
 these eggs will be then 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.390
 presented in Coburg the DAV is 25 degrees 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.620
 so that the change develops and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770
 at a certain stage 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.100
 however, the embryos will want to be the song contest microscope 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.820
 and completely analyzed 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.300
 new electric bikes now allow us directly as one with some in 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.510
 contact 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.570
 to produce that means we see 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.850
 from the designs 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.700
 happened and then there it was finally pull 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.490
 how a development process is going on 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.450
 At the same time we flood a fluorescent protein protein team 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.930
 in blood vessels 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.880
 Shine when you marvel at it with a knife 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.380
 Of course, they are very important for our survival 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.830
 transported more oxygen tied up in Aue but they are also very 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.510
 important in tumor development a tumor can not do without blood vessels 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.079
 Of course that means you want to be educated with the blood vessels of course 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.729
 that is, for certain illnesses one wants to strengthen them 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.530
 The blood vessels worth it and for tumors, for example, I would like Magnin Corsi 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.610
 the bunch to screws and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.900
 Blood vessel formation in the tumors 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.299
 Red regions 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.340
 Hits behind 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.390
 from the tumor, of course, to die off 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.960
 I have never studied you because I am here at the Cantonal Year 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.210
 Faced with fascinating life 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.619
 this is was peaceful 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.939
 Percent more needed they had been sucked off the very first day 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.309
 Au-pair at Einstein studied here 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.309
 and also the club is of course for each one that was natural 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.279
 Percent very stimulating 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.949
 and also not over the years on the level stimulates percent 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.429
 yes, maybe even more 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:24.369
 Percent to go 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:26.039
 I studied at the WEF 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.699
 ETH in Zurich Biology 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.859
 Binder but after two years emigrated mourning there have mine 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.069
 Study finished 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.609
 here and there had met after failure 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.019
 in the Czech Republic is very short he wanted at that time chill is rare and we 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.379
 Why cry every human being's nose is the murdoch newspapers and Nikki 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.369
 Reed instead 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:50.929
 and who have and what once as then find out that and the 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.589
 Cancel performances 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:56.089
 For a long time I thought that his scientific career did not coincide 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:57.859
 to reconcile with your family 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.180
 Ostdorf but not convinced of the opposite and today I am natural 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.180
 happy what he saw and the Viennese 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.730
 the minister is also running for ten years 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.409
 enthusiastic Thai boxers 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.170
 Provo judging boxes probably not my sport which the 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.189
 Test cars has found something that fascinates him 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.229
 and on what it can also align its goals 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:25.229
 that is quite comparable to the science of setting goals 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.229
 to work on enthusiasm 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.479
 about fascination
