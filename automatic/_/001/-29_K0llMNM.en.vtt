00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
to slowly run game down

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.580 
to slowly run game down
we<00:01:54.580> just<00:01:54.820> felt<00:01:55.060> like<00:01:55.300> we<00:01:55.660> were<00:01:56.080> good<00:01:56.290> enough<00:01:56.530> to

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
we just felt like we were good enough to

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.550 
we just felt like we were good enough to
still<00:01:57.010> establish<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:59.200> know<00:01:59.260> we<00:01:59.380> tried

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
still establish it and you know we tried

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.920 
still establish it and you know we tried
to<00:01:59.680> let<00:02:00.160> so<00:02:00.460> pretty<00:02:01.210> much<00:02:01.330> carry<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> load<00:02:01.900> on

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
to let so pretty much carry the load on

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.260 
to let so pretty much carry the load on
that<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.460> was<00:02:03.580> part<00:02:03.790> of<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.880> game<00:02:04.060> plan

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
that and that was part of the game plan

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.460 
that and that was part of the game plan
whether<00:02:04.510> it<00:02:04.630> was<00:02:04.720> going<00:02:04.870> to<00:02:04.930> be<00:02:04.990> raining<00:02:05.230> her

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
whether it was going to be raining her

or<00:02:05.850> sunshine<00:02:06.850> well<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.690> was<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.020> pretty<00:02:08.200> good

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
or sunshine well it was a pretty good

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.050

defensive<00:02:08.950> game<00:02:09.100> up<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.399> that<00:02:09.550> point<00:02:09.760> you<00:02:09.940> know

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
defensive game up to that point you know

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.000 
defensive game up to that point you know
we<00:02:10.180> gave<00:02:10.330> up<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.510> block<00:02:10.690> punt<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.350> they<00:02:11.800> did<00:02:11.950> a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
we gave up the block punt and they did a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.620 
we gave up the block punt and they did a
great<00:02:12.160> job<00:02:12.250> on<00:02:12.520> their<00:02:12.820> pressure<00:02:13.090> there<00:02:13.420> but

other than that Wow our defense i

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.100 
other than that Wow our defense i
thought<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.120> bought<00:02:16.330> our<00:02:16.510> next<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.840> couple

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
thought it bought our next a couple

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.200 
thought it bought our next a couple
times<00:02:17.350> really<00:02:18.100> they<00:02:18.250> had<00:02:18.430> field<00:02:18.700> position

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
times really they had field position

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.490 
times really they had field position
pretty<00:02:19.420> much<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.780> first<00:02:19.810> half<00:02:20.260> they've

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
pretty much the first half they've

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500 
pretty much the first half they've
gotten<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.770> couple<00:02:20.890> first<00:02:21.280> downs<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:22.300> we'd

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
gotten a couple first downs but we'd

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.970 
gotten a couple first downs but we'd
stopped<00:02:22.840> are<00:02:23.050> they<00:02:23.170> missed<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.470> couple<00:02:23.650> field

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
stopped are they missed a couple field

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.380 
stopped are they missed a couple field
goal<00:02:24.220> attempts<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:24.760> we<00:02:24.910> were<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.180> always

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
goal attempts but we were just always

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.090 
goal attempts but we were just always
seem<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.780> be<00:02:25.870> back<00:02:26.080> up<00:02:26.320> and/or<00:02:26.500> into<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.860> field

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
seem to be back up and/or into the field

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.620 
seem to be back up and/or into the field
that<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.370> just<00:02:27.580> didn't<00:02:27.820> ever<00:02:27.880> get<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.150> chance<00:02:28.240> to

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
that we just didn't ever get a chance to

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.080 
that we just didn't ever get a chance to
get<00:02:28.780> out<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.260> pin<00:02:30.070> them<00:02:30.250> down<00:02:30.460> on<00:02:30.520> their<00:02:30.820> side

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
get out and pin them down on their side

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.430 
get out and pin them down on their side
so<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.420> said<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.690> know<00:02:31.720> what<00:02:31.900> we're<00:02:32.320> getting

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
the ball of a second half but it seemed

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.130

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
like towards him in the second quarter

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.350 
like towards him in the second quarter

running<00:02:37.720> hard<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.140> was<00:02:38.320> able<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.590> break<00:02:38.770> out

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
running hard and was able to break out

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.220 
running hard and was able to break out
off<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.460> off<00:02:39.610> tackle<00:02:39.910> play<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:41.110> was

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
off of that off tackle play and it was

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.080 
off of that off tackle play and it was
just<00:02:41.380> couple<00:02:41.800> times<00:02:42.010> more<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.670> step<00:02:42.910> away

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
just couple times more just to step away

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
from breaking for 2030 yarder and we

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.220 
from breaking for 2030 yarder and we
just<00:02:45.970> felt<00:02:46.150> if<00:02:46.330> we<00:02:46.420> could<00:02:46.600> take<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.930> opening

better<00:03:31.190> this<00:03:31.370> year<00:03:31.430> than<00:03:31.610> we<00:03:31.760> did<00:03:31.819> last<00:03:31.970> year

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
better this year than we did last year

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.290 
better this year than we did last year
you<00:03:33.380> know<00:03:33.530> we<00:03:33.709> just<00:03:34.370> didn't<00:03:34.640> have<00:03:34.670> time<00:03:35.060> at

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
you know we just didn't have time at

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.940 
you know we just didn't have time at
times<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.720> then<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:35.930> think<00:03:36.230> four<00:03:36.380> or<00:03:36.410> five<00:03:36.620> sacks

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
times I then I think four or five sacks

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.320 
times I then I think four or five sacks
their<00:03:37.220> pressure<00:03:37.459> was<00:03:37.700> great<00:03:37.910> especially<00:03:37.970> in

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
their pressure was great especially in

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.210 
their pressure was great especially in
that<00:03:38.420> fourth<00:03:38.690> quarter<00:03:39.080> but<00:03:39.739> there<00:03:39.920> were<00:03:40.010> times

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
that fourth quarter but there were times

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.520 
that fourth quarter but there were times
you<00:03:40.580> know<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.910> field<00:03:41.120> conditions<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:42.290> worst

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
you know the field conditions the worst

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.590 
you know the field conditions the worst
thing<00:03:42.770> it<00:03:43.070> was<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.430> snap<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:44.269> just<00:03:44.510> seemed

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
thing it was the snap it just seemed

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.940 
thing it was the snap it just seemed
like<00:03:44.630> we<00:03:44.840> had<00:03:44.870> trouble<00:03:45.320> with<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.620> with<00:03:45.830> the

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
like we had trouble with that with the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.710 
like we had trouble with that with the
center<00:03:46.250> quarterback<00:03:46.940> exchange<00:03:47.420> on<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
center quarterback exchange on the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.240 
center quarterback exchange on the
shotgun<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.440> know<00:03:48.560> they<00:03:48.709> had<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.860> bad<00:03:49.070> snap

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
shotgun and I know they had a bad snap

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.009 
shotgun and I know they had a bad snap
on<00:03:49.610> one<00:03:49.820> of<00:03:49.880> their<00:03:50.000> putts<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.480> second<00:03:50.840> half

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
on one of their putts in the second half

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.770 
on one of their putts in the second half
that's<00:03:51.860> always<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.340> worst<00:03:52.550> part<00:03:52.820> that<00:03:53.600> really

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
that's always the worst part that really

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.780 
that's always the worst part that really
wasn't<00:03:54.110> as<00:03:54.320> close<00:03:54.560> we<00:03:54.980> experienced<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.580> year

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
wasn't as close we experienced a year

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.970 
wasn't as close we experienced a year
ago<00:03:55.910> but<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.900> biggest<00:03:57.110> thing<00:03:57.440> is<00:03:57.620> always

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
ago but the biggest thing is always

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.830 
ago but the biggest thing is always
handling<00:03:58.519> that<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.819> quarterback<00:03:59.330> exchange

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
handling that that quarterback exchange

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.240 
handling that that quarterback exchange
and<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.140> think<00:04:00.319> that's<00:04:00.500> what<00:04:00.680> hurt<00:04:00.830> us<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:00.980> little

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
and I think that's what hurt us a little

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.790 
and I think that's what hurt us a little
bit<00:04:01.459> i<00:04:01.819> know<00:04:02.810> i<00:04:02.840> decided<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.380> rein<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.739> a

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
bit i know i decided to rein it in a

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.650 
bit i know i decided to rein it in a
little<00:04:03.890> bit<00:04:04.250> we<00:04:04.459> dropped<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.880> couple<00:04:05.090> shotguns

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
little bit we dropped a couple shotguns

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.780 
little bit we dropped a couple shotguns
naturally<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.200> couple<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.620> our<00:04:06.769> heads<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:07.730> I

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
naturally a couple of our heads and so I

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.040 
naturally a couple of our heads and so I
said<00:04:07.850> let's<00:04:08.090> get<00:04:08.180> back<00:04:08.360> under<00:04:08.630> standard<00:04:08.959> I

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
said let's get back under standard I

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.630 
said let's get back under standard I
know<00:04:09.110> sometimes<00:04:09.440> that's<00:04:09.830> not<00:04:09.920> conducive<00:04:10.519> as

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
know sometimes that's not conducive as

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.340 
know sometimes that's not conducive as
matt<00:04:10.850> said<00:04:10.880> that<00:04:11.150> getting<00:04:11.569> back<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.930> seeing

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
matt said that getting back to seeing

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.320 
matt said that getting back to seeing
the<00:04:12.470> coverage<00:04:12.860> but<00:04:13.610> it<00:04:13.880> was<00:04:13.970> better<00:04:14.120> than

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
the coverage but it was better than

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.500 
the coverage but it was better than
taking<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.959> 56<00:04:15.470> yard<00:04:15.680> loss<00:04:16.120> just<00:04:17.120> seemed<00:04:17.359> I

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
taking a 56 yard loss just seemed I

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.539 
taking a 56 yard loss just seemed I
looked<00:04:17.810> around<00:04:17.930> or<00:04:18.560> even<00:04:18.859> our<00:04:19.160> coaching

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.870 
staffs name and there's still quite a
few<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.950> us<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.070> had<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.340> chance<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.729> play

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880
