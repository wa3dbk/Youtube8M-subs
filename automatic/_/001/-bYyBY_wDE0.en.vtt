you

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.290 

concepts<00:00:09.470> are<00:00:09.620> always<00:00:10.060> interesting<00:00:11.060> because

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
concepts are always interesting because

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.540 
concepts are always interesting because
they<00:00:11.690> allow<00:00:11.990> the<00:00:12.050> organization<00:00:12.950> to<00:00:13.250> to

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
they allow the organization to to

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.260 
they allow the organization to to
stretch<00:00:13.850> itself<00:00:14.240> and<00:00:14.570> this<00:00:15.559> concept<00:00:16.309> is<00:00:16.520> no

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
stretch itself and this concept is no

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.830 
stretch itself and this concept is no
exception<00:00:17.830> as<00:00:18.830> a<00:00:18.890> as<00:00:19.460> a<00:00:19.520> brand<00:00:20.029> we've<00:00:20.570> already

exception as a as a brand we've already

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.240 
exception as a as a brand we've already
stretched<00:00:21.470> to<00:00:22.480> hybrid<00:00:24.039> we've<00:00:25.039> already

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
stretched to hybrid we've already

stretched to hybrid we've already
announced<00:00:25.700> that<00:00:26.090> we're<00:00:26.270> moving<00:00:26.750> towards<00:00:27.470> an

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
announced that we're moving towards an

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.040 
announced that we're moving towards an
electric<00:00:28.220> vehicle<00:00:28.400> electric<00:00:29.180> sedan<00:00:29.480> that's

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
electric vehicle electric sedan that's

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.140 
electric vehicle electric sedan that's
coming<00:00:30.470> in<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.680> mid<00:00:30.800> term<00:00:31.010> and<00:00:31.760> then<00:00:31.880> really

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
coming in the mid term and then really

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.970 
coming in the mid term and then really
the<00:00:32.180> question<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:32.900> so<00:00:33.260> what<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:33.770> what's

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
the question is so so what so what's

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.090 
the question is so so what so what's
next<00:00:34.330> and<00:00:35.330> this<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:36.260> sports<00:00:36.620> car<00:00:36.920> is

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
next and this the sports car is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.400 
next and this the sports car is
basically<00:00:37.309> about<00:00:37.820> exploring<00:00:38.420> what<00:00:38.809> we<00:00:39.020> think

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
basically about exploring what we think

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.360 
basically about exploring what we think
is<00:00:39.590> next<00:00:39.920> I<00:00:40.280> guess<00:00:41.030> from<00:00:41.390> really<00:00:42.140> two<00:00:43.040> or<00:00:43.129> three

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
is next I guess from really two or three

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.520 
is next I guess from really two or three
perspectives<00:00:43.640> I<00:00:44.239> mean<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:44.989> first<00:00:45.170> and

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
perspectives I mean the first and

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.790 
perspectives I mean the first and
obvious<00:00:45.949> perspective<00:00:46.850> is<00:00:47.680> introducing<00:00:48.680> the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
obvious perspective is introducing the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.520 
obvious perspective is introducing the
technology<00:00:49.400> of<00:00:49.430> range<00:00:49.820> extender<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:50.629> you've

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
technology of range extender so you've

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.910 
technology of range extender so you've
got<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.280> EV<00:00:52.960> which<00:00:53.960> allows<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.799> know

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
got the the EV which allows you you know

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.229 
got the the EV which allows you you know
very<00:00:55.220> great<00:00:55.790> performance<00:00:57.610> but<00:00:58.610> can<00:00:58.970> you<00:00:59.059> do

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
very great performance but can you do

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.180 
very great performance but can you do
that<00:00:59.420> in<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.690> way<00:00:59.839> that<00:01:00.110> that's<00:01:00.229> interesting<00:01:00.949> to

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
that in a way that that's interesting to

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.700 
that in a way that that's interesting to
to<00:01:01.640> people<00:01:01.970> that<00:01:02.059> are<00:01:02.210> limited<00:01:02.629> by<00:01:02.989> by<00:01:03.379> range

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
to people that are limited by by range

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.070 
to people that are limited by by range
and<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.909> technical<00:01:05.360> challenge<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:05.960> being

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
and the technical challenge of being

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.550 
and the technical challenge of being
able<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:06.560> switch<00:01:06.860> between<00:01:07.040> electric<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.560> and

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
able to switch between electric and and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.310 
able to switch between electric and and
you<00:01:10.070> know<00:01:10.100> petrol<00:01:11.000> driven<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:12.020> there's<00:01:12.229> an

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
you know petrol driven so there's an

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.830 
you know petrol driven so there's an
interesting<00:01:12.770> concept<00:01:13.400> there<00:01:15.910> this<00:01:16.910> concept

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
interesting concept there this concept

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.250 
interesting concept there this concept
also<00:01:18.320> allows<00:01:18.680> us<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.820> think<00:01:20.030> about<00:01:20.330> the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
also allows us to to think about the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.800 
also allows us to to think about the
next<00:01:21.560> level<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:22.010> design<00:01:22.340> language<00:01:22.690> for<00:01:23.690> the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
next level of design language for the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.350 
next level of design language for the
product<00:01:24.170> for<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.440> company<00:01:24.830> for<00:01:24.860> infinity<00:01:25.580> so

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
product for the company for infinity so

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.180 
product for the company for infinity so
it<00:01:26.510> allows<00:01:26.750> us<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.140> stretch<00:01:27.380> about<00:01:27.740> what

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
it allows us to stretch about what

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.790 
it allows us to stretch about what
direction<00:01:29.090> do<00:01:29.360> we<00:01:29.420> think<00:01:29.660> we're<00:01:29.780> going<00:01:29.990> beyond

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
direction do we think we're going beyond

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.620 
direction do we think we're going beyond
the<00:01:30.980> cars<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.520> we've<00:01:31.670> already<00:01:31.880> shown<00:01:32.360> as

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
the cars that we've already shown as

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.560 
the cars that we've already shown as
concept<00:01:33.320> cars<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.370> for<00:01:34.520> example<00:01:34.640> making<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
concept cars so for example making the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.070 
concept cars so for example making the
car<00:01:35.750> more<00:01:36.020> seductive<00:01:36.620> more<00:01:37.690> energizing<00:01:38.690> in

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
car more seductive more energizing in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.990 
car more seductive more energizing in
the<00:01:39.470> way<00:01:39.620> that<00:01:39.830> it's<00:01:40.040> it's<00:01:40.610> pulled<00:01:40.880> together

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the way that it's it's pulled together

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.700 
the way that it's it's pulled together
and<00:01:41.480> really<00:01:41.960> defines<00:01:42.560> what<00:01:42.800> infinity<00:01:43.340> will<00:01:43.670> be

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
and really defines what infinity will be

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:54.310 
and really defines what infinity will be
next<00:01:45.710> next<00:01:46.720> generation

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.480 

well<00:01:55.320> infinity<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.990> as<00:01:57.990> an<00:01:58.560> entity<00:01:58.829> likes<00:01:59.280> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
well infinity as a as an entity likes to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.870 
well infinity as a as an entity likes to
stretch<00:01:59.759> itself<00:02:00.179> so<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.679> mean<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.729> key

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
stretch itself so I mean one of the key

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.730 
stretch itself so I mean one of the key
challenges<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.539> us<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.869> when<00:02:04.289> we<00:02:04.409> lay<00:02:04.590> this

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
challenges for us is when we lay this

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.559 
challenges for us is when we lay this
out<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> engineers<00:02:05.789> and<00:02:05.939> designers<00:02:06.090> is

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
out to the engineers and designers is

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.839 
out to the engineers and designers is
what<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.380> what<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.859> level<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.369> stretches

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
what that what that level of stretches

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.740 
what that what that level of stretches
and<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.560> no<00:02:10.769> exception<00:02:10.799> I<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:12.120> really

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and this is no exception I think really

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.839 
and this is no exception I think really
one<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> key<00:02:13.319> things<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.069> we<00:02:14.340> challenge

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
one of the key things that we challenge

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.839 
one of the key things that we challenge
the<00:02:15.030> organization<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.959> look<00:02:16.140> at<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:17.519> this

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
the organization to look at is is this

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.740 
the organization to look at is is this
new<00:02:18.030> technology<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.900> range<00:02:19.860> extender<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:21.180> how

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
new technology of range extender so how

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.089 
new technology of range extender so how
can<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.049> have<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:23.069> know<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.430> sports<00:02:23.910> car<00:02:24.180> and

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
can you have you know a sports car and

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.410 
can you have you know a sports car and
electric<00:02:26.099> sports<00:02:26.310> cars<00:02:26.640> by<00:02:26.819> themselves<00:02:27.239> or

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
electric sports cars by themselves or

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.380 
electric sports cars by themselves or
rare<00:02:27.599> beasts<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:29.310> how<00:02:29.459> can<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.760> take<00:02:30.030> this

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
rare beasts but how can you take this

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.610 
rare beasts but how can you take this
the<00:02:30.780> sportscast<00:02:31.379> concept<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:33.030> make<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.620> have

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the sportscast concept and make it have

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.369 
the sportscast concept and make it have
a<00:02:34.650> social<00:02:35.190> conscience<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:37.079> know<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
a social conscience so you know the

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.920 
a social conscience so you know the
electric<00:02:37.739> car<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.970> gasoline<00:02:39.420> engine

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
electric car that the gasoline engine

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.530 
electric car that the gasoline engine
the<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.739> have<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.040> work<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.430> harmony<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:42.420> they

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the to have to work in harmony but they

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.240 
the to have to work in harmony but they
still<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.019> deliver<00:02:43.170> an<00:02:43.769> experience

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
still have to deliver an experience

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.770 
still have to deliver an experience
which<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.359> which<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.910> infinity<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.629> still

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
which is which is infinity and it still

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.140 
which is which is infinity and it still
has<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.019> feel<00:02:49.349> like<00:02:49.560> an<00:02:49.769> infinity<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.519> that's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
has to feel like an infinity and that's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.369 
has to feel like an infinity and that's
something<00:02:51.390> we've<00:02:51.540> never<00:02:51.660> done<00:02:51.780> before<00:02:51.930> with

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
something we've never done before with

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.259 
something we've never done before with
this<00:02:52.530> particular<00:02:52.859> powertrain<00:02:53.579> combination

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
this particular powertrain combination

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.599 
this particular powertrain combination
so<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.510> as<00:02:54.660> that's<00:02:55.319> really<00:02:55.620> one<00:02:56.129> very<00:02:56.430> clear

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
so that as that's really one very clear

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.009 
so that as that's really one very clear
task<00:02:59.609> that<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.359> draw<00:03:00.540> out<00:03:00.569> of<00:03:00.900> this

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
task that we have to draw out of this

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.789 
task that we have to draw out of this
concept<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:02.400> other<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.790> really<00:03:03.090> around<00:03:03.329> this

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
concept the other is really around this

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.949 
concept the other is really around this
styling<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:05.010> mean<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:05.910> about<00:03:06.000> stretching

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
styling I mean it's about stretching

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.750 
styling I mean it's about stretching
beyond<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.769> concepts<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.400> we've<00:03:08.609> already

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
beyond the concepts that we've already

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.750 
beyond the concepts that we've already
shown<00:03:09.180> we've<00:03:09.900> shown<00:03:10.169> the<00:03:10.349> world<00:03:10.760> essence

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
shown we've shown the world essence

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.370 
shown we've shown the world essence
we've<00:03:12.060> shown<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.480> word<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.200> world

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
we've shown the word of the world

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.979 
we've shown the word of the world
atheria<00:03:14.310> but<00:03:14.940> what<00:03:15.090> comes<00:03:15.269> beyond<00:03:15.750> that

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
atheria but what comes beyond that

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.839 
atheria but what comes beyond that
what's<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.410> design<00:03:16.829> language<00:03:17.069> that<00:03:17.639> will

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
what's the design language that will

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.789 
what's the design language that will
prevail<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:19.370> infinity<00:03:20.370> at<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:21.000> next<00:03:21.389> next

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
prevail for infinity at the next next

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:29.640 
prevail for infinity at the next next
generation

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.449 

well<00:03:30.689> the<00:03:31.689> short<00:03:31.900> answer<00:03:32.110> is<00:03:32.379> geneva<00:03:33.310> motor

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
well the short answer is geneva motor

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.080 
well the short answer is geneva motor
show<00:03:34.439> but<00:03:35.439> and<00:03:36.069> i'm<00:03:36.189> really<00:03:36.459> looking<00:03:36.579> forward

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
show but and i'm really looking forward

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.580 
show but and i'm really looking forward
to<00:03:37.120> having<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.390> opportunity<00:03:37.629> to<00:03:37.959> present<00:03:38.260> the

to having the opportunity to present the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.240 
to having the opportunity to present the
car<00:03:38.799> at<00:03:39.010> at<00:03:39.670> geneva<00:03:40.180> but<00:03:40.900> will<00:03:41.049> also<00:03:41.079> have<00:03:41.560> some

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
car at at geneva but will also have some

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.600 
car at at geneva but will also have some
time<00:03:42.489> between<00:03:42.670> now<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.840> then<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:45.159> update<00:03:45.579> a

time between now and then to update a

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.479 
time between now and then to update a
little<00:03:45.909> bit<00:03:46.000> about<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.359> story<00:03:47.220> tell<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.250> little

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
little bit about the story tell a little

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.240 
little bit about the story tell a little
bit<00:03:48.579> more<00:03:48.909> about<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.480> details<00:03:50.140> behind<00:03:50.769> the

bit more about the details behind the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.429 
bit more about the details behind the
the<00:03:51.700> development<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.420> then<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:53.019> course<00:03:53.049> at

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 
the development and then of course at

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.679 
the development and then of course at
this<00:03:53.560> show<00:03:53.970> you'll<00:03:54.970> be<00:03:55.090> able<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.239> judge<00:03:55.480> for

this show you'll be able to judge for

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.089 
this show you'll be able to judge for
yourself<00:03:56.019> whether<00:03:56.109> we've<00:03:56.470> achieved<00:03:56.590> what<00:03:57.069> we

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
yourself whether we've achieved what we

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.679 
yourself whether we've achieved what we
want<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.489> achieve<00:03:57.579> but<00:03:58.000> i<00:03:58.030> believe<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.390> will

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
want to achieve but i believe that will

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.440 
want to achieve but i believe that will
have<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.870> very<00:03:59.109> compelling<00:03:59.980> story<00:04:00.459> about<00:04:00.849> how

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
have a very compelling story about how

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.879 
have a very compelling story about how
one<00:04:02.310> execute<00:04:03.310> san<00:04:03.639> an<00:04:04.170> extended-range<00:04:05.170> EV<00:04:05.680> on

the one hand and also what our design

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.520 
the one hand and also what our design
language<00:04:08.409> is<00:04:08.799> going<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.099> look<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.280> beyond

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
language is going to look like beyond

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.129 
language is going to look like beyond
atheria<00:04:11.530> beyond<00:04:12.190> essence<00:04:12.940> so<00:04:13.480> in<00:04:13.780> short
