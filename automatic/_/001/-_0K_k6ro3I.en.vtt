00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:27.759
 yes i am junkie from jackpot casino 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:30.279
 I'm 60s here and now 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.230
 years model so the art is but 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.020
 not old or so i believe this 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.790
 somehow from the nineties I have 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.680
 those of acquaintances of mine I always 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.379
 in the studio has taken from his 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.020
 band is 112 patrol which means great 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.149
 cobra of such well-known I have those there 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.710
 we forced them on and then on 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.430
 I have so baptized in the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:56.879
 I really liked the games 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:59.530
 I mainly stop is the model 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.140
 also played pretty down 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.449
 it's not very special with anybody 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.380
 not original from the sixties 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.830
 years thousands of euros but 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.040
 somehow artificially only these pickups 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.050
 the tonabnehmer are as stated 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.200
 only receivers, but they are 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.100
 really good and a bit more expensive 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:30.190
 So I think the net so pick up that 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:33.520
 means you can not do it at all 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.370
 play so that's not fit 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.800
 not to my style can serve 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.200
 there is no panic as for me says 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.580
 that must have been on her Kaisers Kaiserslautern and 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.770
 they are just a bit thicker 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.630
 to convince 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:57.290
 yeah exactly and it 's actually too 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:58.970
 already at play and cool and the system 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.740
 that is already half of jaffa 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.550
 tate because it has to be like that again and again 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.460
 to be glued 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.960
 the cheapest transmitter system you can 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.060
 somehow at Tormann or somewhere 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.090
 can buy 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:35.769
 that goes to the box rainer that's yes 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:35.769
 maybe 100 relatively thick starch 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.590
 exactly definitely important not to 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.930
 You can not skinny us at all 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.470
 check 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.100
 his strength is 12 12 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:57.799
 I have somehow formally somehow 13 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:03:00.079
 Tried and fat and that was it 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.340
 me a little too hard 13a his 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.300
 camera to almost not pull at all 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:16.750
 and so 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:16.750
 So I find a bit of twelve pages 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.140
 older 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.800
 It is always so that she is so horny 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.090
 adventurous and that should be so 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.430
 angry that I take just the way one wants 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:39.820
 actually , most of the time it works 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:39.820
 actually only here so by compressor 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:04:01.840
 classic that sounds really cool 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.840
 that the 2 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:10.880
 spring reserve spiral imitate the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.500
 clearly makes an age-old one 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.050
 child i was the business team nature 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.370
 was how to destor fun just 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.729
 only of those 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.729
 supply power that's what it is 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.729
 is 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.099
 that sometimes has to be done by 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:36.099
 that is totally 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:51.320
 October again a very simple want 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.260
 as it is from compressor that is one 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.690
 down 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.550
 but a little bit more sometimes 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.080
 it is similar to the torch though 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.260
 I can do it all 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.910
 slightly louder this topic is 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:12.590
 such a cheap brand always the brand 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.590
 But it is again a compressor 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:20.889
 that's that's the porsche now 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:24.129
 Boxster up for the lower rcs 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.869
 First of all, it's important to be here 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:29.080
 that is not important to us either 

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:32.629
 I can play over march or something 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.089
 and he has a lot of caves and hand 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.409
 what a cool heating spiral that is 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:46.929
 also all regulators here on 10 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:46.929
 turned up at me a lot drinks a lot 

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:57.559
 Actually, the problem is that me 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.360
 sometimes always not enough 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:01.360
 shove it had me now many heights 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:12.759
 so I have to much loud or find it 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.340
 we thin a little bit of sound and 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:18.159
 that's why I have this song glow m 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.449
 that is somehow that is one 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:24.729
 Japanese remake from the tourist office 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:28.659
 transistor in which ensures quite loud 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:34.900
 and since then do the following happens, the 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:36.370
 Now this box is the power 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.759
 kind of up-to-date with such a thing 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:43.770
 fundament just better purely 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.770
 turned everything else out completely 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:27.600
 case comes not before he 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.900
 hmm 

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:55.830
 but this is actually so all 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.830
 not easy to use 

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.199
 10
