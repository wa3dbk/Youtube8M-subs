and<00:00:15.890> HP<00:00:16.890> claiming<00:00:17.510> 181<00:00:18.510> prints<00:00:18.869> an<00:00:18.990> hour<00:00:19.170> and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and HP claiming 181 prints an hour and

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.279 
and HP claiming 181 prints an hour and
it<00:00:20.189> really<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.670> quite<00:00:21.359> an<00:00:21.539> impressive<00:00:21.810> machine

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
it really is quite an impressive machine

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.400 
it really is quite an impressive machine
and<00:00:24.109> let's<00:00:25.109> go<00:00:25.259> through<00:00:27.560> okay

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
and let's go through okay

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.220

everything can be new printed and let me

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.329 
everything can be new printed and let me
just<00:01:01.410> pull<00:01:01.560> the<00:01:01.680> carriage<00:01:01.890> out<00:01:03.470> okay<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.799> we

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
just pull the carriage out okay and we

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.910 
just pull the carriage out okay and we
show<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> double<00:01:06.030> suede<00:01:06.270> technology<00:01:06.990> what

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
show the double suede technology what

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.349 
show the double suede technology what
we're<00:01:08.039> talking<00:01:08.399> about<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> four<00:01:09.179> ring

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:09.359 
we're talking about it's a four ring

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.450 
we're talking about it's a four ring
system<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.899> this<00:01:10.049> machine<00:01:10.229> where<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.250> see

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
system on this machine where we can see

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.649 
system on this machine where we can see
there<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> printed<00:01:12.390> each<00:01:12.899> one<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.289> them<00:01:13.409> dub<00:01:13.590> dub

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
there I printed each one of them dub dub

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.060 
there I printed each one of them dub dub
yeah<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.049> got<00:01:16.079> two<00:01:16.320> printers<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.920> each

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
yeah so we got two printers for each

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.069 
yeah so we got two printers for each
color<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.640> means<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.329> can<00:01:18.450> lay<00:01:18.630> down<00:01:18.840> in

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
color just means it can lay down in

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:27.709 
color just means it can lay down in
twice<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.590> quickly<00:01:26.420> come<00:01:27.420> over<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
twice as quickly come over to the

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.120 
twice as quickly come over to the
left-hand<00:01:27.960> side<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.530> show<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> ink

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
left-hand side and show you the ink

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
left-hand side and show you the ink
reservoirs<00:01:29.429> on<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.880> machine<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> comes

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
reservoirs on this machine and comes

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.590 
reservoirs on this machine and comes
standard<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.890> 225<00:01:32.819> millings

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
standard with 225 millings

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.039 
standard with 225 millings
much<00:01:34.469> better<00:01:34.740> value<00:01:35.039> for<00:01:35.069> money<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.899> 2400<00:01:36.899> me

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
much better value for money is 2400 me

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.380 
much better value for money is 2400 me
links<00:01:37.319> to<00:01:37.439> come<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.770> machine<00:01:38.390> so

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
links to come with the machine so

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.789 
links to come with the machine so
they're<00:01:39.569> housed<00:01:39.749> in<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:42.679> pull<00:01:43.679> them

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
they're housed in there pull them

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.840 
they're housed in there pull them
forward<00:01:44.569> as<00:01:45.569> you<00:01:45.749> can<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:45.929> really<00:01:46.759> quite<00:01:47.759> an

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
forward as you can see really quite an

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.099 
forward as you can see really quite an
impressive<00:01:48.119> reservoir<00:01:48.719> bank<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.170> 400<00:01:49.740> mil<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
impressive reservoir bank of 400 mil and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.139 
impressive reservoir bank of 400 mil and
so<00:01:52.109> really<00:01:52.380> will<00:01:52.499> last<00:01:52.740> some<00:01:52.979> time<00:01:53.039> a<00:01:53.549> very

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
so really will last some time a very

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.649 
so really will last some time a very
economical<00:01:54.389> machine

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.590 

they're<00:02:01.380> capable<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.920> taking<00:02:02.270> anything<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
they're capable of taking anything up to

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.050 
they're capable of taking anything up to
a<00:02:03.630> 42-inch<00:02:04.229> role<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.890> becoming<00:02:05.159> got<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.430> 33-inch

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
role loaded on the machine here and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.180 
role loaded on the machine here and
we'll<00:02:09.390> print<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:09.869> photographic<00:02:10.560> quality<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
we'll print a photographic quality of

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.940 
we'll print a photographic quality of
that<00:02:11.310> size<00:02:15.290> come<00:02:16.290> around<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.620> back<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.800> the
