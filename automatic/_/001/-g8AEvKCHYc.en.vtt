00:00:00.958 --> 00:00:03.583
 We found that there is still a lack of one on the market. 

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:09.083
 The technology is truly leading the hybrid off-road bike. 

00:00:12.708 --> 00:00:15.792
 The direction of Boone's pursuit is actually a deep passion. 

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:17.208
 We love mixing off-road. 

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:18.208
 We like to participate in this competition, 

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:21.458
 We realize that we have such parts and assemble them together. 

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:26.417
 It can form a bicycle that is unmatched by any bicycle on the market. 

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:29.208
 IsoSpeed ​​developed with Fabian Cancellara won at Flanders and Roubaix 

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:37.625
 The most landmark classics are closely linked. 

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:40.250
 IsoSpeed ​​separates the upper tube from the seat tube, 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.792
 Additional compliance is obtained without any negative impact on power transmission, 

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:48.125
 It has been proven to ride faster on rough roads. 

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.000
 The problem that comes immediately is that 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.125
 When will we apply this technology to hybrid off-road bikes? 

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:57.333
 Fortunately, things are not so simple. 

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:02.375
 We used IsoSpeed ​​and merged it into the inline seat tube IsoSpeed. 

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:07.833
 It allows us to add space when we have a shoulder. 

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:13.792
 This geometry was developed specifically by us and Katie Compton. 

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:18.042
 She tirelessly repeated the geometry test. 

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:19.958
 Until we find the best solution. 

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:24.458
 I must be serious and demanding. 

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:29.833
 I just like the feeling of speeding up. 

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.125
 When you rush out of the corner, 

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.750
 When you rush to a short, steep hill, 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.917
 When you pick up your bike and go uphill, 

00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:36.583
 Grab such a light thing, 

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:39.458
 Your shoulders are not very heavy, it feels good. 

00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:40.167
 Really helpful. 

00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:44.125
 Using OCLV, 

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:45.833
 After years of testing, 

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:50.917
 We are able to produce the lightest hybrid off-road bike without any loss of durability. 

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:53.708
 I think the feeling of speed is the factor that I pay most attention to. 

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:00.625
 We are not going to choose the type of brake for you. 

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:02.708
 So whether it is cantilever or disc, 

00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:05.250
 You can decide for yourself in the new Boone model. 

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:14.167
 We looked at some special parts and parts to ensure they have extra protection. 

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:18.833
 We make OCLV weather strips with carbon fiber armor. 

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:21.875
 To prevent wear and tear caused by weather factors. 

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:26.125
 We installed a new built-in battery holder and 3S chain holder on the bike. 

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:29.125
 Because no one is willing to take a slower shot than others, 

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:35.000
 Especially on rainy and muddy roads, you are trying to catch up with the guy in front. 

00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:45.083
 When we plan to start the hybrid off-road vehicle as a dedicated competition platform, 

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:47.458
 We signed a contract with Katie Compton. 

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.375
 That is what we really started 

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:55.958
 Behind the scenes of all our new hybrid off-road product development. 

00:02:55.958 --> 00:03:00.042
 By signing with other athletes, we are climbing another peak. 

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:03.833
 Sven Nys is standing at the pinnacle of the mixed off-road competition. 

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:05.958
 Sven Nys is a great addition to Trek. 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.042
 I always think of Sven as a rider I want to emulate. 

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.250
 Really, he is riding amazingly fast. 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.000
 He is a super genius. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 He worked tirelessly. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.125
 Let him ride the bicycle I helped develop. 

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:21.208
 I think that is, that is really cool. 

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:22.875
 You know, I really want to know what he thinks, 

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:24.292
 How fast can he ride? 

00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:27.333
 He rode on Boone and went straight for a gust of wind. 

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:30.917
 When asked what we can do to make it better, he said that it is perfect. 

00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:37.250
 It’s really exciting to develop this car, it can bring me into a new space in the mixed off-road. 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.458
 I am very happy to be a member of the Trek family. 

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:43.125
 Work with them to create superior technology.
