hi welcome to play ball but today we're

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.039 
hi welcome to play ball but today we're
going<00:00:04.290> over<00:00:04.560> endgame<00:00:05.100> theories<00:00:05.870> we're<00:00:06.870> going

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
going over endgame theories we're going

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.350 
going over endgame theories we're going
to<00:00:07.140> show<00:00:07.350> you<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.710> simple<00:00:07.980> arithmetic<00:00:08.370> formula

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
to show you a simple arithmetic formula

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.540 
to show you a simple arithmetic formula
to<00:00:09.750> have<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.469> determine<00:00:11.010> whether<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.370> have

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
to have it to determine whether you have

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.839 
to have it to determine whether you have
to<00:00:11.700> move<00:00:12.410> whoever<00:00:13.410> goes<00:00:13.620> first<00:00:13.950> can<00:00:14.309> win<00:00:14.519> by

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
to move whoever goes first can win by

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.540 
to move whoever goes first can win by
force<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> opposition<00:00:16.100> opposite<00:00:17.100> side<00:00:17.310> to

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
force in the opposition opposite side to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.439 
force in the opposition opposite side to
retreat<00:00:18.199> this<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.410> known<00:00:19.590> as<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:20.010> move<00:00:20.220> or<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
retreat this is known as the move or the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.980 
retreat this is known as the move or the
opposition<00:00:21.980> here<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:24.840> way

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
opposition here we have this is the way

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.529 
opposition here we have this is the way
it<00:00:25.109> works<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.769> only<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.730> use<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.150> it's

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
it works is you only can use this it's

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.570 
it works is you only can use this it's
an<00:00:27.630> end<00:00:27.810> game<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.740> end<00:00:28.859> game<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.250> use<00:00:29.400> it

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
an end game for the end game you use it

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.189 
an end game for the end game you use it
only<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> numbers<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.599> pieces<00:00:31.050> are

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
only when the numbers of pieces are

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.069 
only when the numbers of pieces are
equal<00:00:31.590> we're<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> show<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.279> this

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
equal we're going to show you this

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.889 
equal we're going to show you this
shortly<00:00:34.079> example<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.820> second<00:00:36.239> thing<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.540> when

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
shortly example the second thing is when

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.139 
shortly example the second thing is when
it's<00:00:37.050> your<00:00:37.230> turn<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.739> play<00:00:37.940> that's<00:00:38.940> how<00:00:39.059> you

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
it's your turn to play that's how you

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
it's your turn to play that's how you
can<00:00:39.390> figure<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.230> when<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
can figure out when you have the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.420 
can figure out when you have the
opposition<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.480> also<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.219> is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
opposition and also what you do is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.010 
opposition and also what you do is
you're<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> count<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> checkers

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
you're going to count all the checkers

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
you're going to count all the checkers
regardless<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.010> call<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.610> your<00:00:47.760> four

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
regardless of call it that in your four

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.410 
regardless of call it that in your four
columns<00:00:49.579> those<00:00:50.579> are<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.820> four<00:00:51.000> columns

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
columns those are the four columns

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
columns those are the four columns
that's<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> kingsroad<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.920> example

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
that's in the kingsroad for example

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.580 
that's in the kingsroad for example
White's<00:00:54.260> zone<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.969> Kings<00:00:56.969> row<00:00:57.149> 32<00:00:57.539> 31<00:00:58.199> 30

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
White's zone with the Kings row 32 31 30

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.840 
White's zone with the Kings row 32 31 30
and<00:00:59.250> 29<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:01.070> this<00:01:02.070> would<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.430> his<00:01:03.270> squares<00:01:04.850> for

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and 29 and this would be his squares for

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.490 
and 29 and this would be his squares for
the<00:01:05.880> whites<00:01:06.119> only<00:01:06.330> you're<00:01:06.960> gonna<00:01:07.080> be<00:01:07.229> playing

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the whites only you're gonna be playing

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
the whites only you're gonna be playing
white<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.310> would<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.670> your<00:01:08.820> squares<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
white so this would be your squares and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.560 
white so this would be your squares and
the<00:01:09.930> red<00:01:10.110> zone<00:01:10.380> would<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:11.970> three<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the red zone would be one two three and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.460 
the red zone would be one two three and
four<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.229> see<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.790> diagram<00:01:15.470> so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
four as you see here in this diagram so

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.960 
four as you see here in this diagram so
let<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.680> take<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.070> off<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.759> show<00:01:17.939> you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
let me take this off now and show you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.289 
let me take this off now and show you
the<00:01:18.540> example<00:01:18.990> we're<00:01:19.950> gonna<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.460> off<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> problem

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the example we're gonna go off a problem

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.219 
the example we're gonna go off a problem
that<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:22.530> probably<00:01:22.799> an<00:01:23.040> actual<00:01:23.430> game<00:01:23.670> played

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
that was probably an actual game played

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.270 
that was probably an actual game played
by<00:01:25.229> Tom<00:01:25.530> Wiz<00:01:25.770> well<00:01:26.630> first<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.810> see<00:01:28.049> okay<00:01:28.920> all

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
by Tom Wiz well first we see okay all

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.480 
by Tom Wiz well first we see okay all
the<00:01:29.549> science<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> piece<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.110> equal<00:01:31.490> yes

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the science of the piece is equal yes

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.319 
the science of the piece is equal yes
there's<00:01:32.880> four<00:01:33.210> versus<00:01:33.689> four<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:36.180> use

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
there's four versus four so we can use

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.890 
there's four versus four so we can use
our<00:01:36.540> formula<00:01:37.220> what<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.340> your<00:01:38.579> turn<00:01:38.909> when<00:01:39.720> it's

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
our formula what is your turn when it's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.050 
our formula what is your turn when it's
your<00:01:40.020> turn<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> play<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.250> thing<00:01:41.310> it's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
your turn to play in this thing it's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.870 
your turn to play in this thing it's
white<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.479> play<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> win<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> you're<00:01:44.670> playing

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
white to play and win so you're playing

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.060 
white to play and win so you're playing
white<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:45.750> turn<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.619> formula

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
white so it's your turn so the formula

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.069 
white so it's your turn so the formula
would<00:01:47.250> work<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.640> way<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> do

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
would work this way now what do you do

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.469 
would work this way now what do you do
you<00:01:49.829> count<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> check<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
you count all the check is that in the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.530 
you count all the check is that in the
four<00:01:51.689> columns<00:01:52.159> okay<00:01:53.159> if<00:01:53.610> regardless<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
four columns okay if regardless of the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.450 
four columns okay if regardless of the
color<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.110> regardless<00:01:55.710> whether<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> king

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
color and regardless whether it's a king

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.999 
color and regardless whether it's a king
or<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> queen<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.570> you're<00:01:57.960> white<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.469> your<00:01:58.829> first

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
or a queen so you're white so your first

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.969 
or a queen so you're white so your first
column<00:01:59.399> would<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.579> 32<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:00.689> down<00:02:03.649> 0:31<00:02:04.649> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
column would be 32 you go down 0:31 you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.510
