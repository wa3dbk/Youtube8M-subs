00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.790 
things you can do two options so as you
notice<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:53.870> Google+<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.680> those

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
notice here I have Google+ for those

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.090 
notice here I have Google+ for those
applications<00:00:56.600> those<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.949> applications<00:00:58.949> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
applications those are applications and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.670 
applications those are applications and
web<00:00:59.280> apps<00:00:59.840> and<00:01:00.840> here's<00:01:01.170> how<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.500> handle

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
web apps and here's how you can handle

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.579 
web apps and here's how you can handle
this<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:02.789> into<00:01:02.940> settings<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.589> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
this you can go into settings and you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.710 
this you can go into settings and you
can<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:05.010> remove<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.670> applications<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
can just remove the applications or you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.060 
can just remove the applications or you
know<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.170> ahead<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.740> long

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
know just go ahead and you know long

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.250 
know just go ahead and you know long
press<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.520> delete<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> applications<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
press and delete the applications and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.740 
press and delete the applications and
then<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> use<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> web<00:01:12.479> apps

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
then what you can do is use the web apps

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.960 
then what you can do is use the web apps
so<00:01:13.439> web<00:01:13.680> apps<00:01:13.950> are<00:01:14.130> essentially<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
so web apps are essentially just the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.149 
so web apps are essentially just the
same<00:01:15.240> thing<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.140> launches<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> web

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
same thing it just launches in the web

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:17.749 
same thing it just launches in the web
browser

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
browser

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.120 
browser
same<00:01:18.390> thing<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.290> appears<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.009> an

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
same thing and it appears to be an

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.740 
same thing and it appears to be an
application<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.820> functions<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.299> an<00:01:21.540> app<00:01:21.630> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
application it functions like an app you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.840 
application it functions like an app you
see<00:01:21.869> I'll<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.020> pull<00:01:22.320> down<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
see I'll just pull down and it's not the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.480 
see I'll just pull down and it's not the
actual<00:01:24.110> application<00:01:27.049> there's<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.590> couple

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
actual application there's a couple

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.800 
actual application there's a couple
reasons<00:01:29.729> why<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.090> might<00:01:30.329> want<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.630> this

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
reasons why you might want to do this

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.200 
reasons why you might want to do this
one<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.590> saves<00:01:31.939> memory<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.200> two<00:01:35.030> it'll<00:01:36.030> save

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
one it saves memory and two it'll save

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
one it saves memory and two it'll save
some<00:01:36.360> battery<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.220> use<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
some battery but if you want to use the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.510 
some battery but if you want to use the
application<00:01:39.479> itself<00:01:40.130> here's<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> can

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
application itself here's what you can

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.910 
application itself here's what you can
do<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.720> into<00:01:42.930> general<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.659> then

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
do you just go into general and then

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.440 
do you just go into general and then
background<00:01:46.920> app<00:01:47.130> refresh<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.420> can

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
background app refresh and you can

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.710 
background app refresh and you can
decide<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.720> refreshing

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
decide what you want to have refreshing

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.330 
decide what you want to have refreshing
in<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> background<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.899> these<00:01:54.990> things

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
in the background so all of these things

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.709 
in the background so all of these things
keep<00:01:56.340> them<00:01:56.490> off<00:01:56.640> especially<00:01:57.240> Facebook
