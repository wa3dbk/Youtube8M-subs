of the things I love about piping is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.600 
of the things I love about piping is
that<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.630> lot<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:36.989> painting<00:00:37.610> except

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
that it's a lot like painting except

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.400 
that it's a lot like painting except
using<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.090> paintbrush<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.899> paints<00:00:40.379> that

our template on our pastry board and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.670 
our template on our pastry board and
then<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:45.899> gonna<00:00:45.989> put<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> piece<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.530> acetate

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
then we're gonna put a piece of acetate

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.470 
then we're gonna put a piece of acetate
paper<00:00:47.360> right<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.390> top<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> template<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
paper right on top of the template and

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.150 
paper right on top of the template and
this<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:52.020> trace<00:00:52.289> right<00:00:52.890> over

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
this way we can just trace right over

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.319 
this way we can just trace right over
the<00:00:53.250> design<00:00:53.550> which<00:00:53.789> makes<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.149> easy

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the design which makes it really easy

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.770 
the design which makes it really easy
and<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> nice<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.449> don't<00:00:57.539> really

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and this is nice if you you don't really

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.180 
and this is nice if you you don't really
feel<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.620> pipe<00:00:58.920> something

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
feel like you can pipe something

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
feel like you can pipe something
freehand<00:00:59.820> maybe<00:01:00.090> having<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> template<00:01:00.960> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
freehand maybe having a template is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:11.210 
freehand maybe having a template is
gonna<00:01:01.199> make<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> lot<00:01:01.649> easier<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.500> before<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
gonna make it a lot easier so before you

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.250 
gonna make it a lot easier so before you
go<00:01:11.369> ahead<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.640> start<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.420> tip<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.780> dry<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:12.990> on

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
go ahead and start the tip can dry up on

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.410 
go ahead and start the tip can dry up on
you<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> want<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.909> before<00:01:15.299> you

you so what you want to do before you
start<00:01:15.920> piping<00:01:17.150> clear<00:01:18.150> out<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> whole<00:01:18.840> tip

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
start piping clear out the whole tip

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.649 
start piping clear out the whole tip
right<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.740> clonk<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.189> tip<00:01:20.430> tends<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> cool<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
right and clonk that tip tends to cool a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.390 
right and clonk that tip tends to cool a
little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.140> quicker<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.619> write<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.220> whole

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
little bit quicker and write this whole

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.609 
little bit quicker and write this whole
bag<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.600> chocolate<00:01:24.780> still<00:01:25.140> ready<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.380> go

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
bag so the chocolate still ready to go

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
bag so the chocolate still ready to go
you<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.920> want<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.189> clear<00:01:26.430> out<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.790> right

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you just want to clear out that right

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.430 
you just want to clear out that right
okay<00:01:28.759> on<00:01:29.759> another<00:01:30.119> note<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
okay on another note and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.830 
okay on another note and
I<00:01:32.470> have<00:01:32.980> a<00:01:33.010> feeling<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:34.030> might<00:01:34.150> be<00:01:34.210> allergic<00:01:34.630> to

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
I have a feeling it might be allergic to

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.430 
I have a feeling it might be allergic to
bee<00:01:40.050> uh-huh

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
bee uh-huh

00:01:41.440 --> 00:02:06.100 
bee uh-huh
are<00:01:41.980> you<00:01:42.100> allergic<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.490> me

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.010 

and<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:08.250> better<00:02:08.460> when<00:02:08.850> you're<00:02:09.030> piping<00:02:09.810> over

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
and it's better when you're piping over

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.720 
and it's better when you're piping over
a<00:02:10.640> template<00:02:12.110> not<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.350> really<00:02:13.650> try<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:13.920> stay<00:02:14.340> so

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
a template not to really try and stay so

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.310 
a template not to really try and stay so
much<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.270> lines<00:02:17.690> it's<00:02:18.690> better<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.050> do<00:02:19.170> it

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
much in the lines it's better to do it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.690 
much in the lines it's better to do it
just<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.590> little<00:02:19.800> quicker<00:02:20.010> we're<00:02:20.370> gonna<00:02:20.490> have<00:02:20.670> a

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
just a little quicker we're gonna have a

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.380 
just a little quicker we're gonna have a
nicer<00:02:21.060> line<00:02:21.300> if<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:22.320> just<00:02:22.560> kind<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:23.240> do<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.360> a

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
nicer line if you just kind of do it a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.880 
nicer line if you just kind of do it a
little<00:02:24.540> bit<00:02:24.660> more<00:02:24.750> free-flowing<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.590> don't<00:02:25.770> be

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
little bit more free-flowing so don't be

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.560 
little bit more free-flowing so don't be
so<00:02:26.040> concerned<00:02:26.520> with<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:26.940> keeping<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
so concerned with really keeping it and

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.240 
so concerned with really keeping it and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
you know keeping the chocolate inside

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.360 
you know keeping the chocolate inside
the<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:30.450> design<00:02:30.840> there<00:02:31.170> okay

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
the the design there okay

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.680 
the the design there okay
so<00:02:33.030> we'll<00:02:33.210> put<00:02:33.360> these<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.660> refrigerator
