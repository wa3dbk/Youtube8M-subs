now<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.510> stage<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.900> might<00:01:31.260> know<00:01:31.500> whether

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
now at this stage it might know whether

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.080 
now at this stage it might know whether
feels<00:01:31.920> particularly<00:01:32.340> easier<00:01:32.820> where<00:01:32.940> there's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
feels particularly easier where there's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.210 
feels particularly easier where there's
always<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.480> sort<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.110> niggling<00:01:34.950> kind<00:01:35.130> of

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
sense if this is a challenge to get this

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.690 
sense if this is a challenge to get this
right<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.590> I'm<00:01:38.010> on<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.250> own<00:01:38.280> I'm<00:01:38.580> in<00:01:38.670> a

surprised<00:02:13.120> when<00:02:13.360> they<00:02:13.450> said<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.630> was<00:02:13.780> gonna<00:02:13.900> be

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
surprised when they said it was gonna be

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.400 
surprised when they said it was gonna be
pixels<00:02:14.440> rather<00:02:14.620> than<00:02:14.800> plasticine<00:02:16.110> no<00:02:17.110> because

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
pixels rather than plasticine no because

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.510 
pixels rather than plasticine no because
I<00:02:17.500> think<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:18.100> mean<00:02:18.330> aardman<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.450> such<00:02:19.660> a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
I think that you mean aardman is such a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.690 
I think that you mean aardman is such a
wonderful<00:02:21.520> kind<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.820> British<00:02:22.350> legendary

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
wonderful kind of British legendary

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.640 
wonderful kind of British legendary
animated<00:02:24.700> film<00:02:25.570> company<00:02:26.020> that<00:02:26.200> though

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
animated film company that though

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.790 
animated film company that though
they're<00:02:27.100> moving<00:02:28.090> with<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.330> times<00:02:28.570> and<00:02:28.930> this

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
they're moving with the times and this

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.980 
they're moving with the times and this
is<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.340> where<00:02:30.459> we<00:02:30.610> are<00:02:30.640> now<00:02:30.940> or<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.270> 3d<00:02:31.600> and

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
is this is where we are now or in 3d and

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.449 
is this is where we are now or in 3d and
I<00:02:32.170> think<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:32.709> great<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:32.980> they've<00:02:33.280> done

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
I think it's great that they've done

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.699 
I think it's great that they've done
that<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.120> looks<00:02:34.300> amazing<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.230> absolute

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
that and it looks amazing the absolute

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.680 
that and it looks amazing the absolute
depth<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.310> animation<00:02:36.880> is<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.150> so

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
depth of the animation is just so

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.560 
depth of the animation is just so
beautiful<00:02:37.870> because<00:02:38.530> when<00:02:38.680> we<00:02:38.770> started<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.400> it

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
beautiful because when we started on it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.340 
beautiful because when we started on it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.170 
they showed you an image of the
character<00:02:41.860> but<00:02:42.070> when<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.400> start<00:02:42.640> working<00:02:43.060> on

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
character but when you start working on

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.850 
character but when you start working on
it<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.480> go<00:02:43.600> in<00:02:43.780> you're<00:02:44.020> you're<00:02:44.620> sort<00:02:44.739> of

fast-paced<00:03:07.480> as<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.080> sensor<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.800> think

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
fast-paced as the sensor that I think

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.410 
fast-paced as the sensor that I think
Wallace<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.670> Robert<00:03:09.940> are<00:03:10.000> probably<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.300> little

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
Wallace and Robert are probably a little

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.830 
Wallace and Robert are probably a little
bit<00:03:10.570> dizzy

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
bit dizzy

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.240 
bit dizzy
especially<00:03:11.440> those<00:03:11.500> initial<00:03:11.890> seen<00:03:12.070> I<00:03:12.190> think

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
especially those initial seen I think

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.460 
especially those initial seen I think
the<00:03:12.489> roads<00:03:12.670> yeah<00:03:12.940> yeah<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:13.840> like<00:03:13.870> James<00:03:14.170> Bond

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
the roads yeah yeah it's like James Bond

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.020 
the roads yeah yeah it's like James Bond
that<00:03:14.680> first<00:03:14.950> scene<00:03:15.130> isn't<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.580> with<00:03:15.700> like<00:03:15.880> the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
that first scene isn't it with like the

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.759 
that first scene isn't it with like the
music<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.690> all<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.989> action<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:19.470> yeah<00:03:20.470> yeah

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
music and all the action and yeah yeah

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.710 
music and all the action and yeah yeah
but<00:03:21.640> there<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:21.880> notion<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.390> think<00:03:22.570> for

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
but there is that notion I think for

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.479 
but there is that notion I think for
kids<00:03:22.930> today<00:03:23.080> there<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.560> something<00:03:24.400> like

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
kids today there is a something like

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.130 
kids today there is a something like
snow<00:03:24.760> white<00:03:24.910> like<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.269> Brian<00:03:25.600> Eno<00:03:25.840> art

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
snow white like a Brian Eno art

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.440 
snow white like a Brian Eno art
installation<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:27.250> tempo<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.120> movies

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
installation that the tempo of movies

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.150 
installation that the tempo of movies
has<00:03:28.570> increased<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.200> much<00:03:29.410> over<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.739> years<00:03:29.950> I

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
has increased so much over the years I

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.130 
has increased so much over the years I
guess<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.700> videogame<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.570> know<00:03:31.660> generation

guess the videogame you know generation

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.660 
guess the videogame you know generation
would<00:03:32.260> want<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.650> won't<00:03:33.040> need<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.430> sort<00:03:33.610> of

quick-fire slapstick that they can yeah

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.910 
quick-fire slapstick that they can yeah
that's<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.600> world<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:38.290> live<00:03:38.739> in<00:03:38.769> now
