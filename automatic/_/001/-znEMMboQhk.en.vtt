until<00:02:22.570> you<00:02:22.750> get<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:22.989> pretty<00:02:23.410> high<00:02:23.650> number<00:02:24.010> like

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
until you get a pretty high number like

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.580 
until you get a pretty high number like
5<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:25.239> really<00:02:25.540> high<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:25.959> five<00:02:26.320> or<00:02:26.530> six<00:02:26.709> so<00:02:27.700> I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
5 not really high like five or six so I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.170 
5 not really high like five or six so I
have<00:02:29.590> five<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.370> I'm<00:02:30.459> going<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.670> drop<00:02:30.790> one<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.030> my

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
have five so I'm going to drop one of my

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.750 
have five so I'm going to drop one of my
chameleons<00:02:31.690> double<00:02:32.170> click<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.760> start

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
chameleons double click and start

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.340 
chameleons double click and start
duplicating<00:02:33.910> chameleons<00:02:34.750> now<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.110> will<00:02:35.200> go

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
duplicating chameleons now this will go

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.180 
duplicating chameleons now this will go
much<00:02:35.380> faster<00:02:35.769> now<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.340> I'm<00:02:36.430> going<00:02:36.970> by<00:02:37.209> fives

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
much faster now that I'm going by fives

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.479 
much faster now that I'm going by fives
so<00:02:39.190> I'm<00:02:39.250> giving<00:02:39.489> for<00:02:39.819> Scrolls<00:02:40.150> each<00:02:40.390> time<00:02:41.489> now

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
so I'm giving for Scrolls each time now

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.949 
so I'm giving for Scrolls each time now
I<00:02:42.519> should<00:02:43.000> have<00:02:43.120> about<00:02:44.010> 10<00:02:45.010> somewhere<00:02:45.400> around

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
I should have about 10 somewhere around

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:54.960 
I should have about 10 somewhere around
26<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:49.180> I'm<00:02:49.570> gonna<00:02:49.720> pick<00:02:49.989> all<00:02:50.110> these<00:02:50.320> up

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.880 

and<00:02:55.590> then<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.680> can<00:02:56.890> keep<00:02:57.040> going<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.670> same

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
and then I can keep going in the same

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.370 
and then I can keep going in the same
process<00:02:59.890> as<00:02:59.920> duplicating<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:00.940> others<00:03:01.150> just

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
process as duplicating the others just

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.490 
process as duplicating the others just
with<00:03:02.380> more<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:03.030> guess<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.120> don't<00:03:04.270> have<00:03:04.330> 26<00:03:04.810> we

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
with more I guess I don't have 26 we

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.490 
with more I guess I don't have 26 we
have<00:03:05.620> like<00:03:05.800> 18<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:06.550> think<00:03:06.760> that's<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:09.210> so<00:03:10.500> just

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
have like 18 I think that's it so just

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.010 
have like 18 I think that's it so just
keep<00:03:11.680> doing<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:12.670> sooner<00:03:13.510> or<00:03:13.540> later<00:03:13.690> you'll

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
keep doing it and sooner or later you'll

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.980 
keep doing it and sooner or later you'll
get<00:03:14.760> over<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> hundred<00:03:16.180> i<00:03:16.390> would<00:03:16.630> not<00:03:16.780> recommend

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
get over a hundred i would not recommend

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.530 
get over a hundred i would not recommend
going<00:03:17.410> over<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:17.860> hundred<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:19.120> don't<00:03:19.450> know

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
going over a hundred you I don't know

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.270 
going over a hundred you I don't know
why<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.720> need<00:03:20.020> more<00:03:20.170> than<00:03:20.320> 100<00:03:20.740> about<00:03:20.920> one

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
why you need more than 100 about one

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.610 
why you need more than 100 about one
item<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:24.130> just<00:03:24.160> stay<00:03:24.550> under<00:03:24.820> 100<00:03:25.620> this

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
item so you just stay under 100 this

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.040 
item so you just stay under 100 this
glitch<00:03:26.950> still<00:03:27.310> works<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.850> is<00:03:27.970> confirmed<00:03:28.360> i<00:03:28.600> did

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
glitch still works it is confirmed i did

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.800 
glitch still works it is confirmed i did
this<00:03:29.550> this<00:03:30.550> year<00:03:31.180> this<00:03:31.360> month<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:33.330> april<00:03:34.330> april

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
this this year this month so april april

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.590 
this this year this month so april april
two<00:03:35.590> thousand<00:03:35.980> nine<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:38.220> now<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.670> this<00:03:39.880> glitch

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
two thousand nine so now it this glitch

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.080 
two thousand nine so now it this glitch
these<00:03:41.410> duplication<00:03:42.130> they<00:03:42.280> work<00:03:42.490> on<00:03:42.730> most

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
these duplication they work on most

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.330 
these duplication they work on most
items<00:03:43.950> sometimes<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.160> doesn't<00:03:45.490> so<00:03:46.090> you'll<00:03:47.340> go

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
items sometimes it doesn't so you'll go

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.730 
items sometimes it doesn't so you'll go
get<00:03:48.580> us<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.360> shamans<00:03:49.810> staff<00:03:49.990> you<00:03:50.230> can<00:03:50.380> find<00:03:50.620> in

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
get us the shamans staff you can find in

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.890 
get us the shamans staff you can find in
the<00:03:50.910> sewers<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.950> opening<00:03:53.950> level<00:03:54.250> I'll<00:03:55.209> get<00:03:55.780> us

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
the sewers the opening level I'll get us

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.759 
the sewers the opening level I'll get us
a<00:03:56.110> fire<00:03:56.140> actually<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:57.010> think<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:58.030> can<00:03:58.240> find<00:03:58.480> a

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
a fire actually I think you can find a

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.540 
a fire actually I think you can find a
unflawed<00:03:59.769> sapphire<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:03.400> probably

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
unflawed sapphire and this is probably

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.180 
unflawed sapphire and this is probably
the<00:04:03.820> thing<00:04:04.540> worse<00:04:04.720> than<00:04:04.750> look<00:04:05.110> second<00:04:05.800> most

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
the thing worse than look second most

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.270 
the thing worse than look second most
money<00:04:06.459> but<00:04:06.760> it's<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.239> lightest<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:08.160> see<00:04:09.160> you

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
money but it's the lightest and see you

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.710 
money but it's the lightest and see you
can<00:04:09.430> duplicate<00:04:09.580> those<00:04:10.030> by<00:04:10.269> doing<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.570> same

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
can duplicate those by doing the same

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.009 
can duplicate those by doing the same
thing<00:04:10.959> double<00:04:11.290> clicking<00:04:11.470> on<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.920> scrolls<00:04:12.550> and

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
thing double clicking on the scrolls and

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.759 
thing double clicking on the scrolls and
dropping<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.170> you'll<00:04:14.260> get<00:04:14.380> that<00:04:14.560> many

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
dropping and you'll get that many

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.710 
dropping and you'll get that many
sapphires

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.520 

so<00:04:20.239> I'll<00:04:21.239> get<00:04:21.650> some<00:04:22.650> other<00:04:22.800> things<00:04:24.530> paint

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
so I'll get some other things paint

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.770 
so I'll get some other things paint
brushes<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:26.700> can<00:04:26.730> duplicate<00:04:27.090> paint<00:04:27.510> brushes

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
brushes you can duplicate paint brushes

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.230 
brushes you can duplicate paint brushes
they<00:04:28.680> all<00:04:28.830> just<00:04:29.010> spawn<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.430> one<00:04:29.610> big<00:04:29.910> pile

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
they all just spawn in one big pile

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.660 
they all just spawn in one big pile
though<00:04:30.570> floating<00:04:31.080> like<00:04:31.230> paintbrushes<00:04:31.620> do<00:04:33.620> so

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
though floating like paintbrushes do so

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.170 
though floating like paintbrushes do so
let<00:04:35.670> me<00:04:35.760> duplicate<00:04:37.310> paintbrush<00:04:38.310> see<00:04:39.030> they'll

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
let me duplicate paintbrush see they'll

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.450 
let me duplicate paintbrush see they'll
all<00:04:39.300> spawn<00:04:39.600> in<00:04:39.780> one<00:04:39.900> pile<00:04:40.250> there's<00:04:41.250> really

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
all spawn in one pile there's really

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.790 
all spawn in one pile there's really
quite<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:41.910> few<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.180> them

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.830 

that's<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.759> one<00:04:46.030> way<00:04:46.150> to<00:04:46.210> get<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.509> the<00:04:46.629> top<00:04:46.810> of

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
that's a one way to get to the top of

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.219 
that's a one way to get to the top of
the<00:04:47.379> white<00:04:48.190> tower<00:04:48.400> by<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.699> way<00:04:48.879> and<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:50.050> can

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
the white tower by the way and you can

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.909 
the white tower by the way and you can
duplicate<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.889> goblin<00:04:51.550> shaman<00:04:51.759> staff<00:04:52.919> but

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
duplicate the goblin shaman staff but

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.680 
duplicate the goblin shaman staff but
this<00:04:54.069> is<00:04:54.220> really<00:04:54.400> laggy<00:04:54.699> so<00:04:55.120> I<00:04:55.300> would<00:04:55.539> not

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
this is really laggy so I would not

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.129 
this is really laggy so I would not
recommend<00:04:55.840> doing<00:04:56.169> 100<00:04:56.710> or<00:04:57.400> even<00:04:57.460> 50<00:04:58.139> because

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
recommend doing 100 or even 50 because

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.490 
recommend doing 100 or even 50 because
you'd<00:04:59.590> risk<00:04:59.770> lagging<00:05:00.280> out<00:05:00.400> your<00:05:00.550> game<00:05:03.509> so<00:05:04.509> just

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
you'd risk lagging out your game so just

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.320 
you'd risk lagging out your game so just
to<00:05:05.620> prove<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.860> you<00:05:06.220> that<00:05:06.639> it<00:05:06.789> works<00:05:07.000> i'm

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
to prove that you that it works i'm

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330 
to prove that you that it works i'm
shooting<00:05:07.720> around<00:05:07.930> doesn't<00:05:08.889> have<00:05:09.099> that<00:05:09.220> good

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
shooting around doesn't have that good

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.029 
shooting around doesn't have that good
of<00:05:09.400> range<00:05:09.699> so<00:05:09.970> i<00:05:10.000> couldn't<00:05:10.360> hit<00:05:10.479> that<00:05:10.629> lady

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
of range so i couldn't hit that lady

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.960 
of range so i couldn't hit that lady
probably<00:05:12.039> for<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.220> best<00:05:12.430> though<00:05:12.639> i'm<00:05:12.819> only

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
probably for the best though i'm only

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.999 
probably for the best though i'm only
level<00:05:13.180> one<00:05:13.530> guards<00:05:14.530> would<00:05:15.030> not<00:05:16.030> be<00:05:16.180> happy<00:05:17.009> this

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
level one guards would not be happy this

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.520 
level one guards would not be happy this
is<00:05:18.159> just<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.430> prove<00:05:18.550> i'm<00:05:18.759> level<00:05:19.060> one

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
is just to prove i'm level one

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.809 
is just to prove i'm level one
