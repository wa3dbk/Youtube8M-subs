00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.840
 they are the most classic vegetables of the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.900
 Creole are the easiest too 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.000
 cut into slices and I also have the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.570
 content of a can of green beans 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.370
 then we will need to start a 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.020
 egg that I'm going to show you how 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.229
 let's prepare also let's 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 use a little broth some chorritos 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.910
 of olive oil and as for the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.650
 condiments of course salt and pepper 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:52.530
 to taste and here I have scallion parsley 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.930
 rosemary and thyme the first thing we're going to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.720
 do is put a little oil in 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.450
 a pan or in a deep pot and 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.270
 add inside the sofrito is to say the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.710
 onion the garlic and the peppers and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.710
 start to sautÃ© the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.210
 when we see that the onion has 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.830
 begun to become transparent is the moment 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.830
 just to add the tomato 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.130
 we will feed him the topito 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.340
 already begin to be achieved let's add 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.340
 the rest of the vegetables 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.370
 How are you 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.349
 and the fire at medium temperature and add 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.700
 all the broth until the vegetables 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.940
 are well covered 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.950
 Now let's add the seasonings a 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.860
 little bit of parsley I have here 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.060
 dehydrated but it can be fresh a 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.060
 little bit of scallion 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.060
 thyme 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.270
 and rosemary 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.930
 we are going to stir everything very well and now 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.670
 we just have to cover the pan and leave 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.160
 let this be cooked until all the 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.230
 vegetables are fine termites as they are 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.810
 cut little ones will not take long 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.690
 approximately 20 minutes 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.840
 half an hour the vegetables are already 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.980
 lists and this is very easy to check 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.600
 simply with a fork pricking 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.160
 we see that they are already tender and if the 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.050
 carrot that is the hardest one is already 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.300
 tender means that the others 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.340
 it is also and now it is very simple 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.740
 the last step are the steamed eggs 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.840
 let's do in this case I'm going to 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.890
 use two eggs let's do 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.069
 Sorrowful two species of negritos 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.269
 in this way 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.269
 and we are going to add 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.970
 the two eggs 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.080
 and so that they cook, let's go back to 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.220
 cover the pot until they are in the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.470
 consistency that we like 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.500
 and after only two or three minutes 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.890
 as you can see the eggs already 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.200
 the already coagulated egg white and 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.050
 we only have to put out the fire and 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.150
 if we want to transfer the vegetables to 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.150
 another casserole to take to the table and the 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.730
 dish is ready 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.580
 our vegetables to breeding with eggs 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.890
 steamed are ready and here they 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.150
 I show how the finished dish is 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:05:00.210
 It really smells and tastes delicious 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.960
 I recommend them, it 's very nutritious and 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.600
 as you could see very easy to prepare 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.760
