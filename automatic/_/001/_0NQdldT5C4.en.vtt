00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.910 
as you can see I've got some ass already
some<00:02:17.280> hips<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:19.950> really<00:02:20.400> more<00:02:20.670> family

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
some hips and it's really more family

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.059 
some hips and it's really more family
but<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:22.550> know<00:02:22.730> what<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.750> can<00:02:24.080> be<00:02:24.350> better<00:02:24.860> than

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
but you know what it can be better than

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.559 
but you know what it can be better than
this<00:02:25.400> as<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:26.660> told<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:28.190> changed<00:02:28.910> completely

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
this as I told you it changed completely

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.220 
this as I told you it changed completely
it's<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.530> very<00:02:30.830> small<00:02:31.190> hit<00:02:31.550> back<00:02:31.819> so<00:02:32.209> as<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:33.050> can

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
it's a very small hit back so as you can

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.600 
it's a very small hit back so as you can
see<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:34.490> shapes<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.240> earth<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.740> gives<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
see it shapes the earth and it gives the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.760 
see it shapes the earth and it gives the
hips<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:38.150> need<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.660> second<00:02:39.050> one<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> told<00:02:39.560> you

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
hips you need the second one I told you

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.070 
hips you need the second one I told you
is<00:02:39.980> much<00:02:40.850> better<00:02:41.120> because<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:41.840> really

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
is much better because it's really

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.540 
is much better because it's really
bigger<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:44.300> will<00:02:44.570> make<00:02:44.810> even<00:02:45.530> more<00:02:46.070> ground

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
bigger and it will make even more ground

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.229 
bigger and it will make even more ground
so<00:02:47.390> let's<00:02:47.420> try<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.260> as<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:50.540> can<00:02:50.750> see<00:02:51.640> I've<00:02:52.640> got

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
so let's try it as you can see I've got

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.970 
so let's try it as you can see I've got
a<00:02:53.540> real<00:02:54.110> big<00:02:54.620> ass<00:02:54.860> now<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:56.570> hips<00:02:56.870> also<00:02:57.230> change

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
a real big ass now the hips also change

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.699 
a real big ass now the hips also change
it<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.250> lot<00:02:59.350> and<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.120> same<00:03:02.420> design<00:03:03.170> the

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
it a lot and it's the same design the

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.920 
it a lot and it's the same design the
difference<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.820> one<00:03:05.239> is<00:03:05.269> bigger<00:03:05.630> than<00:03:05.780> the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
difference is one is bigger than the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.750 
difference is one is bigger than the
other<00:03:06.820> but<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:08.300> way<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.920> fix<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.519> same

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
other but the way you fix it is the same

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.229 
other but the way you fix it is the same
one<00:03:11.600> heart<00:03:12.320> going<00:03:12.709> back<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.430> other<00:03:13.459> going

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
one heart going back the other going

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.170 
one heart going back the other going
down<00:03:14.540> your<00:03:14.810> legs<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.820> this<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:17.000> already

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
down your legs and this is already

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:25.880 
down your legs and this is already
something<00:03:18.760> really<00:03:19.760> really<00:03:20.060> curves

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.100 

but<00:03:26.890> now<00:03:27.040> let's<00:03:27.310> try<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.640> last<00:03:28.030> one<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.660> the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
but now let's try the last one and the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.400 
but now let's try the last one and the
difference<00:03:29.590> is<00:03:29.770> now<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.910> has<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.599> little<00:03:32.110> bump

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
difference is now this has a little bump

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.140 
difference is now this has a little bump
on<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:33.160> top<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:35.700> that's<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.940> only

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
on the top of it and that's the only

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.970 
on the top of it and that's the only
difference<00:03:37.209> because<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.290> system<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.830> the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
difference because the system is the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.390 
difference because the system is the
same<00:03:39.220> one<00:03:40.000> part<00:03:40.360> going<00:03:40.599> down<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.709> other<00:03:41.739> going

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
same one part going down the other going

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.309 
same one part going down the other going
back<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:43.690> we<00:03:44.349> are<00:03:44.380> going<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.860> get<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.370> part

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
back but we are going to get this part

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.130 
back but we are going to get this part
give<00:03:47.319> it<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.530> little<00:03:47.800> extra<00:03:48.190> shape<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:50.110> let's

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
give it a little extra shape so let's

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.790 
give it a little extra shape so let's
try<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:52.140> this<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.440> what<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.980> looks<00:03:54.250> like

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
try it and this is what it looks like

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.280 
try it and this is what it looks like
it's<00:03:56.800> higher<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.549> curves<00:03:57.910> start<00:03:58.600> really

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
it's higher the curves start really

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.530 
it's higher the curves start really
higher<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:01.630> change<00:04:02.049> that<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.880> shape<00:04:03.880> changes

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
higher you change that the shape changes

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.050 
higher you change that the shape changes
a<00:04:04.630> bit<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:04.989> don't<00:04:05.080> know<00:04:05.230> if<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.440> can<00:04:05.590> see<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.370> but

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
a bit I don't know if you can see it but

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.199 
a bit I don't know if you can see it but
I<00:04:07.090> can<00:04:07.569> that's<00:04:08.049> what<00:04:08.260> does<00:04:08.640> not<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.670> lot<00:04:10.180> of

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
I can that's what does not a lot of

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.690 
I can that's what does not a lot of
difference<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:12.430> at<00:04:13.209> least<00:04:13.630> at<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:14.080> part

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
difference but at least at this part

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:23.900 
difference but at least at this part
it's<00:04:15.700> more<00:04:17.340> curved

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.050 

what<00:04:24.540> I<00:04:24.570> do<00:04:24.720> when<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.200> wear<00:04:25.890> this<00:04:26.310> one<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:26.880> big

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
what I do when I wear this one the big

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.500 
what I do when I wear this one the big
one<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.680> will<00:04:28.680> add<00:04:29.150> two<00:04:30.150> extra<00:04:30.410> foam<00:04:32.090> one<00:04:33.090> here

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
one I will add two extra foam one here

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.550 
one I will add two extra foam one here
and<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.990> other<00:04:34.170> there<00:04:35.450> so<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.720> becomes<00:04:37.110> really

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
and the other there so it becomes really

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.790 
and the other there so it becomes really
round<00:04:38.070> in<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.580> part<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.510> can<00:04:39.800> really

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
round in this part and you can really

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.730 
round in this part and you can really
see<00:04:41.100> it<00:04:41.160> kind<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.360> difference<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:43.260> changed<00:04:43.680> a

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
see it kind of difference it changed a

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.670 
see it kind of difference it changed a
little<00:04:43.890> bit<00:04:44.160> more<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:45.480> curves<00:04:45.870> is<00:04:46.260> really

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
little bit more and the curves is really

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.920 
little bit more and the curves is really
more<00:04:46.860> feminine

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
more feminine

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.010 
more feminine
because<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:49.650> see<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:50.070> think<00:04:50.850> it's<00:04:51.180> too<00:04:51.540> flat

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
because you see I think it's too flat

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.020 
because you see I think it's too flat
it's<00:04:52.889> big<00:04:53.520> but<00:04:54.030> flat<00:04:54.479> so<00:04:55.410> when<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.680> add<00:04:55.949> this<00:04:56.400> it

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
it's big but flat so when I add this it

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.879 
it's big but flat so when I add this it
becomes<00:04:57.419> round<00:04:57.949> so<00:04:58.949> let's<00:04:59.190> do<00:04:59.460> it<00:05:00.229> now<00:05:01.229> now<00:05:01.620> I

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
becomes round so let's do it now now I

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.659 
becomes round so let's do it now now I
bet<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.490> can<00:05:02.669> see<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.000> difference<00:05:03.389> now

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
bet you can see the difference now

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.550 
bet you can see the difference now
everything<00:05:05.669> is<00:05:05.789> really<00:05:06.360> really<00:05:06.630> round

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
everything is really really round

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.450 
everything is really really round
look<00:05:08.430> what<00:05:08.669> two<00:05:09.150> little<00:05:09.780> pieces<00:05:10.220> mommy

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
look what two little pieces mommy
