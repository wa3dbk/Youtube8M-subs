the<00:00:11.880> day<00:00:11.910> using<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.540> different<00:00:12.960> style<00:00:13.259> lighting

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
the day using a different style lighting

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.770 
the day using a different style lighting
so<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.219> know<00:00:14.340> how<00:00:14.580> good<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.150> but

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
so I don't know how good it is but

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.570 
so I don't know how good it is but
usually<00:00:16.049> whenever<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.590> record<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.250> he<00:00:17.340> was<00:00:17.460> in

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
usually whenever I record that he was in

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.220 
usually whenever I record that he was in
my<00:00:17.699> physique<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.240> doesn't<00:00:18.690> look<00:00:18.779> like<00:00:18.900> what<00:00:19.199> it

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
my physique it doesn't look like what it

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.900 
my physique it doesn't look like what it
looks<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.830> real<00:00:19.980> life<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.369> don't<00:00:20.640> know<00:00:20.730> why

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
looks like in real life I don't know why

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.000 
looks like in real life I don't know why
I<00:00:20.970> think<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.689> quality<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> camera<00:00:22.560> but

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I think it's a quality of the camera but

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.130 
I think it's a quality of the camera but
I<00:00:23.580> will<00:00:23.850> be<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.090> hope<00:00:24.449> they<00:00:24.600> get<00:00:24.720> newcomer

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
I will be I hope they get newcomer

I will be I hope they get newcomer
pretty<00:00:25.529> soon<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:26.189> will<00:00:26.369> see<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.000> happens

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
pretty soon we will see if that happens
