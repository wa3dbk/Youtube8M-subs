this<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.620> exhaling<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.700> bread<00:00:48.170> when<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this is exhaling your bread when the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.970 
this is exhaling your bread when the
yeast<00:00:49.559> grows<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.430> gives<00:00:50.700> off<00:00:51.920> carbon<00:00:52.920> dioxide

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
yeast grows it gives off carbon dioxide

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.920 
yeast grows it gives off carbon dioxide
and<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.539> because<00:00:54.660> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and you want to get that out because you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.080 
and you want to get that out because you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
don't want it to taste to me see okay so

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.399 
don't want it to taste to me see okay so
now<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.600> way<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.320> way<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:03.409> just

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
now the way the way I do it I just

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.969 
now the way the way I do it I just
squeeze<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> center<00:01:06.500> if<00:01:07.500> that's<00:01:07.799> going

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
squeeze it in the center if that's going

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.350 
squeeze it in the center if that's going
to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.220> four<00:01:08.490> loaves<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> think<00:01:09.210> that's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to be four loaves do you think that's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.719 
to be four loaves do you think that's
four<00:01:09.630> loaves<00:01:09.979> or<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.430> three

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
four loaves or you think it's three

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.370 
four loaves or you think it's three
lobes<00:01:14.119> sometimes<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.240> make<00:01:15.420> every<00:01:15.990> loaf<00:01:16.200> is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
lobes sometimes they make every loaf is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.740 
lobes sometimes they make every loaf is
about<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> pound<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> half<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.659> think<00:01:18.659> this

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
about a pound and a half I think this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.660 
about a pound and a half I think this
will<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:18.960> better<00:01:19.170> at<00:01:19.380> three<00:01:19.680> loaves<00:01:19.890> okay<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
will be better at three loaves okay so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.050 
will be better at three loaves okay so
I'm<00:01:20.909> gonna<00:01:21.350> I'm<00:01:22.350> gonna<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:23.040> shouldn't<00:01:24.000> have

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
I'm gonna I'm gonna I shouldn't have

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
I'm gonna I'm gonna I shouldn't have
squeezed<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.600> already<00:01:24.900> maybe<00:01:25.200> I'll<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
squeezed it already maybe I'll do the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.429 
squeezed it already maybe I'll do the
four<00:01:25.860> ok<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> squeeze<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> middle

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
four ok so you squeeze it in the middle

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.370 
four ok so you squeeze it in the middle
this<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.000> don't<00:01:30.240> cut<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
lines you know all those straight lines

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.710 
lines you know all those straight lines
you've<00:01:37.680> made<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:39.090> don't<00:01:39.299> want<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.540> cut

through<00:01:39.960> them<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> I'll<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> same<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.110> this

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
through them so I'll do the same on this

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.120 
through them so I'll do the same on this
side<00:01:45.020> now<00:01:46.020> divide<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.920> into<00:01:46.979> two<00:01:47.460> parts<00:01:49.130> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
side now divide this into two parts and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.740 
side now divide this into two parts and
just<00:01:50.430> squeezed<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:52.170> same<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.470> this

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
just squeezed it and the same on this

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.510 
just squeezed it and the same on this
this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.200> buying<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.280> I'm<00:01:56.399> not

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
this is just buying it you know I'm not

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.490 
this is just buying it you know I'm not
being<00:01:56.790> accurate<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.450> remember<00:01:57.899> one<00:01:58.049> person<00:01:58.409> I

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
being accurate I remember one person I

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.770 
being accurate I remember one person I
knew<00:01:58.680> put<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> scale<00:02:00.090> okay<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:00.689> you

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
knew put it on a scale okay so now you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.409 
knew put it on a scale okay so now you
got<00:02:00.899> four<00:02:01.170> loaves
