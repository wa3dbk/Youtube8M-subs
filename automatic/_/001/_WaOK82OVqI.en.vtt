got<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> humbucker<00:01:05.100> pickup<00:01:05.549> with<00:01:05.760> two<00:01:06.000> single

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
got a humbucker pickup with two single

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
got a humbucker pickup with two single
coils<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.159> four

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
coils and as we can see it's got four

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
coils and as we can see it's got four
switches<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> three<00:01:09.930> ones<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> right

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
switches so the three ones on the right

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.609 
switches so the three ones on the right
here<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:11.310> each<00:01:11.820> on/off<00:01:12.570> switches<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.439> all

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
here are each on/off switches for all

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.410 
here are each on/off switches for all
the<00:01:13.950> pickups<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.270> would

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the pickups so this one here would

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030 
the pickups so this one here would
control<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> first<00:01:16.049> single<00:01:16.500> coil<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.950> then

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
control the first single coil and then

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
control the first single coil and then
it<00:01:17.159> goes<00:01:17.310> into<00:01:17.490> order<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
it goes into order then you have a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.359 
it goes into order then you have a
fourth<00:01:18.810> switch<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.560> which<00:01:19.710> basically<00:01:19.890> acts

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
fourth switch here which basically acts

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.760 
fourth switch here which basically acts
as<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> coil<00:01:21.119> top<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> humbucker<00:01:22.470> pickup

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
as a coil top for the humbucker pickup

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.980 
as a coil top for the humbucker pickup
so<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.790> gives<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> whole<00:01:24.450> lot<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
so that just gives you a whole lot of

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.899 
so that just gives you a whole lot of
customization<00:01:25.770> options<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.400> your<00:01:26.520> pickup

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
