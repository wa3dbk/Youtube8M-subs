00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
the reason I didn't is because I didn't

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.870 
the reason I didn't is because I didn't
even<00:02:57.720> know<00:02:57.840> anyone<00:02:58.170> was<00:02:58.319> recording<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.010> I

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
nuclear I was just on a good streak I

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.370 
nuclear I was just on a good streak I
just<00:03:02.910> thought<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.060> myself<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.989> do<00:03:04.049> get<00:03:04.260> this

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
just thought to myself if I do get this

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.509 
just thought to myself if I do get this
a<00:03:04.410> new<00:03:04.560> clean<00:03:04.739> looking<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.069> going<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.280> happen

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
a new clean looking is going to happen

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.130 
a new clean looking is going to happen
because<00:03:06.000> no<00:03:06.330> one's<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.690> ever<00:03:06.840> see<00:03:07.080> it

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
because no one's going to ever see it

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.449 
because no one's going to ever see it
and<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.380> only<00:03:07.530> reason<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.920> are<00:03:08.069> is<00:03:08.280> because

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459
