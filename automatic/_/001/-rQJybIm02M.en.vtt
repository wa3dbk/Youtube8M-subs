00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 yes only the same ones just come 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.140
 gladiolus dahlia lilies they are still in 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.849
 a state of deep rest that is what 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.370
 deepest state of peace most 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.259
 preferred to buy because 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.299
 you this onion 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.369
 you can keep it very long 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.949
 let's see what it consists of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.500
 gladiolus bulbs are a sort of siren 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.990
 By the way, this is collectible gladioli 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.260
 Russian gladioli are very, very 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.269
 good quality need to see all 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.600
 peel the onion 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.480
 it is made from preventative 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
 considerations so suddenly if you 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.920
 find some disease 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.530
 so that it can be healed but we see 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.149
 that the bulb is in excellent condition and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.000
 the most important thing when you buy 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.329
 see Donets in this case Donets 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.719
 net there is no hint that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.109
 this bulb ate thrips when the bulbs county 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.410
 ip100 on the bottom there are such dots sores 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.870
 often happens you bought a bulb she already 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.390
 beginning to grow what do we lower 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 temperature up to 2 degrees and in at such 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.590
 temperature by light we store and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.740
 jostling right up to the landing 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.409
 still a frequent question is it possible onion 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.860
 gladiolus split so what happened 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.159
 2 actually yes if we see in 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.750
 In this case, this bulb has two buds. 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.390
 12 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.409
 that is, if we divide in the middle then 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.890
 we will get 2 flowers but better not 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.740
 do explain why when we share we 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.150
 cut the onion opens the cloth a 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.790
 this is the gate of infection 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.649
 then this can penetrate 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.560
 a disease that will cope very very 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.450
 difficult and again we cut not now 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.020
 cut and about a week before 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.180
 by landing 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.360
 so that the wound has time to drag on 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.939
 if the bulb is flabby then this is gladiolus 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.509
 bad onion must all be solid 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.399
 resilient here when not knocking there now 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.939
 sales and collection gladioli 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.959
 and markets gladiolus or this year 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.569
 there will not be much price tags yet 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.000
 rose and look at what 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.120
 state is now in this 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.400
 case got the beach this is asian terry 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.530
 what condition is he in 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.040
 that is, almost not yet 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.980
 even sprout they are able to deep 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.959
 rest that's what exactly you are so easy 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.970
 save and right up to the landing and 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.879
 dahlias dahlias are now about 70 varieties 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.319
 often the question is here bought 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:46.920
 dahlias they are no such here 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:49.260
 hang on them by the way here he became and how 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.510
 as if they were not really alive 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.530
 they are alive when only they 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.140
 start to grow 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.250
 these tissues are filled with water they 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.349
 become elastic and dahlia 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.569
 wakes up dahlia point rostov 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.379
 several growth points if we 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.830
 look closer 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:12.170
 then here is this sprout where is it from 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:16.409
 it grew here it is a stick she is his one here 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:19.709
 are the most sinuses are growth buds 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.900
 dahlia is very very easy to share 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.310
 their landing time you will have instead 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.150
 one unit of planting material 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.150
 three
