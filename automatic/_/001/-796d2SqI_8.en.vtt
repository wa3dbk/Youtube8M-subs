haven't<00:01:53.579> found<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.270> very<00:01:54.390> effective

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
haven't found that it was very effective

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.780 
haven't found that it was very effective
it<00:01:55.079> works<00:01:55.380> every<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
it works every now and then and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.719 
it works every now and then and
sometimes<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.420> disconnects<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:59.070> wasn't

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
sometimes it disconnects so I wasn't

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.670 
sometimes it disconnects so I wasn't
really<00:01:59.909> thrilled<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.540> now<00:02:01.229> one<00:02:01.439> thing<00:02:01.619> is

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
really thrilled with it now one thing is

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.830 
really thrilled with it now one thing is
on<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> box<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.490> says<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.420> connects

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
on the box it says that this connects

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.870 
on the box it says that this connects
with<00:02:04.049> up<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.350> 3<00:02:04.770> devices<00:02:05.040> now<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> recent

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
with up to 3 devices now with the recent

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.510 
with up to 3 devices now with the recent
firmware<00:02:06.299> change<00:02:06.950> it's<00:02:07.950> actually<00:02:08.250> connected

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
firmware change it's actually connected

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.969 
firmware change it's actually connected
with<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.869> says<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:10.440> connect

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
with this it says it can now connect

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.729 
with this it says it can now connect
to<00:02:11.190> eight<00:02:11.519> devices<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.080> was<00:02:13.230> able<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.470> test

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
to eight devices and I was able to test

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.130 
to eight devices and I was able to test
it<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.040> six<00:02:14.340> devices<00:02:14.700> simultaneously<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it with six devices simultaneously and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.050 
it with six devices simultaneously and
there<00:02:16.680> was<00:02:16.799> absolutely<00:02:17.250> no<00:02:17.489> issue<00:02:17.730> with<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
there was absolutely no issue with the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.509 
there was absolutely no issue with the
quality<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.599> very<00:02:18.989> very<00:02:19.170> good<00:02:19.409> bill<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.430> I'm

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
quality so very very good bill so I'm

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.920 
quality so very very good bill so I'm
just<00:02:20.610> going<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.790> fire<00:02:21.030> up<00:02:21.180> my<00:02:21.299> eye<00:02:21.330> pattern<00:02:21.720> I'm

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
just going to fire up my eye pattern I'm

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.539 
just going to fire up my eye pattern I'm
going<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.110> show<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.290> how<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:23.310> works

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
going to show you how this this works

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.789 
going to show you how this this works
here<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:24.180> comes<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.170> first<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:25.590> let's

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
here it comes with so first of all let's

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.270 
here it comes with so first of all let's
go<00:02:25.950> ahead<00:02:26.159> and<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.489> connect<00:02:27.209> onto<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.660> Wi-Fi

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
go ahead and and connect onto the Wi-Fi

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.900 
go ahead and and connect onto the Wi-Fi
for<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.720> go<00:02:30.720> right<00:02:30.900> there<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.910> basically

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
for this go right there and basically

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.380 
for this go right there and basically
I've<00:02:33.540> got<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.900> as<00:02:34.019> SS<00:02:34.379> media<00:02:35.060> device<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.269> this

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
I've got it as SS media device for this

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.729 
I've got it as SS media device for this
and<00:02:36.599> as<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:37.049> now<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:37.379> starting<00:02:37.620> to

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
and as you can see now it's starting to

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.670 
and as you can see now it's starting to
blink<00:02:38.190> blue<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:40.200> means<00:02:40.409> that<00:02:40.500> it's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
blink blue so that means that it's

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.289 
blink blue so that means that it's
receiving<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> connection<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:41.909> connected

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
receiving a connection so it's connected

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.160 
receiving a connection so it's connected
so<00:02:42.420> we're<00:02:42.569> good<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.840> go

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
so we're good to go

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.030 
so we're good to go
now<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.799> does<00:02:44.010> come<00:02:44.129> with<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.910> Seagate<00:02:46.040> app

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
now it does come with the Seagate app

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.150 
now it does come with the Seagate app
itself<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:48.109> didn't<00:02:49.109> really<00:02:49.349> find<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.769> app<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
itself I didn't really find the app to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.780 
itself I didn't really find the app to
be<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:51.269> great<00:02:51.599> it<00:02:52.230> works<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:52.920> not<00:02:53.040> bad<00:02:53.400> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
be that great it works it's not bad the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.130 
be that great it works it's not bad the
big<00:02:53.970> problem<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:54.420> found<00:02:54.720> with<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.019> app

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
big problem that I found with the app

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.670 
big problem that I found with the app
itself<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.390> lack<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.420> codecs<00:02:58.049> edit<00:02:58.379> that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
itself is the lack of codecs edit that

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.140 
itself is the lack of codecs edit that
is<00:02:58.799> support<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.370> there's<00:02:59.579> only<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.790> few

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
is support so there's only a few

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.349 
is support so there's only a few
different<00:03:01.549> video<00:03:02.549> formats<00:03:02.819> that<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.239> would

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
different video formats that I would

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.890 
different video formats that I would
support<00:03:03.510> now<00:03:04.019> just<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.590> quick<00:03:04.940> note<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.209> connect

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
support now just a quick note to connect

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.420 
support now just a quick note to connect
to<00:03:07.019> Wi-Fi<00:03:07.200> pass-through<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.040> would<00:03:08.160> just<00:03:08.310> go

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
to Wi-Fi pass-through you would just go

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.160 
to Wi-Fi pass-through you would just go
down<00:03:08.609> there<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:08.940> select<00:03:09.329> your<00:03:09.450> Wi-Fi<00:03:09.599> device

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
down there and select your Wi-Fi device

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.140 
down there and select your Wi-Fi device
but<00:03:10.470> every<00:03:10.859> time<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.040> do<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.640> generally<00:03:12.000> end

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
but every time I do this I generally end

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.089 
but every time I do this I generally end
up<00:03:12.269> with<00:03:12.420> some<00:03:12.569> kind<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.870> an<00:03:12.959> error<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.590> never

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
up with some kind of an error so I never

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.710 
up with some kind of an error so I never
really<00:03:14.370> found<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.790> effective<00:03:15.510> feature

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
really found this a effective feature

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.289 
really found this a effective feature
and<00:03:16.530> primarily<00:03:17.099> I<00:03:17.220> use<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.549> on<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:17.760> go<00:03:17.910> anyway

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
and primarily I use it on the go anyway

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.830 
and primarily I use it on the go anyway
so<00:03:18.359> for<00:03:18.720> me<00:03:18.840> having<00:03:19.260> Wi-Fi<00:03:20.000> on<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.150> go<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.690> is

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
so for me having Wi-Fi on the go this is

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.470 
so for me having Wi-Fi on the go this is
a<00:03:21.870> Wi-Fi<00:03:22.410> only<00:03:22.590> iPad<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:23.579> didn't<00:03:24.120> really<00:03:24.299> find

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
a Wi-Fi only iPad I didn't really find

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.099 
a Wi-Fi only iPad I didn't really find
big<00:03:24.690> use<00:03:24.840> out<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:27.180> know<00:03:27.299> you<00:03:27.690> can

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
big use out of it but you know you can

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.900 
big use out of it but you know you can
always<00:03:28.260> connect<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:28.889> and<00:03:29.130> connect<00:03:29.400> back<00:03:29.549> on<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
always connect it and connect back on to

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.180 
always connect it and connect back on to
another<00:03:30.060> Wi-Fi<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.660> not<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.019> big<00:03:31.230> deal<00:03:31.380> but

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
another Wi-Fi it's not a big deal but

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.879 
another Wi-Fi it's not a big deal but
now<00:03:32.370> there's<00:03:32.549> a<00:03:32.609> few<00:03:32.819> different<00:03:32.959> ways<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:34.769> we

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
now there's a few different ways that we

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.069 
now there's a few different ways that we
can<00:03:35.069> find<00:03:35.099> our<00:03:35.549> content<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.419> right<00:03:36.780> now<00:03:36.930> I've

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
can find our content so right now I've

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.780 
can find our content so right now I've
got<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.290> set<00:03:37.560> up<00:03:37.680> for<00:03:37.709> video<00:03:38.130> photos<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.700> music

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
got it set up for video photos and music

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.849 
got it set up for video photos and music
I<00:03:39.209> don't<00:03:39.510> really<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:39.930> any<00:03:40.139> photos<00:03:40.440> or<00:03:40.470> music

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
I don't really have any photos or music

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.530 
I don't really have any photos or music
at<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.130> point<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.639> just<00:03:41.849> primarily<00:03:42.209> videos

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
at this point it's just primarily videos

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.449 
at this point it's just primarily videos
I<00:03:42.750> don't<00:03:43.260> really<00:03:43.560> like<00:03:43.799> this<00:03:43.950> interface

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
I don't really like this interface

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.569 
I don't really like this interface
because<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.480> can<00:03:46.380> see<00:03:46.650> all<00:03:46.829> in<00:03:47.010> stuff<00:03:47.310> but

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
because you can see all in stuff but

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.059 
because you can see all in stuff but
it's<00:03:48.090> not<00:03:48.299> organized<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.049> any<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:49.530> any<00:03:49.739> way<00:03:50.010> so

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
it's not organized in any in any way so

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.680 
it's not organized in any in any way so
it's<00:03:50.340> really<00:03:50.579> confusing<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.299> kind<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.510> hard

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
it's really confusing and kind of hard

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.809 
it's really confusing and kind of hard
to<00:03:51.750> find<00:03:51.930> your<00:03:52.139> content<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:53.220> best<00:03:53.400> way<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:53.639> I

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
to find your content the best way that I

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.400 
to find your content the best way that I
found<00:03:53.879> is<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.359> just<00:03:54.510> go<00:03:54.660> into<00:03:54.810> folder<00:03:55.230> view

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
found is you just go into folder view

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.250 
found is you just go into folder view
here<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.910> then<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.090> click<00:03:57.269> on<00:03:57.480> videos<00:03:57.870> and

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
here and then you click on videos and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.960 
here and then you click on videos and
then<00:03:58.620> now<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:58.859> can<00:03:59.099> basically<00:03:59.280> have<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.700> look

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
then now you can basically have a look

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.050 
then now you can basically have a look
of<00:04:00.230> all<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.290> different<00:04:01.680> types<00:04:01.889> of<00:04:02.160> videos

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
of all the different types of videos

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.369 
of all the different types of videos
that<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.299> have<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:03.660> let's<00:04:03.810> go<00:04:03.930> ahead<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.230> try

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
that you have so let's go ahead and try

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.650 
that you have so let's go ahead and try
something<00:04:04.680> like<00:04:05.069> modern<00:04:05.459> family<00:04:05.879> one<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
something like modern family one of the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.819 
something like modern family one of the
things<00:04:06.840> you'll<00:04:07.019> see<00:04:07.079> is<00:04:07.290> with<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.590> app

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
things you'll see is with this app

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.520 
things you'll see is with this app
itself<00:04:08.359> here's<00:04:09.359> a<00:04:09.449> good<00:04:09.660> example<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.199> it<00:04:10.349> not

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
itself here's a good example of it not

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.860 
itself here's a good example of it not
supporting<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.639> actual<00:04:12.000> video<00:04:12.209> format<00:04:12.660> so

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
supporting the actual video format so

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.020 
supporting the actual video format so
there's<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.560> workaround<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.519> can<00:04:14.699> also<00:04:14.819> go

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
there's a workaround you can also go

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.159 
there's a workaround you can also go
through<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.299> browser<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:15.870> you're<00:04:15.989> going<00:04:16.079> to

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
through the browser but you're going to

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:16.800 
through the browser but you're going to
have

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
have

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.599 
have
similar<00:04:17.109> issues<00:04:17.350> with<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.590> browser<00:04:17.799> now<00:04:18.549> the

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
similar issues with the browser now the

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.310 
similar issues with the browser now the
workaround<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.239> as<00:04:19.359> follows<00:04:19.720> I<00:04:19.840> have<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.109> app

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
workaround is as follows I have this app

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.620 
workaround is as follows I have this app
called<00:04:20.620> ace<00:04:20.859> player<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:22.060> way<00:04:22.180> I<00:04:22.210> connect

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
called ace player so the way I connect

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.940 
called ace player so the way I connect
on<00:04:22.750> towards<00:04:22.990> they<00:04:23.110> go<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.260> media<00:04:23.560> explorer

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
on towards they go to media explorer

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.190 
on towards they go to media explorer
media<00:04:24.520> servers<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.360> finds<00:04:25.720> it<00:04:25.810> right<00:04:26.050> up

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
media servers and it finds it right up

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.310 
media servers and it finds it right up
there<00:04:26.440> just<00:04:27.370> kind<00:04:27.580> of<00:04:27.610> through<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.419> here

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320
