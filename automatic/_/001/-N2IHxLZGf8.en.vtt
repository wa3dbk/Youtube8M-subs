00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello everyone is extinction 7 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.049
 for a little tutorial on minecraft so 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.160
 in this video I will show you 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.830
 how to make an arc so everything 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 just so it's logical enough 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.230
 already you need 3 3 oak planks 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.760
 and three spider threads so already that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.010
 I took four more so for 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.240
 to make a kraft table was a little 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.969
 obliged to do that you ask it 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.610
 so are you placing the three boards 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.610
 fine oak or other trees like 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.480
 these and you put the three girls 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.129
 last like this and I do not understand 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.960
 no ah no she sees and that's right there 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.090
 need sticks 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.280
 I'm stupid what am I saying here 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.579
 so we have to put the sticks as 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.530
 these and the three spider threads 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.899
 like these here and there you get an arc 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.119
 and except that without art you go 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.880
 finally a bow without an arrow you're not going 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.600
 not go far so you need some 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.869
 arrows so for that you have 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.720
 therefore need a stick you need 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.340
 also from a feather called 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.430
 hen have a hen 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.650
 to think that is a plain of chicken and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.409
 a flint 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.409
 it's rather logical that you put the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:41.640
 stick in the middle the flint down the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.799
 flint in water and the feather of hens by 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.630
 where the feather you put it down and that 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.970
 you made four arrows you you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.700
 store to go into your inventory 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.570
 and after you can shoot for example 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.570
 on his cows there 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.270
 no I did not kill I did not touch 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.890
 because I'm a little too far 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.940
 by cons I can perhaps try to 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.410
 touch his cows 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.380
 I touched a class and you 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.500
 can shoot very far with these 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.190
 elections 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.430
 this bow or there I killed one with 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.470
 an arrow is going to be the more you hand it 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.000
 the more you arm your art as we tend 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.500
 the more you will be able to type loudly so 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.220
 now that you know how to do 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.430
 arrows 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.150
 there is no need to show you 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:40.060
 so for example I want to shoot this 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:42.850
 thin cow this is a dish she is 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.190
 fell into the hole she fell down she 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.870
 fell this cow there I killed 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.320
 another way there and I still killed 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.019
 another 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.630
 and with that you can make matches 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.540
 note on for example the zombies or even 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.570
 on the sheep on the matches too 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:10.950
 here a little more difficult I have them 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:10.950
 killed I kill others flat 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.420
 a year ago and not yet killed the 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.209
 crazy 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.670
 a dish and that's it I killed all 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:29.209
 remote cows that's what it's for 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.209
 a bow then has more to more people
