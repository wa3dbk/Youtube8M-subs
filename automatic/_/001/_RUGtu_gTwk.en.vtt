looks<00:02:08.380> like<00:02:08.700> they've<00:02:09.700> kind<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.090> separated

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
looks like they've kind of separated

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.190 
looks like they've kind of separated
these<00:02:10.840> two<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:12.030> looks<00:02:13.030> like<00:02:13.210> front<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.840> rear

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
these two and looks like front and rear

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.040 
these two and looks like front and rear
which<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.160> kind<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.490> cool<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.510> also<00:02:16.750> see

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
which is kind of cool and I also see

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.830 
which is kind of cool and I also see
instructions<00:02:17.560> inside<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.480> kit<00:02:19.690> you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
instructions inside so with the kit you

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.830 
instructions inside so with the kit you
do<00:02:20.020> get<00:02:20.200> carbon<00:02:20.470> fiber<00:02:20.800> shock<00:02:21.130> towers<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.630> get

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
do get carbon fiber shock towers you get

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.380 
do get carbon fiber shock towers you get
the<00:02:23.080> hinge<00:02:23.770> pin<00:02:24.010> holders<00:02:24.400> with<00:02:24.880> all<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
the hinge pin holders with all of the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.100 
the hinge pin holders with all of the
little<00:02:25.600> adjusters<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:26.440> can<00:02:26.560> adjust<00:02:28.110> you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
little adjusters so you can adjust you

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.840 
little adjusters so you can adjust you
know<00:02:29.310> right<00:02:30.310> left<00:02:30.610> or<00:02:31.170> mid<00:02:32.670> aluminum<00:02:33.670> shock

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.470 
know right left or mid aluminum shock
caps<00:02:34.140> also<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.290> aluminum<00:02:35.710> collars<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.640> then

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
caps also the aluminum collars and then

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.860 
caps also the aluminum collars and then
the<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:38.320> shock<00:02:38.700> mounts<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.510> there<00:02:40.660> you're<00:02:40.780> not

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
the the shock mounts so there you're not

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.890 
the the shock mounts so there you're not
using<00:02:41.080> some<00:02:41.410> weird<00:02:41.620> little<00:02:42.160> nut<00:02:43.120> screw

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900

combination setting off of the shock

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.070 
combination setting off of the shock
towers<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:49.240> it<00:02:49.330> does<00:02:49.480> look<00:02:49.630> like<00:02:49.780> there's

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
towers so and it does look like there's

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.380 
towers so and it does look like there's
maybe<00:02:50.470> some<00:02:50.770> instructions<00:02:51.280> inside<00:02:51.640> we'll

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
maybe some instructions inside we'll

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.270 
maybe some instructions inside we'll
have<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.630> take<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> look<00:02:52.959> back<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.920> here's<00:02:54.160> the

have to take a look back and here's the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.550 
have to take a look back and here's the

one<00:03:16.030> thing<00:03:16.209> I've<00:03:16.330> noticed<00:03:16.450> sin<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.930> RC

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
one thing I've noticed sin the RC

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.199 
one thing I've noticed sin the RC
industry<00:03:17.830> is<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.220> lot<00:03:18.610> of<00:03:18.700> times<00:03:18.880> when<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.090> buy

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
industry is a lot of times when you buy

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.050 
industry is a lot of times when you buy
these<00:03:19.350> hop-up<00:03:20.350> parts<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.070> these<00:03:21.250> upgrades

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
these hop-up parts and these upgrades

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.150 
these hop-up parts and these upgrades
they<00:03:22.690> include<00:03:23.110> no<00:03:23.380> instructions<00:03:24.100> whatsoever

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
they include no instructions whatsoever

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.890 
they include no instructions whatsoever
and<00:03:24.910> you're<00:03:25.060> kind<00:03:25.269> of<00:03:25.330> left<00:03:25.480> on<00:03:25.570> your<00:03:25.720> own<00:03:25.780> to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
and you're kind of left on your own to

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.070 
and you're kind of left on your own to
go<00:03:26.380> out<00:03:26.530> there<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:26.980> find<00:03:27.420> how<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.450> install<00:03:28.959> it

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
go out there and find how to install it

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.410 
go out there and find how to install it
correctly<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.920> sometimes<00:03:30.730> it's<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.120> pretty

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
correctly so sometimes it's a pretty

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.330 
correctly so sometimes it's a pretty
common<00:03:31.660> sense<00:03:31.989> but<00:03:32.290> sometimes<00:03:32.890> there<00:03:33.070> is<00:03:33.190> some

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
common sense but sometimes there is some

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.150 
common sense but sometimes there is some
variation<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.320> remember<00:03:35.320> when<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.590> bought<00:03:36.010> my

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
variation so I remember when I bought my

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.990 
variation so I remember when I bought my
first<00:03:36.459> set<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:37.200> upgrade<00:03:38.200> shocks<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:39.790> never

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
first set of upgrade shocks and I never

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000 
first set of upgrade shocks and I never
I<00:03:40.330> never<00:03:40.390> filled<00:03:40.780> oil<00:03:41.019> and<00:03:41.260> shocks<00:03:41.500> before<00:03:41.680> and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
I never filled oil and shocks before and

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.930 
I never filled oil and shocks before and
there<00:03:42.130> was<00:03:42.250> not<00:03:42.400> one<00:03:42.459> drop<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:44.940> instructions

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
there was not one drop of instructions

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.090 
there was not one drop of instructions
included<00:03:46.450> with<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.750> kits<00:03:46.989> so<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.470> had<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:47.980> go

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
included with the kits so I had to go

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.920 
included with the kits so I had to go
online<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.430> kind<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.880> experiment<00:03:49.600> until<00:03:49.750> I

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
online and kind of experiment until I

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.550 
online and kind of experiment until I
got<00:03:50.080> it<00:03:50.230> correct<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.090> for<00:03:52.300> this<00:03:52.560> I

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
got it correct so that is it for this I

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.759 
got it correct so that is it for this I
also<00:03:54.280> picked<00:03:54.610> up<00:03:54.700> one<00:03:54.850> other<00:03:54.970> thing<00:03:55.239> for<00:03:55.510> my

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
also picked up one other thing for my

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.640 
also picked up one other thing for my
low<00:03:56.769> C<00:03:56.980> chassis<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.790> TLR<00:03:58.239> chassis<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:59.080> this

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
droop scrooge's sets in from the top

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.330 
droop scrooge's sets in from the top
there<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.450> gives<00:05:24.630> that<00:05:25.410> grub<00:05:26.070> screw

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340
