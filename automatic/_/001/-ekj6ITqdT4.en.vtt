it something you'd pay $16 for so the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.229 
it something you'd pay $16 for so the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
risks were substantial we're really

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.880 
risks were substantial we're really
putting<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> food<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> test<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.649> Carl's

real it's very pretty
what<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.399> liked<00:00:53.610> about<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:54.090> was<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.480> we

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
what we liked about this was that we

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.180 
what we liked about this was that we
could<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.930> something<00:00:55.199> different<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
could do something different it is a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.650 
could do something different it is a
hidden<00:00:56.399> camera<00:00:56.640> spot<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.300> didn't<00:00:57.480> want<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
hidden camera spot but we didn't want it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479
