literally<00:00:25.410> growing<00:00:25.859> from<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> tree<00:00:28.220> vine

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
literally growing from the tree vine

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.099 
literally growing from the tree vine
just<00:00:29.550> kind<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.820> shut<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.179> into<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.900> territory

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
just kind of shut up into that territory

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.889 
just kind of shut up into that territory
and<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> fruit<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.800> up<00:00:34.950> there<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.059> was

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and and fruit it up there and and was

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
and and fruit it up there and and was
wedged<00:00:37.170> between<00:00:37.530> those<00:00:38.309> two<00:00:38.520> branches<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
wedged between those two branches and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.440 
wedged between those two branches and
then<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.960> dropped<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.620> now<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.920> hanging<00:00:41.450> but

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
then it dropped and now it's hanging but

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.600 
then it dropped and now it's hanging but
settled<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> tank<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> bed<00:00:44.340> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
settled in the tank so in the bed so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.250 
settled in the tank so in the bed so
hopefully<00:00:44.879> it'll<00:00:45.059> it'll<00:00:46.340> do<00:00:47.340> its<00:00:47.489> thing<00:00:48.260> but

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
hopefully it'll it'll do its thing but

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.049 
hopefully it'll it'll do its thing but
obviously<00:00:49.559> we're<00:00:50.340> getting<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.610> lot<00:00:50.789> of

utilizing a bio panic approach which
we've<00:01:04.739> sort<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:08.250> way<00:01:08.400> we're<00:01:08.610> doing<00:01:08.790> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
we've sort of the way we're doing it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.859 
we've sort of the way we're doing it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
can like I even sell the dot designs but

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.219 
can like I even sell the dot designs but
make<00:01:54.729> all<00:01:54.880> these<00:01:55.000> components<00:01:55.570> available<00:01:55.630> with

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
make all these components available with

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.190 
make all these components available with
ends<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:56.890> drains<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.610> everything<00:01:57.970> else<00:01:58.200> so

favorite<00:02:03.220> it's<00:02:03.490> my<00:02:03.640> favorite<00:02:04.030> system<00:02:04.330> in<00:02:04.600> the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
favorite it's my favorite system in the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.090 
favorite it's my favorite system in the
world<00:02:05.289> and<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:07.659> works<00:02:07.840> fabulously<00:02:08.440> though<00:02:08.800> as

tomorrow we'll be showing how to put

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.040 
tomorrow we'll be showing how to put
together<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.680> four<00:02:21.160> unit<00:02:21.610> system<00:02:22.510> let's<00:02:22.840> get

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
together a four unit system let's get

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.750 
together a four unit system let's get
four<00:02:23.260> trough<00:02:23.590> side-by-side<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.430> give<00:02:24.519> us<00:02:24.610> a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
four trough side-by-side to give us a

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.630 
four trough side-by-side to give us a
four<00:02:25.180> by<00:02:25.269> four<00:02:25.300> growth<00:02:25.720> as<00:02:26.040> well<00:02:27.040> as<00:02:27.100> two<00:02:27.459> by

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
four by four growth as well as two by
