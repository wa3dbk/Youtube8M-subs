00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.730
 Hello dear visitors of ours 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.530
 with 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.990
 new world today we are in full swing 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.500
 Arina is a very important topic from my point 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.130
 There was such a view 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.820
 which is called inoculation pruner about 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:29.180
 there are several articles on the Internet and 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.480
 would like to try it today and here 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.420
 as an expert they asked for peter savelich 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.000
 sharkova who does spring 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.430
 a lot of vaccinations try 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.670
 try to tell your opinion inside you 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.010
 also savely very honest at least 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.449
 trial twig first do and then 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.449
 we traveled burned a living plant 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:57.339
 see all technology as described in 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:01.280
 the instructions here are a twig so inserted 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.820
 pass this cut here but you need 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.430
 practice getting hit exactly in the middle 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:13.810
 so that the knife went exactly in the middle of it 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:17.960
 This branch here turned out such a cut 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.700
 so this slice on which we will inoculate 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.450
 cut on the stock we will assume twig 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:33.340
 you need another thickness 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.340
 assume that we will have a graft 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.369
 they themselves make lars only 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.219
 cutting 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.880
 and now you need to do the reverse cut 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:48.840
 we have this here you are shaped 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 and here now should be a cut 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:02:03.149
 which is inserted into it for sure 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:08.000
 prepare no but five years not in 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.000
 back side 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.790
 so here is a cut, let's 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.790
 try to cut 3 kidneys 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:35.400
 reserve components of the kind of 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.820
 matches here turned out good up 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.710
 100% 100% match 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.010
 petrovich rolled very well with thickness 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.590
 but if it will be probably thicker 1 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.930
 twig need somewhere on one side 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:56.350
 cambis hold up to move it but 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.400
 if one of which of any of 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.630
 components stream 6 is better of course 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.840
 do with some one side here u 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.890
 we have three sprig 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.890
 turned out in principle here you see this 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.069
 they took the instrument for the first time 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:22.349
 unpacked it and the first experience can be 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:27.000
 say we have our successful pruner not 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.629
 failed you look at him 3 interchangeable 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.730
 the knife 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:35.819
 here it is an o-neck gives us here 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.230
 This knife is further here in the kit. 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.989
 2 more knives are included which gives 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.870
 v-neck and the so-called omega 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.480
 neckline here here they are 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.849
 shown as a toolchain by developers 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.540
 claim the most durable is considered wood 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:57.209
 Omega neck well and still on 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:01.040
 experimented here it turned out this 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:06.329
 quite strong and smooth connection 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.549
 first experience successful question and so 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.750
 continue our experiment with the usual 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.269
 shears the council decided here 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:19.650
 experimenting on seedlings massages 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:22.919
 I 'll drop the juice of the Chizhov volume 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.520
 any new tool requires to 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:29.130
 they got used to it 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.590
 just this groove on the orange here this 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:37.320
 here are the things he should be just 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:41.389
 everything turned out well this is the one 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.490
 notch in which we have to insert our 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:47.450
 graft 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.450
 now take the stalk 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.790
 I remind that we all do it 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:59.930
 first just unpacked this 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:03.830
 pruner and as stated in the instructions 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:07.220
 It should be suitable for beginners here 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:13.729
 took a little bit pampered with as they say 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:18.110
 they should not all be so 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:21.650
 Here is such a stress now Peter 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:26.240
 savelyich make him chery 3-4 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:31.069
 buds up enough to 2 even if 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:33.800
 live enough to watch the game 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:37.639
 fairly thin twigs and this one 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.509
 pruner them there is no good and neat 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.509
 red 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:45.889
 Here still if by all rules to do 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.699
 Inoculated here still need with garden 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.699
 barb eye 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.440
 Well, then the tag came up thing hang 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.040
 let's see what happens vaccination 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.150
 pruner 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.150
 we have an experiment today with this new 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.150
 tool
