review for my Durango DX two times
I'll<00:00:28.939> probably<00:00:29.539> have<00:00:29.689> a<00:00:29.810> final<00:00:30.289> review<00:00:30.590> later

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
I'll probably have a final review later

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.470 
I'll probably have a final review later
but<00:00:32.210> this<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:32.870> kind<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.320> like<00:00:33.500> my<00:00:33.830> setup<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.519> my

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
but this is kind of like my setup and my

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.930 
but this is kind of like my setup and my
thoughts<00:00:36.129> at<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.370> moment<00:00:38.080> so<00:00:39.080> yeah<00:00:39.940> first

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
thoughts at the moment so yeah first

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.860 
thoughts at the moment so yeah first
with<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.390> body

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
with the body

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.180 
with the body
I<00:00:41.900> have<00:00:42.350> velcro<00:00:42.590> on<00:00:43.010> it<00:00:43.719> but<00:00:44.719> I'm<00:00:45.710> not<00:00:45.770> sure<00:00:46.100> if

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
I have velcro on it but I'm not sure if

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.160 
I have velcro on it but I'm not sure if
I<00:00:46.280> like<00:00:46.309> it<00:00:46.730> is<00:00:46.910> I've<00:00:47.450> kind<00:00:47.719> of<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.899> tight<00:00:48.140> fit

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
I like it is I've kind of a tight fit

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.510 
I like it is I've kind of a tight fit
and<00:00:50.020> as<00:00:51.020> you<00:00:51.530> can<00:00:51.680> see<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:51.980> paint's<00:00:52.280> chipping

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
and as you can see the paint's chipping

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.580 
and as you can see the paint's chipping
off<00:00:52.760> it<00:00:52.940> looks<00:00:53.090> bad<00:00:53.300> but<00:00:53.629> it's<00:00:54.230> kind<00:00:54.440> of<00:00:54.469> a

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
off it looks bad but it's kind of a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.299 
off it looks bad but it's kind of a
tight<00:00:54.800> fit

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
tight fit

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.910 
tight fit
even<00:00:55.699> with<00:00:56.600> my<00:00:56.809> electronics<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.649> way<00:00:57.739> they

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
even with my electronics the way they

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.569 
even with my electronics the way they
are<00:00:58.039> they're<00:00:58.370> not<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.760> big<00:00:59.559> here<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:01.430> can

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
are they're not that big here you can

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.710 
are they're not that big here you can
see<00:01:03.369> they're<00:01:04.369> not<00:01:04.519> that<00:01:04.699> big<00:01:04.910> of<00:01:05.089> electronics

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
see they're not that big of electronics

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.340 
see they're not that big of electronics
so<00:01:06.470> I'm<00:01:07.399> not<00:01:07.610> sure<00:01:07.700> if<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:07.970> like<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.360> body<00:01:08.600> it's

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
so I'm not sure if I like the body it's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.590 
so I'm not sure if I like the body it's
a<00:01:09.470> tight<00:01:09.740> fit<00:01:11.410> one<00:01:12.410> thing<00:01:12.619> I<00:01:12.710> do<00:01:12.770> like<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.399> the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
a tight fit one thing I do like is the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.109 
a tight fit one thing I do like is the
cowl<00:01:14.600> those<00:01:15.409> do<00:01:15.680> work<00:01:15.920> well<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.880> weighing

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
cowl those do work well the weighing

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.060 
cowl those do work well the weighing
this<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.869> J<00:01:21.140> concepts<00:01:21.650> one<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:22.159> had<00:01:23.150> the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
this is a J concepts one I had the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.120 
this is a J concepts one I had the
Durango<00:01:25.070> one<00:01:25.250> which<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.670> it's<00:01:26.390> kind<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:26.659> thin

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
Durango one which is it's kind of thin

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.289 
Durango one which is it's kind of thin
compared<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.220> this<00:01:28.369> one<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:31.700> bent<00:01:32.090> a

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
compared to this one and so it it bent a

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.080 
compared to this one and so it it bent a
lot<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:33.259> kind<00:01:33.439> of<00:01:33.530> rattled<00:01:34.189> when<00:01:34.939> you

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
lot and it kind of rattled when you

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.340 
lot and it kind of rattled when you
drove<00:01:35.770> which<00:01:36.770> was<00:01:36.979> annoying<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:39.200> made

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
drove which was annoying and and it made

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.560 
drove which was annoying and and it made
the<00:01:39.470> paint<00:01:39.710> flake<00:01:39.979> off<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:40.909> one's<00:01:41.119> better

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.999 

one<00:01:44.570> thing<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:44.869> did<00:01:45.079> do<00:01:45.259> I<00:01:46.659> switched<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.079> motor

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
one thing I did do I switched the motor

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.289 
one thing I did do I switched the motor
to<00:01:49.250> an<00:01:49.369> 8.5<00:01:50.530> because<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.130> 13:5<00:01:52.729> was<00:01:53.000> not

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
to an 8.5 because the 13:5 was not

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.990 
to an 8.5 because the 13:5 was not
enough<00:01:53.630> power<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:53.990> mod<00:01:54.369> can't<00:01:55.369> really<00:01:55.549> see<00:01:55.759> it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.709 

this<00:01:59.000> battery<00:01:59.479> is<00:01:59.810> a<00:02:00.820> speak<00:02:01.820> dynamite<00:02:02.299> speed

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
this battery is a speak dynamite speed

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.190 
this battery is a speak dynamite speed

it's<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:05.010> that<00:02:05.190> great<00:02:05.430> element<00:02:06.150> I<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.360> pro

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it's not that great element I have a pro

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:14.330 
it's not that great element I have a pro
Mac<00:02:06.870> shorty<00:02:07.530> coming<00:02:08.039> soon<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.970> tires<00:02:13.340> can't

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
Mac shorty coming soon the tires can't

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.000 
Mac shorty coming soon the tires can't
see<00:02:14.550> him<00:02:14.640> very<00:02:14.760> well

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
see him very well

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.050 
see him very well
there<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.130> go<00:02:17.280> they<00:02:18.209> are<00:02:19.160> gold<00:02:20.160> barcodes

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
there you go they are gold barcodes

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.710 
there you go they are gold barcodes
J<00:02:21.510> concepts<00:02:22.020> barcodes<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.150> they<00:02:24.150> work<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.510> lot

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
J concepts barcodes and they work a lot

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.670 
J concepts barcodes and they work a lot
better<00:02:25.459> than<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:27.060> BK<00:02:27.450> bars<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.900> had<00:02:28.080> before<00:02:28.290> I

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
better than the BK bars I had before I

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.949 
better than the BK bars I had before I
still<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.700> taper<00:02:29.940> pins<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.720> front

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
still have the taper pins in the front

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.260 
still have the taper pins in the front
those<00:02:31.410> work<00:02:31.680> good<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:35.370> BK<00:02:35.760> bars<00:02:36.000> from<00:02:36.239> the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
those work good but the BK bars from the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.320 
those work good but the BK bars from the
back<00:02:36.570> we're<00:02:37.290> not<00:02:37.470> good<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:40.700> on<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.910> suspension

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.990 
and things like kind of a popular thing
with<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.890> Rick<00:03:14.070> mid<00:03:14.400> motor<00:03:15.020> for<00:03:16.020> setup<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:17.000> lot

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
with the Rick mid motor for setup a lot

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.390 
with the Rick mid motor for setup a lot
of<00:03:18.120> guys<00:03:18.270> run<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.780> some<00:03:19.530> guys<00:03:19.710> run<00:03:20.070> even<00:03:20.340> more

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
of guys run that some guys run even more

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.570 
of guys run that some guys run even more
angle<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.180> back<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.830> then<00:03:22.830> some<00:03:23.040> guys<00:03:23.250> run

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
angle in the back and then some guys run

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.690 
angle in the back and then some guys run
less<00:03:24.000> angle<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> front<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.080> like<00:03:25.380> this

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
less angle in the front but I like this

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.780 
less angle in the front but I like this
the<00:03:26.700> way<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:28.160> one<00:03:29.160> thing<00:03:29.370> with<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.640> mid

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
the way it is one thing with the mid

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.690 
the way it is one thing with the mid
motor<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:31.290> if<00:03:31.950> there's<00:03:32.190> not<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.370> lot<00:03:32.580> of

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
motor is that if there's not a lot of

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.150 
motor is that if there's not a lot of
traction<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.480> have<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.720> run<00:03:33.930> full<00:03:34.440> toe<00:03:34.800> so

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
traction you have to run full toe so

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.260 
traction you have to run full toe so
four<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.760> half<00:03:35.790> degrees<00:03:36.860> which<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.970> makes

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
four and a half degrees which that makes

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.210 
four and a half degrees which that makes
it<00:03:39.510> easier<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.410> drive<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.890> have<00:03:40.950> more

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
it easier to drive you have more

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.090 
it easier to drive you have more
traction<00:03:42.140> I<00:03:43.140> do<00:03:44.040> run<00:03:44.690> one<00:03:45.690> degree<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.500> toe<00:03:46.860> in

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
traction I do run one degree of toe in

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.370 
traction I do run one degree of toe in
in<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.580> front<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.840> gives<00:03:48.990> it<00:03:49.200> some

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
in the front that gives it some

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.080 
in the front that gives it some
stability<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:50.220> that's<00:03:50.400> like<00:03:50.610> personal

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
stability but that's like personal

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.080 
stability but that's like personal
preference<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:54.980> what<00:03:55.980> else<00:03:56.130> oh<00:03:56.490> yeah<00:03:56.850> I

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
preference and what else oh yeah I

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.600 
preference and what else oh yeah I
exchanged<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.990> servo<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.620> crappy<00:03:59.340> tracks

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
exchanged the servo that crappy tracks

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.130 
exchanged the servo that crappy tracks
this<00:03:59.820> one<00:04:00.000> died<00:04:01.610> this<00:04:02.610> is<00:04:02.850> a<00:04:02.880> actually<00:04:03.630> very

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
this one died this is a actually very

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.820 
this one died this is a actually very
nice<00:04:04.350> ko<00:04:05.030> ko<00:04:06.030> propo

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
nice ko ko propo

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:14.360 
nice ko ko propo
so<00:04:08.060> whatever<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.240> call<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:10.560> fast<00:04:13.340> okay

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
so whatever you call it it's fast okay

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.750 
so whatever you call it it's fast okay
so<00:04:16.609> yeah<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.790> servo<00:04:18.210> is<00:04:18.739> relatively<00:04:19.739> quick

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.630 

same<00:04:23.760> speed<00:04:24.030> control<00:04:24.420> havoc<00:04:25.170> too<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:25.640> it's

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
same speed control havoc too so it's

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:35.620 
same speed control havoc too so it's
fine<00:04:26.940> for<00:04:27.690> gearing<00:04:29.030> I'm<00:04:30.030> running<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.770> stock

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.980 

stock<00:04:36.630> spur<00:04:37.020> which<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:38.010> believe<00:04:38.250> this<00:04:38.540> 86<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:40.430> a

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
stock spur which I believe this 86 and a

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.630 
stock spur which I believe this 86 and a
25<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.590> believe<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:45.260> 24<00:04:46.310> tooth

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
25 I believe a 24 tooth

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.330 
25 I believe a 24 tooth
and<00:04:49.670> with<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:50.790> 8.5<00:04:51.480> that's<00:04:51.780> pretty<00:04:52.080> good

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
and with the 8.5 that's pretty good

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.820 
and with the 8.5 that's pretty good
it<00:04:53.760> seems<00:04:54.030> about<00:04:54.300> right<00:04:54.360> for<00:04:54.840> a<00:04:55.110> small<00:04:55.470> indoor

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
it seems about right for a small indoor

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:04.460 
it seems about right for a small indoor
track<00:04:58.610> yeah<00:04:59.610> it's<00:05:00.150> just<00:05:00.810> about<00:05:01.080> right<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:03.470> far

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
track yeah it's just about right so far

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.220 
track yeah it's just about right so far
with<00:05:04.650> durability<00:05:05.420> cars<00:05:06.420> been<00:05:06.630> great<00:05:06.960> I

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
with durability cars been great I

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.800 
with durability cars been great I
haven't<00:05:07.560> broken<00:05:07.710> anything<00:05:08.570> except<00:05:09.570> for<00:05:09.600> a

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
haven't broken anything except for a

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.170 
haven't broken anything except for a
stripping<00:05:10.290> out<00:05:10.440> a<00:05:10.740> spur<00:05:11.220> gear<00:05:11.430> but<00:05:11.610> that's<00:05:11.790> my

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
stripping out a spur gear but that's my

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.059 
stripping out a spur gear but that's my
fault<00:05:12.480> that<00:05:13.440> happened

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.839 

I<00:05:16.099> did<00:05:16.909> have<00:05:17.349> one<00:05:18.349> ball<00:05:18.680> cut<00:05:18.949> off<00:05:19.189> off<00:05:19.430> it<00:05:19.729> was

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
I did have one ball cut off off it was

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.600 
I did have one ball cut off off it was
that<00:05:20.089> one<00:05:20.300> but<00:05:21.139> I<00:05:21.319> replaced<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:22.039> and<00:05:22.249> I<00:05:22.309> haven't

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
that one but I replaced it and I haven't

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.909 
that one but I replaced it and I haven't
had<00:05:22.699> any<00:05:22.939> other<00:05:23.210> issues<00:05:24.039> so<00:05:25.629> yeah<00:05:26.629> what<00:05:27.589> I<00:05:27.619> did

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
had any other issues so yeah what I did

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.040 
had any other issues so yeah what I did
i<00:05:28.129> boiled<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.849> ball<00:05:29.029> cups<00:05:29.330> when<00:05:29.599> I<00:05:29.629> got<00:05:29.839> him<00:05:29.990> I

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
i boiled the ball cups when I got him I

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.350 
i boiled the ball cups when I got him I
took<00:05:30.259> the<00:05:30.379> whole<00:05:30.469> part<00:05:30.770> street<00:05:31.129> I<00:05:31.369> threw<00:05:32.240> him

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
took the whole part street I threw him

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.249 
took the whole part street I threw him
in<00:05:32.479> a<00:05:32.569> pot<00:05:32.990> of<00:05:33.020> boiling<00:05:33.139> water<00:05:33.529> and<00:05:34.180> it<00:05:35.259> pretty

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
in a pot of boiling water and it pretty

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.629 
in a pot of boiling water and it pretty
much<00:05:36.849> makes<00:05:37.849> them<00:05:38.149> softer<00:05:38.749> so<00:05:39.259> they<00:05:40.249> won't<00:05:40.430> pop

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
much makes them softer so they won't pop

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.230 
much makes them softer so they won't pop
off<00:05:40.909> as<00:05:41.270> easy<00:05:41.539> I<00:05:41.689> guess<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.849> have<00:05:43.849> not<00:05:44.059> any

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
off as easy I guess I have not any

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.689 
off as easy I guess I have not any
issues<00:05:44.719> like<00:05:45.349> some<00:05:45.619> people<00:05:45.949> first<00:05:46.159> have

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
issues like some people first have

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.730 
issues like some people first have
issues<00:05:47.119> but<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.389> don't<00:05:48.189> I<00:05:50.169> just<00:05:51.169> rebuilt<00:05:51.409> the

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
issues but I don't I just rebuilt the

00:05:51.740 --> 00:06:02.649 
issues but I don't I just rebuilt the
shocks<00:05:54.249> 35<00:05:55.249> weight<00:05:56.319> with<00:05:57.319> I<00:05:58.089> believe<00:06:01.180> 1.2<00:06:02.180> s<00:06:02.240> in

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
shocks 35 weight with I believe 1.2 s in

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.709 
shocks 35 weight with I believe 1.2 s in
the<00:06:02.779> front<00:06:03.020> 1.3<00:06:03.860> is<00:06:03.919> in<00:06:04.099> the<00:06:04.189> back<00:06:04.370> I<00:06:04.699> might<00:06:05.539> be

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719 
the front 1.3 is in the back I might be

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.820 
the front 1.3 is in the back I might be
wrong<00:06:05.870> I<00:06:06.080> can't<00:06:06.289> remember<00:06:07.959> one<00:06:08.959> thing<00:06:09.139> I<00:06:09.409> found

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
wrong I can't remember one thing I found

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.689 
wrong I can't remember one thing I found
the<00:06:10.009> helps<00:06:10.279> is<00:06:10.490> more<00:06:11.149> rebound<00:06:11.689> in<00:06:12.020> the<00:06:12.080> back

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
the helps is more rebound in the back

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.389
