microsoft<00:00:00.900> has<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.439> new<00:00:01.620> research<00:00:02.040> project

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
microsoft has a new research project

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.519 
microsoft has a new research project
called<00:00:02.790> room<00:00:03.149> alive<00:00:03.480> which<00:00:03.840> looks<00:00:04.140> like<00:00:04.230> it

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
called room alive which looks like it

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.200 
called room alive which looks like it
could<00:00:04.770> turn<00:00:04.920> your<00:00:05.160> room<00:00:05.310> into<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.700> holodeck

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
could turn your room into a holodeck

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.849 
could turn your room into a holodeck
let's<00:00:06.540> take<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.930> quick<00:00:07.170> look<00:00:07.200> at<00:00:07.589> what<00:00:07.830> that

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
let's take a quick look at what that

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.080 
let's take a quick look at what that
might<00:00:08.160> be<00:00:08.220> like<00:00:09.889> room<00:00:10.889> alive<00:00:11.160> uses<00:00:11.490> projectors

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
might be like room alive uses projectors

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.030 
might be like room alive uses projectors

auto calibrating and can self localize
within<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> room<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.360> six<00:00:57.600> program

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
within the room so we have six program

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.180 
within the room so we have six program
units<00:00:58.440> around<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> room<00:00:58.890> which<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
units around the room which is

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
units around the room which is
essentially<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> kinect<00:00:59.969> sensor<00:01:00.149> along<00:01:01.020> with

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
essentially a kinect sensor along with

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.189 
essentially a kinect sensor along with
the<00:01:01.379> projector<00:01:01.590> which<00:01:02.550> makes<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.359> room<00:01:03.870> if

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the projector which makes your room if

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.170 
the projector which makes your room if
it's<00:01:04.379> very<00:01:04.619> blank<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.129> empty<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.880> room

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it's very blank and empty like that room

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's very blank and empty like that room
maybe<00:01:07.280> into<00:01:08.280> your<00:01:08.460> own<00:01:08.610> gaming<00:01:08.909> environment

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
maybe into your own gaming environment

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.050 
maybe into your own gaming environment
yeah<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.590> neat<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.400> uh<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.880> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
yeah it's really neat this is uh this is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.030 
yeah it's really neat this is uh this is
pretty<00:01:12.240> cool<00:01:12.450> tech<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:13.080> originally<00:01:13.710> saw<00:01:13.890> this

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
pretty cool tech we originally saw this

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.649 
pretty cool tech we originally saw this
a<00:01:14.100> couple<00:01:14.340> years<00:01:14.490> ago<00:01:14.700> at<00:01:14.970> CES<00:01:15.450> says

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
a couple years ago at CES says

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.810 
a couple years ago at CES says
illumiroom<00:01:16.259> Microsoft<00:01:17.130> had<00:01:17.310> announced<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
illumiroom Microsoft had announced it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.399 
illumiroom Microsoft had announced it
and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.119> there's<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.600> lot<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> things<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.229> see

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and then there's a lot of things we see

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.679 
and then there's a lot of things we see
at<00:01:19.500> CES<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.220> don't<00:01:20.460> actually<00:01:20.729> come<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
at CES that don't actually come to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.120 
at CES that don't actually come to
fruition<00:01:21.869> later<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.040> right

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
fruition later and this one is right

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.380 
fruition later and this one is right
there<00:01:23.280> yet<00:01:23.460> either<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.820> still<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> research

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
there yet either it's still a research

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.840 
there yet either it's still a research
project<00:01:24.630> yeah<00:01:25.080> still<00:01:25.439> conceptual<00:01:26.189> still<00:01:26.580> kind

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
project yeah still conceptual still kind

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.490 
project yeah still conceptual still kind
of<00:01:26.939> like<00:01:27.180> hey<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
of like hey we know we have this a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.230 
of like hey we know we have this a
couple<00:01:28.799> years<00:01:28.920> ago<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.610> sort<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> fell<00:01:30.090> off

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
couple years ago and it sort of fell off

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.120 
couple years ago and it sort of fell off
the<00:01:30.390> map<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.810> now<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.380> we're<00:01:31.740> doing<00:01:32.040> this

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the map and now it's we're doing this

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
the map and now it's we're doing this
new<00:01:32.310> cool<00:01:32.579> thing<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.150> then<00:01:33.270> maybe<00:01:33.570> it'll

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
new cool thing and then maybe it'll

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.319 
new cool thing and then maybe it'll
become<00:01:33.930> something<00:01:34.290> else<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:35.640> don't<00:01:36.000> think

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
become something else I don't think

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.200 
become something else I don't think
we'll<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:37.100> this<00:01:38.100> come<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> commercial<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.060> mean

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
we'll see this come to commercial I mean

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.760 
we'll see this come to commercial I mean
this<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.360> obviously<00:01:39.479> very<00:01:39.869> expensive<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this is obviously very expensive you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.639 
this is obviously very expensive you
have<00:01:40.860> six<00:01:41.159> connects<00:01:41.579> six<00:01:42.180> projectors<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.170> six

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
have six connects six projectors and six

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
computers inside these procam units to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.620

cover<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.979> room<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.520> didn't<00:01:47.820> even<00:01:47.909> look<00:01:48.090> you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
cover one room that didn't even look you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.880 
cover one room that didn't even look you
know<00:01:48.750> super<00:01:49.229> large<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> i<00:01:50.729> I'm<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.390> sure<00:01:51.890> I'm

not sure how feasible this would be you
know<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.290> consumers<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.610> not

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
know for consumers but really it's not

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
that Microsoft Research is sort of like

that Microsoft Research is sort of like
hey<00:02:01.590> look<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.189> do<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.810> and

be smart smaller or larger rooms i know
it<00:03:12.530> said<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.829> was<00:03:13.040> auto<00:03:13.370> calibrating<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.390> auto

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
it said it was auto calibrating and auto

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.080 
it said it was auto calibrating and auto
it<00:03:15.829> can<00:03:16.069> track<00:03:16.280> where<00:03:16.459> you<00:03:16.609> are<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:16.940> they're

working together all of these sensors

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.770 
working together all of these sensors
but<00:03:19.519> i<00:03:19.579> don't<00:03:19.849> know<00:03:19.940> how<00:03:20.030> well<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.540> would

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
but i don't know how well that would

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.559 
but i don't know how well that would
work<00:03:20.959> in<00:03:21.169> a<00:03:21.260> room<00:03:21.470> that's<00:03:21.650> not<00:03:22.569> particularly

up to whatever standard that room had

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.470 
up to whatever standard that room had
but<00:03:26.569> on<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.200> other<00:03:27.440> side<00:03:28.040> when<00:03:28.669> we<00:03:28.849> put<00:03:29.180> on<00:03:29.299> a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
but on the other side when we put on a

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.870 
but on the other side when we put on a
VR<00:03:29.870> headset<00:03:30.040> we<00:03:31.040> can<00:03:31.190> only<00:03:31.250> wear<00:03:31.459> them<00:03:31.519> for<00:03:31.700> a

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
VR headset we can only wear them for a

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.990 
VR headset we can only wear them for a

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
certain amount of time due to how close

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.390 
certain amount of time due to how close
it<00:03:35.209> is<00:03:35.239> localized<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.840> our<00:03:36.019> eyes<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.709> also<00:03:37.010> the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
it is localized to our eyes and also the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.240 
it is localized to our eyes and also the
weight<00:03:37.609> so<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:39.319> could<00:03:39.500> possibly<00:03:39.709> be<00:03:39.980> better

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
weight so this could possibly be better

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.210 
weight so this could possibly be better
it<00:03:40.519> reminded<00:03:40.849> me<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:41.000> lot<00:03:41.239> of<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:42.590> gaming<00:03:43.040> scene

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
it reminded me a lot of the gaming scene

at the x-men boo I was in it and I was

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.210 
at the x-men boo I was in it and I was
not<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.900> fan<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.440> be<00:04:07.560> honest<00:04:07.769> okay<00:04:07.920> you're<00:04:08.069> not<00:04:08.099> a

not a fan to be honest okay you're not a
family<00:04:08.519> well<00:04:08.610> what<00:04:08.730> I'm<00:04:08.819> saying<00:04:08.849> is<00:04:09.150> maybe

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
family well what I'm saying is maybe

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.800 
family well what I'm saying is maybe
something<00:04:10.500> like<00:04:10.739> this<00:04:11.069> would<00:04:11.519> be<00:04:11.700> used<00:04:12.000> by<00:04:12.450> a

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
something like this would be used by a

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.069 
something like this would be used by a
studio<00:04:13.409> or<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.920> gaming<00:04:14.670> company<00:04:14.849> but<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.959> know

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
studio or a gaming company but you know

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.500 
studio or a gaming company but you know
something<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.949> sort<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.220> promote<00:04:17.729> something

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
something to sort of promote something

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.060 
something to sort of promote something
so<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.109> way<00:04:19.199> you<00:04:19.260> could<00:04:19.440> go<00:04:19.620> in<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.010> have

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
so that way you could go in and have

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.520 
so that way you could go in and have
this<00:04:20.250> kind<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.489> immersive<00:04:20.970> experience<00:04:21.570> but<00:04:22.380> it

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
this kind of immersive experience but it

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.860 
this kind of immersive experience but it
would<00:04:22.680> never<00:04:22.889> actually<00:04:23.160> come<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.940> consumers

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
would never actually come to consumers

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.270 
would never actually come to consumers
in<00:04:24.900> general<00:04:25.440> like<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.650> wouldn't<00:04:25.830> be<00:04:25.889> for<00:04:26.010> mass

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
in general like it wouldn't be for mass

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.100 
in general like it wouldn't be for mass
consumption<00:04:26.760> would<00:04:26.940> be<00:04:27.060> more<00:04:27.240> for<00:04:27.419> these<00:04:27.780> kind

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
consumption would be more for these kind

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.890 
consumption would be more for these kind
of<00:04:28.169> like<00:04:28.830> perhaps<00:04:29.160> maybe<00:04:29.310> for<00:04:29.610> Marvel's<00:04:30.030> their

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
of like perhaps maybe for Marvel's their

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.360 
of like perhaps maybe for Marvel's their
new<00:04:31.080> tour<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.560> they're<00:04:31.680> having<00:04:31.800> more<00:04:32.250> they

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
new tour that they're having more they

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.460 
new tour that they're having more they
it's<00:04:32.520> like<00:04:32.729> a<00:04:32.910> marble<00:04:33.479> carnival<00:04:34.080> sort<00:04:34.350> of

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
it's like a marble carnival sort of

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.620 
it's like a marble carnival sort of
right<00:04:34.830> or<00:04:35.040> like<00:04:35.190> like<00:04:35.699> oh<00:04:35.880> let's<00:04:36.120> go<00:04:36.360> look<00:04:36.510> at

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
right or like like oh let's go look at

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.779 
right or like like oh let's go look at
Tony<00:04:36.840> Stark's<00:04:37.289> workroom<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.520> walk

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
Tony Stark's workroom and and you walk

Tony Stark's workroom and and you walk
into<00:04:39.030> this<00:04:39.210> room<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.660> it's<00:04:39.840> it's<00:04:40.289> room<00:04:40.830> alive

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
and so this technology sort of

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.810 
and so this technology sort of
incorporated<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:44.100> way<00:04:44.310> have<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.580> ever<00:04:44.669> been

oh<00:05:22.440> my<00:05:22.889> word<00:05:23.160> so<00:05:23.729> what<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:24.120> do<00:05:24.180> remember<00:05:24.419> that

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
oh my word so what I do remember that

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.930 
oh my word so what I do remember that
where<00:05:25.139> did<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.349> go<00:05:25.590> exactly<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:26.639> I<00:05:26.700> think

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
where did that go exactly and I think

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.240 
where did that go exactly and I think
this<00:05:27.090> is<00:05:27.270> sort<00:05:27.510> of<00:05:27.570> a<00:05:27.720> very<00:05:27.930> similar<00:05:28.349> thing<00:05:28.560> in

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
this is sort of a very similar thing in

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.000 
this is sort of a very similar thing in
that<00:05:29.419> we<00:05:30.419> might<00:05:30.720> see<00:05:30.990> it<00:05:31.110> incorporate<00:05:31.860> into

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
that we might see it incorporate into

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.010 
that we might see it incorporate into
businesses<00:05:32.760> in<00:05:32.940> some<00:05:33.120> way<00:05:33.240> but<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:33.720> as<00:05:33.900> a
