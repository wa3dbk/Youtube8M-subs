00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.130
 hi everyone I'm a swing target 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.530
 salty and in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.599
 how arequipe is made, which is the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.730
 name that we give in colombia al dulce 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.279
 of milk and to make it a lot of people 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.510
 uses a can of condensed milk 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.789
 but in this video we're going to do it 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.619
 from scratch because the recipe is super 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.560
 easy to do and in my opinion has 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.990
 better flavor and as always the link of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.420
 the complete recipe will be found at 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.090
 end of the video 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.830
 first let's put whole milk in 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.510
 a large pot 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.510
 and we add white sugar 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.339
 stir well and let it boil 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.339
 mid fire 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.270
 when the milk is boiling and the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:02.060
 sugar has dissolved we are going to 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:04.730
 add vanilla extract and 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:15.170
 baking soda this is what you 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:18.260
 will give the coffee color to the milk then 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.540
 let's reduce the heat down and let's 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.280
 cook it uncovered for an hour and a half 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.560
 to two hours, make sure you take the 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.810
 foam that is formed above and from 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.960
 stir this up occasionally 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:38.960
 about two hours at the end we ended up with 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:42.220
 a thick, brown consistency and then 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.220
 we went through a colander 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.890
 and we store it in an airtight container in 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.600
 the refrigerator for a month or so and 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.920
 that is the recipe to make 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.079
