 Before, love, and I wanted to know one. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.160
 a bit of the voice's success as 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.160

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.410

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.840
 used to be part of my life 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.329
 music but now it 's not me who is 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.629
 focus I need to share the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.700
 my experiences my feelings 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.590
 with someone else so that it shines is 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.479
 very easy to do things for my 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.150
 first scenario for my show 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.689
 happen but to do to the other has a 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.720
 Special taste because it makes you someone 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.189
 better also is pure altruism so it is 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.640
 very good very and knowing that success 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.790
 fashion reference wardrobe where comes the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.619
 All the inspiration of the music when I go 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.840
 build my costume I think of what 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.390
 I'll play there on stage because I'm going 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.579
 making that stage that the movement is 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.030
 need to have to feel well at ease 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.799
 singing and there's been there for a while 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.350
 the story begins to be built as 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.090
 is the wardrobe of claudia leitte who 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.970
 Do you have what you have on the board? 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.820
 That's no big deal, I love it. 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.040
 jeans shoe I love a shoe 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.810
 shoe I like bullet only 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.180
 flashes they do not want them to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.340
 to attack my children high in school 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.250
 I ride a bike so sneakers are 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.110
 always good but tall shoe is mine 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.870
 passion 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.300
 since always said you can use all 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.300
 temporal day but his papacy 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.050
 you arrive and coast when I thought 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.000
 shoe is crazy business I love 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.250
 shoe and very loud know those heels 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.090
 well extravagant so almost a 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:49.459
 transvestite 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:52.160
 if you want you can cast and you are 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.280
 always uses brightness and you get a 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.400
 elegance match the brightness together with 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.160
 pedrarias as you, as well as 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.500
 You do to create this look without 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.570
 mix up to be confused because you 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.730
 can pass this elegance and become a 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.670
 incredible look and nothing 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.200
 I think everything has a lot to do with 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.350
 people's personality 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.200
 of course there are things that are trend 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.720
 that we see on the catwalk that people 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.150
 comes from a magazine and that people know 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.010
 somehow they can be part of our 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.230
 costumes from our wardrobe on the day 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.480
 day I like different I do not like 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.430
 Obvious things do not like to use what 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.480
 everybody uses to do what everyone else 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.510
 does 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.890
 starting from this principle according to 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.299
 With my personality I'm going to use it 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.299
 much of each is individual 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.430
 the carnival is coming what has to 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.170
 news out there 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.840
 so I'm going to make a collective now in 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.050
 end of the month to announce more things 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.470

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.640
 people launched in the past in the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.880

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.680

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.240

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.550
 everybody sees and sensuality has 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.040
 much relationship with a naturalness 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.600
 no use pushing it does not like 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.280
 red lipstick does not boot red lipstick 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.350
 Just because the blog girl is bouncing.
