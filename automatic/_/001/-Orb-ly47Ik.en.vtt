00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.380
 no no 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.950
 to my mind 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.400
 the ghosts exist I always have them 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.840
 seen ghosts I had never imagined 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.840
 I wrote about that 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.650
 They are pretty good really seriously 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.660
 you'll see where I come from the ghosts 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.760
 they are taken lightly I understand your 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.580
 fascination with the arts 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.870
 happy this is my sister but you must 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:50.460
 be careful I feel like there is a 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.460
 link between your heart and mine 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.700
 how do you maintain this house is a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.660
 privilege to have been born in it is not 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.660
 you can give it up 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.750
 I could have a copy of the keys there 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.380
 you need them there are areas of the house that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.380
 they are not safe 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.860
 in these rotten modules 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.420
 in the dark 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.420
 many secrets are cut 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.409
 tomÃ¡s 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.369
 the dead someone in this house 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.369
 and also the signal 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.579
 he had a violent death in particular 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.180
 a rate as old as this with the 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.180
 time comes alive 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.840
 start clinging to things 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.729
 some are good others are bad and there are 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.360
 others of which should not go back to 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.360
 talk to each other 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.260
 what happens what do you want
