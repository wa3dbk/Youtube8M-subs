00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 i 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.330
 and this is all is mister android in this 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.010
 video I bring you one of the best 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.889
 games for android may i have a 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.840
 mechanical a bit simple that all the 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.880
 world will know is a kind of 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.160
 variant to the typical tetris game 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.890
 which include mechanical as physical 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.890
 three of ice and many more things that 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.750
 I'm going to teach good the game is called 99 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.180
 prix and as always online the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.570
 description if you can not find it 29 brick 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.010
 easy to find and well then I will 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.660
 teach a little the mechanics I have 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.410
 advanced enough in game that has 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.210
 liked a lot and to advance phase the 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.560
 black we have to go doing and go 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.620
 getting the challenges that we 're going 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.860
 marking and well let's lower it a little 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.860
 voice 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.000
 and let's go to the hardest one that I have has 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.360
 unlocked so far my record 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.320
 here are almost 900 meters is quite 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.030
 all right 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.650
 the game consists basically as I have 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.440
 said before new variant of the workshop and 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.390
 we are putting pieces and you have to put them 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.870
 pretty good because if you do not 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.170
 will quickly destabilize the pyramid 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.840
 and it will cost us a lot to move more than 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.790
 height to see for example the challenges 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.310
 that we have now build 4,000 meters 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.930
 by altering two bricks with a magic and 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.780
 achieve level 5 of the tasks good 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.650
 levels for example there is that list of 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.590
 rhombus there then 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.190
 those are the levels when the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.960
 we reach we will overcome the level and so 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.790
 up to 5 to get the radio like this 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.810
 unblock in the next phase 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.870
 this here moment and good here are the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.360
 magic that does not give us that 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.700
 randomly we are going to put it by 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.399
 example 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.219
 those to give us more gold that is not 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.409
 bad good there are better and sincerely 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.689
 I highly recommend this game we have already 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.090
 reached level 1 and what we have 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.179
 fact solidifies which is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.739
 pretty and good basically this would be 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.000
 the game there are also some good rivals 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.400
 here these things you have to take those that 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.810
 there are other magics there are u and if in the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.280
 vine 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.989
 these are the enemies that are going 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.480
 making it difficult 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.510
 the rise of the east tower in 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.280
 particular this character will make some 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.080
 invisible blocks others will do the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.080
 giant blocks others look 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.240
 before 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.190
 and another 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.040
 you have to think well where to put it and such 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.930
 and well there are also others that make 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.370
 others that convert faster 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.099
 the bricks in ice 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.750
 and little more and good the magic that we have 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.080
 here 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.210
 let's click on it to show you the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.360
 woman is this memory that makes 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.760
 shit I was jumping on that 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.510
 of making the giant pieces is very 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.020
 funny the gentleman 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.830
 'do not put it here 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.060
 [Music] 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.060
 with this here 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.730
 and I'm here and well I think that 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.520
 basically he has explained everything that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.080
 would be the mainstream brics os what 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.680
 I recommend everyone who likes the 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.540
 arcade games and think a little bit and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.519
 let's finish this tower a bit 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.519
 let's speed this up a bit 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.690
 We anticipate a little video we will 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.140
 make it as narrow as possible 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.140
 already lost 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:52.490
 so well I said I 'm not bad 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.690
 but not so much I say the 600 meters to 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.970
 final is not in a picture we can 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.730
 share it on social networks or 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.250
 Take a picture and save it on your mobile 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.930
 so good basically from the game 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.580
 I wanted to teach the many risks what 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.769
 come down and if you want to spend a little bit of time 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.870
 playing then the truth that is quite 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.580
 ok so you already know in the description 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.980
 is like if you liked the 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.360
 video and visit my lists of 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.470
 playback if you want more videos like 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.840
 this one follow me on social networks 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.549
 facebook and twitter and this has been all 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.549
 androids until the next video
