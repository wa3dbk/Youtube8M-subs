00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.010
 and a sea of ​​positive ribs butts viewers 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.440
 my channel with you again arsena 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.049
 video I would like to tell you 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.930
 new refinement of my default and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.470
 resource pack in this version it will 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.000
 called black pack principle resurspak 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 You are from the first version 0 of 2 a strong review 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.230
 the resource pack is basically quite pretty 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.800
 liked you scored my active 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.550
 serial lot of likes. 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.550
 I decided to make a similar resource pack 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.309
 just modify it to make the principle of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.530
 decided it worked it thought but how are you 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.300
 I thought not to make a minimum form 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.680
 for yourself so now you will see right away 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:59.460
 on eat on your likes well, okay principle 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:03.409
 start with the balls how do you save anything 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.070
 as a resource from the past while they are in principle 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.900
 is critical 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.040
 they differ as well, they are very much 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 conveniently through fungi and apparently 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.880
 You liked the boots very much in 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.270
 principle what else do we have what principle u 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.610
 we changed changed we have bow bow 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.040
 On 100 such black his such such there he has 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.220
 stretch stretch got calls cool 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.660
 such an original bow sent by wilson 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.119
 pick up all what to see have a resource 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.610
 until all i 'm saying is that if i take in 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.310
 the game of this stove okay this is unreal 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.039
 private because ways and plagiarism 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 I really like books I don’t think so 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.060
 tell someone else's works my offices position 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.180
 do not take the principle of such a bow 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:02.580
 we build also such black black black and 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:06.660
 my she's even very cool to them let's 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.700
 look at the armor of Man we 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.640
 it was completely so black 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.400
 black she looks at us right this way 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.840
 black black black and in the inventory guys 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.959
 what I really don't read in 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:30.540
 normal inventory 90 born lack 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:34.500
 that we are Vitya, we are all black, well, I 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.560
 I think I'll leave it to this 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.370
 paxton again let's go further 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:46.320
 and Dima so also go so 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.400
 things are all principle here's the floor with us 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.230
 replaced shura 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:56.350
 this iron ingot stick and principle we 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:00.670
 but we did not really but in my opinion 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:05.650
 normal enough wave principle 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:11.500
 slept not happy black chest such 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.750
 the black hour there is straight all black as 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.870
 only black principle here we have 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:27.600
 energetically black straight wall and sandpipers and 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:31.630
 golden apples and the usual while the prince 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.440
 golden apple on all black and how 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:41.250
 usually a golden enchanted apple for 100 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:45.700
 will be shorter like that but some 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.740
 say such a thing as normal but it 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.270
 shine well and basically it is usually an apple 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.840
 brown because alison 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.110
 parker and everything must have such a dark tone 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.020
 Well, I thought to make it the amount 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.840
 original but what else is there in 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.130
 In principle, I did not want a iron resource pack 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.280
 On the card I got the videos very cool 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.740
 solve principle you okay i'm sort of all 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.150
 that showed all that is changed from 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:24.250
 The past model of the respaws principle is 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:29.250
 I like the modified model more 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:34.630
 and that's how I hope you like and 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:37.780
 if so and in such 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.000
 positive comment following 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.880
 what 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.540
 series muse resuspak want immediately after 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.090

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:07.930
