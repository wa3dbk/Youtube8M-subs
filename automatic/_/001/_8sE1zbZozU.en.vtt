 Hi everyone, as promised, here I am 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.990
 with the second video dedicated to the widget 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.219
 kronus made by the team china gene 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.330
 which allows us to have a widget 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.640
 complete with weather clock and events 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.890
 dog taken from the calendar 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.170
 the widget is free and as you can 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.930
 see and also customizable as 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.939
 first thing I can tell you we can 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.820
 resize the widget based on 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.750
 space on our screen and see 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.630
 more or less all the information to have 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.190
 fast connections indeed 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.809
 to the clock application by clicking 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 on the clock we will be able to enter inside 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.309
 watch application and possibly 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.559
 can stay awake and display the time e 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.700
 the date activate the chronometer on 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.010
 countdown 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.320
 ok we can view the eventual 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.449
 future alarms and the level of the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.460
 battery in this case over one hundred 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:06.409
 I hope it's enough for me to finish the video 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.080
 second second part of the widget we have 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.080
 time and daily indications e 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.729
 clicking on it we will be able to visualize 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.570
 also those of the following days with 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.300

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.830
 possible day temperature 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.690
 precipitation humidity and in this case 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.150
 this is also the wind for 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.310
 customize the weather part 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.869
 we can also choose a set of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.820
 pre-installed colics where once 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.310
 you will have installed the widget will be two 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.360
 while if you want to expand the set of icons 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.360
 we can connect to the play store e 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.030
 install seven more cona last 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.430
 part of the widget is the link to 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.440
 calendar of the system of the few 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.570
 words from our phone 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.590
 as you can see here we can scroll 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.050
 downwards also possible events e 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.130
 choose how many to display on the CEO 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.130
 by default 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.680
 I left the setting to two 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.360
 weeks if you wish 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.489
 add without entering into the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.940
 calendar a fast event we can 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:29.100
 explain on the button more and how you can 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.470
 see set up a single event 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.650
 ok it's not over because now we go to 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.560
 see the various point customizations 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.840
 cone colors and others 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.180
 settings that could come back 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.790
 useful for customizing the widget and in 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.900
 based on our customization 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.470
 general 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.950
 we are going to open kronus ok as you can 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.900
 see for every single item 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.600
 alarm clock weather news 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.130
 calendar we can go to set up 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.890
 different aspects 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.180
 we say that for all we can also the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.670
 I can do 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.150
 we can set the for example the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.750
 bold color we might as well 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.560
 go set up 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.650
 the color is no bold only on 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.660
 hours in as in the case of both or only 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.410
 on the minutes 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:27.500
 ok data is awake and as you can see 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.410
 in the pro version we could have others 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.020
 additional settings here is how I had it 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.140
 mentioned at the beginning I looked for the 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.180
 battery in this case we can 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.810
 also display the percentage of the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.680
 battery 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.239
 the next alarm clock and show the date 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.459
 once we have chosen all the 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:52.070
 settings that interest us 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:54.020
 we will have to tick it to apply them to the al 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.970
 widget 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.420
 same thing for the weather we can 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.330
 precisely choose the interval of 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.120
 update the source I left 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.300
 the increases or however as you can see there 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.080
 other sources display the weather 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.760
 obviously we for every single item of the 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.530
 widgets also based on ours 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.720
 preferences maybe you also have another 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.109
 weather widget we can choose 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.270
 also not to display it maybe us 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.090
 we want to play only the date and the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.310
 calendar just remove this 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.780
 tick and the weather will not be displayed 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:35.240
 the widget is another thing is the position io 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.220
 now I let the widget survey 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.380
 the position automatically however us 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.160
 however we can go to insert a 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.620
 single city 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.350
 I now the automatic school because 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.740
 now I prefer to set them and set of icons 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.600
 now as you can we have two 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.850
 clicking on other two will direct us 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.100
 on the play store and we will choose between 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:59.600
 other cona sets 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:04.240
 ok other settings for the style of 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:08.990
 weather and the various units of measurement 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.220
 and anyway let's say they are settings 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.070
 that there are also in other applications 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.750
 the weather also in this case as I had 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.270
 already senate we can also set the 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.270
 lettering color ok 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.860
 same speech also for the calendar 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.720
 we will have dedicated settings for 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.670
 calendar application anyway 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.600
 also in this case we could go to 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:41.600
 customize the appearance of the example 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:45.120
 the color according to our tastes that 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.740
 general aspect in this case not 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.730
 you can see them from here in this case 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.220
 free version 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:55.370
 we may have other settings ok 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.590
 rescue and recovery here we can 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.230
 save settings make a 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:05.250
 backup the widget in the way of 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.790
 restore it if eventually in the 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.160
 in case maybe we decided to 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:14.340
 uninstall it and then install it 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.220
 later ok i got the news 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.570
 you can see I have not used it 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.810
 show news because sincerely 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.650
 I don't care, though, though 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.210
 you want to try it you can also activate it 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.520
 OK nothing 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:34.620
 for this widget in my opinion very much 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.260
 complete and also customizable e 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.300
 all as always always found in the 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.080
 description of the video and within the 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.659
 video the link 2 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.030
 where to download the widget o 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:50.690
 application 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:53.630
 in question we see each other next 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:57.590
 video where I thought I'd show you the 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.540
 new clean master update where 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.880
 I had already made the dedicated video though 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.430
 with the last update that came out 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.590
 for a while it has changed completely graphically 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:11.050
 and added some customizations and 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.860
 quick shortcuts in my opinion 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.690
 interesting 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.590
 nothing for the moment is all about 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.590
 next hello
