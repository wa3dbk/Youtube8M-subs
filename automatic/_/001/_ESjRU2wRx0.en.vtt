00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.620 
actually that next step so i'm going to
touch<00:01:56.450> up<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:56.780> mint<00:01:57.079> color

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.190 

next<00:02:01.530> step<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.040> use<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.610> large<00:02:03.299> shader

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
next step was to use this large shader

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.289 
next step was to use this large shader
brush<00:02:04.350> from<00:02:04.649> Sonia<00:02:05.009> Kashuk<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:06.149> is

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
brush from Sonia Kashuk and this is

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.719 
brush from Sonia Kashuk and this is
called<00:02:06.539> camel<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.530> put<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.860> from<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
called camel and I put this from the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.029 
called camel and I put this from the
crease<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.539> brow<00:02:09.720> bone<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.530> next<00:02:10.830> color

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
crease to the brow bone the next color

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.220 
crease to the brow bone the next color
is<00:02:11.220> called<00:02:11.370> pudding<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.390> put<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.720> through

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
is called pudding and I put this through

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.380 
is called pudding and I put this through
the<00:02:13.349> crease<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.670> next<00:02:14.910> color<00:02:15.209> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
the crease so this is the next color and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.509 
the crease so this is the next color and
it's<00:02:15.480> called<00:02:15.690> truffle<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.890> put<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.310> in

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
it's called truffle and I put this in

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.780 
it's called truffle and I put this in
the<00:02:17.610> outer<00:02:17.760> V<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:18.780> here<00:02:19.459> using<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.550> medium

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the outer V right here using a medium

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.140 
the outer V right here using a medium

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
shader brush from Sonia Kashuk using a

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.059 
shader brush from Sonia Kashuk using a
blending<00:02:24.480> brush<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:25.290> want<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.560> blend<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:26.040> any

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.759 
blending brush we want to blend out any
harsh<00:02:26.310> lines<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.599> don't<00:02:27.810> want<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.260> kind<00:02:28.680> of

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
harsh lines but we don't want to kind of

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.160 
harsh lines but we don't want to kind of
mix<00:02:29.040> these<00:02:29.310> colors<00:02:29.910> together<00:02:30.120> really<00:02:30.840> muddy

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
mix these colors together really muddy

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.870 
mix these colors together really muddy
them<00:02:31.470> up<00:02:31.650> they're<00:02:31.890> gonna<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.280> really<00:02:32.489> kind<00:02:32.760> of

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
them up they're gonna be really kind of

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.680 
them up they're gonna be really kind of
just<00:02:33.769> right<00:02:34.769> there<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:36.150> pulling<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.630> out

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
just right there just pulling that out

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
so that's the step we are at the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.190 
so that's the step we are at the
tutorial<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.569> we're<00:02:39.690> going<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> keep<00:02:40.019> going
