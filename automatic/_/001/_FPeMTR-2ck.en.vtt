00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 then gazich to friends and so we are 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.830
 here in a small log because then 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.960
 as you saw in the last video that 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.790
 I loaded an hour ago the game 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.779
 precisely gta 5 takes laga and so I am 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.330
 right here because in writing I know that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.130
 you can't read all my words 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.670
 little video in which I tell you a little 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:31.380
 why am I going to play then 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.770
 boys gta 5 consumes a mess of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.160
 dc processor more type now than not 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.230
 I'm doing nothing we're already 75 per 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.680
 hundred of cpi without doing anything 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.750
 let alone when I play and therefore it is for 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.000
 what snaps but the beauty that I don't 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.160
 I realize that the game is triggered and the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.050
 video that does not play the game 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 because obviously I notice it 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.780
 game snaps is not that I am not short 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.730
 that I am blind is not that I do not see while 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.100
 the game if it clicks on me does not trigger me and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.090
 precisely the video that clicks 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.790
 because because in the end we say that the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.010
 processor is dedicated to the game ne 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.770
 very little is devoted to the program 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.140
 which records at xp which is dedicated 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.159
 little processor and therefore since there is not 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.799
 makes her stay with the pace of the game then 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.229
 the video then clicks guys I have 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.420
 tried everything I'm also looking for 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.259
 lower the graphic quality but the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.990
 processor always consumes a mess 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.700
 sixth game is based more on the processor 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.079
 that on the video card 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.060
 because that's how it consumes kids 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.979
 always a lot anyway if you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.509
 ask what you are doing now 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.850
 nick and nothing I was a little bit 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.110
 trying something I never did 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.009
 I was trying to create a competition if I was 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.079
 succeeds guys maybe in one of the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.799
 next videos when maybe i will 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.969
 make a complete path that works 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.080
 in that case maybe he'll publish 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.759
 in short, a race 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.340
 a track a short race created by 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.650
 the less you understand no race creator 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.920
 then seen a little while passing the time a 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.900
 build a track now I make a 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.940
 moment to see and then in short boys 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.790
 I just wanted to tell you why then 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.450
 maybe one says me sleeves but it will be the fault 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.340
 Your short floods so maybe some is 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.770
 my fault maybe I don't notice that 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.480
 is flooding at that time 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.060
 but in the meantime there is not much that in short 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.700
 I can do it in short this is the view 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.090
 guys that was so right therefore 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.670
 so it's a bit fiddling and therefore that 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.250
 I'm creating this kind of race 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.430
 I will try to put other obstacles in 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.520
 then another thing I wanted to say 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.110
 in this small you log and I will do the 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.320
 my first faq time guys and in fact vi 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.220
 I wanted to say that now I will create soon 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.740
 a 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.780
 a post on facebook then guys 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.320
 go to my facebook page found 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.080
 linking description in which precisely there 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.260
 it will be this place where you can do 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.900
 to me some questions I in a video 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.050
 dedicated to part time 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.840
 I will answer I do not know now I think 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.590
 towards Sunday, maybe I'll say the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.060
 video answer in your questions 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.710
 anyway this is also the view 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.050
 I created siena half crap 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.480
 because there is also a couple of jumps to do 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.640
 but I think that while one is playing 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.240
 it concentrates better and maybe succeeds 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.730
 in short, to go a little better or 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.680
 maybe I'll put some kind of bikes on the yes 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.959
 maybe they put more suitable means to the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.880
 off-road but still I think a 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.040
 above, so I'm also 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.940
 tweaking a little boys to create 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.080
 of custom races and death matches 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.900
 custom maybe if I can 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.030
 it would be nice too no oh well with the boys 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.280
 so this gray wire ends here 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.010
 only aimed to say about 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.700
 this problem of lag and concerning the fac 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.470
 in short, what time will I do 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.690
 because i will do the video answer i think 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.799
 Sunday is fine so guys I will 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.830
 greeting 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.210
 there is nothing else to say, well we get it 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.590
 at the next best acacia la 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.310
 next who knows if it goes off well 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.310
 this way
