00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
to do some testing with Enderman to

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.830 
to do some testing with Enderman to
answer<00:00:08.160> many<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.760> suggested<00:00:09.389> myths<00:00:09.630> you

have been asking for in the comments

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.270 
have been asking for in the comments
most<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.570> which<00:00:12.750> ask<00:00:13.049> what<00:00:13.380> blocks<00:00:13.650> can<00:00:13.950> end<00:00:14.160> up

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
most of which ask what blocks can end up

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.919 
most of which ask what blocks can end up
and<00:00:14.429> pick<00:00:14.580> up<00:00:14.759> now<00:00:15.299> there<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.570> information

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
and pick up now there is information

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.380 
and pick up now there is information
about<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.100> Minecraft<00:00:17.310> Wiki<00:00:17.760> however

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
about this on the Minecraft Wiki however

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.300 
about this on the Minecraft Wiki however
its<00:00:18.600> source<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.140> over<00:00:19.500> two<00:00:19.680> years<00:00:19.949> old<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
its source is over two years old and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.250 
its source is over two years old and
since<00:00:20.939> then<00:00:21.180> many<00:00:21.390> new<00:00:21.630> blocks<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.109> been

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
since then many new blocks have been

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.200 
since then many new blocks have been
added<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.859> game<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.850> built<00:00:24.060> this

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
added to the game so I have built this

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
added to the game so I have built this
testing<00:00:24.689> facility<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.470> can<00:00:25.740> test<00:00:25.949> what

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
testing facility so we can test what

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.550 
testing facility so we can test what
blocks<00:00:26.550> Enderman<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.269> pick<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.599> inside<00:00:28.349> we

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
blocks Enderman can pick up inside we

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.230 
blocks Enderman can pick up inside we
can<00:00:28.710> place<00:00:28.890> different<00:00:28.920> blocks<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.730> test<00:00:30.000> an

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
can place different blocks to test an

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.510 
can place different blocks to test an
Enderman<00:00:30.689> could<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:30.990> spawned<00:00:31.320> inside<00:00:31.710> using

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
Enderman could be spawned inside using

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520 
Enderman could be spawned inside using
command<00:00:32.880> blocks<00:00:33.149> then<00:00:33.750> when<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.050> observe<00:00:34.140> an

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
command blocks then when we observe an

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.440 
command blocks then when we observe an
Enderman<00:00:34.950> picking<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.520> block<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:36.000> make<00:00:36.180> note

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
Enderman picking up a block we make note

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.420 
Enderman picking up a block we make note
of<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.870> B<00:00:37.290> spawn<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> Enderman

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
of it and B spawn all of the Enderman

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.369 
of it and B spawn all of the Enderman
using<00:00:38.790> command<00:00:39.149> blocks<00:00:39.390> before<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.960> places

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
using command blocks before it places

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.410 
using command blocks before it places
the<00:00:40.530> block<00:00:40.770> back<00:00:40.980> down<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.090> relies<00:00:42.390> on

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the block back down now this relies on

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.420 
the block back down now this relies on
Enderman<00:00:43.050> being<00:00:43.290> able<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.620> de-spawn<00:00:44.190> when

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
Enderman being able to de-spawn when

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.220 
Enderman being able to de-spawn when
holding<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.850> block<00:00:45.090> which<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.140> the

holding a block which is one of the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
holding a block which is one of the
myths<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.680> has<00:00:46.770> been<00:00:46.980> requested<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
myths that has been requested in the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.119 
myths that has been requested in the
comments<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> bust<00:00:49.289> another<00:00:49.620> mini<00:00:49.920> myth

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
comments so to bust another mini myth

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.430 
comments so to bust another mini myth
while<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.520> are<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.420> possible<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.050> an

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
while we are at it it is possible for an

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
while we are at it it is possible for an
Enderman<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> place<00:00:53.190> any<00:00:53.520> block<00:00:53.879> type<00:00:54.180> down<00:00:54.449> if

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
Enderman to place any block type down if

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810 
Enderman to place any block type down if
they<00:00:55.230> are<00:00:55.350> spawned<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.890> holding<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.370> block<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
they are spawned in holding a block they

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.090 
they are spawned in holding a block they
can't<00:00:57.120> pick<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.289> getting<00:00:58.530> back<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
can't pick up so getting back to the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
can't pick up so getting back to the
testing<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.699> are<00:00:59.820> doing<00:01:00.120> Enderman<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:00.989> be

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
testing we are doing Enderman will be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.869 
testing we are doing Enderman will be
unable<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.469> teleport<00:01:02.160> outside<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.789> the

unable to teleport outside of the
testing<00:01:03.300> facility<00:01:03.480> which<00:01:04.049> means<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.500> can

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
testing facility which means we can

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.190 
testing facility which means we can
contain<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.790> two<00:01:06.000> tests<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> first

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
contain them for two tests for the first

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.530 
contain them for two tests for the first
test<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.770> will<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:08.070> checking<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> pickup

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
test we will be checking that the pickup

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
test we will be checking that the pickup
herbal<00:01:09.840> blocks<00:01:10.080> listed<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> wiki<00:01:11.130> are

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
herbal blocks listed on the wiki are

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.399 
herbal blocks listed on the wiki are
correct<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> second<00:01:12.840> test<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.260> will

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
correct and in the second test we will

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
correct and in the second test we will
check<00:01:13.619> all<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.070> blocks<00:01:14.310> added<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
check all of the blocks added to the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
check all of the blocks added to the
game<00:01:15.119> since<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.990> information<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.860> made

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
game since this information was made

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
game since this information was made
available<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.450> those<00:01:18.689> blocks

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
available to see which of those blocks

00:01:19.020 --> 00:03:47.120 
available to see which of those blocks
Enderman<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.830> pick<00:01:19.979> up

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.920 

so<00:03:48.130> there<00:03:48.400> we<00:03:48.520> go<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.940> lot<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.270> things<00:03:49.480> happened

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
so there we go a lot of things happened

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.780 
so there we go a lot of things happened
in<00:03:50.080> that<00:03:50.260> time<00:03:50.560> lapse<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:51.099> blocks<00:03:51.310> got<00:03:51.550> picked

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
in that time lapse and blocks got picked

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.059 
in that time lapse and blocks got picked
up<00:03:51.970> some<00:03:52.330> blocks<00:03:52.510> got<00:03:52.840> put<00:03:53.020> down<00:03:53.260> but<00:03:53.800> here<00:03:54.040> I

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
up some blocks got put down but here I

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.860 
up some blocks got put down but here I
have<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.520> results<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:55.090> our<00:03:55.180> test<00:03:55.510> now<00:03:55.810> we

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
have the results of our test now we

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.570 
have the results of our test now we
started<00:03:56.290> off<00:03:56.440> by<00:03:56.470> testing<00:03:57.099> the<00:03:57.190> blocks<00:03:57.430> that

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
started off by testing the blocks that

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.490 
started off by testing the blocks that
the<00:03:57.819> wiki<00:03:58.090> said<00:03:58.330> Enderman<00:03:58.810> could<00:03:58.930> pick<00:03:59.110> up<00:03:59.290> and

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
the wiki said Enderman could pick up and

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.229 
the wiki said Enderman could pick up and
all<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.190> these<00:04:00.310> were<00:04:00.550> correct<00:04:00.940> with<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
all of these were correct with the

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.809 
all of these were correct with the
exception<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:01.959> lilypads<00:04:02.500> as<00:04:02.769> you<00:04:03.370> saw<00:04:03.610> we

exception of lilypads as you saw we

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.550 
exception of lilypads as you saw we
tested<00:04:04.239> this<00:04:04.360> for<00:04:04.569> some<00:04:04.810> time<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.380> not<00:04:05.530> a

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
tested this for some time and not a

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.070 
tested this for some time and not a
single<00:04:05.830> Enderman<00:04:06.400> picks<00:04:06.940> one<00:04:07.150> up<00:04:07.300> now<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.019> is

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
single Enderman picks one up now this is

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.130 
single Enderman picks one up now this is
a<00:04:08.260> change<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.709> we<00:04:08.920> found<00:04:09.220> in<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.660> 1.6.4<00:04:10.660> code

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
a change that we found in the 1.6.4 code

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.320 
a change that we found in the 1.6.4 code
so<00:04:11.709> for<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:12.069> rest<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.519> our<00:04:12.610> testing<00:04:13.150> there

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
so for the rest of our testing there

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.850 
so for the rest of our testing there
were<00:04:13.420> no<00:04:13.600> other<00:04:13.840> blocks<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.530> Enderman

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
were no other blocks that the Enderman

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.340 
were no other blocks that the Enderman
picked<00:04:15.100> up<00:04:15.310> until<00:04:15.700> we<00:04:15.819> got<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.299> 1.7<00:04:17.019> update

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
picked up until we got to the 1.7 update

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.590 
picked up until we got to the 1.7 update
in<00:04:17.530> this<00:04:18.160> test<00:04:18.430> we<00:04:18.639> found<00:04:18.910> that<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.209> Enderman

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
in this test we found that the Enderman

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.930 
in this test we found that the Enderman
could<00:04:19.810> pick<00:04:19.959> up<00:04:20.139> the<00:04:20.350> red<00:04:20.560> sand<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.430> podzol

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
could pick up the red sand the podzol

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.150 
could pick up the red sand the podzol
the<00:04:22.180> dirt<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.720> grass<00:04:23.020> doesn't<00:04:23.320> spread<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.950> and

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
the dirt the grass doesn't spread to and

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.530 
the dirt the grass doesn't spread to and
all<00:04:24.700> eight<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.479> new<00:04:25.630> one<00:04:25.900> high<00:04:26.110> flow<00:04:26.380> types

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
all eight of the new one high flow types

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.870 
all eight of the new one high flow types
so<00:04:28.540> as<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:28.900> explained<00:04:29.410> in<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.650> last<00:04:30.040> episode<00:04:30.639> we

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
so as I explained in the last episode we

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.180 
so as I explained in the last episode we
still<00:04:31.240> don't<00:04:31.419> have<00:04:31.540> access<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.290> 1.7<00:04:32.979> game

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
still don't have access to the 1.7 game

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.610 
still don't have access to the 1.7 game
code<00:04:33.460> but<00:04:33.940> sigh<00:04:34.150> guy<00:04:34.360> Ryan<00:04:34.630> check<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.020> 1.6

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
code but sigh guy Ryan check the 1.6

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.500 
code but sigh guy Ryan check the 1.6
code<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.190> found<00:04:36.430> that<00:04:36.550> Enderman<00:04:36.970> have<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.180> list

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
code and found that Enderman have a list

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.480 
code and found that Enderman have a list
of<00:04:37.690> blocks<00:04:37.930> they<00:04:38.139> can<00:04:38.350> pick<00:04:38.530> up<00:04:38.680> this<00:04:39.220> is

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
of blocks they can pick up this is

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.040 
of blocks they can pick up this is
interesting<00:04:39.910> because<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.450> means<00:04:40.690> that<00:04:40.930> any

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
interesting because it means that any

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.990 
interesting because it means that any
newly<00:04:41.440> added<00:04:41.620> blocks<00:04:41.950> can<00:04:42.280> not<00:04:42.430> be<00:04:42.610> picked<00:04:42.820> up

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
newly added blocks can not be picked up

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.540 
newly added blocks can not be picked up
by<00:04:43.600> default<00:04:43.840> so<00:04:44.410> if<00:04:44.530> an<00:04:44.650> Enderman<00:04:45.070> can<00:04:45.220> pick<00:04:45.400> up

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
by default so if an Enderman can pick up

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.520 
by default so if an Enderman can pick up
a<00:04:45.700> new<00:04:45.910> block<00:04:46.180> is<00:04:46.360> because<00:04:46.690> mo<00:04:46.870> yang<00:04:47.110> have

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
a new block is because mo yang have

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.860 
a new block is because mo yang have
changed<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.100> endermans<00:04:48.550> code<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:49.300> specify

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
changed the endermans code to specify

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.659 
changed the endermans code to specify
that<00:04:50.080> it<00:04:50.169> can<00:04:50.380> which<00:04:50.890> is<00:04:51.070> what<00:04:51.220> they<00:04:51.340> have<00:04:51.460> most

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
that it can which is what they have most

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.230 
that it can which is what they have most
likely<00:04:51.850> done<00:04:52.240> with<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.600> 1.7<00:04:53.169> update<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:55.030> that

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
likely done with the 1.7 update so that

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.940 
likely done with the 1.7 update so that
is<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.510> for<00:04:55.690> another<00:04:55.870> episode<00:04:56.020> of<00:04:56.440> Minecraft

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
is it for another episode of Minecraft

think<00:05:10.870> it's<00:05:11.020> flawed<00:05:11.410> or<00:05:11.979> that<00:05:12.280> there's

the<00:05:26.650> episode<00:05:27.130> I<00:05:27.400> read<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:27.729> game<00:05:27.910> code<00:05:28.210> I

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
the episode I read the game code I

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.240 
the episode I read the game code I
figure<00:05:28.630> out<00:05:28.750> what's<00:05:28.930> going<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.200> go<00:05:29.350> on<00:05:29.380> so<00:05:30.070> when

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
figure out what's going to go on so when

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.010 
figure out what's going to go on so when
I<00:05:30.280> make<00:05:30.490> these<00:05:30.639> videos<00:05:30.850> I<00:05:31.270> display<00:05:31.870> the

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
I make these videos I display the

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.050 
I make these videos I display the
information<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:32.860> in<00:05:33.100> a<00:05:33.250> way<00:05:33.400> that's<00:05:33.610> fun<00:05:33.820> I

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
information to you in a way that's fun I

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.879 
information to you in a way that's fun I
sort<00:05:34.510> of<00:05:34.539> take<00:05:34.780> you<00:05:34.960> through<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.289> process<00:05:35.320> of

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
sort of take you through the process of

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.740 
sort of take you through the process of
how<00:05:36.070> I've<00:05:36.340> understood<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:37.090> things<00:05:37.300> are<00:05:37.510> going

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
how I've understood the things are going

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.930 
how I've understood the things are going
on<00:05:37.900> in<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.169> game<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:39.010> time<00:05:39.220> lapses<00:05:39.700> are

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
on in the game and the time lapses are

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.610 
on in the game and the time lapses are
often<00:05:40.389> a<00:05:40.479> way<00:05:40.600> of<00:05:40.750> demonstrating<00:05:40.960> what's

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
often a way of demonstrating what's

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.350 
often a way of demonstrating what's
happening<00:05:41.950> in<00:05:42.070> the<00:05:42.160> game<00:05:42.340> just<00:05:42.940> for<00:05:43.090> a<00:05:43.120> bit<00:05:43.300> of

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
happening in the game just for a bit of

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.490 
happening in the game just for a bit of
fun<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:43.810> they're<00:05:43.930> not<00:05:44.050> always<00:05:44.200> the<00:05:44.470> most

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
fun and they're not always the most

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.100 
fun and they're not always the most
accurate<00:05:44.889> of<00:05:45.190> tests<00:05:45.669> for<00:05:45.850> example<00:05:45.960> today<00:05:46.960> with

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
accurate of tests for example today with

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.930 
accurate of tests for example today with
the<00:05:47.200> Enderman<00:05:47.650> farm<00:05:47.979> you<00:05:48.159> could<00:05:48.370> argue<00:05:48.580> that

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
the Enderman farm you could argue that

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.969 
the Enderman farm you could argue that
just<00:05:49.210> because<00:05:49.539> those<00:05:50.020> Enderman<00:05:50.530> didn't<00:05:50.830> pick

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
just because those Enderman didn't pick

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.920 
just because those Enderman didn't pick
up<00:05:51.159> certain<00:05:51.580> block<00:05:51.880> types<00:05:52.150> doesn't<00:05:52.599> mean<00:05:52.720> they

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
up certain block types doesn't mean they

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.840 
up certain block types doesn't mean they
can't<00:05:53.169> bleep<00:05:53.440> them<00:05:53.860> up<00:05:54.009> just<00:05:54.340> that<00:05:54.460> they<00:05:54.580> chose

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
can't bleep them up just that they chose

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.879 
can't bleep them up just that they chose
not<00:05:55.060> to<00:05:55.479> on<00:05:55.840> that<00:05:55.870> occasion<00:05:56.289> and<00:05:56.680> that<00:05:56.770> is<00:05:56.860> a

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
not to on that occasion and that is a

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.980 
not to on that occasion and that is a
perfectly<00:05:57.430> good<00:05:57.610> point<00:05:57.910> but<00:05:58.449> it<00:05:58.600> doesn't<00:05:58.870> make

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
perfectly good point but it doesn't make

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.960 
perfectly good point but it doesn't make
for<00:05:59.229> a<00:05:59.289> fun<00:05:59.560> time<00:05:59.860> lapse<00:06:00.130> and<00:06:00.310> in<00:06:00.400> this<00:06:00.520> case<00:06:00.789> I

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
for a fun time lapse and in this case I

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.060 
for a fun time lapse and in this case I
could<00:06:01.030> also<00:06:01.330> prove<00:06:01.750> which<00:06:02.350> blocks<00:06:02.680> they<00:06:02.860> could

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
could also prove which blocks they could

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.529 
could also prove which blocks they could
pick<00:06:03.280> up<00:06:03.430> due<00:06:03.669> to<00:06:03.699> the<00:06:03.850> way<00:06:04.030> that<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.330> game

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
pick up due to the way that the game

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.540 
pick up due to the way that the game
code<00:06:04.810> worked<00:06:05.169> but<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:05.919> point<00:06:06.130> there<00:06:06.340> would<00:06:06.520> be

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
code worked but the point there would be

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.150 
code worked but the point there would be
that<00:06:06.910> if<00:06:07.030> I<00:06:07.210> were<00:06:07.389> to<00:06:07.470> test<00:06:08.470> it<00:06:08.680> you<00:06:08.830> know<00:06:08.949> for

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
that if I were to test it you know for

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.560 
that if I were to test it you know for
hours<00:06:09.460> and<00:06:09.610> hours<00:06:09.759> and<00:06:09.940> hours<00:06:10.210> then<00:06:10.330> I'd<00:06:10.449> never

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
hours and hours and hours then I'd never

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.150 
hours and hours and hours then I'd never
be<00:06:10.810> able<00:06:10.900> to<00:06:11.020> get<00:06:11.169> this<00:06:11.289> video<00:06:11.590> together<00:06:11.830> and

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
be able to get this video together and

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.830 
be able to get this video together and
these<00:06:12.250> actually<00:06:12.639> take<00:06:12.850> a<00:06:13.000> long<00:06:13.300> time<00:06:13.479> to<00:06:13.690> make

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
these actually take a long time to make

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.840 
these actually take a long time to make
as<00:06:14.020> it<00:06:14.050> is<00:06:14.380> there's<00:06:14.949> a<00:06:15.009> long<00:06:15.220> time<00:06:15.430> spent

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
as it is there's a long time spent

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.969 
as it is there's a long time spent
building<00:06:16.120> things<00:06:16.539> then<00:06:16.810> recording<00:06:17.410> then<00:06:17.889> I

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
building things then recording then I

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.529 
building things then recording then I
have<00:06:18.160> to<00:06:18.280> transfer<00:06:18.520> files<00:06:18.970> between<00:06:19.120> my

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
have to transfer files between my

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.360 
have to transfer files between my
computer<00:06:20.050> and<00:06:20.199> I<00:06:20.259> have<00:06:20.289> to<00:06:20.560> render<00:06:20.800> and<00:06:21.070> encode

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
computer and I have to render and encode

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.310 
computer and I have to render and encode
and<00:06:21.610> edit<00:06:21.910> and<00:06:22.030> do<00:06:22.120> all<00:06:22.360> sorts<00:06:22.389> of<00:06:22.840> things<00:06:23.080> that

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
and edit and do all sorts of things that

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.499 
and edit and do all sorts of things that
make<00:06:23.889> the<00:06:24.190> five<00:06:24.550> minutes<00:06:24.850> that<00:06:25.000> you<00:06:25.120> see<00:06:25.300> of<00:06:25.419> a

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
make the five minutes that you see of a

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.300 
make the five minutes that you see of a
video<00:06:25.750> a<00:06:25.810> hell<00:06:26.169> of<00:06:26.199> a<00:06:26.349> lot<00:06:26.470> longer<00:06:26.620> for<00:06:26.979> me<00:06:27.099> and

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
video a hell of a lot longer for me and

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.980 
video a hell of a lot longer for me and
so<00:06:27.820> know<00:06:27.970> that<00:06:28.000> with<00:06:28.270> this<00:06:28.389> show<00:06:28.630> I'm<00:06:28.840> always

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
so know that with this show I'm always

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.320 
so know that with this show I'm always
trying<00:06:29.259> to<00:06:29.440> provide<00:06:29.710> quality<00:06:30.220> with<00:06:30.460> the<00:06:30.699> video

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
trying to provide quality with the video

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.879 
trying to provide quality with the video
that<00:06:31.570> you<00:06:31.660> watch<00:06:31.870> but<00:06:32.080> I'm<00:06:32.169> also<00:06:32.349> making<00:06:32.860> sure

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
that you watch but I'm also making sure

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.650 
that you watch but I'm also making sure
that<00:06:33.099> everything<00:06:33.580> I<00:06:33.699> tell<00:06:33.880> you<00:06:33.940> is<00:06:34.210> as

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
that everything I tell you is as

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.409 
that everything I tell you is as
accurate<00:06:35.139> as<00:06:35.259> I<00:06:35.380> can<00:06:35.620> know<00:06:35.740> is<00:06:35.979> as<00:06:36.190> well<00:06:36.820> so<00:06:37.389> I

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
accurate as I can know is as well so I

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.150 
accurate as I can know is as well so I
think<00:06:37.660> that<00:06:37.900> summarizes<00:06:38.320> everything<00:06:38.620> I<00:06:39.009> want
