00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.580
 hello dear 1000 ps fans we are today 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.160
 here in the house of bmw motorcycle center 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.650
 for new and used motorcycles 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.059
 My name is florian iron books and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.090
 I want you some used today 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.990
 Motorcycles show and catch us 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.570
 now with the r 1200 rt a bmw 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.760
 boxer tours machine with a very 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.109
 long tradition and there are 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.219
 some details from me 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.360
 the r 1200 rt are here anyway 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.980
 long tradition 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.190
 that already has in the 70s 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 started with an 80s tee or 100e 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.110
 is then about the 1100 of the RT models 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.129
 tl fifties and then finally to 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.770
 first 1200 rt passed in the form 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.039
 have it in the latest version that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.780
 is still with the last stand of the engine 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.489
 And she has all the qualities we have 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.070
 expect a harvest is the r 1200 rt 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.060
 a car model already in the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.970
 fifth generation has started the rd 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.880
 bauer at the end of the seventies with the ro80 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.549
 rt about the centuries t models then 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 finally the 1100 there and the 1150 he 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.100
 the models are seen to the r 1200 r 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.799
 which now in the meantime in the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.680
 second generation are that means with 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.960
 we have a lot of rt models 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.360
 traditional and long model history 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.340
 already and I am convinced that we are with 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.229
 the tours vehicles 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.970
 combined with the box aggregate too 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.759
 still have many successful years 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.520
 be the model revised r 1200 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.189
 Just as we have seen here 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.030
 the 1200 cubic boxer engine installed with 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.470
 110 ps power 119 newton meters 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.060
 So that's why you look 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.520
 It will be decided for the boxer engine 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.200
 namely the torque especially in the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.020
 Machine is it that you are doing in gymnastics 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.759
 segment is the lightest machine 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.180
 namely with a live weight of 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.129
 Just 260 kilo full of fuel there 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.170
 but let's talk about 25 liters 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:16.250
 tank volume where you really great 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.840
 considerable reach reaches the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.780
 fuel consumption is at the machine 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.310
 at about 5 and semiconductors that's very 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.760
 realistic and often tested 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.120
 been 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.600
 even more special is that it at the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.780
 variant very many bench 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.060
 possibilities are also from the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.730
 highest variation with 84 cm down to 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.069
 75 centimeters if possible and sitting 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.250
 this is very rare in the segment 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.670
 the r 1200 rd models from the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.010
 2013 model year are in three colors too 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.230
 get on the one hand in this 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.760
 midnight blue as we see it here 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.110
 then there is a gray metallic and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.959
 especially for this year 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.390
 anniversary 90 years bmw motorcycle is there 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.450
 a black model namely the 90th 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.280
 years edition of the r 1200 rd so 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.340
 say for the connoisseur and for the collector 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.290
 certainly quite interesting machine 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.850
 who for a used 1200 he he 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.790
 the pass should be some things 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.260
 pay attention to the vehicles are one 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.049
 all very well equipped that is the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.090
 All models are all electric 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.010
 adjustable wind deflector that should be 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.500
 definitely work because of that 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.239
 very much contributes to the comfort 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.549
 important also the standard 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.650
 side luggage must rt in each case 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.799
 be because you tour vehicles 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.320
 are simply essential 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.700
 from the technical side 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.910
 Just close the engine for tightness 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.890
 check and we at least in the first 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.390
 year wants to have a lot of fun with his 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.650
 machine should additionally also the 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.390
 Check brake system 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.510
 because of the strong 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.069
 braking power from and to a higher 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.480
 wear because you should just it 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.890
 watch 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.670
 more tips from the technical side 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.459
 from me 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.500
 for vehicles 60 70 thousand 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.180
 have reached kilometer marks the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.370
 one should pay attention to the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.290
 Clutch lay because in the area is 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.280
 to expect that the clutch already 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.109
 should be renewed and continue us 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.810
 have our vehicles at 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:21.140
 Cardan drive that means it is driving 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.849
 without care quasi possible but of course 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.140
 are seals installed that is called the 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.449
 of course, charta drive is also on 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.130
 Check tightness 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.520
 if you want to get a species up and running 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.639
 is that easy turn key 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.460
 and idle can then immediately on 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.240
 Stadthaus has been started 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.639
 in addition I have on mine 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.900
 Information display the most important 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.320
 data retrievable 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.960
 on the one hand over the on-board computer I 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.940
 switch on the info button here 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.340
 the proven things like a permanent one 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.870
 residual range control 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.790
 average speed indicator 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.090
 average consumption indicator and ever 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.940
 after equipment of the machine optional 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.710
 tire pressure indicator 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.479
 Of course, there are compulsory ones 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.950
 kilometer indication with two days 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.500
 kilometers count as well as one 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.540
 Tank gauge temperature gauge and still 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.910
 a gear indicator is the machine 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.050
 additionally with the bmw radio 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.660
 been equipped 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.910
 I see the controls here and 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.280
 Here you have a wheel where 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.720
 you can operate very comfortably directly 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.139
 that means you can continue to switch the transmitter 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.389
 and regulate the volume 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.490
 in addition to the automatic 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.060
 volume adjustment the 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.060
 speed-dependent works 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:45.349
 the radio is supplemented with the model 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:49.580
 by extra connection contemporary for usb 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:52.760
 or jack connector to over 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.710
 cellphone or ipod also the one would like 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.979
 to be able to do music during the ride 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.240
 There are many at the 1200 rt 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.400
 possibilities the vehicle too 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.020
 individualize 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.060
 who is looking for a machine in the 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.130
 category has decided by work often 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.010
 already very complete 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.440
 get a vehicle 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:15.169
 who still looks for special things or 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.560
 on tours is usually supplemented 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.120
 through a topcase just more 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.389
 storage space there are two 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.250
 variants and further gladly taken 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.320
 at the machines are normal 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.830
 still cylinder protection project were unfortunately 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:34.219
 not installed here or just engine 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.289
 Protection bar ordered via accessory 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.600
 can be 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:41.530
 otherwise, the machine 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.830
 little tuning or tuning variants 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.990
 necessary who needed for 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:51.130
 Vehicles from the r 1200 rt power 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:54.820
 which can be interested already from one 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:57.430
 price of about 11,000 euros 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.490
 the twelve wonderful ones started in the 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.830
 year 2005 is still up to date 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.490
 small retouching technical and 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.860
 optical sea ​​seat 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.720
