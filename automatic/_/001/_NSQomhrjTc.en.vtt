00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
 hérault sport with her basketball and the defeat of the csp last night at roanne 66 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.740
 at 78 e the csp lost to fifth place 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.839
 is there a severe defeat and yet they shone in the second 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.910
 part of the match their best outdoor performance since the beginning 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.640
 of the season 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.289
 explanations with France 3-lyon 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:22.780
 - limoges last night 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.880
 history the world upside down 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.869
 the rouennais in white by winning match in front of their audience 78 66 twelve 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.010
 points of difference all the same 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.330
 a victory maybe 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.300
 but for the master artificer jean-denys choulet has reached sufficient 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.430
 I'm not very happy because I think we did not do a very good 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.130
 match 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.890
 I think we were very permissive at the defensive level 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.160
 especially on the outdoor players plates 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.660
 the om is doing it because between libourne then walk either but i'm not 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.090
 very happy I understand them the boards not hear the world's the 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.520
 defender because I believe he is very happy with him 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.950
 of the match but also we take it bigger and bigger for the mid-tempo 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.670
 when we have a foundation for women 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.980
 the whites 2009 about them all the first part of the match 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.159
 but they are quickly disputed the recovery by limougeauds 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.420
 remember that late August 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.210
 morgan stanley who did his job 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.190
 the pressure solution five montpellier clubs of which they are members of 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.290
 the team and that's me it was a little tense compared to our 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.830
 last home defeat in the atmosphere would be the defense that 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.460
 like a ramp evening 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.409
 Sunday did not deserve 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.619
 the promoted had demonstrated interesting qualities of play for a young person 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.240
 team 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.259
 still need to find a cruising pace and civil remedies 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.840
 to gain confidence 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.130
 we had a good match 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.079
 we can even rather a very good match we have a passage in the first quarter 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.610
 time that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.610
 novelty a little bit of what we lose some balloons for 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.660
 a study that with experience some control may not have 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.610
 afraid of them in this context 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.820
 so we can not really get past and do them 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.820
 doubt to make him doubt a little more 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.670
 in the 12th shot ii eluana third who cries like what last night 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.560
 it was really 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.130
 the world upside down 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.310
 off 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.070
 and this defeat we have more the csp at the 12th place of the pro championship at 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.090
 with eight points in front of Lyon 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.030
 in relaying Poitiers and Vichy limougeauds are three points from 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.329
 shuler is the current leader 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.150
 we always accept fact also on the side of phillies dci lignières 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.849
 on the move at 20 64 to 46 but she let herself end up at the 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.249
 fourth place in the league in women's league 2 at three points in lyon then 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.079
 the leading team
