 and bel channel attribute 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.650
 lattice value 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.550
 four zeros so 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.490
 what does this mean 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.330

 this network has not been sold to seagulls 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.300
 a definite answer to our text 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.190
 let's say we lead the court 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.190
 blue 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.710
 the same however further 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.140

 by you 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.139
 table from the project m 5 GB 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.139
 dot com 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.869
 for example to write 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.869
 red you two beds 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.090
 value 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.640
 hee hee 4 0 a 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.640
 So let's move on to our codes. 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 let's save and check 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 our page 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.080
 transition our holiday updating 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 as you can see the text appeared and no answer 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.720
 let's ask 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.020
 those who are heading and 2 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.610
 multiple 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.050
 find my eyes here are the data I saw 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.450
 its not always 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 5 he 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.740
 to you

 and closing fom counts 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.469
 save browser check 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.859
 update the penny page those who she 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.529
 of red color 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.449
 now let's consider others 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.849
 attributes in 5 ha fund 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.209
 go to lj 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.569
 and set the headset of our text 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.649
 she has otbÑ‘m shares 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.489
 what is a headset headset is sheriff 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.709
 our text 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 let's say Mona type of Cortiev 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.619
 one of my favorite naughty 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.239
 guarded 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.509
 citizens' trust 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.619
 penny game dayan in this font 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.959
 move in the peel or give green size 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.129
 of our 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.659
 Spector 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.939
 however drift away 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.649
 let's say 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.299
 here 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.569
 right 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.949
 six kinds 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:17.970
 save 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.109
 and see 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.199
 as you can see our pitch has become more 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.309
 we dismantled this fund 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:29.579
 let's say we want to keep text 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.379
 whose answer is not specified 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.719
 using an additional 5 sq. 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:34.869
 and attributes 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.139
 we have any answer 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.899
 for this we need 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.899
 tags Babel news attribute 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.399
 equally 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.399
 and in the same pattern the lattice 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:52.779
 fired green 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.779
 guarded 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.909
 update our browser 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.919
 page in the browser more precisely and as we see 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.989
 those who have become our answer 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.109
 so let's move on to the last part 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.379
 of our video tutorials 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.359
 dear 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.359
 in our country 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.979
 lipstick color gives bg color attacks 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.759
 Agayev shelter 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.809
 novel 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:28.270
 well, what a smart 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.270
 retro fm let's say we enter 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:37.979
 he 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.289
 earlier earlier he 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.719
 check 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.819
 specifics 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.349
 blue 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.740
 He is our country n and who here with it 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.740
 let's better yellow pattaya 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.009
 guarding 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.180
 check 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.860
 so that's nice 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.669
 that's all 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.970
 so meeting the following video tutorials
