Michelle what are you up to that put the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.549 
Michelle what are you up to that put the
layers<00:00:12.090> together<00:00:12.420> already<00:00:12.870> Michelle<00:00:13.320> meant

for<00:00:13.920> piping<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.580> roses<00:00:15.030> over<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.420> cake<00:00:15.660> as

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
for piping the roses over the cake as

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.260 
for piping the roses over the cake as
you<00:00:16.859> can<00:00:16.980> see<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.279> started<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> sides

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
you can see I started on the sides

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.790 
you can see I started on the sides
because<00:00:18.840> they're<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> little<00:00:19.199> bit<00:00:19.350> trickier

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
because they're a little bit trickier

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.529 
because they're a little bit trickier
and<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.039> easy<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.460> sit<00:00:20.789> down<00:00:21.000> when<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.390> do

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and it's easy to sit down when you do

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.890 
and it's easy to sit down when you do
those<00:00:21.779> when<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.800> get<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> top<00:00:23.660> just<00:00:24.660> work

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
those when you get to the top just work

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.050 
those when you get to the top just work
out<00:00:25.109> how<00:00:25.410> many<00:00:25.470> roses<00:00:26.160> fit<00:00:26.430> across<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> top<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
out how many roses fit across the top I

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.990 
out how many roses fit across the top I
found<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.660> two<00:00:27.900> layers<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.740> roses<00:00:29.220> work<00:00:29.730> well

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
found that two layers of roses work well

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.990 
found that two layers of roses work well
on<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.570> size<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.109> cake<00:00:31.320> pan<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.700> need<00:00:32.850> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
on this size of cake pan and you need to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.209 
on this size of cake pan and you need to
just<00:00:33.180> pipe<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> firm<00:00:34.050> hand<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.649> basically

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
just pipe with a firm hand and basically

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.520 
just pipe with a firm hand and basically
let<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.489> icing<00:00:35.850> fall<00:00:36.390> onto<00:00:36.750> itself<00:00:37.170> don't

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
let the icing fall onto itself don't

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.190 
let the icing fall onto itself don't
force<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.430> they<00:00:39.090> should<00:00:39.149> gently<00:00:39.629> overlap

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
force it and they should gently overlap

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.280 
force it and they should gently overlap
and<00:00:40.590> fill<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> gaps<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.930> just<00:00:42.930> work<00:00:43.110> out

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and fill the gaps and just work out

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.130 
and fill the gaps and just work out
where<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> finish<00:00:43.980> each<00:00:44.430> each<00:00:44.879> rose<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.809> try

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
where you finish each each rose and try

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.569 
where you finish each each rose and try
and<00:00:46.260> finish<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> same<00:00:46.829> spot<00:00:47.399> for

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
and finish in the same spot for

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.100 
and finish in the same spot for
continuity<00:00:49.100> gently<00:00:50.100> turn<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.430> around<00:00:51.020> and<00:00:52.020> we

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
continuity gently turn it around and we

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.530 
continuity gently turn it around and we
start<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.590> another<00:00:52.770> one

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.840 

practice<00:00:59.320> makes<00:00:59.560> perfect<00:00:59.680> with<00:01:00.310> this<00:01:00.460> your

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
practice makes perfect with this your

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.810 
practice makes perfect with this your
first<00:01:01.120> couple<00:01:01.360> might<00:01:01.750> be<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.490> little<00:01:03.490> tricky

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
first couple might be a little tricky

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.550 
first couple might be a little tricky
but<00:01:03.970> you<00:01:04.090> can<00:01:04.120> easily<00:01:04.510> scrape<00:01:05.080> them<00:01:05.260> off<00:01:05.379> with

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
but you can easily scrape them off with

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.740 
but you can easily scrape them off with
a<00:01:05.650> spatula<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.370> try<00:01:06.760> again

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.720 

consider<00:01:14.350> Michelle<00:01:14.680> what<00:01:14.890> type<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.130> icing<00:01:15.610> are

it's a beautiful consistency to pipe

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.490 
it's a beautiful consistency to pipe
with<00:01:24.160> always<00:01:25.000> try<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.270> pipe<00:01:25.540> closest<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.320> you

if you lean over the cake you'll end up

if you lean over the cake you'll end up
with<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.240> little<00:01:28.450> crooked<00:01:28.660> rose<00:01:29.050> it's<00:01:29.770> not<00:01:29.950> a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
with a little crooked rose it's not a

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.130 
with a little crooked rose it's not a
good<00:01:30.190> look<00:01:32.700> inside<00:01:33.700> we<00:01:34.150> also<00:01:34.330> have<00:01:34.630> layers<00:01:34.870> of

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
good look inside we also have layers of

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.260 
good look inside we also have layers of
the<00:01:35.290> buttercream<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:36.070> we<00:01:36.550> also<00:01:36.730> have<00:01:37.030> some

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
the buttercream and we also have some

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.360 
the buttercream and we also have some
dark<00:01:37.570> chocolate<00:01:37.870> that's<00:01:38.530> drizzled<00:01:38.950> over<00:01:39.070> that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
dark chocolate that's drizzled over that

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.740 
dark chocolate that's drizzled over that
and<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:39.670> think<00:01:39.730> there's<00:01:40.030> about<00:01:40.120> three<00:01:40.450> or<00:01:40.540> four

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
and I think there's about three or four

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.950 
and I think there's about three or four
like<00:01:41.020> layers<00:01:41.350> inside<00:01:41.830> yeah<00:01:42.760> there's<00:01:43.060> some<00:01:43.330> cut

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
like layers inside yeah there's some cut

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.630 
like layers inside yeah there's some cut
the<00:01:44.050> cake<00:01:44.260> into<00:01:44.470> four<00:01:44.800> layers<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.430> there<00:01:45.550> are

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
the cake into four layers and there are

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.400 
the cake into four layers and there are
three<00:01:45.850> layers<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.180> buttercream<00:01:46.660> so<00:01:47.080> it's<00:01:47.229> a

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
three layers of buttercream so it's a

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.050 
three layers of buttercream so it's a
special<00:01:47.979> occasion<00:01:48.430> take<00:01:49.150> this<00:01:49.420> one<00:01:50.910> and<00:01:51.910> you

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
special occasion take this one and you

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.820 
special occasion take this one and you
can<00:01:52.210> see<00:01:52.390> how<00:01:52.540> easy<00:01:52.900> it<00:01:52.960> is<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.290> do<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.710> I<00:01:53.770> think

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
can see how easy it is to do and I think

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.060 
can see how easy it is to do and I think
everyone<00:01:54.490> at<00:01:54.520> home<00:01:54.790> will<00:01:54.910> be<00:01:55.030> able<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.360> do<00:01:55.540> this

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.469 

just<00:02:00.070> gently<00:02:00.400> rotate<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.210> let<00:02:01.360> the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
just gently rotate and let the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.380
