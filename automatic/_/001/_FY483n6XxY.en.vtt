best<00:00:36.660> combo<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> world<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> would<00:00:37.860> be

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
best combo in the world and you would be

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.069

right<00:00:39.079> because<00:00:40.079> he<00:00:40.140> gives<00:00:40.290> us<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:40.829> kill

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
right because he gives us not one kill

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.420 
right because he gives us not one kill
but<00:00:44.239> two<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.960> then<00:00:46.649> show<00:00:46.800> gap<00:00:47.010> comes<00:00:47.190> forward
