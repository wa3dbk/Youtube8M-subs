00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.060
I want to show what I got.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.520
It's a storage barrel.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.520
It comes with a pump and here is the barrel.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:44.840
It is pretty sturdy, it's a tough plastic
barrel.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.580
Water storage supply, it's from Shelf Reliance.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.260
55 gallon water storage.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.340
I got it from Costco, Costco Whole sale and
I got it Costco online.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.720
Here is a photo of it with the pump.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.680
The components and stuff are really sturdy.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:13.010
It's got more pieces to it that connect.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:22.590
Yeah all the pieces attaches so it can go
in here so that water can be pumped out.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.119
It's got a water filter, it's got a pump.

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.399
Arrows.

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:47.200
It's got measurements that go up all the way
up.. starting from 5 gallons all the way up

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.310
to 55 gallons.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.580
Right now it's..the ocean is taking over.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.490
The Pacific Ocean is right over there and
uh it brings in the marine layer.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.179
The marine layer cools things off it brings
in a nice breeze.

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.539
And I want to show the tree here this tree
is so dense, I love this tree so much.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.470
The food and they haven't touched it, I don't
know they haven't touched it yet.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.160
They ate up the bird food I put in the first
time I put this thing up.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.319
This is a new bird feeder.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.450
The birds ended up eating all of the food,
you know the first time I filled it up.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.069
And I don't know if it is taking them a little
longer or what but look I have little meal

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.650
worms that I bought and they are dried worms
that are for birds, you know for birds, in

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.390
the bird food section so I just put them in
with the bird seed because I think they would

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.390
enjoy that.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.390
I love this tree so much... and I have it
secured, I have it tied several times so that

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.390
it is safe.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.750
Let me show the tree, the tree, I love this
tree so much.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.790
Giant.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.560
Love this tree.
