00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.080
 hello everyone is you die of nardÃ² 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.849
 nothing 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.699
 and in this video besides giving you the new one 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.390
 version of the origins but lancer I wanted 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.869
 show you how to install minecraft on 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.330
 short minecraft seen that of users 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.039
 they had problems and I thought of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.019
 make a video of it 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.460
 then to demonstrate how to install it 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.430
 part of the clean installation then 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 open a random folder go up 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.930
 percent by 8 percent and I cancel 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.770
 minecraft stitch folder so I will have to re 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.489
 download everything from scratch ok could 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.539
 to be gone 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.219
 yes ok then this lancer and how to 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.539
 I will usually give you version for windows and 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.109
 macs that are already covering between being 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.090
 loaded on mediafire and so what 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.229
 I will install here 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.159
 these files such as forge and codes that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.890
 still and not enough items these two 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.760
 note writers would be practically the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.090
 mode that I decided to install 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.189
 prove that ford works and this is 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.299
 a secondary mod that will be precisely for 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.369
 make this work so it had to 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.369
 download it in the description you will find 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.670
 this link here on this page 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.470
 need the force downloads with 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.880
 various of minecraft issue its fin 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.710
 where they arrived maybe there will also be 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.140
 something else down here I have 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.829
 downloaded the recommended 1.7 point 10 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.310
 or this downloadable link installer 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.049
 in short he had an ex viabile and the page 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.399
 of the fashion that wants to install in 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.450
 this case will be fine anyway 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.890
 if you want I leave you all discretionary 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.829
 this 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.360
 we will see however we leave we have the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.640
 lancer which will obviously open in 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.430
 small because on the 4 k 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.610
 the fishing ingv has a bit of a crap 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.520
 let's put a user name 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:12.370
 fifth simone ok then let's start with 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:19.080
 make us a profile with 1 point 7.10 that 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:22.900
 it would be these h we put a point 7.10 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.180
 just don't save profile let's do a 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.440
 play now I'll cut the part from a 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.850
 place so the video will be a little bit 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:38.230
 faster so it has finished 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:41.370
 we wait a moment longer and should 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.370
 starting the game 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.410
 ok perfect has finished part game in 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.970
 these tiny window for fault 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.860
 of 4 k 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.540
 ok let's go to single player and create 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.400
 new world just to try 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.810
 let's get creative if we want 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.550
 simply create a world 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.330
 so much to see that fashion is not 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:08.170
 still installed open inventory will be 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:12.010
 the inventory at the worst of minecraft is 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.239
 no ocean we trust minecraft now 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.090
 we can install these two then 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:22.140
 let's copy all two codes in here and 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:28.360
 there fashions and we bring them in the folder for 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:30.160
 a hundred from the fight for a hundred or lose 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.480
 the minecraft tip here will not be there 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.269
 fashions folder and then we create it 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:41.440
 we mods with the final axis I recommend 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:44.950
 and we put the two bikes in here one 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.989
 done this before starting the launcher 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.900
 maybe we also include forces that maybe 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.299
 agrees to start fashions 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.010
 so let's go to install client 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.480
 let's leave the path here as you know 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.340
 the point folder will already be pointed 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.400
 minecraft if you do not do it 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.170
 you no doubt we give ok and here begins the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.070
 download operations that will cut for 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.540
 this ok now that we can finish 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.750
 give him this window waiting for us 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.580
 says he installed the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.580
 ford here we can vr lancer 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.290
 but now we will not have to select the 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.479
 profile we had selected before 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.150
 that would be how we can play that 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.270
 it would be this but below it will be 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.449
 molds we select peace generals 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.830
 put the user name and when ford has 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.910
 selected that we can also put 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:41.440
 wanting home ford 1.7 point 10 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.760
 we recognize it even though it is also 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.600
 if, however, he will also tell us here and there 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.600
 we can give him plug in 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.550
 in this way we installed in 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.560
 correct way forge and now we will see it here 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.160
 is downloading secondary files that 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:07.090
 he needs it opens up missing 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:10.030
 only on the standard window and if 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:16.539
 let's go on the world we created 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:18.780
 first if you want to charge thanks 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.510
 to have dominated us by your performance 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.430
 let's go to the inventory and see that the 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.630
 fashion installed in short now you are 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:31.120
 loading the list of blocks just 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.349
 will want to charge are but no 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.130
 wait what we are creative in this 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.130
 here ok to the company 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.420
 let's drag blocks at random 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.920
 however we see that it works and therefore 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.110
 this also for all the other fashions 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.230
 in short, if you still have questions, it will be enough 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.650
 that you write me in the comments below and 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.650
 have fun
