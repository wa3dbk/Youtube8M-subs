00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.670
 partly divided because each 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.860
 your opinion 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.630
 the star has admitted that she is trying not 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.670
 talk in general about politics not 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.620
 family not with friends conflicts between 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.020
 countries allowed a coldness between 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.850
 close people will be a long time by the way 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.830
 besides performances the singer is engaged 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.630

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.830
 depends on your goal how much it is 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.230
 scale and

 and if you want to quit everything in her opinion 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.370
 it is best to let go of everything and go there 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.090
 where there are no televisions and mobile 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.250
