00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
about I think 15 to 20 minutes and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.560 
about I think 15 to 20 minutes and
normally<00:00:40.489> what<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.610> do<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:42.180> take<00:00:42.360> off

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
normally what we do just take off

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.229 
normally what we do just take off
whatever<00:00:43.100> varnish<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.850> cleans<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
whatever varnish we have it cleans a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.889 
whatever varnish we have it cleans a
nail<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:46.219> in<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.370> salon<00:00:47.820> or<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.420> home<00:00:48.629> some

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
nail and in a salon or at home some

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.810 
nail and in a salon or at home some
people<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> fries<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.680> soak<00:00:50.100> their<00:00:50.309> now

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
people like the fries you soak their now

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.970

in warm water and soap

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.220 
in warm water and soap
