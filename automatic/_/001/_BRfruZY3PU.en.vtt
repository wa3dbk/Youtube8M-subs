00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.930
 So now we're going to network together 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:11.660
 we need cheese in it 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:16.529
 salted paw on three eggs cut 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.359
 some milk salt a pan and a little bit of milk 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.939
 of course a little oil for the flag 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.880
 first of all, the cheese and the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.730
 Cut turkey sliced turkey 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.930
 cold cuts and cheese in salzlake this 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 cut small 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.590
 now it's different so now it's up to the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:49.649
 Eggs are best used 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:52.460
 dish beaters beat the eggs at all 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.460
 once in there 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.880
 then they will be short for now 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.880
 beaten 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.520
 then comes a small gulp of milk 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.190
 The milk is for that purpose 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.510
 gets a bit quieter and not so firm 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:41.020
 This will be something with pepper 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:42.240
 season with salt once and may be good 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.500
 be that 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.020
 Of course you can parsley now 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.210
 do it in there or chive or no matter 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:56.380
 what you wanted as you like it 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:02:00.580
 mix up a bit and then it works 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.070
 is also about the egg as it was as far 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.830
 You can test that one 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.840
 little of that a few splashes there 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.070
 enter and then you see the game 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.340
 gets hot or you take your hand short 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.320
 then notice also that it is hot 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.049
 will or not yet the temperature 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:24.130
 has the one you want to have then you go 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:26.410
 that one was to be very close before 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.720
 given some oil 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.470
 Please not too much about that else in the oil 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.160
 Floats that we leave ten now 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:41.070
 seconds in the pan and then come 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.070
 also the remaining ingredients 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.040
 I'm still short term 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.470
 decided for it 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.300
 I'll give you a little bit more 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.730
 nutmeg it a bit 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:12.870
 tastes better 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:17.280
 so now we give the cheese to and 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:22.709
 once cut the turkeys nicely 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.170
 distribute that everywhere is something beautiful 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.510
 the sheep cheese is through the heat 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.489
 it is so easily melted on and 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:39.030
 then when it is still hot to net is 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:41.880
 Super delicious in the network is important 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.840
 Still to say should be on a low level 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.350
 be made 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.470
 oh yes we leave something else now 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.959
 in here and then it will be uneven 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.310
 turned around, respectively 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.110
 folded that is better than that 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.209
 turn around because heat is now the ingredients 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.280
 then it was once on top 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:06.030
 and then it's done so far 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:08.400
 that is the finished around nice please do 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.070
 you still like it when it's warm 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.700
 because the whole feta cheese is there 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.000
 in it is 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.489
 that is melted and from the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.030
 consistency is a little bit super soft 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.620
 I now have cucumbers still ahead again 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.350
 coag added to it 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.910
 because he is involved now and a lot 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.450
 fun while copying and up to 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.450
 next time
