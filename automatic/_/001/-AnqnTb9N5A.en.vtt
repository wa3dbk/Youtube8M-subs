00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.980
 here 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.730

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.750
 next to 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.790
 and this 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:19.330
 to see what happens 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.010

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.010

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.390
 and to me yes 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.210
 something tells me that this is going to be 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.210
 extremely inefficient 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.430
