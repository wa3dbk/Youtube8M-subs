00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.390 

it's<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> hard<00:00:17.250> question<00:00:17.840> in<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.019> way<00:00:19.400> mainly

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
it's a hard question in a way mainly

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.589 
it's a hard question in a way mainly
when<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> paint<00:00:21.689> something<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.730> like<00:00:23.730> people<00:00:24.359> to

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
when I paint something I like people to

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.290 
when I paint something I like people to
make<00:00:25.019> their<00:00:25.679> own<00:00:25.710> story<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.699> when<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.089> look

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
make their own story so when they look

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.929 
make their own story so when they look
at<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.140> CI<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.460> big<00:00:29.669> animal

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
at it or it's like CI it's a big animal

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.760 
at it or it's like CI it's a big animal
yes<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.599> big<00:00:30.779> animal<00:00:31.109> or<00:00:32.840> its<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.310> don't

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
yes it's a big animal or its I don't

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.040 
yes it's a big animal or its I don't
it's<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:37.980> necessarily<00:00:38.970> about<00:00:39.090> one<00:00:39.600> meaning

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
it's not necessarily about one meaning

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.090 
it's not necessarily about one meaning
or<00:00:40.550> but<00:00:42.080> people<00:00:43.080> are<00:00:43.200> like<00:00:43.380> this<00:00:43.590> they<00:00:43.860> give

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
or but people are like this they give

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.130 
or but people are like this they give
things<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.610> meaning<00:00:44.970> so<00:00:45.240> I<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.630> in<00:00:45.990> every

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
things a meaning so I think in every

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.840 
things a meaning so I think in every
culture<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.340> everybody<00:00:47.640> different

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
culture and for everybody different

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.400 
culture and for everybody different
certain<00:00:50.850> animals<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.540> a<00:00:51.570> certain<00:00:52.050> meaning

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
certain animals have a certain meaning

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
certain animals have a certain meaning
and<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.680> think<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.130> interesting<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.060> then

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and I think this is interesting and then

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
and I think this is interesting and then
when<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.570> place<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.080> at<00:00:55.230> certain<00:00:55.680> places<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
when you place it at certain places it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.940 
when you place it at certain places it
gets<00:00:57.150> a<00:00:57.330> meaning<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.590> me<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:58.920> I

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
gets a meaning because for me when I

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.100 
gets a meaning because for me when I
painted<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.000> didn't<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:00.870> this

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
painted this I didn't know what this

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.920 
painted this I didn't know what this
building<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.280> now<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.030> heard<00:01:03.450> this<00:01:03.720> is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
building was for now I heard this is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.800 
building was for now I heard this is
like<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> social<00:01:04.650> service<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.690> end

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
like the social service so in the end

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.080 
like the social service so in the end
it's<00:01:07.110> almost<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.800> political<00:01:08.640> meaning

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it's almost like a political meaning

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.110 
it's almost like a political meaning
without<00:01:09.390> even<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.410> a<00:01:10.440> being<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.010> people<00:01:11.400> can

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
without even what a being so people can

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.310 
without even what a being so people can
give<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.900> little<00:01:13.860> bit<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.640> way<00:01:15.320> definitely

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
give it a little bit this way definitely

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.690 
give it a little bit this way definitely
what<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.800> is<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.190> like<00:01:19.040> my<00:01:20.040> work<00:01:20.310> does<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
what it is it's like my work does a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.930 
what it is it's like my work does a
little<00:01:21.150> bit<00:01:21.300> about<00:01:22.790> nature<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.820> about<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
little bit about nature and about the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.010 
little bit about nature and about the
civilization<00:01:26.940> where<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.270> live<00:01:27.510> in<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:29.060> in<00:01:30.060> my

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
civilization where we live in and in my

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.830 
civilization where we live in and in my
opinion<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.130> does<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> little<00:01:32.760> bit<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.240> okay

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
opinion it does a little bit like okay

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.870 
opinion it does a little bit like okay
we<00:01:33.990> got<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> lot<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.500> problems<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.370> for

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
we got a lot of problems like for

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.270 
we got a lot of problems like for
instance<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.420> rats<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.170> city<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.100> we

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
instance with rats in the city but if we

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.980 
instance with rats in the city but if we
got<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:39.229> weasel<00:01:40.700> he<00:01:41.700> would<00:01:41.880> eat<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.479> nature

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
got a weasel he would eat it so nature

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.600 
got a weasel he would eat it so nature
takes<00:01:43.470> care<00:01:43.800> of<00:01:43.830> itself<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.659> maybe

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
takes care of itself so this is maybe

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.899 
takes care of itself so this is maybe
one<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.140> biggest<00:01:49.220> meanings<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.400> myself

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
one of the biggest meanings for myself

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.300 
one of the biggest meanings for myself
there<00:01:51.510> is<00:01:51.690> but<00:01:52.260> then<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.920> give<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
there is but then you can give it a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.969 
there is but then you can give it a
thousands<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.150> hundreds<00:01:54.540> meanings<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.440> don't

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
thousands and hundreds meanings I don't

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.570 
thousands and hundreds meanings I don't
think<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.370> so<00:01:56.610> important<00:01:57.409> but<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.920> kind<00:01:59.460> of

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
think it's so important but it's kind of

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.760 
think it's so important but it's kind of
important<00:02:00.180> people<00:02:00.330> actually<00:02:00.900> think<00:02:01.170> about<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
important people actually think about it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.580 
important people actually think about it
and<00:02:01.979> give<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.369> their<00:02:02.670> own<00:02:02.700> when<00:02:03.090> meaning

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and give it their own when meaning

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.830 
and give it their own when meaning
in<00:02:05.340> my<00:02:05.579> opinion<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.390> really<00:02:06.570> positive

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
in my opinion it's a really positive

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.570 
in my opinion it's a really positive
thing<00:02:08.750> maybe<00:02:09.750> somebody<00:02:10.080> else<00:02:10.349> see<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.160> really

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
thing maybe somebody else see it really

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.210 
thing maybe somebody else see it really
really<00:02:12.269> differently<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.500> that's

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
really differently but I think that's

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.430 
really differently but I think that's
the<00:02:14.459> interesting<00:02:14.760> thing<00:02:15.209> people<00:02:15.840> look<00:02:16.379> to

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
the interesting thing people look to

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.759 
the interesting thing people look to
something<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.420> way<00:02:18.569> they<00:02:18.870> are<00:02:19.050> so

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
something and see it the way they are so

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.220 
something and see it the way they are so
if<00:02:20.129> you<00:02:20.489> are<00:02:20.580> really<00:02:20.849> not<00:02:21.209> positive<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.019> will

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
if you are really not positive you will

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.740 
if you are really not positive you will
see<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.680> really<00:02:23.220> dark<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.299> are<00:02:24.450> really

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
see this really dark if you are really

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.530 
see this really dark if you are really
positive<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:26.370> will<00:02:26.549> see<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.910> as<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.180> really

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
positive you will see this as a really

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.710 
positive you will see this as a really
positive<00:02:27.870> thing<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.530> think<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.190> mainly

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
positive thing I think this is mainly

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.800 
positive thing I think this is mainly
the<00:02:30.720> interesting<00:02:31.349> about<00:02:31.590> making<00:02:32.129> visible

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
the interesting about making visible

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.640 
the interesting about making visible
visual<00:02:34.819> paintings<00:02:35.819> drawings<00:02:36.120> whatever<00:02:37.110> it

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
visual paintings drawings whatever it

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.309 
visual paintings drawings whatever it
get<00:02:38.190> got<00:02:38.640> an<00:02:38.819> impression<00:02:39.329> on<00:02:39.420> people<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.989> it's
