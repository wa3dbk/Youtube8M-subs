00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that's something to be concerned about

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.340 
that's something to be concerned about
you<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.549> your<00:01:05.729> thing<00:01:05.939> might<00:01:06.090> fall<00:01:06.330> off<00:01:06.479> um<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
you know your thing might fall off um I

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.440 
you know your thing might fall off um I
was<00:01:07.799> probably<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:08.220> careful<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.820> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
was probably not very careful with it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.570 
was probably not very careful with it
still<00:01:10.170> works<00:01:10.380> fine<00:01:10.619> powder<00:01:11.130> doesn't<00:01:11.340> fall<00:01:11.549> out

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
still works fine powder doesn't fall out

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.740 
still works fine powder doesn't fall out
or<00:01:11.760> anything

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
or anything

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.899 
or anything
you<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.439> your<00:01:13.619> power<00:01:13.890> button<00:01:14.040> right<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.460> on

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
you have your power button right here on

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.030 
you have your power button right here on
and<00:01:15.090> off<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.390> basically<00:01:15.600> when<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.040> pretty

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and off so basically when it's on pretty

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
and off so basically when it's on pretty
so<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.520> still<00:01:17.700> use<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.030> without<00:01:18.119> battery

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
so you can still use it without battery

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.789 
so you can still use it without battery
basically<00:01:18.960> it'll<00:01:19.320> sound<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.590> normal

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
basically it'll sound like normal

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
basically it'll sound like normal
headphones<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:20.970> wanna<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
headphones you just wanna have the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539 
headphones you just wanna have the
ability<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.080> control<00:01:22.439> your<00:01:22.590> bass<00:01:22.710> sound<00:01:23.040> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
ability to control your bass sound so

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.010

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
when it is on you have this little dial

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.679 
when it is on you have this little dial
right<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.909> where<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.030> turn<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.570> down

right here where you turn it up and down

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.270 
right here where you turn it up and down

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
everything at my computer and I actually

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.960 
everything at my computer and I actually
just<00:01:40.439> started<00:01:40.740> using<00:01:40.920> them<00:01:41.220> while<00:01:41.579> running
