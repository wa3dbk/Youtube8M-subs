there's<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.690> I<00:01:39.900> think<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.350> only<00:01:40.500> reason

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
there's a lot I think the only reason

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.560 
there's a lot I think the only reason
enough<00:01:40.950> made<00:01:41.340> sword<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.420> don't

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
enough made sword is because they don't

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.670 
enough made sword is because they don't
like<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.780> fact<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.050> people<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.440> nodding

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
like the fact that people are nodding

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.790 
like the fact that people are nodding
thumbs<00:01:44.100> well<00:01:45.000> guess<00:01:45.210> what<00:01:45.420> swords<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.440> now<00:01:46.619> be

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
thumbs well guess what swords can now be

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.380
