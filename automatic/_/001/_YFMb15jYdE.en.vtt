00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
this off I've gotta let die off of there

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.590 
this off I've gotta let die off of there
make<00:02:37.980> sure<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.250> clean<00:02:38.459> surface<00:02:38.640> car<00:02:39.060> way<00:02:39.209> and

make sure of a clean surface car way and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.190 
make sure of a clean surface car way and
I<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:40.230> can't<00:02:40.620> have<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.830> 90-degree<00:02:41.840> edge<00:02:42.840> right

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
I just can't have a 90-degree edge right

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.710 
I just can't have a 90-degree edge right
here<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.010> put<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.549> little

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
here so what I do is I put a little

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.910 
here so what I do is I put a little
radius<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:45.900> there<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.110> got<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.380> cut<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.680> down

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
radius on there I got to cut that down

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.150 
radius on there I got to cut that down
so<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.760> filler<00:02:48.510> metal<00:02:48.720> has<00:02:49.049> place<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.560> go<00:02:49.709> so

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
so the filler metal has place to go so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.030 
so the filler metal has place to go so
when<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.340> sand<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.760> down<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.319> polish<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.349> this

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
when I sand it down and polish it this

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.340 
when I sand it down and polish it this
will<00:02:53.190> look<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.459> seamless<00:02:54.019> Park<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.260> when

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
will look like a seamless Park and when

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.069 
will look like a seamless Park and when
I<00:02:55.410> put<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.859> here<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.090> put<00:02:57.269> this<00:02:57.420> and

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
I put this on here and I put this and

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.289 
I put this on here and I put this and

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
powder-coated whenever do stuff like

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.939 
powder-coated whenever do stuff like
this<00:06:00.120> remember<00:06:00.330> safety<00:06:00.690> glasses<00:06:01.020> safety<00:06:01.889> is

this remember safety glasses safety is

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.080 
this remember safety glasses safety is
the<00:06:02.009> most<00:06:02.099> important<00:06:02.639> thing<00:06:02.729> you<00:06:02.849> can't

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
the most important thing you can't

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.909 
the most important thing you can't
replace<00:06:03.330> your<00:06:03.509> eyes<00:06:03.690> and<00:06:04.080> hearing<00:06:04.800> protection

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
replace your eyes and hearing protection

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.529 
replace your eyes and hearing protection
you<00:06:05.520> don't<00:06:05.669> lose<00:06:05.849> any<00:06:06.000> more<00:06:06.060> hearing<00:06:06.449> you

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
you don't lose any more hearing you

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.820 
you don't lose any more hearing you
already<00:06:06.780> have<00:06:06.960> and<00:06:07.139> I've<00:06:07.229> already<00:06:07.379> lost<00:06:07.650> a<00:06:07.800> lot

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
already have and I've already lost a lot

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:15.050 
already have and I've already lost a lot
so<00:06:08.250> hearing<00:06:08.669> protection<00:06:08.940> is<00:06:09.090> important<00:06:14.060> so

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
so hearing protection is important so

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.730 
so hearing protection is important so

really<00:06:42.090> cool<00:06:42.330> a<00:06:42.630> lot<00:06:43.500> better<00:06:43.860> than<00:06:44.069> just

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
really cool a lot better than just

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.399 
really cool a lot better than just
having<00:06:44.460> to<00:06:45.060> throttle<00:06:45.449> bodies<00:06:45.690> mounted<00:06:46.020> on<00:06:46.110> top

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.129 
and having regular carburation in there

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.510 
and having regular carburation in there
looks<00:06:53.129> pretty<00:06:53.190> pretty<00:06:53.520> cool<00:06:53.699> so<00:06:53.969> far<00:06:55.490> like<00:06:56.490> I

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
looks pretty pretty cool so far like I

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.980 
looks pretty pretty cool so far like I
said<00:06:56.819> next<00:06:57.000> step<00:06:57.180> would<00:06:57.270> be<00:06:57.330> powder<00:06:57.690> coat

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
said next step would be powder coat

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.019 
said next step would be powder coat
which<00:06:58.770> means<00:06:58.979> I<00:06:59.039> got<00:06:59.159> to<00:06:59.250> be<00:06:59.340> blessed<00:06:59.610> at<00:06:59.789> first

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:00.029 
which means I got to be blessed at first

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:03.170 
which means I got to be blessed at first
and<00:07:00.960> be<00:07:01.139> ready<00:07:01.289> to<00:07:01.379> mount<00:07:01.909> work<00:07:02.909> on<00:07:03.029> the

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
and be ready to mount work on the

and be ready to mount work on the
cylinder<00:07:03.449> heads<00:07:03.690> right<00:07:03.840> now<00:07:03.900> so<00:07:04.319> my<00:07:04.440> next

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
cylinder heads right now so my next

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.510 
cylinder heads right now so my next
video<00:07:04.830> should<00:07:04.979> be<00:07:05.039> putting<00:07:05.340> the<00:07:05.400> motor

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
video should be putting the motor

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:14.350 
video should be putting the motor
together
