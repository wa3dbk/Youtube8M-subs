right<00:03:26.890> here<00:03:26.920> really<00:03:27.430> hard<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.760> defend<00:03:28.060> this<00:03:28.269> is

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
right here really hard to defend this is

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.539 
right here really hard to defend this is
a<00:03:28.450> really<00:03:28.690> great<00:03:28.840> money<00:03:29.170> plate<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.590> use<00:03:29.829> as<00:03:30.519> a

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
a really great money plate to use as a

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.330 
a really great money plate to use as a
base<00:03:30.940> play<00:03:31.269> for<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.959> board<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:32.980> Green<00:03:33.190> Bay

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
base play for the board of the Green Bay

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.270 
base play for the board of the Green Bay
Packer<00:03:33.610> scheme<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.840> I<00:03:34.900> think<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.530> run<00:03:35.980> is

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
Packer scheme so and I think this run is

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.300 
Packer scheme so and I think this run is
really<00:03:36.640> unique<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.390> one<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.959> things<00:03:38.019> that

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
really unique and one of the things that

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.680 
really unique and one of the things that
kind<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.370> gives<00:03:39.610> a<00:03:39.790> handset<00:03:40.120> off<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.269> little<00:03:40.540> bit

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
kind of gives a handset off a little bit

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.720 
kind of gives a handset off a little bit
faster<00:03:40.900> than<00:03:41.260> other<00:03:41.380> halfback<00:03:41.590> draws<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.670> you

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
faster than other halfback draws so you

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.420 
faster than other halfback draws so you
have<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.120> really<00:03:43.480> fast<00:03:43.870> running<00:03:44.799> back<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.280> can

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
have a really fast running back you can

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.130 
have a really fast running back you can
go<00:03:45.549> ahead<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.790> attack<00:03:46.180> real<00:03:46.570> quick<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.079> then

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
go ahead and attack real quick and then

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.840 
go ahead and attack real quick and then
go<00:03:47.410> with<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.620> screen<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.190> mini<00:03:48.400> scream<00:03:48.700> that

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
go with a screen the mini scream that

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.550 
go with a screen the mini scream that
came<00:03:49.060> out<00:03:49.239> in<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.540> then<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.049> could<00:03:50.200> go<00:03:50.380> and

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
came out in and then you could go and

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.960 
came out in and then you could go and
come<00:03:50.739> out<00:03:50.890> with<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:51.070> feel<00:03:51.310> riding<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.670> flats

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
come out with a feel riding the flats

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.000 
come out with a feel riding the flats
which<00:03:52.570> makes<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.079> play<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.470> really<00:03:53.829> powerful
