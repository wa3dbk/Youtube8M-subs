is one two three or it may help to think

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
is one two three or it may help to think
how<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> follows<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.550> words<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:36.449> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
how it follows the words because the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.530 
how it follows the words because the

so that ignoring that open 5th string
for<00:02:58.970> now<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.120> get<00:02:59.420> this

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.750 

but<00:03:08.560> before<00:03:08.830> we<00:03:08.920> get<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.220> those<00:03:09.340> let's<00:03:09.580> have<00:03:09.730> a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
but before we get to those let's have a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.120 
but before we get to those let's have a
look<00:03:10.030> at<00:03:10.120> how<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.300> introduction<00:03:10.960> works<00:03:11.170> here

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
look at how the introduction works here

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:33.479 
look at how the introduction works here
it<00:03:12.250> is<00:03:12.370> first<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.850> all<00:03:12.910> played<00:03:13.180> through

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.709 

then<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.609> moves<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.879> the<00:03:35.030> first<00:03:35.299> chord<00:03:35.599> of<00:03:35.689> the

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:35.719 
then it moves to the first chord of the

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:37.089 
then it moves to the first chord of the
song<00:03:35.959> proper<00:03:36.260> which<00:03:36.469> we'll<00:03:36.650> get<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.829> in<00:03:36.980> a

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
song proper which we'll get to in a

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.740 
song proper which we'll get to in a
moment

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.460 

then<00:03:42.750> we<00:03:42.900> get<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.170> chorus<00:03:46.520> friends<00:03:47.520> to<00:03:47.760> come

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
then we get the chorus friends to come

00:03:48.470 --> 00:04:00.010 
then we get the chorus friends to come
bring<00:03:49.470> em<00:03:49.830> all<00:03:52.250> along<00:03:53.280> Oh

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.490 

one<00:04:01.020> two<00:04:02.090> three<00:04:03.140> four<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.470> back<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.760> our

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
one two three four and back to our

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.820 
one two three four and back to our
introduction<00:04:07.500> passage<00:04:08.040> again

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.080 

here<00:04:14.830> is<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.190> first<00:04:15.430> part<00:04:15.849> of<00:04:15.970> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
here is the first part of the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.680 
here is the first part of the
instrumental

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
instrumental

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.460 
instrumental
it<00:04:16.840> starts<00:04:17.230> off<00:04:17.910> exactly<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.000> same<00:04:19.239> as<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:20.169> as

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
it starts off exactly the same as the as

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.650 
it starts off exactly the same as the as
when<00:04:21.100> you're<00:04:21.220> singing<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.639> verse<00:04:21.850> no<00:04:22.389> I'm

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
when you're singing the verse no I'm

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.480 
when you're singing the verse no I'm
wrong<00:04:22.900> it<00:04:23.139> starts<00:04:23.440> off<00:04:23.500> exactly<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:24.100> same<00:04:24.280> as

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
wrong it starts off exactly the same as

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:35.439 
wrong it starts off exactly the same as
when<00:04:24.610> you<00:04:24.700> play<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.030> introduction

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.029 

okay<00:04:36.449> that's<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.780> first<00:04:36.810> two<00:04:37.320> times<00:04:37.590> around

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
okay that's the first two times around

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.890 
okay that's the first two times around
that<00:04:38.160> little<00:04:38.250> sequence<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:39.150> third<00:04:39.419> time<00:04:39.750> it

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
that little sequence the third time it

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:49.739 
that little sequence the third time it
does<00:04:40.080> this

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:49.749 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:51.579 

now<00:04:50.749> that<00:04:50.929> little<00:04:51.169> pull-off

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:51.589 
now that little pull-off

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:56.189 
now that little pull-off
is<00:04:52.399> a<00:04:52.549> triplet<00:04:53.179> sequence<00:04:53.659> so<00:04:54.349> the<00:04:54.469> count<00:04:54.709> is<00:04:54.979> 1

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
is a triplet sequence so the count is 1

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:06.140 
is a triplet sequence so the count is 1
2<00:04:57.199> &amp;<00:04:57.679> 3<00:04:58.479> &amp;<00:04:59.479> 4<00:05:00.019> and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.129 

we<00:05:06.630> choose<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:07.139> an<00:05:07.229> open<00:05:07.680> C<00:05:08.250> tuning<00:05:09.240> open<00:05:09.930> C

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
we choose to an open C tuning open C

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.890 
we choose to an open C tuning open C
major<00:05:10.430> let's<00:05:11.430> do<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.699> from<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.210> first<00:05:12.570> string

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
major let's do it from the first string

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.840 
major let's do it from the first string
to<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.260> sixth<00:05:13.590> string<00:05:13.800> your<00:05:14.280> first<00:05:14.580> string

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
to the sixth string your first string

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.330 
to the sixth string your first string
stays<00:05:15.300> on<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:15.900> note<00:05:16.080> e

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
stays on the note e

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.219 
stays on the note e
let's<00:05:19.340> get<00:05:19.520> into<00:05:19.669> the<00:05:19.819> intro<00:05:20.360> where<00:05:20.720> maybe<00:05:20.960> for

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
let's get into the intro where maybe for

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.020 
let's get into the intro where maybe for
the<00:05:21.289> only<00:05:21.560> time<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:22.099> strum<00:05:22.370> pattern<00:05:22.669> is<00:05:22.789> going

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
the only time the strum pattern is going

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.240 
the only time the strum pattern is going
to<00:05:23.120> be<00:05:23.240> important<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:24.169> some<00:05:24.349> extent<00:05:24.740> it's

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
to be important to some extent it's

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.480 
to be important to some extent it's
going<00:05:25.430> to<00:05:25.490> sound<00:05:25.669> like<00:05:25.759> this

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.100 

and<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.640> will<00:05:32.790> repeat<00:05:33.150> four<00:05:33.450> times<00:05:33.480> that

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
and I will repeat four times that

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.760 
and I will repeat four times that
sequence

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.080 

spencer<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.890> rovolon<00:05:41.310> as<00:05:41.460> I<00:05:41.490> said<00:05:41.790> in<00:05:41.880> one<00:05:41.910> of

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
spencer the rovolon as I said in one of

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
spencer the rovolon as I said in one of
John<00:05:42.360> Massey's<00:05:42.720> favorite<00:05:43.140> tunings<00:05:43.500> dad<00:05:44.010> gasps

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
John Massey's favorite tunings dad gasps

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.230 
John Massey's favorite tunings dad gasps
he's<00:05:46.110> gonna<00:05:46.290> hit<00:05:46.470> strict<00:05:46.920> six<00:05:47.250> could<00:05:48.000> probably

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
he's gonna hit strict six could probably

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.080 
he's gonna hit strict six could probably
get<00:05:48.480> him<00:05:48.540> in<00:05:48.660> a<00:05:48.690> string<00:05:49.020> five<00:05:49.320> -<00:05:49.880> that's<00:05:50.880> part

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
get him in a string five - that's part

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.850 
get him in a string five - that's part
of<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.240> sound<00:05:51.480> he's<00:05:51.630> looking<00:05:51.960> for

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.590 

so<00:05:55.190> if<00:05:55.340> instead<00:05:55.580> of<00:05:55.700> just<00:05:55.880> picking<00:05:56.120> six

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
so if instead of just picking six

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.930 
so if instead of just picking six
cleanly<00:05:57.080> you<00:05:57.530> can<00:05:57.680> kind<00:05:57.860> of<00:05:57.890> brush<00:05:58.490> it<00:05:58.550> across

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
cleanly you can kind of brush it across

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.360 
cleanly you can kind of brush it across
five<00:05:59.240> as<00:05:59.420> well<00:05:59.630> so<00:06:00.560> much<00:06:00.680> the<00:06:00.740> better

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
five as well so much the better

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.850 
five as well so much the better
court<00:06:02.030> number<00:06:02.180> one<00:06:02.510> two<00:06:03.170> times<00:06:03.470> around<00:06:03.650> the

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
court number one two times around the

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.650 
court number one two times around the
pattern

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.300 

and<00:06:10.660> then<00:06:10.870> we<00:06:11.050> go<00:06:11.170> to<00:06:11.200> court<00:06:11.530> number<00:06:11.680> two<00:06:12.040> which

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
and then we go to court number two which

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.370 
and then we go to court number two which
we<00:06:12.460> will<00:06:12.610> play<00:06:12.790> eight<00:06:13.060> times<00:06:13.780> if<00:06:14.080> we're<00:06:14.290> going

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
we will play eight times if we're going

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.140 
we will play eight times if we're going
to<00:06:14.440> play<00:06:14.560> exactly<00:06:14.770> like<00:06:15.280> a<00:06:15.520> John<00:06:15.700> Martin<00:06:16.030> on

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
to play exactly like a John Martin on

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:24.909 
to play exactly like a John Martin on
the<00:06:16.180> record

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.149 

six<00:06:25.749> seven

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.260 

you<00:06:31.159> could<00:06:31.309> hear<00:06:31.429> that<00:06:31.490> I<00:06:31.669> was<00:06:31.789> sometimes

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
you could hear that I was sometimes

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.489 
you could hear that I was sometimes
finishing<00:06:32.809> the<00:06:32.869> pic<00:06:33.050> pattern<00:06:33.319> on<00:06:33.379> the

finishing the pic pattern on the

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:35.949 
finishing the pic pattern on the
third-string<00:06:33.740> and<00:06:34.189> sometimes<00:06:34.719> the<00:06:35.719> ring

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:35.959 
third-string and sometimes the ring

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:38.439
