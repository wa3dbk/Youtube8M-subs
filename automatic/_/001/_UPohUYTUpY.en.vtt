00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.000 
didn't realize I had LS two coils on
here<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:49.340> they<00:01:49.460> sit<00:01:49.670> high<00:01:50.080> which<00:01:51.080> means<00:01:51.260> the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
here so they sit high which means the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.109 
here so they sit high which means the
fuel<00:01:52.220> row<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.490> should<00:01:52.520> come<00:01:52.729> out<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.939> side

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
fuel row you should come out the side

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.460 
fuel row you should come out the side
right<00:01:53.299> here<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.689> ran<00:01:53.840> right<00:01:54.020> into<00:01:54.200> that

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
right here and it ran right into that

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.080 
right here and it ran right into that
coil<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.979> just<00:01:57.979> cut<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.640> tab<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:58.850> holds

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
coil so I just cut the tab that holds

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.289 
coil so I just cut the tab that holds
the<00:01:59.270> fuel<00:01:59.479> row<00:01:59.630> right<00:01:59.840> there

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.359 

bent<00:02:02.869> it<00:02:02.990> down<00:02:03.020> around<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.710> back<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.159> rear

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
bent it down around and back to the rear

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.880 
bent it down around and back to the rear
so<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.180> we<00:02:05.270> can<00:02:05.390> get<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.570> out<00:02:05.689> of<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.840> way<00:02:05.990> if

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
so that we can get it out of the way if

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.040 
so that we can get it out of the way if
you<00:02:07.009> care<00:02:07.220> about<00:02:07.310> your<00:02:07.490> fuel<00:02:08.330> rail<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.750> don't

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
you care about your fuel rail I don't

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.300 
you care about your fuel rail I don't
know<00:02:09.110> if<00:02:09.200> I'd<00:02:09.259> recommend<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:09.830> too<00:02:09.979> much<00:02:10.130> we

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
know if I'd recommend that too much we

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.830 
know if I'd recommend that too much we
got<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.489> little<00:02:10.849> bit<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.090> kink<00:02:11.300> here<00:02:11.569> which<00:02:11.750> is

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
putting aftermarket rails in here

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.680 
putting aftermarket rails in here
anyways<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.580> for<00:02:19.730> me<00:02:19.819> it's<00:02:20.150> okay<00:02:20.420> for<00:02:20.510> this

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
anyways so for me it's okay for this

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.479 
anyways so for me it's okay for this
quarter<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.140> get<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.380> up<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.890> less<00:02:22.280> fast

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
quarter and to get it up to a less fast

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.000 
quarter and to get it up to a less fast
on<00:02:22.640> time<00:02:23.110> for<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> quick<00:02:24.440> disconnect<00:02:24.890> on

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
on time for the quick disconnect on

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.040 
on time for the quick disconnect on
there<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.430> took<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.000> original<00:02:26.060> hose<00:02:26.630> off<00:02:26.900> to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050
