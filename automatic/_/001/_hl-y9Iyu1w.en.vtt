00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
1997 I know that buying a bike sight

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.920 
1997 I know that buying a bike sight
unseen<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.529> only<00:00:22.680> photos<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> Internet

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
unseen from only photos on the Internet

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.390 
unseen from only photos on the Internet
might<00:00:24.930> seem<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> little<00:00:25.410> dicey<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.890> some<00:00:26.070> people

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
might seem a little dicey to some people

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.929 
might seem a little dicey to some people
I've<00:00:27.029> bought<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> couple<00:00:27.599> bikes<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.050> way<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
I've bought a couple bikes that way and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.250 
I've bought a couple bikes that way and
I<00:00:29.939> thought<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.359> shooting<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.810> video<00:00:31.050> might

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
I thought that shooting the video might

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.280 
I thought that shooting the video might
be<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.410> way<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> help<00:00:32.160> give<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> potential<00:00:33.420> buyer

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
be a way to help give a potential buyer

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.110 
be a way to help give a potential buyer
a<00:00:34.680> better<00:00:35.480> feeling<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.780> motorcycle<00:00:37.940> as<00:00:38.940> I

Honda<00:01:10.950> has<00:01:11.070> assured<00:01:11.400> me<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.330> very

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
Honda has assured me that it's it's very

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.730 
Honda has assured me that it's it's very
solid<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:14.360> it<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.840> solid<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
solid and if you it really is solid this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.890 
solid and if you it really is solid this
it's<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.820> down<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> road<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.360> 80<00:01:18.509> miles<00:01:18.720> an

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
it's you go down the road at 80 miles an

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.390 
it's you go down the road at 80 miles an
hour<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.710> solid<00:01:20.100> there's<00:01:20.280> no

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
hour and it's it's solid there's no

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.090 
hour and it's it's solid there's no
problem<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.000> does<00:01:21.119> look<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> little<00:01:21.479> weird

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
problem so it does look a little weird

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.969 
problem so it does look a little weird
but<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:24.210> could<00:01:24.360> probably<00:01:24.540> go<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:25.080> quite<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
but you could probably go for quite a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.830 
but you could probably go for quite a
long<00:01:26.130> ways<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.240> any<00:01:27.360> problems<00:01:27.720> with

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
long ways and not have any problems with

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.330 
long ways and not have any problems with
it<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> other<00:01:28.470> thing<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it and then the other thing is the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.910 
it and then the other thing is the
windshield<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.939> chipped<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.390> belt<00:01:30.600> buckle

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
windshield I chipped with my belt buckle

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.340 
windshield I chipped with my belt buckle
I<00:01:31.920> was<00:01:32.430> able<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.790> put<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> pieces<00:01:33.960> back

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
I was able to put one of the pieces back

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.310 
I was able to put one of the pieces back
in<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:35.180> glued<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> back<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:36.990> there's<00:01:37.140> still

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
in I glued it back in but there's still

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.690 
in I glued it back in but there's still
a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.500> piece<00:01:37.740> missing<00:01:38.009> yeah<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:38.670> of

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
a little piece missing yeah it's kind of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.260 
a little piece missing yeah it's kind of
unsightly

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
unsightly

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.620 
unsightly
but<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.170> said<00:01:40.229> they<00:01:40.530> added<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.979> no<00:01:41.130> way

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
but as I said they added in no way

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.240 
but as I said they added in no way
impairs<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.869> functioning<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.530> security<00:01:44.189> of

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.240 
five hundred twenty-two miles I've been
riding<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.139> bike<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.319> few<00:04:12.650> miles<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.949> day<00:04:12.980> just

riding the bike a few miles a day just

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.610 
riding the bike a few miles a day just
to<00:04:13.370> keep<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:14.090> engine<00:04:14.389> and<00:04:14.510> battery<00:04:14.629> strong<00:04:15.049> so

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
to keep the engine and battery strong so

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.339 
to keep the engine and battery strong so
I'm<00:04:15.709> going<00:04:15.859> to<00:04:15.919> put<00:04:16.099> the<00:04:16.280> choke<00:04:16.579> on<00:04:16.789> here<00:04:17.120> and

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
I'm going to put the choke on here and

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.599 
I'm going to put the choke on here and
this<00:04:18.349> is<00:04:18.500> what<00:04:18.650> it's<00:04:18.769> like<00:04:18.949> starting<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.400> spike

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
this is what it's like starting to spike

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.030 
this is what it's like starting to spike
from<00:04:19.789> completely<00:04:20.209> cold

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.360 

so<00:04:24.520> as<00:04:24.670> you<00:04:24.820> can<00:04:24.940> see<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.750> fired<00:04:26.140> right<00:04:26.560> up<00:04:26.620> and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
so as you can see it fired right up and

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.230 
so as you can see it fired right up and
that's<00:04:27.610> cold

that's cold

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.060 
that's cold
it<00:04:28.990> just<00:04:29.200> started<00:04:29.500> right<00:04:29.620> up<00:04:29.650> without<00:04:30.010> a

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
it just started right up without a

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.270 
it just started right up without a
second<00:04:30.460> hesitation<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:32.620> B<00:04:32.740> twin<00:04:33.040> has<00:04:33.250> a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
second hesitation the B twin has a

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.600 
second hesitation the B twin has a
really<00:04:33.580> nice<00:04:33.700> /<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:34.420> and<00:04:34.980> as<00:04:35.980> I<00:04:36.250> said<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
really nice / to it and as I said the

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.580 
really nice / to it and as I said the
listing<00:04:36.970> with<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.150> high<00:04:37.270> wind<00:04:37.540> shield<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:38.380> can

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
listing with a high wind shield you can

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.930 
listing with a high wind shield you can
really<00:04:38.860> hear<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.070> engine<00:04:39.460> purring<00:04:39.670> when

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
really hear the engine purring when

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.590 
really hear the engine purring when
you're<00:04:40.060> going<00:04:40.180> down<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.360> high

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
you're going down a high

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.470 
you're going down a high
I<00:04:41.720> think<00:04:42.260> that's<00:04:42.470> about<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:44.000> bike<00:04:44.150> speaks

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
I think that's about it the bike speaks

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.800 
I think that's about it the bike speaks
for<00:04:44.690> itself<00:04:44.930> it's<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.350> good<00:04:45.500> fine<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:46.810> don't

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
for itself it's a good fine so don't

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.250 
for itself it's a good fine so don't
wait

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
wait

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.630
