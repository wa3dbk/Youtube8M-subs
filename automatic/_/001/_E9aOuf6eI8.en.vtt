00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.059
Whassap yo? This week on Thug Notes
we straight buggin with The Metamorphosis

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.320
by Franz Kafka.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.710
Things dead as usual in the life of Gregor
Samsa. Oh yeah, cept for one

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.880
thing: Fool realize he dun TRANSFORMED IN
TO A GIANT FUGLY-ASS INSECT. I ain’t even

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.820
playin, man. But compared to slavin away for
the man, Gregor don’t give a fu** bout lookin

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.420
all jacked up. Instead, he start marinatin
on how much he hate his daily grind as a salesman.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.769
When his mama come a knockin, she
say “Gregor! Get yo lazy white ass outta

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.040
bed and go to work!” Gregor try to talk-
but his mouth just spittin gibberish.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.369
Then his manager rolls up to the
crib and say “Yo Gregor. Man da boss ain’t

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:58.089
gonna take none o dis “sick-day” jive.
Get yo sh** together and go to work!” After

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.689
Gregor finally opens the door, his Mama passes
out COLD, the manager BAILS, and Gregor’s

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:08.420
daddy tries to swat his ass with a newspaper
before holing him up.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.500
Eventually Gregor on a new grind-
chillin under the couch, eatin trash his sister

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.840
Grete tossin him, and listenin to his family
go on bout how they all tapped out now that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.210
Gregor’s useless bug-ass can’t bring home
the bread no mo.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.530
Later, Gregor be creepin round his
grimey digs when his mama peeps dat crusty

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.210
ass and be all like “Oh SNAP!” Then his
pops start chunkin apples- wreckin dat big

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.979
bug FO REAL.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.030
Without Gregor hustlin fo’ paper on
the streets, the Samsas start rentin out some

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.700
space in their digs. One day Grete busts out
her violin and starts layin down some fresh

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.549
jams for the tenants. Dem beats are so next
level that Gregor crawls out from under the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.200
couch so he can get a closer listen. But when
dem scrubs peep game at Gregor’s nastified

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.979
self, they tweak out, throw up the deuce to
the Samsa crib and tell daddy Samsa that he

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.920
ain’t gettin none of their cash monies.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.119
After dat, Grete say “Look, this nappy vermin
gotta hit the road,

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.200
yo. I can’t live like this anymore!” Our
boy can take a hint, so Gregor crawls back

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.280
under the couch, and checks out of this whack-
ass world fo good.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.260
With Gregor no longer trippin up
their game, the Samsas finally get to chill

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.420
outside the city. Ma and Pa Samsa take look
at Grete and realize she turned out pretty

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.890
damn fine. So she gotta start bussin dat ass
so she can find a man. Hopefully one who stackin

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.410
mad grands. Priorities. Naw mean?

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.840
This text right hurr layin down
some righteous truths bout what it means to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.620
be human in a modern capitalist society.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.760
The only thing ERRYBODY want you to do is
keep yo head down, grind hard

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.010
at yo job, and stack that cheddar. And it
ain’t just the boss-man wearin yo ass down,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.620
it can even be yo own blood.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.500
See back when Gregor’s was hustlin
for dough by being his boss’s favorite nut-rest,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.500
all that bug boy’s family did was just sit
on their asses.

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.060
But after Gregor gets smacked wit
the ugly stick, errybody in the family gotta

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.330
sack-up and start makin dat scratch.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.290
Grete got Gregor’s back at first,
but eventually can’t stand dat nasty mug

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.540
no mo and say he gotta GO. Even though back
then Gregor’s cash flow was providin fo

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.010
THE WHOLE DAMN FAMILY, they trippin now that
all three gotta support JUST him. Aint dat

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.670
some sh**?

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.040
When even yo family lookin at you like you
ain’t nothin more than a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.440
cash machine, you livin in a cold- ass society
that can turn even the hardest hoods in to

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.360
insects. For Gregor, all dat mess he gotta
put up with makes him a little less human

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.459
erry day.

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.440
Some scholars wonder if Gregor
ACTUALLY transformed in to a bug at all. Maybe

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.560
gettin dumped on day in day out just made
him feel like an insect.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.460
In a 
hopeless world of hoods always
rollin fake, Gregor does the only good thing

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.500
a bug can do: curl up in to a ball and die.
Damn.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.630
And if Gregor had only one regret,
it would probably be that he didn’t subscribe

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.460
to my channel. So what you waitin for? HIT
IT and catch me later. Peace
