two buns past or extreme I've been
stretching<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.360> worthy<00:00:36.920> ok<00:00:37.920> I'll<00:00:38.670> readyboost

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
stretching it worthy ok I'll readyboost

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.530 
stretching it worthy ok I'll readyboost
it<00:00:39.420> forty-two<00:00:40.230> percent<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.790> my<00:00:41.969> three

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
it forty-two percent so for my three

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.010 
it forty-two percent so for my three
thousand<00:00:42.960> two<00:00:43.110> hundred<00:00:43.789> megahertz<00:00:45.020> Oh

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
thousand two hundred megahertz Oh

thousand two hundred megahertz Oh
gigahertz<00:00:46.829> processor<00:00:47.690> boosted<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.989> 4,500

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
gigahertz processor boosted up to 4,500

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.560 
gigahertz processor boosted up to 4,500
49<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.010> think<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.520> reached<00:00:53.789> my<00:00:54.000> limit<00:00:54.329> there

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
49 so I think I'm reached my limit there

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.510 
49 so I think I'm reached my limit there
shouldn't<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.289> anymore<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> should

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
shouldn't we do it anymore but I should

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.020 
shouldn't we do it anymore but I should
try<00:00:56.760> anyway<00:00:57.270> once<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:58.609> just<00:00:59.609> see<00:00:59.850> what<00:00:59.879> the

try anyway once more just see what the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
try anyway once more just see what the
process<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.840> I'm<00:01:01.079> doing<00:01:01.289> got<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> boring

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
process is so I'm doing got a boring

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.420 
process is so I'm doing got a boring
bits<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.120> extreme<00:01:03.510> he<00:01:03.750> says<00:01:03.989> me<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:05.309> will

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
bits go for extreme he says me it will

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.580 
bits go for extreme he says me it will
reboot<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.820> couple<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.180> times<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.780> CPU<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
reboot a couple of times of you CPU and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.859 
reboot a couple of times of you CPU and
the<00:01:07.830> memory<00:01:07.950> I've<00:01:08.820> got<00:01:09.119> quite<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.630> lot<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the memory I've got quite a lot of

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.010 
the memory I've got quite a lot of
memory<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.320> 64<00:01:10.920> gigs<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> also<00:01:12.360> start

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
memory in there 64 gigs so I also start

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.380 
memory in there 64 gigs so I also start
once<00:01:13.320> more

called a I sweet to lots of look with

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.719 
called a I sweet to lots of look with

gadgets on the other moreshow for what

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.889 
gadgets on the other moreshow for what
they<00:01:35.819> do<00:01:36.950> if<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.189> flip<00:01:38.729> back<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.209> turbos<00:01:39.750> is

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
they do if I flip back to this turbos is

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.139 
they do if I flip back to this turbos is
where<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.380> basically<00:01:41.100> tell<00:01:41.640> me<00:01:41.819> how<00:01:41.909> far

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
where you basically tell me how far

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.529 
where you basically tell me how far
something<00:01:42.420> yeah<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.069> know<00:01:44.069> he<00:01:44.189> didn't<00:01:44.429> get<00:01:44.610> it

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
something yeah I know he didn't get it

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.690 
something yeah I know he didn't get it
was<00:01:45.689> saying<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.409> was<00:01:46.469> telling<00:01:46.829> me<00:01:46.950> exactly<00:01:47.100> 45

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
was saying it was telling me exactly 45

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
was saying it was telling me exactly 45
just<00:01:48.299> there<00:01:50.240> did<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.420> power<00:01:51.630> controller

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
just there did you power controller

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.749 
just there did you power controller
we've<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.649> been<00:01:52.950> feeling<00:01:53.130> about<00:01:53.489> this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
we've just been feeling about this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.449 
we've just been feeling about this
apparently<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:54.959> you<00:01:55.020> says<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> higher<00:01:56.189> value

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
apparently if you says a higher value

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.149 
apparently if you says a higher value
brings<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.090> total<00:01:57.450> power<00:01:58.170> range<00:01:58.560> extends

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
brings a total power range extends

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.620 
brings a total power range extends
overclocking<00:01:59.880> frequencies<00:02:00.390> simultaneously

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
overclocking frequencies simultaneously

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.559 
overclocking frequencies simultaneously
so<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.709> reduce<00:02:02.039> this<00:02:02.390> nice<00:02:03.390> little

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
so you can reduce this nice little

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.080 
so you can reduce this nice little
graphics<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.670> pushed<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.789> right<00:02:05.939> up

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
graphics in is they pushed it right up

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.050 
graphics in is they pushed it right up
and<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:06.840> same<00:02:07.110> thing<00:02:07.579> like<00:02:08.579> all<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> way

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
and that one same thing like all the way

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.520 
and that one same thing like all the way
up<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:10.079> want<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.430> one<00:02:11.489> here<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.930> one<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.230> more

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
up I want this one here this one is more

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.930 
up I want this one here this one is more
stability<00:02:14.329> so<00:02:15.980> less<00:02:16.980> stable<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.549> one<00:02:17.730> month

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
stability so less stable that one month

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.740 
stability so less stable that one month
all<00:02:18.209> these<00:02:18.569> things<00:02:18.840> are<00:02:20.299> common<00:02:21.299> sense<00:02:21.540> or

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
all these things are common sense or

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:31.490 
all these things are common sense or
emerging<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:23.000> fly<00:02:25.459> this<00:02:26.459> one<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:30.500> simply

emerging so fly this one here simply

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.220 
emerging so fly this one here simply
sort<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.799> thing<00:02:32.420> just<00:02:33.420> kind<00:02:33.569> of<00:02:33.690> adjusting<00:02:34.109> it

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
sort of thing just kind of adjusting it

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.910 
sort of thing just kind of adjusting it
