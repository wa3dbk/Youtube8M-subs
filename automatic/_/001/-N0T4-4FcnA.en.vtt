00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:13.259
 I bought that is the iphone 4s in 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.639
 white is pretty cool and here it is 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.309
 the plastic but now I want to make you 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.110
 the others 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:26.100
 good to see how it is 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:30.240
 here over here is this apple 4s 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.509
 cloud that is storing information in 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.839
 Internet 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.690
 and here after putting the gigas the other bla 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:41.629
 bla bla from california make boldin chain 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.880
 to very well we are going to open it and here 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.460
 is 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.980
 it is in white color is a 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.330
 advanced little black COLOR 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.620
 equipment and all this and good to see me 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.910
 like pretty blank 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.180
 is very pretty 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.730
 then later we will review the iphone no 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.380
 let's see what the box includes 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.710
 good the typical of 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.920
 of wall connectors 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.090
 europe here has for usb 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.300
 here the headphones 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.760
 the iac to kill him 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.410
 both these and to raise and lower the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.400
 volume I think it will also serve to 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.440
 go up and down to pick up calls and everything 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.920
 that's because he also carries books 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.680
 and the usb cable 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.120
 with the water here and the apple connector 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.650
 here 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.700
 well this is basically what it takes 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.820
 the box does not bring any more if you look here 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.300
 is 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.300
 here 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.210
 design bollinger mesh fornia what 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.159
 cool 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.900
 good to see what the box brings, this is not what 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.190
 I have to see 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.110
 let's see 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.820
 the east stick that is for 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.520
 to get it out 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.320
 you see here here goes the sim card in the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.869
 mobile then put the stick I'm by 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.260
 here this opens we go pretty cool and 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.260
 now here the drawing if you see 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.810
 and the good instructions and everything 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.810
 typical how to use it blah blah blah 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.520
 apple stickers 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.610
 well this is more or less all that 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.990
 brings the box does nothing more 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.720
 and this is what really matters to see 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.300
 what they have improved is going faster 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.170
 processor and that then the camera is in 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.270
 1080 then at the end of the video I'll put you 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.220
 I will put a small a small video 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.920
 compared to the two iphones because with 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.470
 what I'm recording is with the iphone 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.150
 with the normal and good iphone I will put the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.700
 two and I'll make a small video at the end 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.290
 to see the difference and then also 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.569
 an image 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.000
 but that has also improved in the 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.489
 cloud that he has put new goes more 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.219
 fast then design practically by 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.480
 out the best is equal antennas have not 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.049
 I know if you have two more so there's more 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.049
 coverage because 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.860
 the normal and the iphone4 the normal iphone4 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.239
 had little coverage failed sometimes and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.980
 how the logs are here the logs 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.980
 here to see 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.069
 to see if it fits wait 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.480
 you see here the antenna is those things 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.959
 black that have the edges and are the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.040
 antennas that the iphone4 had only two and 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.620
 now they have added a few 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.079
 to improve it and well that's 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.609
 basically what I wanted to show you 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.900
 mobile that I bought I hope that you 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.879
 I liked it 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.270
 if you are thinking if you are thinking about 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.700
 buy or not buy it or recommend it 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.920
 he is very cool good with these I leave 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:02.890
 now you will see the video of the difference 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.890
 and a bye zone to another
