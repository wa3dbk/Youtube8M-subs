00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
then the second thing what else did they

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.560 
then the second thing what else did they
say<00:01:46.079> use<00:01:46.680> games<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.220> don't<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.549> buy<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> whole

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
say use games I don't really buy a whole

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.050 
say use games I don't really buy a whole
ton<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> use<00:01:49.049> games<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.710> mean<00:01:50.280> primarily<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.850> just

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
ton of use games I mean primarily I just

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.330 
ton of use games I mean primarily I just
play<00:01:51.180> cod<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.840> honest<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:53.189> think

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
play cod to be honest so I don't think

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.490 
play cod to be honest so I don't think
that's<00:01:53.460> gonna<00:01:53.579> affect<00:01:53.729> me<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.000> whole<00:01:54.180> lot<00:01:54.350> if<00:01:55.350> I

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that's gonna affect me a whole lot if I

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.990 
that's gonna affect me a whole lot if I
want<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> game<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.100> gonna<00:01:56.250> go<00:01:56.460> buy<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.670> new

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
probably but now that's just me so it

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.600 
probably but now that's just me so it
doesn't<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.170> these<00:02:01.649> really<00:02:02.100> these<00:02:02.369> things

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
xbox one and maybe Microsoft are being a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.630 
xbox one and maybe Microsoft are being a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
bunch of green money whores but I don't

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.400 
bunch of green money whores but I don't
really<00:02:08.729> care<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.569> does<00:02:09.720> kind<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.959> pissed<00:02:10.349> me

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
really care it does kind of pissed me

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.620

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
off that they do that stuff but

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.910 
off that they do that stuff but
I<00:02:12.720> mean<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.140> not<00:02:13.260> gonna<00:02:13.380> affect<00:02:13.500> me<00:02:13.800> much

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I mean it's not gonna affect me much

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.460 
I mean it's not gonna affect me much
plus<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.610> kind<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.510> Xbox<00:02:15.810> brand<00:02:16.320> a

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.930 
plus I kind of like the Xbox brand a
little<00:02:16.680> bit<00:02:16.770> more<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.190> right<00:02:17.670> now<00:02:17.700> I'm

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
little bit more so right now I'm

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.060
