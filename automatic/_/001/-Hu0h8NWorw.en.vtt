it takes the heads of the grain off come
on<00:03:45.030> them<00:03:45.180> here<00:03:45.329> I'll<00:03:45.510> show<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:47.629> these<00:03:48.629> are<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
on them here I'll show you these are the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.199 
on them here I'll show you these are the
heads<00:03:49.139> of<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.349> other<00:03:49.650> grain<00:03:50.040> they<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:50.970> thrown

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
heads of the other grain they get thrown

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.899 
heads of the other grain they get thrown
into<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.629> machine<00:03:51.870> behind<00:03:52.290> me<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:53.159> it

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
into this machine behind me and it

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.670 
into this machine behind me and it
separates<00:03:54.450> these<00:03:54.659> and

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.770 

oh<00:03:57.739> wow<00:03:58.730> look<00:03:58.849> at<00:03:58.939> that<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.420> there's<00:03:59.599> the

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
oh wow look at that and there's the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.830 
oh wow look at that and there's the
grain<00:04:00.609> there<00:04:01.609> it<00:04:01.700> is<00:04:01.879> and<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.510> machine

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
grain there it is and so the machine

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.530 
grain there it is and so the machine
takes<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.980> trap<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.819> blows<00:04:05.239> it<00:04:05.420> out

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
takes the trap and blows it out

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.809 
takes the trap and blows it out
separates<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.680> grain<00:04:06.890> and<00:04:07.129> it<00:04:07.250> goes<00:04:07.400> into<00:04:07.640> the

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
separates the grain and it goes into the

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.569 
separates the grain and it goes into the
bin<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.840> goes<00:04:09.049> into<00:04:09.379> a<00:04:09.409> machine<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:10.189> turn

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
bin this goes into a machine to turn

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.500 
bin this goes into a machine to turn
into<00:04:10.790> flour<00:04:11.409> and<00:04:12.409> Wonder<00:04:12.650> Bread<00:04:13.510> today's

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.180 
just how much tractors and harvesters
revolutionized<00:04:20.180> agriculture<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.919> get<00:04:22.100> an

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
for us to have the future we must

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.670 
for us to have the future we must
restore<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.820> past

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.580 

we<00:04:48.220> must<00:04:48.460> pass<00:04:48.669> it<00:04:48.910> on<00:04:49.030> we<00:04:49.300> need<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.509> know<00:04:49.810> how<00:04:50.560> a

I used to decompress and this is you
know<00:05:21.210> it's<00:05:21.389> really<00:05:21.569> fun<00:05:21.870> it's<00:05:22.110> quite<00:05:22.410> a<00:05:22.440> hobby
