00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.899 
someone special and the squad last day
at<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> middle<00:01:21.750> meant<00:01:22.619> great<00:01:23.490> among<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.330 
at the middle meant great among the
talent<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.420> any<00:01:25.049> 15<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.680> put<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.130> think

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
talent and any 15 this put up I think

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.850 
talent and any 15 this put up I think
we'll<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.549> able<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> good<00:01:28.110> job<00:01:28.170> he<00:01:28.740> would

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
we'll be able to do a good job he would

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310 
we'll be able to do a good job he would
you<00:01:28.950> say<00:01:29.130> are<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.369> dangerous<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.229> think<00:01:31.229> they

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you say are they dangerous I think they

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.100 
you say are they dangerous I think they
got<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.460> many<00:01:32.700> who<00:01:33.000> can't<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.479> pinpoint<00:01:33.689> one

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
got so many who can't just pinpoint one

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.380 
got so many who can't just pinpoint one
or<00:01:34.229> two<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.799> think<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.610> pinpoint<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.270> or

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
or two I think if you pinpoint one or

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.999 
or two I think if you pinpoint one or
two<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> open<00:01:37.320> holes<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.860> for

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
two then it's going to open holes up for

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.399 
two then it's going to open holes up for
the<00:01:38.159> other<00:01:38.250> other<00:01:38.729> players<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.110> just

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the other other players so you know just

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.520 
the other other players so you know just
