00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:13.599
 here today dismantled the engine one 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.170
 very interesting means man of the ring 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.870
 sunk 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.340
 rubber sealing under the liner on 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:25.080
 tractor and water went oil means oil 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:29.920
 he was filled with this here barrels 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:35.730
 this oil is very good even 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:40.560
 oil was a series of force 4 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.870
 very trump oil was brought to the farm 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.200
 Oryol 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.550
 local but the water went unmeasured 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:59.680
 its quantities from this oil turned out 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:03.180
 Here is such a white emulsion that bodyaga 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:08.159
 obtained from the oil when it gets 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:17.229
 the water turns out here is such a little white 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:22.200
 emulsions, but to the touch that even 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:25.659
 very slippery here 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.229
 but the whole problem is this this whole 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.479
 emulsions and then kills motors 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.619
 but all this is pumped up and no way 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.299
 it does not peel off this already and will 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.750
 life by the way 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:45.000
 she is very good at lubricating all kinds of drills 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.979
 the incisors of the case do not come up with lubrication 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.179
 very good for this business november 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.740
 to work with the engine, it is not suitable 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.110
 so if you pulled a pike 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.200
 from your engine and saw there 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.509
 such a phenomenon or more 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.549
 less probably more 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:09.250
 there is no place because there is a lot of water 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:11.470
 cooked very but this butter and if you 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.450
 there was such a little white here 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:20.890
 oil similar will hire everything means you 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:28.299
 map and water like this the whole thing 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:32.250
 looks like an unpleasant thing okay we will 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:35.380
 repair where you get away 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.269
 so what is it if you have a map 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.380
 such a thing appeared this trouble is 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.380
 need to save the motor
