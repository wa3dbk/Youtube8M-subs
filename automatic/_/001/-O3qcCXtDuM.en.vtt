problems<00:00:42.559> in<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:42.859> world<00:00:43.039> are<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.699> result<00:00:43.879> of

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
problems in the world are the result of

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.540 
problems in the world are the result of
the<00:00:44.510> difference<00:00:44.929> between<00:00:45.140> how<00:00:45.710> nature<00:00:46.039> works

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
the difference between how nature works

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.559 
the difference between how nature works
and<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.239> way<00:00:47.359> people<00:00:47.390> think<00:00:49.059> what<00:00:50.059> does<00:00:50.420> it

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:50.569 
and the way people think what does it

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:53.160 
and the way people think what does it
even<00:00:50.809> mean<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.589> change<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.100> way<00:00:52.249> we<00:00:52.460> think<00:00:52.699> and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
even mean to change the way we think and

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.759 
even mean to change the way we think and
he<00:00:54.170> asked<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.589> question<00:00:55.069> what<00:00:55.969> is<00:00:56.300> there

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
he asked the question what is there

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.450 
he asked the question what is there
about<00:00:57.769> our<00:00:58.149> way<00:00:59.149> of<00:00:59.449> perceiving<00:01:00.109> that<00:01:01.100> makes

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
about our way of perceiving that makes

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.880 
about our way of perceiving that makes
us<00:01:01.760> not<00:01:02.539> see<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:04.610> delicate

us not see the delicate
