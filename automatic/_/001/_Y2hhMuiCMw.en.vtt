00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.410 
we've got a 335 tire and we're loading
this<00:01:53.920> thing<00:01:53.979> going<00:01:54.549> around<00:01:54.640> corners<00:01:55.180> and

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
this thing going around corners and

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.660 
this thing going around corners and
little<00:01:56.140> puny<00:01:56.409> axles<00:01:56.979> are<00:01:57.189> going<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.460> go<00:01:57.610> to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
little puny axles are going to go to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.359 
little puny axles are going to go to
crap<00:01:58.210> well<00:01:58.540> what<00:01:59.229> happens<00:01:59.649> is<00:01:59.829> with<00:02:00.040> with<00:02:00.250> an

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
crap well what happens is with with an

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.130 
crap well what happens is with with an
axle<00:02:00.700> like<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:01.030> you'll<00:02:01.210> actually<00:02:01.420> get<00:02:01.899> a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
axle like that you'll actually get a

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.109 
axle like that you'll actually get a
bend<00:02:02.770> in<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:02.979> axle<00:02:03.490> you'll<00:02:03.670> actually<00:02:03.850> get

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
bend in the axle you'll actually get

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.719 
bend in the axle you'll actually get
deflection<00:02:04.810> here<00:02:05.049> it<00:02:05.409> can<00:02:05.560> cause<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.829> pad<00:02:06.430> knock

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
deflection here it can cause a pad knock

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.389 
deflection here it can cause a pad knock
back<00:02:07.000> on<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.270> calipers<00:02:07.810> just<00:02:08.799> all<00:02:08.950> kinds<00:02:09.310> of

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
back on the calipers just all kinds of

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.340 
back on the calipers just all kinds of
mysterious<00:02:10.119> stuff<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.540> comes<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.170> goes

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
mysterious stuff that comes and goes

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.860 
mysterious stuff that comes and goes
that<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.070> may<00:02:12.190> have<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.400> think<00:02:12.430> about<00:02:12.790> one<00:02:13.780> of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
that you may have to think about one of

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.030 
that you may have to think about one of
the<00:02:13.959> thing<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.230> was<00:02:14.350> going<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.530> point<00:02:14.709> out<00:02:14.890> in

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
the thing I was going to point out in

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.289 
the thing I was going to point out in
this<00:02:15.160> we're<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.549> you<00:02:15.730> can't<00:02:15.910> really<00:02:16.060> see<00:02:16.269> it

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
this we're in you can't really see it

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.460 
this we're in you can't really see it
because<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.600> all<00:02:16.690> buttoned<00:02:17.049> up<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.290> has

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
because it's all buttoned up this has

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.580 
because it's all buttoned up this has
got<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.829> Moser<00:02:18.220> wave<00:02:18.880> track<00:02:19.329> pausing<00:02:20.170> unit

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
got the Moser wave track pausing unit

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.920 
got the Moser wave track pausing unit
yeah<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.400> wave<00:02:21.579> track<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.209> something<00:02:22.840> a

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
yeah and the wave track is something a

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.380 
yeah and the wave track is something a
little<00:02:23.019> new<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.530> them<00:02:23.620> but<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.730> important

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
little new for them but the important

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.710 
little new for them but the important
thing<00:02:25.450> about<00:02:25.780> that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
thing about that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.050 
thing about that
intersection<00:02:27.320> is<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.070> very<00:02:28.580> smoothly

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
intersection is that it very smoothly

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.620 
intersection is that it very smoothly
and<00:02:29.390> cleanly<00:02:29.650> releases<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:31.790> know<00:02:31.910> power<00:02:32.270> to

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
and cleanly releases you know power to

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.480 
and cleanly releases you know power to
both<00:02:32.780> sides<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.500> rear<00:02:33.680> end<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.980> doesn't

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
both sides of the rear end it doesn't

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.790 
both sides of the rear end it doesn't
clog<00:02:34.820> or<00:02:35.150> chatter<00:02:35.420> or<00:02:35.660> chunk<00:02:35.930> like<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.140> like

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
clog or chatter or chunk like a like

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.950 
clog or chatter or chunk like a like
maybe<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.190> different<00:02:37.580> Locker<00:02:37.820> or<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.270> school

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
maybe a different Locker or a school

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.780 
maybe a different Locker or a school
rear-end<00:02:39.410> or<00:02:39.650> something<00:02:39.950> like<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:40.130> so

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
rear-end or something like that so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.130 
rear-end or something like that so
really<00:02:40.820> important<00:02:41.720> when<00:02:41.810> you're<00:02:41.960> in<00:02:42.020> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
really important when you're in the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.120 
really important when you're in the
middle<00:02:42.350> of<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.620> turn

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
middle of a turn

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.650 
middle of a turn
trying<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.610> get<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.030> off<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.150> power<00:02:44.450> to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
trying to get on and off the power to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.090 
trying to get on and off the power to
make<00:02:44.810> around<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.200> term<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.710> thing<00:02:45.920> is

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
make around the term that this thing is

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.370 
make around the term that this thing is
cleanly<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.790> smoothly<00:02:47.090> releasing<00:02:47.750> and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
cleanly and smoothly releasing and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.440 
cleanly and smoothly releasing and
that's<00:02:48.740> what<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.920> wave<00:02:49.100> faculty<00:02:49.550> for<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.880> well
