00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello together here is the kelvin and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.830
 In this movie I want a question 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.349
 answer and that is the question why me 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.230
 to the new canon legria mini iks 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.450
 changed and not the old one 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.010
 camera use yes and I was too 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.080
 asked where are the differences? 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.910
 between the old legria mini and one 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.350
 new legria mini yes and there I have 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.060
 I now resolutely agree to this video 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.220
 make the differences for you 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.510
 tell 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.260
 By the way, this video is still being filmed 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.840
 with the old legria mini and also the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.719
 sound comes directly from the camera 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.879
 so all those who now have the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.739
 legria mini not yet in the test 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.510
 have had or seen in the test 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.329
 a small impression of how good the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.430
 is and how the quality is there 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.110
 but again an extra video on 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.860
 the legria mini knew something more 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.070
 to explain 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.399
 well come in addition reason why I have to 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.829
 new legria mannix changed because i 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.170
 very often use this legria mini 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.640
 if i use something quite often then 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.439
 I always think about it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.110
 to be up to date and also the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.180
 to check whether this makes sense for 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 make me and the innovations in the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.360
 legria mini have the sense for me 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.729
 Just made because I am the camera 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.130
 I would not use them that often 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.540
 I will often use the allegria mini 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.729
 remained but because the plane with me 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.220
 I wanted to use it every day 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.229
 necessarily on the new legria mi nix 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.640
 change but where are the differences 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:34.829
 For one, the new legria mini is something 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.920
 bigger and optically something nice 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.829
 I'm a bit higher quality 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.960
 more high-tech from that was not the 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.409
 main reason why I have changed 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.829
 should have been the main reasons 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.319
 others the first main reason of the 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.289
 I agree he is that the 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.329
 legria mini is now here 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.079
 has a headphone input and a 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.179
 Microphone input that means you can 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.119
 now connect an external microphone 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.950
 if I'm just further away 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.200
 it makes sense because we have funk microphones 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.970
 and that was just with the old legria 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.980
 mini not even the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.629
 headphone jack makes sense right now 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.799
 then when someone films he can do it directly 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.860
 to hear the sound 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.860
 that's for the first advantageous one 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.569
 Another small advantage even then 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.870
 but I noticed later 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.040
 if you are filming there are still the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.920
 used function so where this 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.290
 fish perspective virtually disappears 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.599
 you have normal field of vision and that was 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.430
 in legria always hold something 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.650
 Blurry in the preview when you look 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.780
 then it was his good picture 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.319
 and that is already here in 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.120
 the preview sharply displayed was one 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.450
 trifle noticed in later 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.329
 is 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.000
 Another point is the microphone 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.829
 microphone is generally I mean it sounds 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.319
 Now here at the camera I'm sitting in 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.389
 a lake echoes the room 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.730
 But the quality is really good 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.130
 and the microphone is now at the new one 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.139
 legria mix has gotten even better 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.180
 yes to the front now microphones and 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.019
 again suffer from this, and it is sounded 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.060
 really huge 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.760
 the picture quality because I have none 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.849
 big difference noted 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.139
 Another great advantage is also great 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.030
 the battery life 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.250
 I chose the canon legria mini 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.230
 immediately another additional battery brought the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.450
 has cost 20 euros for itself 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.250
 because there was the term still at 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.960
 an hour to an hour 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.820
 one and a half 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.550
 Customers almost always 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.410
 has been sufficient for the camera at the 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.360
 new legria mini is now one 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.890
 Term of more than three hours 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.800
 yes and that is of course a great 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.640
 story, whatever, more beautiful 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.820
 advantage was 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.460
 furthermore, we have at the delivery 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.960
 already a power supply of this power supply 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.510
 Incidentally, it also fits the old lee 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.790
 greer with the film I'm watching 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.090
 and the power supply is right there 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.730
 means one can also directly the camera 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.780
 connect without battery directly to 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.610
 connect electricity 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.350
 this is as said with the old camera 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.800
 also you have to have the power supply extra 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.740
 Buy and a nice advantage to me 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.150
 also noticed later is this 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:18.390
 the new canon legria mini now sd 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.340
 card has and not mini sd 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.900
 i could have thought for the mini sd 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.910
 Of course you can also get an adapter 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.310
 but that's totally handy now 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.230
 I took a film slide 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.210
 I put the mini sd card directly into mine 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.160
 laptop in and can then directly the 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.680
 data transfer and it is still 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.810
 a great thing good 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.010
 otherwise it was the real thing 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.010
 there are a few more 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.230
 innovations in the camera even if you 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.270
 you can trigger the picture 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.950
 now on the display and so far 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.230
 So a few things change in the 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.530
 but mostly that is 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.600
 Camera equal and my conclusion means 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.790
 now because the new one is also one 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.420
 a little more expensive instead of 100 euro that is 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.460
 My conclusion is if you have this camera 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.050
 often uses when he's like that exactly 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.170
 the camera I needed then 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.810
 does the canon legria mi nix so the 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.030
 new version makes sense if now 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.580
 but says we only come from time to time 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.070
 in use then the old camera 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.150
 the old legria mini absolutely sufficient 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.160
 a great part 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.840
 which is also a bit smaller 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.630
 and therefore also a little bit more handy 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.660
 So I'm really crazy about 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.430
 These cameras are convinced and never want 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.930
 give it back so that I am 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.370
 absolute fan of it I will be the old one 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.190
 camera held for a second 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.520
 perspective and so on is real 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.290
 class 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.090
 I've raved enough now 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.280
 synonymous get no commission or otherwise 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.620
 something but when he looks at Amazon 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.080
 and then really something buys yes 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.970
 It's very open and honest but 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.560
 my concern is not these cameras 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.270
 for sale but I want you the 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.250
 answer that you a clearer answer 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.480
 picture of it will get something for you 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.490
 perhaps appropriate 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.250
 This does not compare these cameras with 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.870
 Great these are not action camps for that 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.260
 you do not use those cameras 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.270
 perfect for a blogger podcaster and 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.100
 people who just make such videos but 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.560
 an action would come that the 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.010
 gopro better it has everything before it 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.300
 disadvantages well that 's it I hoped 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.320
 impression you liked and we 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.320
 pay until next time
