00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.440
 with the girls and welcome to my channel 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.660
 today we are going to use a few empanaditas de 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.940
 fried meat and for this increase a 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.309
 brown and an onion what are we going to 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.550
 to do is to explain the same in strips and 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.289
 then in mini cubes and the same goes 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.720
 to do with the onion we are going to cut 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.759
 good good little girl and let's mix 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.009
 for my taste I say it put more 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.560
 porrón but at that time I had no more 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.150
 Well, these and other meals but good 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.410
 that will be liked by each one if you like 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.290
 more to erase I fall in love where if you 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.440
 they liked green yellow morrón 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.320
 red and I tell you that goes to your liking 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.860
 the more onions they put more bound 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.810
 more is going to render the meat in this case I 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.590
 I did not want it to perform so much because it's for 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.590
 only two people 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.950
 and can also onion 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.950
 green 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:09.470
 the insurance you know is very very rich in 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:12.460
 this kind of empanadas but I did not have to 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.460
 hand none of that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.100
 Now I'm going to put a little oil 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.020
 at the bottom of the pot that I already had 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.899
 warming up 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.149
 and when it is well hot, the 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.979
 oil I'm going to put the onion obviously 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.530
 those video cuts but let it be 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.690
 hot and in the oil 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.619
 and I put everything onion and the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.619
 morrón together 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.539
 make sure you move it around for a while 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.509
 so that the onion does not burn 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.650
 cooking it does not affect it here what I have 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.860
 they are two eggs already boiled and minced 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.770
 that also goes what you like more egg 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.680
 egg now that I'm going to put are 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.410
 olives 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.420
 green you can put black if 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.160
 They want or rather with the olive 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.160
 they can put raisins 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.890
 I'm going to leave it on one side and now 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.849
 the claw is the minced meat this is a 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.590
 kilo of meat palette you expose say 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.780
 the meat they want is more they can 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.970
 buy in a big piece boil it 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.160
 then cut the hand but for same 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.700
 practical is at this time this 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.080
 they also have to move it to 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.120
 as it goes cooking so that 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.250
 everything is very even 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.110
 this is a cup of boiling water 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.750
 and what I'm going to add is a little bottle of 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.700
 vagina meat and vegetable 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.890
 hen also that goes to taste of each 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.840
 who applied it a little bit and I am 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.550
 putting the cup is a matter of 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.620
 stir it well until it dissolves 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.020
 everything and that mediates as a pale color 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.570
 half ugly but good this what is going to 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.600
 give flavor to our empanadas and go 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.520
 to see everything in the pot and let's move it 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.010
 a little if it is to be distributed 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.630
 well and watch the meat now that 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.060
 we leave olives aside we go to 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.010
 integrate with the egg because at last and 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.550
 that we're going to put when everything is 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.550
 cold 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.680
 if you want your ruyman empanadas a 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.469
 little more what you can do is 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.629
 put dad on what I'm putting 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:23.329
 is the thick make half a teaspoon 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.250
 but the salt is if you are using salty 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.540
 or less the amount that they put it I'm going 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.680
 for the peppers hung so that 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.680
 have a little bit of color 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.470
 and I'll put a condiment 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.569
 call for your thing and that I'm giving 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.299
 hard because I did not have much and I wanted to 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.950
 everything came out but but do not abuse yourself because 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.810
 It is usually a little spicy 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.180
 Now we are stirring everything up very very very 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.599
 well so that it grabs the color of the 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.599
 condiments 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.659
 Now I have all the cold mixture that 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.659
 I'm going to add the egg and the olive 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.599
 can incorporate it when hot 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.540
 also but good I chose to put it to the 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.579
 last ones and I also the regional ones 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.540
 let's mix everything very well 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.540
 to integrate it 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.889
 and more or less there has to be something like that 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.090
 you see the appointment but I assure you it is 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.980
 very very rich 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.800
 to fill our empanadas has 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:38.389
 to be very cold the filling so that 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.389
 the caps do not get softer 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.230
 This way they can do as they want d 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.850
 to seal the empanadas but just like 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.330
 I'm going to show how I'm going to do it and not 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.330
 he knows 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.270
 we are going to paste everything very very well and what 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.340
 let's do is put the tip towards 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.380
 inside and with the little bank that was there 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.150
 we increase again in and the 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.670
 back little bank that was left towards 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.730
 in and so on in the process of all the 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:13.020
 empanada the little tip that remains the put 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:17.599
 inside the tip inside and so on 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.599
 if you can not close it with your fork 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.150
 and now the end left her little leg 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.010
 outside there are people who screw up 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.180
 but I did not like to know where it started 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.180
 to finish the pie 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.190
 while almost of stay he was 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.889
 giving food to Miguel Reyes what I 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.680
 asked so if some little hands come by 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.070
 there is my daughter who asked me for the filling 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.070
 of the empanada 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.949
 with seeing you just in everything they mark are 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:53.360
 more or less to fill two sources and 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:55.360
 mean they are almost 40 empanadas I'll 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.330
 I would say there would be 35 stops of something like that 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.760
 because that package was 20 caps 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.460
 each eye 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.319
 ah 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.200
 what they can do is also search 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:12.070
 a recipe for the dough and do it by hand 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.950
 there they see how is one 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.750
 source of empanadas and other times maría 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.640
 washing the dishes with this help friends 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.130
 Pay attention that I'm going to show you 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.320
 the caps that I was using we are 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.900
 giving one specifically for frying 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.240
 because the city is cool but if not 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.570
 they have to grab the criollas or to 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.870
 oven that is the same good I will continue 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:37.690
 here filling our things and 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.700
 I say you can enlarge it in this region or 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.520
 putting it drier and putting more 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:46.000
 egg or a potato because it always falls 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.830
 some of unforeseen and good we can 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.960
 piloting with that is also good 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.550
 to explain what is what I'm going 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.490
 to do the same, I'm going to show you some 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.230
 final of how they were but it 's good 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.940
 do them once a month and have the 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.600
 surprise then when we want the 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.320
 we take out and go straight to the oven 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.090
 or africa obviously 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.040
 you do not have to let them thaw 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.640
 because they will all soften and start 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.640
 to burst 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:24.160
 I'm putting enough oil in one 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:28.060
 pot enough for a tape 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.460
 the empanada not much more what hardly 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.080
 the lid 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.630
 now show them more or less the 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.139
 amount that I put are that the many 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.139
 little 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.990
 and I said when the oil is very very 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.270
 hot to talk can you put a 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:48.230
 apple bit and throw it there for 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.230
 see if it is already hot 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.530
 they run out well there I have 

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:57.990
 paper napkins to absorb a 

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.599
 little more of the oil we can also 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.000
 ask in fat is not my taste but 

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:05.550
 Well there I'm opening out the 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.780
 vaporcito very very rich if thanks 

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.780
 for watching the video he sent them months
