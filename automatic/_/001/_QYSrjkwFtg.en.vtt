00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.529
 I will not enter any game 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:33.180

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.309
 each and cash it is a very good kit and me 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.270

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.440
 from that link kit that the sad had a kit 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.780
 very cool 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.700
 the first thing the 20km cash a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.510
 first thing this package itself 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.989
 player 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.469
 this package is a package I'm going to buy 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.100
 he is buying already the player 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.050
 Now what I'm going to buy next I 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.350
 I'm going to buy the carso after molds and g1 and 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.990
 3,500 that's 4 thousand buying this house 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.310
 memory that I do not go team now I 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.350
 I'll stay with two thousand and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.939
 five hundred but what am I going to do with 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.650
 These two thousand and five hundred 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.500
 It's obvious that I'm going to buy something 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.530
 Good a knife but I will not buy 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.750
 none of these knife and machete funks 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.970
 I will not buy my the knife in 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.640
 my opinion is better is the bone knife 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.360
 she is cheaper than the mall 1,300 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.700
 and because she has the weight without 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.400
 means that knife and the knife that you 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.040
 runs faster on the winning game 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.150
 fame that there are 99 and a funny is not stealing 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.540
 camping remembering that I play only the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.670
 bed linen I'm not a cash robot and buying 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.070
 now this one will not equip either 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.380
 there are going to be 1,200 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.360
 Now I would say the following for you. 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.640
 now it 's a choice 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.850
 I'm going to buy the bang plus flash that goes 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.729
 give exactly Sunday 24 and cats but have 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.240
 people who prefer the same wp enamel 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.429
 than the one that is the poison and that 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.310
 but it is assumed that it is not stealing camp if 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.230
 you use it in a cfa field but it ends 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.670
 face fields will complain 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.610
 so much that it falls on the sef for the politec 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.069

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.040

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.080

 It picks up and makes the watch faster 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.959

 so today 's video is just showing it 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.640
 some people asked me what I 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.650
 use of title obtained in the case the baby 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.930
 Captain Tanya did not have time to pick up here. 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.340
 the master of this discharge but whoever has 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:51.610
 use if an account is majored and banned 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.520
 have the titles use this in case I am 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.320
 using it is that most important use of 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.960
 all who were special people all 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.910
 use and a grenade launch 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.730
 distance is good to make the bugs wins 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.310
 nothing and who has the penultimate one too 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.160
 there is too much distance and the area of explosion 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.350

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.690
