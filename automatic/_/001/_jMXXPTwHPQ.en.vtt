 Afternoon to the seagrass 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.660
 Vendee fans mostly come to encourage Nicolas Vogondy 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.479
 the number 1 turquoise asset on this time of nations 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:14.849

 the stake was in shape he was eager to shine again on 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.659
 the Vendean lands 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.989
 but the blésois of beat box or telecom will quickly disillusion 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.409
 party before the grandissimes favorites he has never been in the game for the 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:27.800

 nicolas vogondy finishes far ahead at more than 3 minutes 30 behind the winner 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.610
 david millar 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.920
 he had a pressure to what I had it was my last official race 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.660
 with the raw and com 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.570

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.680
 Chantonnay in Vendée I finished my 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.910
 I wanted to do well I have good 5th session a good result even if I him 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.860
 say a top 300 was superb 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.880
 for me it's this amp is I gave it all is the main 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.190
 whoever joins the team cofidis his next season finally ranks 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.010
 sixth on arrival 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.759
 one thing is certain the 48 km route 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.540
 without particular difficulty 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.050
 did some damage 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.850
 with a violent headwind at the end of the course 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.710
 suspense he did not disappoint me 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.130
 quote of mila vice-world champion in title 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.130
 who came for the first time to the seagrass crushed the competition 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.240
 and panicked the time his time 58 minutes and 53 seconds 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.320
 boasson hagen the champion of norway time trial the second at close to 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.230
 two minutes 20 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.630
 the best ones to speak then of course 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.630
 place to david millar deûle the great champion 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.090
 they would have to stop pulverized the record is not big risks I 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.540
 I was personally expecting them to descend below their memory 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.390
 but at this point I do not imagine so very very very very beautiful feat 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.040
 on his part as well as of course that jeannie longo who took the opportunity to 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.200
 pocket his sixth victory which is a record 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.440
 Jeannie Longo decidedly inexhaustible to soon 52 years 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.300
 his first victory on the time of the herbaria goes back to 1987 it is more than 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.480
 twenty years later she is still there to meet the summits 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.430
 very applauded throughout the course the Grenoble has traveled the 21 km in 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.930
 29 minutes the same American soil allows us to 2nd 30 seconds
