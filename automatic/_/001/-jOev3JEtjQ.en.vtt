00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
reason we use the concealed zipper

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.160 
reason we use the concealed zipper
fouché<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.520> has<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:30.180> groove<00:01:30.479> underneath

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
fouché it has a little groove underneath

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.210 
fouché it has a little groove underneath
which<00:01:31.560> enables<00:01:32.189> us<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> sew<00:01:33.150> along<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.829> teeth

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
which enables us to sew along the teeth

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.140 
which enables us to sew along the teeth
of<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.750> zipper<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.220> side<00:01:38.579> we

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
of the zipper so that on this side we

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.719 
of the zipper so that on this side we
have<00:01:39.180> its<00:01:39.540> sign<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.350> an<00:01:40.500> order<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.159> save<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729

have its sign in an order not to save a
zipper<00:01:42.090> at<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.619> take<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.040> zipper<00:01:44.460> we
