 separate to recycle recycle to improve 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.059
 p planet earth has more than 6 thousand 400 million inhabitants 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.079
 to his understanding if I lie 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.179
 notably also cause their deterioration 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.870
 in 1992 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.269
 the social and political leaders of the world 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.640
 is one in taking definitive actions 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.199
 against this criterion 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.929
 and with the participation of 178 nations elaborate a single agenda to mark 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.570
 defined models win 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.570
 and to know the human being and the planet in which we live 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.340
 so is 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.960
 as through the organization of the united nations 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.800
 suu kyi so the 21 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.300
 to promote sustainable development from several aspects 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.950
 being one of the most important the elaboration of unpublished strategies 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.710
 to define the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.590
 no effects of environmental degradation 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.570
 178 nations committed to the planet earth 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.140
 a tijuana with determined actions responds to the call 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.520
 according to inegi tijuana 13 at a rate of 80 thousand people a year and of 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.720
 keep this growth for 2030 tijuana will be the fourth most city 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.040
 populated of the Mexican Republic 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.240
 at this rate the government will require an annual budget of 5 billion 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.210
 of pesos only to cover the demand for basic services that currently 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 reaches 85% of the population 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.620
 the government headed by Jorge RamÃ³n after winning the elections to the 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.140
 he found a deficit for more than 350 million pesos 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.000
 and a store of around 600 million pesos between 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.120
 urban structure 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.360
 practically in ruins 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.940
 With this panorama in January 2008, Tijuana was immersed in a crisis in 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.360
 garbage collection in a city that produce 2 thousand 300 tons of 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.710
 daily garbage 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.310
 only ten trucks covered less than half of the 555 routes so 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.120
 For two months the Tijuana residents together with the government participated 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.280
 collecting the waste that was in the streets 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.200
 with an army of more 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.980
 more than five thousand people and the restructuring of mechanics and 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.299
 collection routes 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.549
 the initial crisis was overcome 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.949
 this is how the project for the installation and operation was born 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.849
 of a citrus plant solid waste action 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.659
 to thrive recycling city hall 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.199
 municipal begins 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.009
 where the garbage collection truck arrives and unloads in the hopper 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.799
 later that happens through a bag opener 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.689
 It is a machine designed 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.169
 with seven knives the knives are made of stainless steel with 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.099
 sky titanium bridge that does is there will be in the garbage bags without 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.589
 damage the recyclables 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:03.889
 later that happens through a separation band and what is done is that 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.189
 Separate recyclable materials as a person 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.639
 yes plastics 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.279
 later that goes through a second a second phase in what it does is that 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.709
 separates what metals are 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.679
 like copper aluminum 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.219
 and what it is to tie 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.909
 after that 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.590
 we come to a process that is uncovering this separation by density where I fell 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.899
 the organic of the inorganic 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:32.539
 is separated and once we have separated the inorganic passes through the machine 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:34.019
 Celtic player 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.930
 In simple words, a washing machine of this material is being a washing machine 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.639
 that the ones you make who come out completely clean 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.989
 They are our and key 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.920
 we handle chemical materials like this clear 1% 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.129
 but within only 1% and 1% sodium sulfate 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.879
 these chemical residues what they do is that they eliminate odors 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.260
 eliminate bacteria and purify our material the amates comes out completely 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.259
 clean for export 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.259
 and comes out completely compacted we have a compactor machine 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.730
 I know what he does is that he shares all the laterals and has the capacity to 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.609
 compact 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.019
 paperboard 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.639
 ap the aluminum plastic including what is the minutes 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.750
 and has a capacity see the general PD PD Elias Sanchez highlights 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:28.399
 completely once finished the material coming out as a product 

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:31.309
 finished happens what is the final phase 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:34.099
 that we are talking about it is a pulhac peace 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.309
 that at the moment of being weighed it emits a vaccine a piquete efe weight 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:40.860
 Automatically capture system 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.840
 and it is sent from that lie attends the transport municipality for is the 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.460
 town hall which has the dairy control that we are really recycling 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.050
 with this eliminates flies major problems within the level of what 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.270
 it's ours and also two 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.490
 1 this topic of ecology 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.020
 giving it life and go of formality to the current norm 4 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.749
 eliminate the social problem of the pepenadores 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:06.320
 since all our staff that works here 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.010
 100% senators are people who are giving themselves a life tunnel better a 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.310
 quality of life better and finally 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.949
 as the problem because we have 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.870
 as soon as it is a common expense in that garbage we are converting it 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.279
 in a constant investment 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.139
 an income 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.219
 sanz to the internet 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:25.409
 cuts 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.069
 cc oo 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.550
 economic 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.550
 goal is achieved 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:37.319
 precisely lengthens 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.689
 preventing my future 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.740
 festive 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.189
 important in 2001 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.189
 to be used 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.099
 they also provoke 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.909
 brokenness 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.599
 with the design of this new integral strategy of waste segregation 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.319
 solves not only the problem of efficient collection of 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:03.020
 The trash 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.460
 but immediate social and economic benefits are obtained and 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.589
 tangible the government of the city of tijuana 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:16.049
 it breaks like this with the scheme of putting aside the problem keeping the inertia 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.340
 and becomes the axis of the solution generating a virtuous circle of 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.830
 trash
