00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.100 
idea because when you have subscribers
in<00:03:28.160> number<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:28.760> do<00:03:28.910> like<00:03:29.090> 125<00:03:29.690> thousand

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
in number that you do like 125 thousand

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.930 
in number that you do like 125 thousand
or<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:30.230> last<00:03:30.560> i<00:03:30.680> checked<00:03:30.709> when<00:03:31.580> you<00:03:31.640> have<00:03:31.790> that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
or so last i checked when you have that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.789 
or so last i checked when you have that
many<00:03:32.180> subscribers<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:33.380> kind<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.650> have<00:03:33.769> to

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
many subscribers you kind of have to

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.990 
many subscribers you kind of have to

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.130 
channel basically focuses on gaming and
the<00:04:48.560> reason<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:48.860> say<00:04:48.890> it<00:04:49.220> it<00:04:49.820> hits<00:04:50.150> home<00:04:50.780> with<00:04:50.840> me

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
the reason I say it it hits home with me

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.390 
the reason I say it it hits home with me
is<00:04:51.290> because<00:04:51.410> I'm<00:04:51.650> kind<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:51.950> in<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.190> boat

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
is because I'm kind of in that boat

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.460 
is because I'm kind of in that boat
right<00:04:52.610> now<00:04:52.640> too<00:04:52.790> I<00:04:53.150> still<00:04:53.990> want<00:04:54.140> to<00:04:54.200> do<00:04:54.260> gaming

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.060 
videos and I definitely enjoy a world of
warcraft<00:04:56.870> but<00:04:57.440> there<00:04:57.590> are<00:04:57.680> other<00:04:57.800> games<00:04:57.950> that

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
start a new channel in my opinion even

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.440 
start a new channel in my opinion even
though<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.520> would<00:05:28.820> be<00:05:28.910> happy<00:05:29.180> with<00:05:29.210> you
