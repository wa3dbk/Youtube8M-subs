00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.680
 Hello, welcome, help from 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.040
 teacher 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.089
 We have thousands of exercises to try 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.160
 and get good grades in math 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.320
 good physics and chemistry let's do 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.940
 this exercise that has sent me a 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.340
 follower that is an exam to see if it was 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.800
 complicated we will not see anything we paste 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.840
 a block of elevator floors elevates a 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.150
 load of 700 kilograms up to a height 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.460
 10 meters in a time of 10 seconds 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.610
 if the power consumed by the motor is 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.260
 of 8 thousand watts determines its performance 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.100
 good this performance tests 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.739
 they are a bit complicated, yes, so 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.050
 of the two powers that are not bad 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.519
 then I'm going to read up here and go to 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.769
 remember the power and then we already 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.659
 We will fight, I will give you the brasilia as the 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.339
 performance is worth the first thing 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.769
 we have to always calculate in the 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.190
 performance problems the power 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.969
 useful is to say what we have 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.280
 used of the motor is worth understanding what 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.710
 I mean is to say what really 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.239
 does the engine then what are we going to 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.860
 to do is calculate the work with some 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.360
 of work we go to the law of 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.890
 conservation 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.140
 energy then we say work from 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.830
 lift yes because it's a force 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.620
 outside plus the initial kinetic energy 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.230
 plus the initial potential energy is 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.270
 equal to the final kinetic reality more 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.130
 the potential energy if we who 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.130
 we have here a block 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.920
 we raise 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.200
 at a height of 10 meters and we leave it 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.939
 there 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.180
 what happens in the middle does not matter what 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:43.060
 important is that here the block if the 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.460
 elevator is standing and here like that 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.310
 is the elevator stands also 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.619
 then how much is the final velocity and the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.909
 initial velocity zero when something does not 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.939
 has speed has no energy 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.490
 kinetic final kinetic energy and the 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.460
 initial kinetic energy is zero worth 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.899
 also here how tall is the elevator 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.569
 is on the ground then natural 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.579
 zero elevators if the height of the sensor 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.769
 is zero which means that energy 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.080
 power the elevator is also zero 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.489
 worth to remember that whenever 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.130
 we throw away the conservation law is of 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.370
 the most important energy will only be 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.810
 be perfect to put in our head what 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.230
 first we have to look at vale 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.640
 then we already have the equation with the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.000
 elevator work equal energy 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.910
 final potential this is the start to 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.060
 end will go up elevator like this 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.440
 up there and it would stop okay ok we can 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.569
 calculate this power at the end yes 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.460
 because we know the height not the height 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.680
 it tells us that they are 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.310
 10 meters then we will always calculate 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.780
 that we have a height we can calculate 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.780
 a potential energy or vice versa 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:57.790
 the mass says problems that are 700 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.790
 the severity is 98 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.050
 the height of that and a half 68,600 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.120
 July that would be potential energy 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.100
 final that we know is equal to 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.080
 work that we have shown here that 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.100
 performs the elevator then the work that 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.830
 the elevator is 68,600 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.930
 Julius is worth once we have the 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.720
 I work as they give us the time we're going 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.050
 to calculate the power because because the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.239
 power is equal to work match the 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.080
 then we have the work that 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.910
 are 68 thousand 600 match the time they are 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.920
 10 seconds to look without a calculator 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:43.320
 what cool xavier in 6.460 know if it 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.040
 wrong for good and that would be 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.650
 Julius there was no leopard by list 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.170
 are watts can be concentrated one already 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.450
 let's say it but this is very important 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.950
 this is what the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.970
 lift the power that we have used 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.069
 of this elevator is worth it is this 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.349
 useful power 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.090
 ok this is fundamental that what 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.310
 you understand is worth or gives a lot 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.079
 with it but it never hurts to follow 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.299
 giving an ember with things 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.609
 important with the keys of the 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.190
 exercises worth is very important 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.930
 understand the keys so there's down 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.310
 hey, sergio vas, stop giving us the 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.139
 Ember in the comments 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.210
 you can indicate that they have understood 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.580
 He has not yet understood 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.960
 keep giving me the badge ok you know 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.810
 that I like to talk to you and that 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.130
 tell me how baltera is good 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.020
 we already have the power and then 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.820
 now let's go to the performance formula 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.070
 because we who ask us the 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.960
 problem is performance performance 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.449
 is equal to the useful power 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.059
 by the theoretical starting power 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.379
 portion is worth what is the useful power 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:53.789
 we just said that they are out and then 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:56.430
 are 6,860 the theoretical power of what 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:05:00.979
 theoretically has consumed what we 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.979
 they say the 8000 engine 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.319
 and by a hundred anyway remember with 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.699
 a performance always has to be 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:12.620
 less than 100 85 75 also a 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.889
 performance can not give more than if in 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:20.719
 that's crazy, you can not go 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:26.569
 performance 115% bundled fatal bad 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:27.460
 eye to the data gentlemen then we put a 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.229
 all right 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.939
 you have understood me you comment liza 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.249
 button I like to share by 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:36.020
 social networks come and we go with 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:40.659
 next exercise that's going to be so 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.659
 less just as fun come see you
