this<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.680> video<00:00:01.979> by<00:00:02.220> rich<00:00:02.429> pin<00:00:02.730> today<00:00:03.060> we're

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
this is a video by rich pin today we're

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.960 
this is a video by rich pin today we're
going<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.780> be<00:00:04.140> checking<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.859> diff<00:00:05.370> pin<00:00:05.759> or

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
going to be checking the diff pin or

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.410 
going to be checking the diff pin or
differential<00:00:06.720> pin<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.859> want<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.130> first<00:00:08.490> get

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
differential pin you want to first get

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.299 
differential pin you want to first get
your<00:00:09.809> car<00:00:10.500> up<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.160> air<00:00:11.690> so<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:13.410> can<00:00:13.650> spin

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
your car up in the air so you can spin

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.580 
your car up in the air so you can spin
the<00:00:14.370> tires<00:00:14.960> because<00:00:15.960> you're<00:00:16.230> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.440> need

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the tires because you're going to need

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.380 
the tires because you're going to need
to<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.369> check<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:18.600> diff<00:00:18.810> pen<00:00:23.210> now<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to do that to check the diff pen now the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.269 
to do that to check the diff pen now the
next<00:00:24.750> thing<00:00:24.869> we've<00:00:25.019> got<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.890> we've<00:00:26.250> got

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
next thing we've got to do is we've got

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:35.530 
next thing we've got to do is we've got
to<00:00:26.670> drain<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.539> fluid<00:00:28.820> out<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.449> transaxle

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:01:12.109 

this<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.930> drain<00:00:37.380> plug<00:00:37.590> right<00:00:37.860> here

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.950 

we<00:01:12.659> don't<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.079> to<00:01:13.259> drain<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.859> of<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.960> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
we don't have to drain all of it just a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.719 
we don't have to drain all of it just a
little<00:01:15.990> bit<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.429> I'm<00:01:17.789> draining<00:01:19.340> all<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.579> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
little bit but I'm draining all of it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.190 
little bit but I'm draining all of it
because<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.679> really<00:01:22.679> doesn't<00:01:22.979> matter<00:01:24.200> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
because it really doesn't matter it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.690 
because it really doesn't matter it
doesn't<00:01:25.500> take<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.740> long<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:27.289> drain<00:01:28.289> the

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
doesn't take that long to drain the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:37.100 
doesn't take that long to drain the
whole<00:01:29.700> transaxle

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:52.120 

okay<00:01:38.010> that's<00:01:38.340> enough<00:01:39.350> put<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> plug<00:01:40.740> back<00:01:40.770> in

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.600 

next<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.790> find<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.800> vehicle<00:01:55.800> speed

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
next we have to find the vehicle speed

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.690 
next we have to find the vehicle speed
sensor<00:01:58.880> which<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.080> located<00:02:01.160> back<00:02:02.160> here<00:02:02.220> on<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
sensor which is located back here on the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.980 
sensor which is located back here on the
transaxle

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.530 

so<00:02:09.530> there<00:02:09.710> it<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:09.950> right<00:02:10.340> there<00:02:11.260> with<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:13.540> blue

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
so there it is right there with the blue

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.660 
so there it is right there with the blue
connector<00:02:15.080> on<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:17.890> now<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> next<00:02:19.370> thing<00:02:19.490> we

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
connector on it now the next thing we

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.490 
connector on it now the next thing we
have<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.030> do<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.420> take<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.810> electrical

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
have to do is take the electrical

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.260 
have to do is take the electrical
connector<00:02:22.130> off<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.240> sensor<00:02:24.580> just<00:02:25.580> pull<00:02:25.910> up<00:02:26.060> on

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
connector off the sensor just pull up on

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.140 
connector off the sensor just pull up on
this<00:02:26.420> little<00:02:26.750> lock<00:02:26.960> right<00:02:27.290> here

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
this little lock right here

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.990 
this little lock right here
and<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:29.840> will<00:02:30.019> remove<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:31.430> electrical

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
and that will remove the electrical

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.809 
and that will remove the electrical
collector<00:02:33.099> from<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.220> sensor

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
collector from the sensor

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:43.099 
collector from the sensor
now<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.530> center<00:02:37.530> itself<00:02:38.599> is<00:02:41.030> has<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.060> hex<00:02:42.689> on<00:02:42.959> it

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
now the center itself is has a hex on it

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.880 
now the center itself is has a hex on it
right<00:02:43.349> here<00:02:43.709> which<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.219> a<00:02:44.489> 24<00:02:45.299> millimeter<00:02:45.890> now

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
right here which is a 24 millimeter now

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.369 
right here which is a 24 millimeter now
if<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.159> don't<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.579> a<00:02:47.609> wrench<00:02:47.909> for<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.379> you

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
if you don't have a wrench for that you

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.339 
if you don't have a wrench for that you
can<00:02:49.590> use<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:50.069> an<00:02:50.310> adjustable<00:02:51.030> wrench<00:02:51.349> to

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
can use in an adjustable wrench to

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:10.520 
can use in an adjustable wrench to
remove<00:02:52.379> that

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.649 

okay<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.739> think<00:03:12.099> we<00:03:12.280> could<00:03:12.489> get<00:03:12.879> it<00:03:13.000> out<00:03:13.120> by<00:03:13.359> hand

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
okay I think we could get it out by hand

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:33.100 
okay I think we could get it out by hand
now

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:45.060 

and<00:03:34.110> there<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:36.200> vehicle<00:03:37.200> speed<00:03:37.440> sensor

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.610 

now<00:03:46.070> if<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.490> can<00:03:46.700> see<00:03:47.000> this<00:03:47.390> I've<00:03:47.720> placed<00:03:48.350> a

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
now if you can see this I've placed a

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.580 
now if you can see this I've placed a
mirror<00:03:49.240> above<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:51.190> hole<00:03:52.190> where<00:03:52.610> we<00:03:52.640> took<00:03:53.030> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
mirror above the hole where we took the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.960 
mirror above the hole where we took the
vehicle<00:03:54.590> speed<00:03:54.710> sensor<00:03:54.920> out<00:03:55.580> of<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:57.500> we<00:03:57.710> can

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
vehicle speed sensor out of so we can

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:05.290 
vehicle speed sensor out of so we can
inspect<00:03:59.050> the<00:04:00.050> diff<00:04:00.290> pin<00:04:03.130> now<00:04:04.130> if<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.460> go<00:04:04.610> when

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
inspect the diff pin now if you go when

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.660 
inspect the diff pin now if you go when
you're<00:04:05.420> looking<00:04:05.780> in<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.170> VSS<00:04:06.950> hole<00:04:07.220> this<00:04:07.490> is

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
you're looking in the VSS hole this is

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.190 
you're looking in the VSS hole this is
what<00:04:07.850> you'll<00:04:08.060> see<00:04:09.580> you'll<00:04:10.580> see<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:11.120> pin<00:04:11.870> right

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
what you'll see you'll see the pin right

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.599 
what you'll see you'll see the pin right
there<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.710> can<00:04:12.860> see<00:04:12.890> half<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.840> pin<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.609> what

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
there you can see half the pin and what

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.820 
there you can see half the pin and what
you<00:04:16.730> want<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.060> do<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:17.390> see<00:04:17.630> if<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:18.170> pin<00:04:18.530> is

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
you want to do is see if the pin is

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.620 
you want to do is see if the pin is
flush<00:04:19.130> with<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:20.180> carrier<00:04:21.610> now<00:04:22.610> we're<00:04:23.450> going

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
flush with the carrier now we're going

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.480 
flush with the carrier now we're going
to<00:04:23.750> rotate<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:25.700> carrier<00:04:26.270> by<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.320> tires<00:04:27.860> that

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
to rotate the carrier by the tires that

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.400 
to rotate the carrier by the tires that
we<00:04:28.580> have<00:04:28.790> up<00:04:28.940> ania<00:04:29.300> make<00:04:29.870> sure<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.290> the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
we have up ania make sure that the

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.030 
we have up ania make sure that the
transaxle<00:04:31.130> is<00:04:31.550> in<00:04:31.730> neutral<00:04:32.890> now<00:04:33.890> rotate<00:04:36.040> we're

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
transaxle is in neutral now rotate we're

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.920 
transaxle is in neutral now rotate we're
going<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.280> rotate<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.790> carrier<00:04:38.240> all<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.780> way

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
going to rotate the carrier all the way

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.800 
going to rotate the carrier all the way
to<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.320> other<00:04:39.620> side<00:04:40.130> so<00:04:41.000> we<00:04:41.180> can<00:04:41.360> see<00:04:41.630> the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
to the other side so we can see the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.760 
to the other side so we can see the
other<00:04:42.020> end<00:04:42.350> of<00:04:42.470> that<00:04:42.650> pin<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:44.180> make<00:04:44.390> sure<00:04:44.770> that

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
other end of that pin to make sure that

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.150 
other end of that pin to make sure that
it's<00:04:45.980> flush<00:04:46.340> with<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:48.410> other<00:04:48.650> side<00:04:48.980> of<00:04:49.100> the

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
it's flush with the other side of the

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.610 
it's flush with the other side of the
carrier

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.770 

and<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.310> should<00:04:55.520> be<00:04:55.640> coming<00:04:55.970> into<00:04:56.090> view<00:04:56.420> short

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
and it should be coming into view short

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.350 
and it should be coming into view short
late

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.839 

and<00:05:00.629> there's<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.710> other<00:05:01.740> end<00:05:02.189> of<00:05:02.849> the<00:05:03.120> dip<00:05:03.330> pen

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
and there's the other end of the dip pen

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.749 
and there's the other end of the dip pen
so<00:05:05.849> make<00:05:06.479> sure<00:05:06.509> that<00:05:07.319> it<00:05:07.949> is<00:05:08.159> the<00:05:08.310> equal

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
so make sure that it is the equal

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:14.950 
so make sure that it is the equal
distance<00:05:09.360> on<00:05:09.659> both<00:05:10.229> sides<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.129> carrier

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.749 

and<00:05:15.960> that's<00:05:16.229> all<00:05:16.500> there<00:05:16.650> is<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:17.069> checking<00:05:17.520> your

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
and that's all there is to checking your

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.360 
and that's all there is to checking your
dip<00:05:18.060> pen
