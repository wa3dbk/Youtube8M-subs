00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
mean I started running and then there
was<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.739> little<00:01:01.980> bit<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.239> fluid<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.449> pretty

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
was a little bit of fluid but pretty

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.690 
was a little bit of fluid but pretty
much<00:01:03.870> nothing<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.559> everything<00:01:05.369> seems<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.610> be

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
much nothing so everything seems to be

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.130 
much nothing so everything seems to be
very<00:01:05.760> positive<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> moment<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:06.869> i<00:01:06.900> guess
