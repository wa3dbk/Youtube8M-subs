 stuffed with spinach with feta cheese 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.750
 going to love about for when 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.050
 those days that you have guests 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.019
 wants to give turkey is a good recipe look 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.970
 let's start in a frying pan 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.410
 mean what we are going to start doing to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.630
 SautÃ©ing is not delicious and nutritious 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.820
 spinach milk spinach apart from that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.239
 it has a lot of fibers it has a lot 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.640
 iron vitamin b vitamin b12 with its 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.920
 teacher who knows that it is very economical 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.530
 always and in the market nothing more 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 try to wash it very well pass the by 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.320
 very important drinking water leave it now 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.510
 the time that you remove the water does not 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.090
 go see what you have to do is 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.340
 pick up the plates so they are not 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.160
 go to put again all the dirty that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.580
 it went to the surface then 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.220
 let's sautÃ© the onion of the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.350
 butter will see it very followed by 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.300
 here in December I loved the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.810
 butter in these times are 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.970
 I really think I need 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.040
 necessary ingredients let's add 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.090
 to brazil 'spinach 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.310
 enough spinach you know that the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.439
 spinach is greatly reduced because 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.650
 It also has a lot of water 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.620
 so 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.620
 we finite it 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.420
 and we are going to see how it is reduced 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.420
 combined with the heat 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.369
 our onion 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.060
 and from the butter we're going to put a 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.060
 little salt 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.250
 rich truth and good I'll go 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.969
 telling what we are going to do here I have 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.090
 the ranchera ask you to ranchera the most 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.130
 great that you have to simulate a skirt and 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.979
 This will help us to be able to do 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.250
 much simpler roll we go to 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.510
 accompany him on this occasion 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.400
 carrots as garnish mushrooms 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.610
 that are also simple days there are always 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.430
 in the super and potatoes are potatoes cambray 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.189
 Exactly we are going to leave the skin 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.370
 and if you do not get potatoes chaps and what 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:29.939
 you can do it's also good to cut some 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.219
 large cubes of regular potatoes and then 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:36.709
 leave the skin too if you like we're going 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.709
 to put olive oil 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.099
 well rich and this ingredient that good 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.099
 in this time I also like a lot 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.519
 use a little bit of fresh rosemary 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.860
 chopped with the herbs as they are there 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.220
 to go slowly lady if you never 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.680
 has used it, use it little by little so that 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.110
 you will not be too strong and do not go 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.970
 to overwhelm the family if we were a 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.940
 tap then you will like 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.750
 Pepper 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.850
 well and look here we have our 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.140
 mix this will go together with the meat 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.820
 you will see it as the spinach has 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.160
 sweaty 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.330
 We will continue adding ingredients 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.250
 more flavor we are going to put red pepper 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:31.480
 how rich truth truly smells rich 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.390
 chubby if christmas colors green red 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.310
 and white lady you have to leave 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.260
 preparing and mentally physically 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.690
 because we have to consent to the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.430
 family and be prepared nothing that 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.440
 we do not organize anything that we do not know 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.870
 what do we have to know what are we going to 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.820
 do and if you your recipes the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.340
 print with for ingredients with 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.740
 time nobody will catch you unprepared 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.280
 then this is going to be a party 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.740
 really christmas we add garlic 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.250
 and do not know how the red pepper smells 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:11.240
 he liked parsley very well 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.910
 and we have our sauteed here ready 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.310
 of spinach now to give it more flavor 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.650
 what we are going to do is mix it with 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.560
 feta cheese here I have feta cheese 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.170
 when it is already cold, preferably what 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.510
 we mix then this will be our 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.529
 filling mire 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.880
 we go 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:34.230
 to distribute 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.230
 our filling 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.039
 cute can also be a breast 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.000
 of chicken opens a chicken breast 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:47.009
 they make milanesa and you can also 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.969
 roll up you know that the recipe is 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.969
 extremely cabbage 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:58.429
 we press well well well and look at this 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:03.439
 rollito is going to go to a container or a 

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:04.729
 tray for oven and here what we are going to 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:10.270
 do 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.270
 is to place our potatoes on one side 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:22.060
 the mushrooms and so will enter the 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:26.200
 oven at 375 degrees by approximately 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:29.320
 40 minutes I'm going to put it in the oven 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.780
 and after that elapsed time 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.870
 uncovered very important so that it 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.110
 can do well well baked golden 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.350

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.759

 how can you adapt it if you believe 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:06.529
 necessary and if not good then nothing else what 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.039
 Rolls puts a toothpick and is 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:12.490
