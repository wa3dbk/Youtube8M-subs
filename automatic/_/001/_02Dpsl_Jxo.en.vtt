I think public knowledge of how serious

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.280 
I think public knowledge of how serious
this<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:09.080> my<00:02:10.009> own<00:02:10.160> personal<00:02:10.789> view<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.900> we

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
this is my own personal view is that we

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.930 
this is my own personal view is that we
have<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.620> do<00:02:12.740> something<00:02:13.040> about<00:02:13.310> cigarettes

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
have to do something about cigarettes

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.210 
have to do something about cigarettes
and<00:02:14.240> what<00:02:15.080> government<00:02:15.590> has<00:02:15.740> done<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.130> past

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
and what government has done in the past

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.059 
and what government has done in the past
is<00:02:16.880> essentially<00:02:17.600> just<00:02:18.200> raise<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.500> tobacco

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
is essentially just raise the tobacco

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.330 
is essentially just raise the tobacco
tax<00:02:19.520> my<00:02:20.390> own<00:02:20.600> view<00:02:20.960> is<00:02:20.990> that<00:02:21.290> some<00:02:21.800> attention

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
tax my own view is that some attention

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.520 
tax my own view is that some attention
should<00:02:22.520> be<00:02:22.580> given<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.600> carcinogenic
