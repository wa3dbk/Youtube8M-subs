people<00:00:20.490> would<00:00:20.789> run<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.180> play<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.990> wait<00:00:22.170> for

the running back to cut across the

the running back to cut across the
middle<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.850> he<00:00:23.910> would<00:00:24.029> often<00:00:24.210> beat<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
middle and he would often beat the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.089 
middle and he would often beat the
linebacker<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.470> year<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.800> doesn't

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
linebacker but this year that doesn't

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.130 
linebacker but this year that doesn't
seem<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> case<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.510> here's<00:00:27.720> how<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.930> run

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
seem to be the case but here's how I run

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.609 
seem to be the case but here's how I run
it<00:00:28.289> i<00:00:28.439> put<00:00:29.250> x<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> comeback<00:00:30.449> route<00:00:30.720> or<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> curl

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it i put x on a comeback route or a curl

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.950 
it i put x on a comeback route or a curl
route<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.099> i<00:00:32.160> put<00:00:32.430> circle<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> drag<00:00:33.719> route

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
route and i put circle on a drag route

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.200 
route and i put circle on a drag route
now<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.340> attack<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> middle

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
now this is going to attack the middle

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.430 
now this is going to attack the middle
of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> field<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.809> all<00:00:36.960> starts<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.410> the

of the field and it all starts on the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.430 
of the field and it all starts on the
left<00:00:37.710> side<00:00:37.860> now<00:00:38.700> if<00:00:39.090> my<00:00:39.149> linebacker<00:00:39.719> locks<00:00:40.230> up

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

my running back I'm know I'm going to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.400 
my running back I'm know I'm going to
hit<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.059> my<00:00:42.149> curls<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.989> dragging

here we go here's a prime example vs

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.610 
here we go here's a prime example vs
zone<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.450> purple<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> get<00:00:49.350> dragged

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
zone that purple is going to get dragged

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
zone that purple is going to get dragged
by<00:00:49.829> triangles<00:00:50.460> route<00:00:50.610> which<00:00:51.000> opens<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.539> big

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.779 
by triangles route which opens up a big
route<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.440> our<00:00:52.800> running<00:00:53.100> back<00:00:53.219> drops<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.670> so

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
route but our running back drops it so

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.889 
route but our running back drops it so
make<00:00:53.940> sure<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> good<00:00:54.390> catching

definitely lab this play up a bit here's
another<00:01:17.759> great<00:01:17.970> example<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.900> cover<00:01:19.080> 3

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
another great example here for cover 3

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.640 
another great example here for cover 3
now<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.250> linebacker<00:01:20.430> leaves<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.119> zone<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
now that linebacker leaves the zone and

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
now that linebacker leaves the zone and
the<00:01:22.650> flat<00:01:22.950> rail<00:01:23.130> takes<00:01:23.340> away<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> flat<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the flat rail takes away the flat and it

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.090 
the flat rail takes away the flat and it
really<00:01:25.020> works<00:01:25.320> against<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.710> ton<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.890> different

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
really works against a ton of different

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.240 
really works against a ton of different
defenses<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.200> setup<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.979> really

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
defenses on that this setup is really

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.880 
defenses on that this setup is really
hard<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> stop<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:31.140> get<00:01:31.259> great<00:01:31.320> separation

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
hard to stop and we get great separation

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.039 
hard to stop and we get great separation
there<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.430> our<00:01:32.490> running<00:01:32.759> back<00:01:32.909> again<00:01:33.329> here's

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
there for our running back again here's

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.260 
there for our running back again here's
a<00:01:34.140> blitz<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:35.310> actually<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.030> drag

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
a blitz and we actually have the drag

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.690 
a blitz and we actually have the drag
and<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> running<00:01:36.780> back<00:01:36.990> open<00:01:37.490> we<00:01:38.490> probably

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and the running back open we probably

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.160 
and the running back open we probably
had<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:38.970> curl<00:01:39.240> routes<00:01:39.450> open<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.020> well

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
had the curl routes open to as well

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.920 
had the curl routes open to as well
they'd<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.799> time<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.250> look<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.810> is

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
they'd have time to look and this is

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.149 
they'd have time to look and this is
really<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.259> great<00:01:43.350> way<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> ball<00:01:44.100> out

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
really a great way to get the ball out

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.850 
really a great way to get the ball out
of<00:01:44.340> hand<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.909> fast<00:01:45.299> um<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.380> ball<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.829> be

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
of hand really fast um the ball can be

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.260 
of hand really fast um the ball can be
out<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.130> your<00:01:47.369> hand<00:01:47.520> within<00:01:47.700> actually<00:01:48.090> one

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
out of your hand within actually one

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.600 
out of your hand within actually one
second<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.740> aren't<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.460> many

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
second and there aren't really that many

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.340 
second and there aren't really that many
blitzes<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.149> happen<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.540> under<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:51.930> second

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
blitzes that happen in under one second

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.249 
blitzes that happen in under one second
here<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.430> go<00:01:53.549> again<00:01:53.670> another<00:01:54.299> easy<00:01:54.570> quick<00:01:54.990> gain

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
here we go again another easy quick gain

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.600 
here we go again another easy quick gain
while<00:01:55.560> running<00:01:55.799> back<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.450> like

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
while running back and it's really like

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.819 
while running back and it's really like
consistently<00:01:59.610> getting<00:01:59.880> me<00:02:00.259> in<00:02:01.259> practice<00:02:01.439> mode

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
consistently getting me in practice mode

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.280 
consistently getting me in practice mode
at<00:02:02.130> least<00:02:02.549> four<00:02:02.850> yards<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.509> without

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
at least four yards like without

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.440 
at least four yards like without
we<00:02:04.380> trying<00:02:04.920> anything<00:02:05.220> I<00:02:05.490> mean<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
we trying anything I mean I have the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.930 
we trying anything I mean I have the
safe<00:02:06.690> drag<00:02:07.620> route<00:02:07.800> which<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.160> great<00:02:08.490> against<00:02:08.850> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
safe drag route which is great against a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.550 
safe drag route which is great against a
ton<00:02:09.240> of<00:02:09.270> coverage<00:02:09.540> except<00:02:10.050> maybe<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.290> man

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
ton of coverage except maybe to man

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.100 
ton of coverage except maybe to man
under<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.120> actually<00:02:12.390> don't<00:02:12.840> forget

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
under and here I actually don't forget

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.480 
under and here I actually don't forget
about<00:02:13.200> your<00:02:13.440> curls<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.890> they<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:14.220> great

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
about your curls to they have great

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.070 
about your curls to they have great
separation<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:15.180> man<00:02:15.360> as<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.720> see<00:02:15.870> there

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
separation on man as you see there

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.440 
separation on man as you see there
here's<00:02:17.070> how<00:02:17.520> we<00:02:17.580> get<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.880> ball<00:02:18.030> out<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.270> our

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
here's how we get the ball out of our

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.990 
here's how we get the ball out of our
hands<00:02:18.660> when<00:02:19.050> they<00:02:19.200> are<00:02:19.290> coming<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> running
