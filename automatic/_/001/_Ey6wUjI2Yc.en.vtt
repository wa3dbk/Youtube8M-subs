again<00:00:06.390> by<00:00:06.600> milestone<00:00:07.500> this<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.099> demo<00:00:08.490> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
again by milestone this is the demo the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.360 
again by milestone this is the demo the
game<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.450> out<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.809> few<00:00:09.990> weeks<00:00:10.139> um<00:00:10.590> I've

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
game is out in a few weeks um I've

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.220 
game is out in a few weeks um I've
already<00:00:11.700> pre-ordered<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.360> game<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.960> thought

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
already pre-ordered this game I thought

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.110 
already pre-ordered this game I thought
it<00:00:13.290> would<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.530> kind<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.799> interesting<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.610> what

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
it would be kind of interesting and what

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.580 
it would be kind of interesting and what
I<00:00:15.150> saw<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.450> demo<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.870> thought<00:00:16.170> hey<00:00:16.350> why<00:00:16.560> not

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
I saw the demo I thought hey why not

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.769 
I saw the demo I thought hey why not
let's<00:00:16.949> go<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> demo<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.480> without<00:00:18.630> further

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
let's go to the demo so without further

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.599 
let's go to the demo so without further
ado<00:00:19.260> let's<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> track<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.070> i<00:00:26.099> think<00:00:26.400> i

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
ado let's get to the track so i think i

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.140 
ado let's get to the track so i think i
can<00:00:26.910> choose<00:00:27.269> my<00:00:27.630> lane<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.789> don't<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.970> many

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
can choose my lane I don't have many

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.880 
can choose my lane I don't have many
choices<00:00:30.359> though<00:00:30.810> oh<00:00:33.410> so<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.680> quite

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
choices though oh so it's quite

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.549 
choices though oh so it's quite
interesting<00:00:35.250> oh<00:00:35.670> hello<00:00:36.120> number<00:00:36.450> 5<00:00:36.690> uh-huh

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
interesting oh hello number 5 uh-huh

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.830 
interesting oh hello number 5 uh-huh
yeah<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.700> quite<00:00:38.879> interesting<00:00:39.180> i<00:00:39.450> suppose<00:00:39.690> i

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
yeah it's quite interesting i suppose i

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.750 
yeah it's quite interesting i suppose i
could<00:00:39.899> choose<00:00:40.050> an<00:00:40.350> outside<00:00:40.739> line<00:00:41.010> that's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
could choose an outside line that's

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.060 
could choose an outside line that's
probably<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> worst<00:00:42.390> line<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.530> anyway<00:00:43.800> yeah

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
probably the worst line but anyway yeah

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.670 
probably the worst line but anyway yeah
good<00:00:44.309> luck<00:00:44.340> man<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> let's<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.200> how<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.379> do

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
good luck man so let's see how we do

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.049 
good luck man so let's see how we do
probably<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.370> very<00:00:47.430> well<00:00:47.820> i<00:00:49.910> have<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.000> in

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
probably not very well i have it in

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.319 
probably not very well i have it in
first<00:00:51.329> person<00:00:51.600> view<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.170> course

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.509 

let's<00:00:56.780> see<00:00:56.960> how<00:00:57.079> we<00:00:57.140> do<00:00:57.350> I'm<00:00:57.890> not<00:00:58.190> very<00:00:58.309> good<00:00:58.399> at

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
let's see how we do I'm not very good at

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.479 
let's see how we do I'm not very good at
these<00:00:58.670> games<00:00:59.019> but<00:01:00.019> I've<00:01:00.320> played<00:01:00.859> it<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.070> bit<00:01:01.250> and

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
these games but I've played it a bit and

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.590 
these games but I've played it a bit and
I<00:01:01.730> have<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:02.000> admit<00:01:02.149> it's<00:01:02.539> kind<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.019> fun

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.450 

but<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.260> can<00:01:08.560> imagine<00:01:08.770> it's<00:01:09.040> going<00:01:09.189> to<00:01:09.250> take<00:01:09.430> a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
but I can imagine it's going to take a

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.040 
but I can imagine it's going to take a
lot<00:01:09.640> of<00:01:09.700> practice<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.270> get<00:01:10.540> good<00:01:10.600> at<00:01:10.780> this<00:01:10.960> game

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.570 

and<00:01:15.690> you're<00:01:16.690> basically<00:01:16.990> obviously<00:01:17.830> steering

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
and you're basically obviously steering

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.170 
and you're basically obviously steering
I<00:01:18.820> mean<00:01:19.330> I'm<00:01:19.480> using<00:01:19.690> an<00:01:19.870> xbox<00:01:20.260> 360<00:01:20.980> controller

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
I mean I'm using an xbox 360 controller

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.330 
I mean I'm using an xbox 360 controller
that<00:01:22.180> is<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.510> best<00:01:22.950> controller<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.160> I'm

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
that is the best controller that I'm

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.000 
that is the best controller that I'm
aware<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.730> that<00:01:24.940> you<00:01:25.150> can<00:01:25.300> use<00:01:25.650> obviously<00:01:26.650> I

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
aware of that you can use obviously I

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.010 
aware of that you can use obviously I
can't<00:01:27.400> use<00:01:27.580> a<00:01:27.610> wheel<00:01:27.940> with<00:01:28.420> this<00:01:28.570> kind<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.870> game

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
can't use a wheel with this kind of game

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.220 
can't use a wheel with this kind of game
oh<00:01:29.320> dear<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.980> was<00:01:30.040> not<00:01:30.400> good<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.840> can't<00:01:32.050> use

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
oh dear that was not good you can't use

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.500 
oh dear that was not good you can't use
a<00:01:32.260> wheel<00:01:32.560> with<00:01:32.890> this<00:01:33.100> kind<00:01:33.910> of<00:01:33.940> game<00:01:34.120> obviously

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
a wheel with this kind of game obviously

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.820 
a wheel with this kind of game obviously
so<00:01:35.110> I<00:01:35.380> use<00:01:35.980> an<00:01:36.130> xbox<00:01:36.550> 360<00:01:37.210> controller<00:01:37.690> it<00:01:38.590> works

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
so I use an xbox 360 controller it works

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.670 
so I use an xbox 360 controller it works
well<00:01:39.130> see<00:01:39.430> you<00:01:39.940> obviously<00:01:40.330> steer<00:01:40.750> with<00:01:41.620> the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
well see you obviously steer with the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.120 
well see you obviously steer with the
left<00:01:42.040> analog<00:01:42.250> stick<00:01:42.930> used<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.590> triggers<00:01:45.100> for

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
left analog stick used the triggers for

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.530 
left analog stick used the triggers for
all<00:01:45.610> down<00:01:46.320> use<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.680> triggers<00:01:48.670> for<00:01:48.700> accelerate

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
all down use the triggers for accelerate

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.270 
all down use the triggers for accelerate
and<00:01:49.660> brake

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.410 

and<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.479> also<00:01:56.580> use<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.790> right<00:01:57.970> analog<00:01:58.270> stick

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
and you also use the right analog stick

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.200 
and you also use the right analog stick
to<00:01:58.930> move<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.409> riders<00:01:59.799> weight<00:02:00.010> so<00:02:00.850> when<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.119> do

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
to move the riders weight so when you do

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.930 
to move the riders weight so when you do
a<00:02:01.240> big<00:02:01.479> jump<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.930> can<00:02:02.170> move<00:02:03.040> divide<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.520> forward

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
a big jump you can move divide a forward

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.690 
a big jump you can move divide a forward
or<00:02:04.030> back<00:02:04.210> on<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.509> bike<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.009> can<00:02:06.340> kind<00:02:06.610> of

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
or back on the bike so you can kind of

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.850 
or back on the bike so you can kind of
position<00:02:07.270> your<00:02:07.420> bike<00:02:08.429> where<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.580> want<00:02:09.789> it<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
position your bike where you want it and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.420 
position your bike where you want it and
yeah<00:02:12.100> i<00:02:12.130> mean<00:02:12.720> i've<00:02:13.720> i've<00:02:14.230> been<00:02:14.530> enjoying<00:02:14.770> this

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
yeah i mean i've i've been enjoying this

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.360 
yeah i mean i've i've been enjoying this
game<00:02:15.670> i<00:02:15.940> think<00:02:16.300> just<00:02:16.569> purely<00:02:17.050> because<00:02:17.370> there

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
game i think just purely because there

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.400 
game i think just purely because there
aren't<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.760> lot<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.090> these<00:02:19.450> kind<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:19.959> games<00:02:20.110> out

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
aren't a lot of these kind of games out

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.040 
aren't a lot of these kind of games out
there<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.489> mean<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.940> wouldn't<00:02:22.420> say<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.930> is

with<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:07.539> valley<00:05:07.810> games<00:05:08.169> that<00:05:08.470> they<00:05:08.590> did<00:05:08.830> but

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
with the valley games that they did but

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.710 
with the valley games that they did but
the<00:05:09.160> issue<00:05:09.310> that<00:05:09.610> I<00:05:09.729> had<00:05:09.940> was<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.330> fact<00:05:10.570> that

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
the issue that I had was the fact that

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.439 
the issue that I had was the fact that
you<00:05:10.900> couldn't<00:05:11.260> that<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:12.340> couldn't<00:05:12.699> feel<00:05:13.030> the

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
you couldn't that you couldn't feel the

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.480 
you couldn't that you couldn't feel the
force<00:05:13.720> feedback<00:05:14.050> on<00:05:14.380> yours<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.860> be<00:05:15.070> on<00:05:15.220> your

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
force feedback on yours to be on your

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.490 
force feedback on yours to be on your
steering<00:05:16.060> wheel<00:05:16.300> when<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:16.780> were<00:05:16.870> playing<00:05:17.199> the

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
steering wheel when you were playing the

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.250 
steering wheel when you were playing the
valley<00:05:17.710> games<00:05:18.039> obviously<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:19.389> is<00:05:19.720> using<00:05:20.080> an

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
valley games obviously this is using an

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.980 
valley games obviously this is using an
xbox<00:05:20.910> 360<00:05:21.910> controller<00:05:21.940> and<00:05:22.539> not<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.690> steering

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
xbox 360 controller and not a steering

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.290 
xbox 360 controller and not a steering
wheel<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.620> that<00:05:23.949> kind<00:05:24.400> of<00:05:24.490> eliminates<00:05:25.060> that

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
wheel so that kind of eliminates that

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.710 
wheel so that kind of eliminates that
issue<00:05:26.070> so<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.490> also<00:05:27.729> like<00:05:28.360> I<00:05:28.510> said<00:05:28.690> earlier

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
issue so and also like I said earlier

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.529 
issue so and also like I said earlier
I'm<00:05:29.110> some<00:05:30.070> reason<00:05:30.490> I'm<00:05:30.610> finding<00:05:31.120> this<00:05:31.240> dirt

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
I'm some reason I'm finding this dirt

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.310 
I'm some reason I'm finding this dirt
racing<00:05:32.139> more<00:05:32.380> intuitive<00:05:33.099> with<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.090> xbox<00:05:34.599> 360

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
racing more intuitive with the xbox 360

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.339 
racing more intuitive with the xbox 360
controller<00:05:35.349> and<00:05:35.949> I<00:05:36.009> was<00:05:36.280> from<00:05:36.520> moto<00:05:37.050> GP<00:05:38.050> I

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
controller and I was from moto GP I

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.010 
controller and I was from moto GP I
found<00:05:39.099> it<00:05:39.220> harder<00:05:39.580> motogp<00:05:40.510> to<00:05:40.720> get<00:05:40.900> the

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
found it harder motogp to get the

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.250 
found it harder motogp to get the
accuracy<00:05:41.560> that<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:41.800> needed<00:05:42.360> you<00:05:43.360> know<00:05:46.020> but<00:05:47.020> with

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
accuracy that I needed you know but with

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.920 
accuracy that I needed you know but with
this<00:05:47.530> it<00:05:47.949> feels<00:05:48.400> more<00:05:48.729> intuitive<00:05:49.419> I<00:05:49.630> mean

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
this it feels more intuitive I mean

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.589 
this it feels more intuitive I mean
obviously<00:05:50.050> it<00:05:50.440> would<00:05:50.560> be<00:05:50.680> better<00:05:50.889> if<00:05:51.599> someone

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
obviously it would be better if someone

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:58.020 
obviously it would be better if someone
actually<00:05:52.780> made<00:05:53.530> a<00:05:53.560> controller<00:05:54.250> that<00:05:55.080> was

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
actually made a controller that was

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.490 
actually made a controller that was
you<00:05:58.630> know<00:05:58.780> like<00:05:59.680> a<00:05:59.710> proper<00:06:00.250> bike<00:06:01.500> controller

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
you know like a proper bike controller

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.750 
you know like a proper bike controller
but<00:06:02.800> I<00:06:02.830> don't<00:06:03.070> think<00:06:03.190> that's<00:06:03.400> going<00:06:03.550> to<00:06:03.610> happen

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
but I don't think that's going to happen

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.550 
but I don't think that's going to happen
any<00:06:04.060> time<00:06:04.150> soon<00:06:06.030> so<00:06:07.030> yeah<00:06:07.210> so<00:06:07.450> the<00:06:07.570> xbox<00:06:07.930> 360
