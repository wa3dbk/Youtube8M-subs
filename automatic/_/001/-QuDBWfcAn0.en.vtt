00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.759
 Huub Stevens Unsalted is the title of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.580
 the book published this week which 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.809
 eager deduction found a presentation evening 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.679
 the fourth floor of the fire 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.599
 stadium 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.549
 busy so the hand was shaking 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.320
 for the main character for the author of 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.359
 the telophase book 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.439
 right here in the picture if it's hard to 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.810
 about languages 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.250
 but he got help from wife and daughter 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.230
 son stevens 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.869
 I think it's for posterity because 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.340
 that's why the children wanted that too 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.599
 the book was written first 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.369
 authority and I do not want it at all 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.760
 because it doesn't really suit me 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.010
 I think that I am still in full swing 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.629
 career base I am and found that out 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.290
 I hope it didn't have to be a biography 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.469
 to be 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.100
 it just had to be a book about it 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.140
 the life of a person where people 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.190
 where one have where people are 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.920
 might be reflected in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.300
 where people can set a specific example 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.670
 see back 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.340
 never give up always stay 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.469
 fight and stay positive 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.570
 people will believe in it huub 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.500
 Stevens certainly recognize Willy van 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.390
 of the cows 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.979
 adrie van kraaij and also twan Scheepers 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.630
 lived his lives in the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.060
 youth education of psv 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.040
 director Jan count was just like the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 predecessor of steven sef vergsensen old 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.450
 colleagues from the roda period and from the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.939
 show the time how those as our links and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.729
 Eddy Achterberg wants a family 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.390
 my friends and acquaintances and and and and and 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.220
 colleagues present here yes that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.890
 indicates again and then they have 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.329
 just about the dutch branch of 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.979
 male what I did 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.390
 how he likes to love is according to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.520
 me or was a pity that is also the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.290
 only german person who is present here 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.590
 is 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.450
 because then you go mobile head and those 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 I can be very proud of that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.110
 he is present here but the book will 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.050
 can also appear in germany and then 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.760
 the people in germany will also give way 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.410
 have had a lot of bond with it 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.240
 I will also hope for a certain evening 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.670
 to show up 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.010
 what is for yourself perhaps the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.870
 most beautiful passage from the book 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.350
 well i think the passage where madam and 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:11.850
 fighting was for her life and that 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.320
 she was told that we were on one and on 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.780
 became a grandmother 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.870
 I think that was very moving 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.700
 moment is in someone's life 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.110
 making that the person fasting them 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.110
 is for his life 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.450
 that they open something positive 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.640
 looks back for the future so it is 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.920
 not just a football book 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.010
 No certainly not sitting there opposite me 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.730
 think they are those who read the book 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.990
 that jotan see again how the life of 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:47.040
 a soccer player and trainer 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.900
 is outside of football and I think that 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.430
 much more important than just that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.170
 soccer life 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.910
 you are the football man you always talk 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.130
 about football you think about it after you live 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.709
 football is hard to push that button 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.140
 to set up and just about to talk 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.370
 the choice to make that kind of private 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.410
 passages 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.520
 to include it well yes that is 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.080
 difficult 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.630
 and then go to a lot of hours in 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:16.540
 sit down but again i think if you 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.280
 it when you read the book that you like it 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.150
 much more of and see back then alone 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.030
 but 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.870
 whether to play football or train or it 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.990
 football 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.340
 life is many times more and and me 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.650
 I think that's good in this booklet too 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.460
 comes back and the first copy of 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.030
 your mother 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.840
 she was the first and and the biggest fan 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.270
 that I have had in my career so far 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.670
 to experience and from there I thought 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:47.340
 it also no longer like 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.080
 and and and yes and jazz to her 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.310
 that book to hagert or america blog and 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.000
 my wife 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.770
 being able to hand it over to someone 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.810
 from football but I think it 's whole 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.350
 It is important that it is the mother orders 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.350
 admittedly
