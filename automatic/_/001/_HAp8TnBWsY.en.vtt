00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.960
 with people welcome to Eva 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.599
 here came another step of the project 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.400
 the robotic claw as I said to 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.580
 You saw my previous goal is 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.980
 to make an explorer robot and this claw 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.260
 robotics she is part of the project 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.359
 I'll show you how it works. 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.970
 of her that in two steps first is a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.880
 simple operation keep ina 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.060
 I have here a proto board this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.350
 call you here all the time 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.640
 simple goat 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.059
 keep in 11:01 pot're here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.460
 connected to stack content and kitagawa 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:51.690
 robotics the idea here is to do with 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.100
 that when turning the potential the subway h opens 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.480
 and date 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.480
 Let's see how it goes here. 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.909
 here generates central power open call 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.820
 date 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.909
 you can control it slowly 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:23.110
 slowly and faster 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:23.110
 she responds well and taking it near here 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:39.190
 how it works is there and yet the 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:39.190
 that holds tight 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:58.030
 put some feathers she looked for more 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:58.030
 of the law and of the company available 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.369
 she is an aluminum daughter with a 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.989
 very sturdy and fine material 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:15.950
 here she is working 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:17.870
 works with two servants is not here and 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.130
 another down there where I knew 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.540
 show you the control on the part of 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.340
 down on the other link is and she has a 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.870
 very interesting device that is 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.209
 this one that it prevents the Serbian from being 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.190
 Stressed that has a spring mechanism 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.310
 that when you spin 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.860
 it accompanies the opening of the claw are 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.470
 seeing it does not allow the saw to be 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.150
 forced to watch TV that they will 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:52.329
 two two dates here will go away 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.329
 now when to close the store available 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:02.090
 not to leave the hill very well force 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.530
 made and has managed to 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.670
 applied here really was very cool 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.670
 very interesting 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:13.250
 you have now seen the hymn functional 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.600
 Now how will it actually be the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.730
 project 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.190
 I'm here as the controller of gucci 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.560
 I already showed you in another video she 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.230
 that will control the robot 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.870
 explorer and will also make the control 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.040
 communicates with radio control that goes 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.019
 control the claw 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.480
 so that's the project going to be this way 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.579
 which will run on the explorer robot 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.530
 I'll show you here now now. 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:42.440
 are both axes running grabs 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.569
 will open in this channel that it is 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.910
 even basically equal to the potentiometer of the 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.650
 arduino even the same operation 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:59.110
 you spin by closing 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:01.780
 and the cepac and the axis of high it rise and 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.159
 going down will be in this channel here as 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.180
 show you guys with me show 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.180
 Opening how are you going to stay? 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.329
 this way and now the channel for clawing 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.080
 up and down 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:26.039
 if this is how it will work now 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.039
 known here on the other side 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.250
 This is how it will work in theft. 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.889
 if white not heavy like I already told you 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.900
 was aluminum up to a certain weight 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:04.229
 The same thing she answers 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.939
 slowly and delicately progressive as 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.409
 also responds very quickly if 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.409
 you make a sudden move 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.610
 thinks of you closely 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.009
 the details 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.460
 good staff and this if you are not subscribed 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.670
 on our channel sign up for you 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.290
 follow the assembly of this project is 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.010
 something very interesting as I said something 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.850
 unprecedented in Brazil is that I believe will 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.520
 stay a very cool project 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.690
 interesting sign up to follow 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.340
 the next videos 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.040
 I'll leave it here in the description on the 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.180
 below the link where I bought the claw 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.920
 if you wish, by chance also 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.990
 buy how it is the question of 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.720
 price I'll leave the link below to 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.290
 This is a personal description until the 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.290
 next video
