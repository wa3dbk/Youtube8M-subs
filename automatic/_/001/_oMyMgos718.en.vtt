I<00:03:22.519> think<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:23.739> know<00:03:24.739> an<00:03:25.250> important<00:03:25.790> part<00:03:26.000> of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
I think you know an important part of

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.600 
I think you know an important part of
where<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.840> cap<00:03:27.049> is<00:03:27.290> right<00:03:27.590> now<00:03:27.799> is<00:03:28.190> that

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
where the cap is right now is that

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.430 
where the cap is right now is that
revenues<00:03:29.090> have<00:03:29.239> grown<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.720> in<00:03:29.870> each<00:03:30.170> our

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
revenues have grown and in each our

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.410 
revenues have grown and in each our
relationship<00:03:31.100> with<00:03:31.700> each<00:03:31.850> other<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.299> that's

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
relationship with each other and that's

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.150 
relationship with each other and that's
something<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.930> we<00:03:33.290> wanted<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:33.890> bathed

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
something that we wanted and bathed

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.640 
something that we wanted and bathed
agreed<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:34.880> they<00:03:35.000> wanted<00:03:35.350> since<00:03:36.350> we<00:03:36.440> made

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
agreed to and they wanted since we made

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.770 
agreed to and they wanted since we made
the<00:03:36.769> agreement<00:03:36.890> last<00:03:37.250> time<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:38.180> won't

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
the agreement last time so I won't

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.229 
the agreement last time so I won't
necessarily<00:03:38.900> speak<00:03:39.650> on<00:03:39.829> what<00:03:40.100> teams<00:03:40.340> how

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
necessarily speak on what teams how

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.460 
necessarily speak on what teams how
they're<00:03:41.390> behaving<00:03:41.540> but<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.050> think<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.349> can

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
they're behaving but I think you can

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.530 
they're behaving but I think you can
understand<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.849> market<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.239> what<00:03:44.450> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
understand that the market is what the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.730 
understand that the market is what the
market<00:03:44.780> is<00:03:44.900> right<00:03:45.080> now<00:03:45.260> and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
you know we're all measured against each

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.410 
you know we're all measured against each
other<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.590> that's<00:04:04.010> basically<00:04:04.580> how<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:05.180> know

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
other and that's basically how you know

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.760 
other and that's basically how you know
your<00:04:05.570> performance<00:04:06.050> on<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.170> ice

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
your performance on the ice

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.680 
your performance on the ice
typically<00:04:07.280> speaks<00:04:07.640> for<00:04:07.880> you<00:04:08.300> know<00:04:08.390> what<00:04:08.540> type

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
typically speaks for you know what type

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.300 
typically speaks for you know what type
of<00:04:08.810> deal<00:04:08.930> you'll<00:04:09.110> sign<00:04:09.350> and<00:04:09.590> obviously

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
of deal you'll sign and obviously

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.680 
of deal you'll sign and obviously
there's<00:04:10.490> some<00:04:10.610> marquee<00:04:11.210> players<00:04:11.450> getting

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
there's some marquee players getting

there's some marquee players getting
some<00:04:11.900> great<00:04:12.080> deals<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.620> all<00:04:13.580> I<00:04:13.640> guess<00:04:13.910> I'll

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
some great deals and all I guess I'll

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.520 
some great deals and all I guess I'll
really<00:04:14.180> say<00:04:14.390> is<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.660> it's<00:04:14.780> just<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:15.050> nature<00:04:15.350> of

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
really say is that it's just a nature of

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.150 
really say is that it's just a nature of
the<00:04:16.310> system<00:04:16.610> that<00:04:16.730> we<00:04:16.820> have<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:19.070> know
