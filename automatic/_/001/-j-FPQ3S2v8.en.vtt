00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.820
 to round out the robot theme 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.329
 multiple recycled I'm going to do I'm going to 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.609
 show several details of 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.399
 the whole set and in turn make a 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.410
 demo of how the robot works with each 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.520
 sensor 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.980
 to get started 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.710
 we see that the two motor reducers that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.010
 we got from the cd readers are 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.920
 stuck with a plastic in a small 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.910
 easy wooden fiber board of ones 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.710
 7 centimeters by 20 and we should always 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.350
 keep in mind that the mechanisms 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.320
 there is one for one side and the other for 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.990
 the other with the two gears that go 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.320
 solidarity with the rims perfectly 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.080
 aligned can also be seen that they have 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.320
 fixed with thermo gun plastic 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.360
 fuse a clutch system that 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.880
 they had these mechanisms that we got out of 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.740
 the readers for good so you do not 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.700
 activate and that one of the engines of the 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.790
 two engines is skating also it 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.240
 They have fixed the cables of the motors with 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.880
 this same glue and good in the part 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.640
 rear of the model a wheel was added 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.560
 that was obtained from the wizards of the wheel 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.820
 of the mouse that 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.329
 which is let's say in the front that 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.470
 it serves to go down and do the scroll good 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:09.860
 we take that wheel out of there and it's 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.550
 mounted on a plastic and good is 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.540
 this crazy tour is not going to the side 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.599
 where the attraction is the two 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.480
 tires are stuck with plastics to 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:27.180
 the gears we got this 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.400
 to the gears and they were obtained from 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.790
 traction rollers of a printer 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.370
 from an old printer and they are very good 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.069
 these wheels because they are rubber and 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.530
 They offer a very good grip on any 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.890
 surface compared with those of 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.069
 plastics that generally skate 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.780
 pretty good and those of plastics are 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.200
 easy to get toys but 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.400
 these others are rubber and it has very 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.459
 good traction 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.420
 well past the top we see 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.329
 a kind of battery holder also made 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.860
 with wood and always stuck with the 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:15.540
 silicone gun where they go away 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:19.409
 housed two lithium batteries from the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.510
 type 18 650 and that we have recycled the 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.329
 batteries of the notebooks was also 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.099
 explained in another video how to load them and 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:31.470
 use them for these purposes are two 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.440
 of these batteries two of two of these 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.780
 cells put in series and feed everything 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.569
 the set both in the electronics and 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.389
 the engines and motors that make 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.060
 attraction because you can also see a 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:48.090
 switch retrieved from a flashlight 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.900
 china what good to cut and give the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.019
 energy the whole 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.540
 the drivers of the engines and the 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.750
 power output from the battery holder go 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.400
 with chips recovered from wiring 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.489
 front of old cpu 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.620
 and more towards the front of the car is the 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.650
 electronics that controls the engines that 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.069
 It was also described in this video that 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.239
 I am checking you at this time if 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.789
 we connect without sensor the energy to 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.240
 Wide circuit both LEDs light 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.400
 and the two engines start to work 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.580
 that indicates that everything is correct 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.919
 finally on the front they will go 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.460
 mounted the sensors and that too 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.100
 we live 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:39.410
 with detail in other previous videos 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:43.490
 that you recommend them to see for 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:47.870
 to see how they perform and now 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:51.050
 good a little demos with the three 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.350
 sensors to see how this works 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.350
 robot 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.139
 ah 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.830
 Y 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:30.120
 well this was all if they liked to mark 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:33.480
 like and do not forget to subscribe to the channel and 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.020
 I send you an affectionate greeting and even the 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.400
 next 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.400
 thank you very much for your attention
