 I saved 12 to 14 euro is always 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.140
 how much you see tank euro x

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.739
 a first conclusion from the Federal Cartel Office 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.659

 and if you try it yourself 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.030
 If you also see that the prices 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.630
 if you agree to the gas station 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.399
 drive 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.110
 how many consumers are using as yet 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.369
 It's hard to guess who 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.289
 he compares quickly 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.329
 benefit because there are currently 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.719
 Price differences up to 14 cents per 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.820
 liter 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.469

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.750
 comparative portals and is with the 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.549

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.380
 Internet usage has increased rapidly 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.789
 we see a tremendous interest in the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.289

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.630
 to inform fuel prices 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.090
 Car drivers can strengthen the competition 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.109
 and we urgently need that in mind 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.380
 fair and not excessive 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.310
 fuel prices price fixing under

 the consumer can at least insist 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.270
 react with the tap in hand 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.740
 and the comparison on the phone and 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.210
 in fact , that is what happens with the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.929
 petrol station operators too 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.920
 noticeable 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.780
 the drivers are reacting faster 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.519

 moment in the evening 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.010
 Consumers are well informed 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.990

 The project is still in the market 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.740
