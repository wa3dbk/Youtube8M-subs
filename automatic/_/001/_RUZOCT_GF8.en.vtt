00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.380
 massi cases offers all year long 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 dance workshops with our teacher 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
 dance but the idea is there for example 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.119
 today exceptionally we 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.310
 brought in a speaker 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.989
 outside because he has another way 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.759
 to teach the big event because it is 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.890
 a great dancer choreographer and a big 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.750
 pedagogue because he will complete the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:41.520
 training our students precisely in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 this sense currently expected of the bad 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 side with the side that is not a course 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.070
 or get to do it we'll do it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:01:01.020
 just the solo side a little bit is good 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:03.239
 for everyone's going to the principle of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.049
 this teaching these two to learn 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.130
 not only a directory of not 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.170
 register ten ionaires but also the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.299
 principles that are unique to each 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.649
 pace 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.530
 the main measures specific to each 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:19.590
 rhythm and that make every dancer 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.930
 enters into communication with with the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.500
 Morocco and the mac is that tanbouye 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.500
 soloist 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.610
 I would not say it's a dance 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.530
 difficult but it's still a tooth 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.869
 know who looks simple but there is 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.479
 some codes to respect certain 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.909
 techniques to see and it's a dance that 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.020
 is very much based on the imbalance 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.009
 is the balance in fact one time 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.720
 that we understood his codes 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.670
 as it's a dance that's based on 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.220
 improvisation we can after this coward 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.560
 and so first observe learn 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.560
 listen and know how to let go 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.400
 all 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.299
 for 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.580
 when we look at it's beautiful and it looks 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.250
 simple and it's normal it's fluid game 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.240
 it's true that when you learn at the beginning 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.130
 realizes that there are codes going to do 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.920
 fly give you time to get in 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.130
 in and especially that the pleasure is there 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.080
 and patients it's a game with also the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.459
 pace 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.750
 it's a game and chloride may and then that 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.560
 allows you to break free 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.300
 this is the first time I do like 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.430
 So it was very difficult but 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.290
 after little by little with the teacher put me 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.290
 at ease then there we follow the movement 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.670
 it's a dance that is dancing alone 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.099
 a solo dance because when we 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.030
 dance around in his underwater 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:58.600
 but solo is not solitary but we 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.430
 is a solidarity solo he said that 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.209
 Rome is a solo but in communication 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.360
 communion thursday with loud lahoud who 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.980
 has all the people we can not 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.190
 call the spectators the calls 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.110
 the audience said they are they are 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.510
 around but participate as they 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.850
 can 3d but by doing what we 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.209
 calls answering machines taking over the 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.580
 the answer of the field there is the singer 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.470
 soloist there is the chacha there is the 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.810
 boulahia the mcee is all that they 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.810
 thought of the energy of the round 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:50.310
 there is some freedom in this 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.620
 instructive dance but it's a 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.000
 freedom that runs inside a 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.320
 number of codes 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.950
 that is to say basically when we dance to 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.120
 black 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:11.160
 when we are free to say it is not 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.890
 the same types of two reports to 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.810
 fonts that's pretty much the same type of 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.810
 relation to rhythm and body also 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.260
 2 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.139
 the beginner first and foremost he must 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.800
 understand the tance davioud when he 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.590
 dance on a rhythm it takes 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.410
 companions how the tournament rhythm 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.160
 that they learn at first 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:42.070
 to score the pace with him but he 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.139
 they must also understand the type of 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.230
 ground ratio because every dance a 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.880
 ground ratio is a way of posing the 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.610
 feet on the ground 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.990
 he must also understand how that 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.930
 works in the body ie 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.500
 the joints that are who are 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.300
 set in motion 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.770
 so we have to take all this and 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.430
 it's done little by little 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.900
 through warming up we learn to 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.750
 lay your feet on the ground 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.970
 we learn what's called transfer 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.100
 body weight go from one leg to 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.650
 another dance and swing jean marc and the 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.100
 rhythm if we missed rhythm or 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.100
 the other 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.180
 the good dancer is above all 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.570
 someone who has a sense of rhythm then 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.570
 who knows 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:41.340
 if yes, the time that knows how to dialogue with 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:45.560
 the tangos who knows how to navigate slalom 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.240
 Monday winner slalom between the times 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:53.130
 of music at the same time these few 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.740
 it's not who talks about executors who he 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.300
 has technically been running from 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.660
 goffin is someone who also 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.160
 basically to an approach of 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.139
 the whole well spiritual dimension 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.020
 this is someone who also dances 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.190
 coming out to the roof with his very heart having 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.440
 some not but someone who 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.300
 dance with his heart and his few 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.870
 even less 100 boys have a lot of 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.860
 paris who can you touch kiki who 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.860
 interact with the invisible
