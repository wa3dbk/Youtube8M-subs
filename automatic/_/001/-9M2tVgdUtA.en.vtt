00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
of the native plants one big concern we

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.170 
of the native plants one big concern we
have<00:00:30.859> in<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.099> part<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> state<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.149> that

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
have in this part of the state is that

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.920 
have in this part of the state is that
we<00:00:34.079> now<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> biological<00:00:35.059> control<00:00:36.059> for

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
we now have a biological control for

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.830 
we now have a biological control for
tamarisk<00:00:37.530> which<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.950> another<00:00:38.250> invasive<00:00:38.879> woody

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
tamarisk which is another invasive woody

tamarisk which is another invasive woody
species<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.090> tamarisk<00:00:42.690> being

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
species and with the tamarisk being

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
species and with the tamarisk being
suppressed<00:00:43.469> by<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.800> their<00:00:44.550> biological

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
control which is a beetle the concern is

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
control which is a beetle the concern is
that<00:00:47.879> we're<00:00:48.149> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.629> an<00:00:49.050> explosion<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that we're going to have an explosion of

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.819 
that we're going to have an explosion of
Russian<00:00:50.610> olive<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.120> take<00:00:51.300> their<00:00:51.510> place<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.110> so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
Russian olive to take their place and so

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.130 
Russian olive to take their place and so
we've<00:00:53.039> been<00:00:53.160> doing<00:00:53.460> research<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.239> different

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
we've been doing research on different

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.500 
we've been doing research on different
methods<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> control<00:00:55.860> them<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:57.000> cut<00:00:57.210> stump

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
methods to control them the cut stump

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.880 
methods to control them the cut stump
method<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.050> we're<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> talk<00:00:58.859> about

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
method that we're going to talk about

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.000 
method that we're going to talk about
today<00:00:59.550> has<00:00:59.789> some<00:01:00.030> real<00:01:00.210> advantages<00:01:00.710> in<00:01:01.710> about

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
today has some real advantages in about

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.039 
today has some real advantages in about
five<00:01:02.340> years<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.789> research<00:01:03.090> one<00:01:03.660> thing<00:01:03.870> we've

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
five years of research one thing we've

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.780 
five years of research one thing we've
learned<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.830> doesn't<00:01:05.189> matter<00:01:05.400> which

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
learned is that it doesn't matter which

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.550 
learned is that it doesn't matter which
month<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> year<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.630> use<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.080> method

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
month of the year we use this method

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.550 
month of the year we use this method
it's<00:01:08.040> equally<00:01:08.490> effective<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it's equally effective and so that's a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
it's equally effective and so that's a
good<00:01:10.710> thing<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.250> someone<00:01:11.490> who<00:01:11.820> has<00:01:12.090> some<00:01:12.869> time

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
good thing for someone who has some time

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.890 
good thing for someone who has some time
in<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> offseason<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.790> during<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.090> growing

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
in the offseason not during the growing

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.149 
in the offseason not during the growing
season<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.500> they're<00:01:16.619> trying<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> put<00:01:17.040> up

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
season when they're trying to put up

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.969 
season when they're trying to put up
crops<00:01:17.600> think<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.750> could<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.110> some<00:01:19.710> Russian

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
crops think they could do some Russian

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.460 
crops think they could do some Russian
olive<00:01:20.280> control<00:01:20.750> another<00:01:21.750> nice<00:01:22.110> thing<00:01:22.140> about

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
olive control another nice thing about

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.460 
olive control another nice thing about
the<00:01:22.979> cut<00:01:23.159> stump<00:01:23.460> method<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.020> uses<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the cut stump method is that it uses a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.370 
the cut stump method is that it uses a
very<00:01:25.590> small<00:01:26.280> amount<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.759> herbicide<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
very small amount of herbicide and the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
very small amount of herbicide and the
herbicide<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.100> applied<00:01:29.460> directly<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
herbicide is applied directly to the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.310 
herbicide is applied directly to the
stump<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:31.740> specific<00:01:32.549> very<00:01:33.329> little<00:01:33.780> danger

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
stump very specific very little danger

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.600 
stump very specific very little danger
of<00:01:34.700> damaging<00:01:35.840> non-target<00:01:36.840> plants<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.040> has

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
of damaging non-target plants and so has

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.460 
of damaging non-target plants and so has
some<00:01:38.850> real<00:01:39.000> advantages<00:01:39.630> biggest

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
some real advantages biggest

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
some real advantages biggest
disadvantages<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:41.579> fairly<00:01:41.820> labor

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
disadvantages it's fairly labor

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.440 
disadvantages it's fairly labor
intensive<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> Russian<00:01:44.280> olive<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
intensive and with a Russian olive the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.260 
intensive and with a Russian olive the
most<00:01:45.689> difficult<00:01:46.350> part<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:47.000> control<00:01:48.000> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
most difficult part of control is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.969 
most difficult part of control is
getting<00:01:48.600> close<00:01:48.840> enough<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> plant<00:01:49.770> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
getting close enough to the plant to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:50.690 
getting close enough to the plant to
control<00:01:50.369> it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
control it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.910 
control it
they're<00:01:51.180> thorny<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.780> they're<00:01:52.140> shrubby<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
they're thorny and they're shrubby and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.300 
they're thorny and they're shrubby and
they're<00:01:53.520> messy<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.000> work<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:54.619> with<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
they're messy to work with with the the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.060 
they're messy to work with with the the
cut<00:01:56.520> stump<00:01:56.820> method<00:01:57.350> basically<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.590> come<00:01:58.829> in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
cut stump method basically you come in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.630 
cut stump method basically you come in
and<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.430> cut<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.210> tree<00:02:00.420> off<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.460> then<00:02:02.460> you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and you cut the tree off and then you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.719 
and you cut the tree off and then you
apply<00:02:02.969> an<00:02:03.180> herbicide<00:02:03.479> now<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.829> mistake<00:02:05.250> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
apply an herbicide now it's a mistake to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.880 
apply an herbicide now it's a mistake to
simply<00:02:06.119> cut<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.540> tree<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.469> apply<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
simply cut the tree and not apply the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.880 
simply cut the tree and not apply the
herbicide<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.090> our<00:02:09.209> trials

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
herbicide because in our trials

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.380 
herbicide because in our trials
basically<00:02:10.890> every<00:02:11.340> tree<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.819> we<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.090> cut

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
basically every tree that we have cut

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.300 
basically every tree that we have cut
and<00:02:12.690> left<00:02:13.410> untreated

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and left untreated

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.729 
and left untreated
has<00:02:14.760> Rhys<00:02:15.060> proud<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.750> in<00:02:15.870> some<00:02:16.110> cases<00:02:16.379> it

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
has Rhys proud and in some cases it

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.349 
has Rhys proud and in some cases it
appears<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.219> actually<00:02:17.610> invigorates<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
appears it actually invigorates the

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.809 
appears it actually invigorates the
plants<00:02:18.780> after<00:02:19.439> a<00:02:19.799> couple<00:02:20.129> of<00:02:20.219> years<00:02:20.370> some<00:02:20.700> of

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
plants after a couple of years some of

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.929 
plants after a couple of years some of
our<00:02:21.170> untreated<00:02:22.170> cut<00:02:22.620> stumps<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.670> trees

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
our untreated cut stumps the the trees

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.959 
our untreated cut stumps the the trees
are<00:02:24.150> taller<00:02:24.420> than<00:02:24.810> adjacent<00:02:25.379> uncut<00:02:26.280> trees<00:02:26.609> and

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
are taller than adjacent uncut trees and

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.270 
are taller than adjacent uncut trees and
already<00:02:27.269> have<00:02:27.420> fruit<00:02:27.719> on<00:02:27.900> them<00:02:28.079> so<00:02:28.349> as<00:02:28.950> one
