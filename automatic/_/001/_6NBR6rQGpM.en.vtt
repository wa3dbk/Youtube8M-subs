00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
interesting the theory of evolution

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.779 
interesting the theory of evolution
claims<00:00:19.550> only<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.180> strong<00:00:20.509> shall<00:00:20.900> survive

claims only the strong shall survive

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.400 
claims only the strong shall survive
maybe<00:00:22.789> so<00:00:23.119> maybe<00:00:23.680> so

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
maybe so maybe so

but<00:00:26.770> the<00:00:26.890> theory<00:00:27.340> of<00:00:27.460> competition<00:00:28.300> says<00:00:28.570> just

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
but the theory of competition says just

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.260 
but the theory of competition says just
because<00:00:29.590> they're<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.310> strong<00:00:30.670> doesn't<00:00:31.090> mean

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
because they're the strong doesn't mean

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.229 
because they're the strong doesn't mean
they<00:00:31.540> can't<00:00:31.840> get<00:00:32.050> their<00:00:32.259> asses<00:00:32.710> kicked<00:00:33.239> that's

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
they can't get their asses kicked that's

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.780 
they can't get their asses kicked that's
