well

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.909 
well
probably<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:18.959> definitely<00:04:19.410> lacking

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
probably it's it's definitely lacking

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.300 
probably it's it's definitely lacking
you<00:04:20.519> know<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:22.530> know<00:04:22.620> as<00:04:22.740> far<00:04:22.919> as<00:04:22.980> you<00:04:23.220> know

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
you know you know as far as you know

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.340 
you know you know as far as you know
bitterness<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:23.850> goes<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.540> needs<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.810> bit<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.080> you

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
bitterness it goes it needs a bit of you

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.230 
bitterness it goes it needs a bit of you
know<00:04:25.380> bitterness<00:04:25.890> there<00:04:26.100> for<00:04:26.280> balancing<00:04:26.760> so<00:04:27.030> I

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
know bitterness there for balancing so I

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.270 
know bitterness there for balancing so I
guess<00:04:27.840> in<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.110> sense<00:04:28.500> it's<00:04:28.919> a<00:04:29.010> little

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
guess in that sense it's a little

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.610 
guess in that sense it's a little
unbalanced<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.180> know<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.480> just<00:04:30.690> needs<00:04:31.530> a

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
unbalanced you know it just needs a

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.200 
unbalanced you know it just needs a
little<00:04:31.770> bit<00:04:32.220> more<00:04:32.280> in<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.700> way<00:04:32.730> of<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:33.180> know

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
little bit more in the way of you know

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.600 
little bit more in the way of you know
well<00:04:33.510> hop<00:04:33.720> bitterness<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.919> balance<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.460> up

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
well hop bitterness to to balance it up

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.630 
well hop bitterness to to balance it up
but<00:04:35.820> still<00:04:36.090> it's<00:04:36.300> it's<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:37.350> very<00:04:37.560> pleasant

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
but still it's it's a very pleasant

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 
definitely got a very high drink ability

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:11.119 
definitely got a very high drink ability
it<00:05:07.439> wouldn't<00:05:07.829> be<00:05:07.889> a<00:05:07.919> bad<00:05:08.189> session<00:05:08.729> beer<00:05:10.129> yeah

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
it wouldn't be a bad session beer yeah

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.979 
it wouldn't be a bad session beer yeah
now<00:05:11.429> what<00:05:11.759> would<00:05:11.849> I<00:05:11.939> give<00:05:12.149> it<00:05:12.269> in<00:05:12.389> terms<00:05:12.629> of<00:05:12.869> a

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:12.989 
now what would I give it in terms of a

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:14.689 
now what would I give it in terms of a
score<00:05:13.259> out<00:05:13.469> of<00:05:13.499> 10

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
score out of 10

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.729 
score out of 10
I'd<00:05:14.939> probably<00:05:15.119> be<00:05:15.329> inclined<00:05:15.719> to<00:05:15.839> give<00:05:16.110> duff

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:16.739 
I'd probably be inclined to give duff

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:22.699 
I'd probably be inclined to give duff
beer<00:05:19.399> give<00:05:20.399> it<00:05:20.549> a<00:05:20.849> 7<00:05:21.479> out<00:05:21.629> of<00:05:21.779> 10<00:05:22.139> I<00:05:22.379> think

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:22.709 
beer give it a 7 out of 10 I think

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:26.299 
beer give it a 7 out of 10 I think
that's<00:05:22.889> only<00:05:23.099> fair<00:05:23.839> alright<00:05:24.839> so<00:05:25.259> there<00:05:25.829> you<00:05:25.860> go

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:26.309 
that's only fair alright so there you go

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:27.739 
that's only fair alright so there you go
it's<00:05:26.489> definitely<00:05:27.059> one<00:05:27.149> that<00:05:27.209> exceeded<00:05:27.599> my

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:27.749 
it's definitely one that exceeded my

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:30.049 
it's definitely one that exceeded my
expectations<00:05:28.589> although<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:29.669> is<00:05:29.789> a<00:05:29.819> little

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:30.059 
expectations although it is a little

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.949 
expectations although it is a little
flawed<00:05:30.389> in<00:05:30.779> some<00:05:30.839> ways<00:05:32.179> it<00:05:33.179> does<00:05:33.389> have<00:05:33.599> a<00:05:33.629> very

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:33.959 
flawed in some ways it does have a very

first review for 2012 done and dusted

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:50.869 
first review for 2012 done and dusted
although<00:05:49.679> I<00:05:49.709> really<00:05:50.009> did<00:05:50.309> botch<00:05:50.550> it<00:05:50.579> up

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
although I really did botch it up

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.229 
although I really did botch it up
terribly<00:05:51.559> but<00:05:52.559> I<00:05:52.589> was<00:05:53.039> intent<00:05:53.459> on<00:05:53.639> doing<00:05:54.089> one

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:54.239 
terribly but I was intent on doing one

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:58.549 
terribly but I was intent on doing one
today<00:05:54.629> even<00:05:55.589> though<00:05:55.919> yeah<00:05:56.219> it's<00:05:56.459> probably<00:05:57.559> not

00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:58.559 
today even though yeah it's probably not

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.109 
today even though yeah it's probably not
such<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:58.829> good<00:05:58.979> idea

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:00.119 
such a good idea

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.889 
such a good idea
