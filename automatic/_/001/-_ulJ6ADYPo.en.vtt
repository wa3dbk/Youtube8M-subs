00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
I'm sure that there was probably a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.250 
I'm sure that there was probably a
little<00:01:10.140> bit<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> an<00:01:10.560> upcharge<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.670> know<00:01:11.790> being

little bit of an upcharge you know being

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.800 
little bit of an upcharge you know being

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
because I get you know I get tired and I

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.860 
because I get you know I get tired and I
rub<00:02:46.640> my<00:02:46.760> eyes<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.180> know<00:02:47.270> I<00:02:47.300> shouldn't<00:02:47.720> do<00:02:47.840> that

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
rub my eyes and know I shouldn't do that

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.190 
rub my eyes and know I shouldn't do that
but<00:02:48.140> I<00:02:48.230> do<00:02:48.290> I'm<00:02:48.530> really<00:02:48.770> horrible<00:02:49.190> at<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:50.200> so

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
but I do I'm really horrible at it so

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.290 
but I do I'm really horrible at it so
things<00:02:51.709> like<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:51.920> but<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.940> throughout<00:02:53.180> the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
things like that but so throughout the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.970 
things like that but so throughout the
day<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.510> know<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.959> wears<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.440> stuff<00:02:54.650> but<00:02:54.770> that

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
day you know it wears and stuff but that

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.080 
day you know it wears and stuff but that
definitely<00:02:55.310> could<00:02:55.640> tell<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.000> difference

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
definitely could tell the difference

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.930 
definitely could tell the difference
with<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.870> lasts<00:02:57.170> longer<00:02:57.590> my<00:02:57.739> skin<00:02:58.070> was<00:02:58.220> a

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
with this it lasts longer my skin was a

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.440 
with this it lasts longer my skin was a
lot<00:02:59.540> softer<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.520> when<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.640> apply<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.030> makeup

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
lot softer and when you apply the makeup

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.240 
lot softer and when you apply the makeup
you<00:03:02.570> can<00:03:02.600> just<00:03:02.959> feel<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.350> difference<00:03:03.530> if

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
you can just feel the difference if

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.440 
you can just feel the difference if
you've<00:03:04.400> used<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.700> primer<00:03:04.970> before<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.360> know

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
you've used a primer before you know

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.729 
you've used a primer before you know
what<00:03:05.570> I'm<00:03:05.660> talking<00:03:05.989> about<00:03:06.050> when<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.470> first

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
what I'm talking about when you first

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.949 
what I'm talking about when you first
apply<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.610> makeup<00:03:08.030> over<00:03:08.360> your<00:03:08.480> primer<00:03:08.750> it

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
apply the makeup over your primer it

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.410 
apply the makeup over your primer it
just<00:03:09.140> goes<00:03:09.320> on<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.500> silky<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.520> so<00:03:11.030> smoothly

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
just goes on so silky and so smoothly

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.400 
just goes on so silky and so smoothly
and<00:03:13.060> it's<00:03:14.060> just<00:03:14.269> a<00:03:14.360> lot<00:03:14.570> easier<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.080> apply<00:03:15.320> it

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
and it's just a lot easier to apply it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.440 
and it's just a lot easier to apply it
now<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.709> only<00:03:16.040> downside<00:03:16.400> about<00:03:16.760> this<00:03:17.180> like<00:03:17.420> I

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
now the only downside about this like I

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.320 
now the only downside about this like I
said<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.930> cost<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.040> quite<00:03:19.310> as<00:03:19.430> oh<00:03:19.880> sorry

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
said the cost is so quite as oh sorry

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.630 
said the cost is so quite as oh sorry
about<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:20.570> just<00:03:20.989> dropping<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.280> quite

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
about that just dropping it it is quite

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.050 
about that just dropping it it is quite
expensive<00:03:22.940> so<00:03:24.430> because<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:25.549> that<00:03:25.580> I<00:03:25.700> kind<00:03:26.000> of

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
expensive so because of that I kind of

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.789 
expensive so because of that I kind of
feel<00:03:26.209> like<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.540> don't<00:03:26.810> want<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.049> waste<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:27.560> I

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
feel like I don't want to waste it so I

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.470 
feel like I don't want to waste it so I
don't<00:03:27.920> want<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.220> use<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.400> like<00:03:28.730> every<00:03:29.120> single

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
don't want to use it like every single

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.690 
don't want to use it like every single
day<00:03:29.630> although<00:03:30.049> hmm<00:03:30.860> because<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.430> my<00:03:31.489> schedule

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700

have<00:04:38.640> very<00:04:38.850> sensitive<00:04:39.180> skin<00:04:39.480> so<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:41.010> would

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
have very sensitive skin so I would

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.840 
have very sensitive skin so I would
highly<00:04:41.850> highly<00:04:42.090> recommend<00:04:42.690> this<00:04:42.840> if<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:43.440> have

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
highly highly recommend this if you have

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.220 
highly highly recommend this if you have
the<00:04:44.850> money<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.210> spend<00:04:45.330> on<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.630> product<00:04:45.900> like

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
the money to spend on a product like

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.670 
the money to spend on a product like
this<00:04:47.390> it<00:04:48.390> does<00:04:48.690> seem<00:04:48.960> like<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.230> will<00:04:49.320> last<00:04:49.380> a

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
this it does seem like it will last a

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.230 
this it does seem like it will last a
long<00:04:49.860> time<00:04:49.890> however<00:04:50.340> I've<00:04:50.580> only<00:04:50.730> used<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:51.060> few

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
long time however I've only used a few

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.700 
long time however I've only used a few
times<00:04:51.450> so<00:04:51.510> I<00:04:51.600> don't<00:04:51.660> really<00:04:51.990> know<00:04:52.320> but<00:04:52.530> it

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
times so I don't really know but it

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.530 
times so I don't really know but it
because<00:04:53.310> of<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.520> size<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:53.760> stuff<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.210> think<00:04:54.240> it

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
because of the size and stuff I think it

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.030 
because of the size and stuff I think it
will<00:04:54.720> last<00:04:55.020> me<00:04:55.320> quite<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.560> long<00:04:55.740> time

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
will last me quite a long time

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.890 
will last me quite a long time
especially<00:04:56.310> since<00:04:56.580> I'm<00:04:56.910> not<00:04:57.030> using<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.510> daily

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
especially since I'm not using it daily

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.530 
especially since I'm not using it daily
so<00:04:58.490> in<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.640> long<00:04:59.820> run<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.000> think<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.360> might<00:05:00.510> be

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
so in the long run I think it might be

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.440 
so in the long run I think it might be
actually<00:05:01.050> worth<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.230> investment<00:05:01.910> so<00:05:02.910> thanks

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
actually worth the investment so thanks

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.820 
actually worth the investment so thanks
