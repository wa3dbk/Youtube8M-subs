00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.809 
bottom two lugs oh well my cowrie shells
I<00:02:15.060> remember<00:02:15.300> one<00:02:15.650> flew<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.459> right<00:02:17.610> here

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
I remember one flew out of right here

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.610 
I remember one flew out of right here
when<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.120> had<00:02:18.540> my<00:02:18.720> hair<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.900> can<00:02:18.989> tell<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.470> her

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
when I had my hair I can tell on her

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.010 
when I had my hair I can tell on her
ponytail<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.310> snapped<00:02:21.030> up<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.330> ponytail<00:02:21.599> holder

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020

ponytail I snapped up a ponytail holder
and<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.950> guess<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.520> Cowrie<00:02:24.450> shell<00:02:24.480> got<00:02:24.810> caught

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
and I guess the Cowrie shell got caught

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.040 
and I guess the Cowrie shell got caught
in<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.099> pointer<00:02:26.489> holder<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.090> blew<00:02:27.690> out
