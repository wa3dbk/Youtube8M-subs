00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.739
 we refer to the double category where 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.320
 they opened san martín texmelucan del 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:35.590
 State of Puebla followed by San Martin 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.480
 also from the state of Puebla and 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.460
 these two poblanos were in front of 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.590

 directed by don memo bustamante and we 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.370
 we go to the horse face where where 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.860
 eduardo valdez starts from the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.470
 partisan and unfortunately not 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.440
 take advantage of the excellent quality of the floor 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.500
 Box Creek canvas 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.229
 golden since it only contributes four of 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.850
 sides and one of a means to take 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.040
 25 units 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.950
 On the other hand, armando hernández 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.040
 he's lucky in what was the movement 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.830
 of tip because as we can see no 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.310
 I knew whether to stop the mare's race 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.399
 or to have the hat though 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.409

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.420

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.920
 times to add 9 tip 4 of those 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.100
 sides and 1 of a half to get to 34 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.869
 units with 4 infraction brings 30 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.700
 points and it becomes the best 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.590

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.030
 one of the limbs had four 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.390
 times so he only added 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.149
 four of the 22 of a half one of the other 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.519
