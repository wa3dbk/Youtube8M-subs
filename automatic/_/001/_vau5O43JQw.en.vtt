00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.400 

Center<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:16.630> we're<00:02:17.630> done<00:02:17.750> if<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.020> first

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
Center it so we're done if the first

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.920 
Center it so we're done if the first
text<00:02:19.069> layer<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:20.150> got<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.360> do<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.450> for<00:02:20.690> all

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
text layer we got to do that for all

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.930 
text layer we got to do that for all
three<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.860> select<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.280> second<00:02:22.580> text<00:02:22.610> layer

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
three so select the second text layer

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.550 
three so select the second text layer
and<00:02:23.180> edit<00:02:23.600> your<00:02:23.720> text<00:02:23.870> again

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.280 

just<00:02:30.560> copy<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.629> size<00:02:32.629> that<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.959> have<00:02:32.989> for<00:02:33.230> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
just copy the size that you have for the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.600 
just copy the size that you have for the
first<00:02:33.500> one<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.739> paste<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.819> for<00:02:34.940> all<00:02:35.000> three<00:02:35.269> and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
first one and paste it for all three and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:45.940 
first one and paste it for all three and
the<00:02:37.610> position<00:02:38.000> 2<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.480> 4<00:02:39.080> 9<00:02:39.260> dy<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.769> last

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
the position 2 so 4 9 dy and the last

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:59.620 
the position 2 so 4 9 dy and the last
text<00:02:46.280> layer

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.100 

so<00:03:00.260> once<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.710> finish<00:03:00.860> with<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.430> just

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
so once you finish with that you just

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.060 
so once you finish with that you just
hydrate<00:03:03.110> switch<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.410> render<00:03:03.650> queue<00:03:03.800> and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
hydrate switch to the render queue and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.180 
hydrate switch to the render queue and
render<00:03:04.880> your<00:03:04.940> intro
