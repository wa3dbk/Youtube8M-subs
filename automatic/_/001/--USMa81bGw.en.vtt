let<00:00:51.510> me<00:00:51.600> show<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.839> a<00:00:51.929> simple<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
let me show you a simple way of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.090 
let me show you a simple way of
correcting<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.370> behavior<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.890> always<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
correcting this behavior as always the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.520 
correcting this behavior as always the
key<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.489> everything<00:00:56.819> was<00:00:57.480> gaining<00:00:57.899> Ruby's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
key to everything was gaining Ruby's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.430 
key to everything was gaining Ruby's
trust<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.249> respect<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.999> I<00:01:00.449> did<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.960> through

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
trust and respect and I did that through

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.169 
trust and respect and I did that through
implementing<00:01:02.249> and<00:01:02.399> putting<00:01:02.429> in<00:01:02.729> place<00:01:02.760> those

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
implementing and putting in place those

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.870 
implementing and putting in place those
five<00:01:03.510> golden<00:01:04.110> rules<00:01:04.309> here's<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> little<00:01:05.640> trick

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
five golden rules here's a little trick

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.180 
five golden rules here's a little trick
though<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.420> helped<00:01:06.659> me<00:01:06.810> establish<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.530> little

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
though that helped me establish a little

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.330 
though that helped me establish a little
bit<00:01:08.280> more<00:01:08.460> respect<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> walk<00:01:09.980> one<00:01:10.980> very

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
bit more respect on the walk one very

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.250 
bit more respect on the walk one very
simple<00:01:11.640> way<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.970> getting<00:01:12.150> at<00:01:12.690> a<00:01:12.810> change<00:01:13.110> of

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
simple way of getting at a change of

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.290 
simple way of getting at a change of
behavior<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.980> to<00:01:14.310> put<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.550> little<00:01:14.850> chain

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
behavior is to put a little chain

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.870 
behavior is to put a little chain
through<00:01:16.140> her<00:01:16.410> collar<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.010> so<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:17.850> first

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
through her collar and so that the first

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.420 
through her collar and so that the first
foot<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.660> half<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.200> her<00:01:19.380> leash<00:01:19.620> is<00:01:19.860> now<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
foot and a half of her leash is now a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.790 
foot and a half of her leash is now a
chain<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.360> she<00:01:21.540> still<00:01:21.810> has<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> soft<00:01:22.560> little

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
chain but she still has a soft little

fabric collar on now Ruby's still free
to<00:01:26.880> jump<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.600> chew<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:28.020> chain<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.470> she

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
to jump up and chew the chain if she
