okay<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:14.009> want<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.320> be<00:00:16.320> careful<00:00:16.710> now<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.070> I

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
okay I want to be careful now that I

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.849 
okay I want to be careful now that I
don't<00:00:18.119> define<00:00:18.539> foliage<00:00:19.109> where<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.500> shouldn't

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
don't define foliage where it shouldn't

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.410 
don't define foliage where it shouldn't
be<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.550> I'll<00:00:20.730> use<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.270> edge<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.350> brush<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
be so I'll use the edge of this brush to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.029 
be so I'll use the edge of this brush to
just<00:00:24.420> kind<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.720> pick<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.769> would<00:00:25.949> be

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
just kind of pick up the this would be

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.750 
just kind of pick up the this would be
the<00:00:26.160> light<00:00:26.369> value<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.289> in<00:00:28.340> this<00:00:29.340> foliage

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the light value in this in this foliage

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.310 
the light value in this in this foliage
will<00:00:29.970> come<00:00:30.119> back<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.510> shape<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> little

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
will come back and shape it a little

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.880 
will come back and shape it a little
more<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.859> some<00:00:32.510> some<00:00:33.510> darker<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.739> they

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
more with some some darker what they

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.310 
more with some some darker what they
would<00:00:35.040> dip<00:00:35.280> into<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.760> yellow<00:00:36.660> ochre<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
would dip into the yellow ochre just a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.619 
would dip into the yellow ochre just a
little<00:00:38.040> bit<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:39.300> had<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> little

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
little bit there they had a little

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.700 
little bit there they had a little
yellow<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.410> things<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.559> need

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
yellow to it one of the things you need

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.610 
yellow to it one of the things you need
to<00:00:43.739> do<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> keep<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.940> bit<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.530> variety<00:00:46.530> as

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to do is keep a little bit of variety as

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.369 
to do is keep a little bit of variety as
you<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.640> move<00:00:47.820> across<00:00:48.120> your<00:00:48.420> painting<00:00:48.809> you

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
you as you move across your painting you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.930 
you as you move across your painting you
don't<00:00:49.559> want<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.950> consistently<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
don't want it to be consistently the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.139 
don't want it to be consistently the
same<00:00:51.239> color<00:00:51.800> okay<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.039> that's<00:00:53.340> defining

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
same color okay that's that's defining

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.529 
same color okay that's that's defining
the<00:00:54.390> shapes<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.160> that's<00:00:57.149> really

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the shapes a bit and and that's really

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.470 
the shapes a bit and and that's really
all<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.829> wanted<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.460> point<00:00:59.969> because

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
all I wanted to do at this point because

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.979 
all I wanted to do at this point because
those<00:01:00.719> will<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.989> shaped<00:01:01.820> later<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.120> I'm<00:01:03.449> going

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
those will be shaped later on I'm going

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.700 
those will be shaped later on I'm going
to<00:01:04.110> let<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.260> dry<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.970> few<00:01:06.180> minutes

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
to let that dry for a few minutes

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
to let that dry for a few minutes
now<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.820> drying<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
now that that's drying a little bit and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.100 
now that that's drying a little bit and
and<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.610> don't<00:01:11.670> need<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.270> green<00:01:12.540> right<00:01:13.080> now

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110

and I don't need that green right now
I've<00:01:14.060> cleaned<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> pallet<00:01:15.540> off<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> little<00:01:15.900> bit

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
I've cleaned the pallet off a little bit

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990 
I've cleaned the pallet off a little bit
to<00:01:16.200> give<00:01:16.320> me<00:01:16.439> some<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.740> mixing<00:01:17.070> room<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.790> what

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
to give me some more mixing room so what

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.230 
to give me some more mixing room so what
I<00:01:18.030> want<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.670> mix<00:01:20.670> some<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.119> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I want to do now is to mix some of this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.390 
I want to do now is to mix some of this
burnt<00:01:22.080> sienna<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.439> altering<00:01:22.860> blue<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
burnt sienna and altering blue and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.660 
burnt sienna and altering blue and
define<00:01:24.330> some<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> rock<00:01:25.110> formations<00:01:25.799> from

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
define some of the rock formations from

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.270 
define some of the rock formations from
the<00:01:26.850> drawing<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> can't<00:01:27.680> tell<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:28.890> some<00:01:29.159> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the drawing you can't tell but some of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.149 
the drawing you can't tell but some of
these<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.850> rocks<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.540> some<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:30.869> plants<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.470> I

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
these are rocks and some are plants so I

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
these are rocks and some are plants so I
will<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> burnt<00:01:34.350> sienna

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
will do that with with the burnt sienna

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.030 
will do that with with the burnt sienna
and<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.070> ultramarine<00:01:35.579> blue<00:01:35.640> by<00:01:36.090> mixing<00:01:36.540> that

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
and the ultramarine blue by mixing that

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.200 
and the ultramarine blue by mixing that
in<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> principles

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
in and one of the one of the principles

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.230 
in and one of the one of the principles
in<00:01:42.420> terms<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.869> color<00:01:43.439> mixing<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.939> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
in terms in color mixing here is that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.200 
in terms in color mixing here is that
you<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:45.869> over<00:01:46.470> mix<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> pallet<00:01:47.640> for

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
you don't over mix on the pallet for

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.780 
you don't over mix on the pallet for
instance<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.530> quite<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> bit<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.520> blue

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
instance I will have quite a bit of blue

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.120 
instance I will have quite a bit of blue
on<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.270> side<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.840> mix<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.439> I'll<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.829> some

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
on one side of a mix and I'll have some

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.130 
on one side of a mix and I'll have some
of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.369> burnt<00:01:53.970> sin<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> other<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.110> just

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
of the burnt sin on the other and just

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.760 
of the burnt sin on the other and just
kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.979> dip<00:01:56.219> out<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.610> those<00:01:56.729> randomly<00:01:57.450> and

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
kind of dip out of those randomly and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.440 
kind of dip out of those randomly and
let<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> mix<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> paper<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.180> will<00:02:00.240> give

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
let it mix on the paper and it will give

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.760 
let it mix on the paper and it will give
a<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:01.200> more<00:02:02.040> interesting<00:02:02.670> variety<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
a little more interesting variety of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.590 
a little more interesting variety of
color<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.040> definition<00:02:05.189> that's<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.329> that's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
color and definition that's a that's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.080 
color and definition that's a that's
awfully<00:02:07.140> gray<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.799> what<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.550> do<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.879> come

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
awfully gray so what I can do is come

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.780 
awfully gray so what I can do is come
back<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.959> mix<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.009> little<00:02:11.580> red

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
back and I can mix a little little red

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.850 
back and I can mix a little little red
with<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
with it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.880

more blue if I need to in order to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.870 
more blue if I need to in order to
define<00:02:15.890> these<00:02:16.340> ROC<00:02:16.760> shapes<00:02:18.520> what<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.550> want<00:02:19.790> to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
define these ROC shapes what I want to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.590 
define these ROC shapes what I want to
see<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.240> not<00:02:20.930> see<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.590> get<00:02:21.830> too<00:02:22.040> too<00:02:23.030> boring

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
see is not see that get too too boring

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.670 
see is not see that get too too boring
there<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:25.280> way<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.430> avoid<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.850> is<00:02:26.180> to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
there and the way to avoid that is to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.720 
there and the way to avoid that is to
mix<00:02:28.120> variety<00:02:29.120> now<00:02:29.380> those<00:02:30.380> colors<00:02:30.950> will<00:02:31.310> still

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
mix variety now those colors will still

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.190 
mix variety now those colors will still
get<00:02:32.230> blend<00:02:33.230> together<00:02:33.680> as<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.790> dries<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:35.750> you

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
get blend together as this dries so you

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.350 
get blend together as this dries so you
will<00:02:36.350> not<00:02:36.500> notice<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.190> distinction<00:02:38.150> of

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
will not notice the distinction of

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.150 
will not notice the distinction of
colors<00:02:38.720> quite<00:02:39.050> as<00:02:39.230> much

colors quite as much

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.030 
colors quite as much
it'll<00:02:40.700> be<00:02:40.790> subtle<00:02:41.150> enough<00:02:41.470> but<00:02:42.470> definite

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040

it'll be subtle enough but definite
enough<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.870> gives<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:45.680> a

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
enough that it that it gives you a

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.730 
enough that it that it gives you a
variety<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.250> it's<00:02:46.430> not<00:02:46.640> boring<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.360> eye

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740
