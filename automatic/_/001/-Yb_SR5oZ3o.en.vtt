00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.949
 explaining how the agent circumvents the password of the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.710
 bios knows when you turn on a computer 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.870
 and has 100 before the windows password to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.059
 bios black screen password 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.510
 I'll show you all I put it on. 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.579
 Without this notebook, I'll call him there. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.980
 let's assume you are a technician in 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.930
 and picks up a computer from a 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.059
 someone to fix you has to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.149
 this password asking for the password 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.820
 or you are an ordinary person is not in 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.980
 mexico is not technical and has been 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.949
 turn on your computer happens to have this 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.270
 yes you do not know 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.229
 So the people tell you how 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.390
 cheat if you have to type three or 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 four times depends on the bios of your 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.250
 computer you have to dictate without wrong 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.070
 to disable it there will show you a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.590
 I cosmos anything here. 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.100
 enter the void password is speaking 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.470
 I do not think I can see it again. 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.119
 wrong again wrong third time of 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.150
 new one there he wrote the zebu system and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.549
 of a code to get the camera close to 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.670
 see if it focuses on you 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:45.329
 Code you can read there guys 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.189
 I do not know if you can read but that's how it is 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.860
 samsung tantrums generate this code 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.380
 multi-digit hexadecimal 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.509
 has some that generates a smaller code 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.759
 depending on whether blue to dell 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.579
 generate smaller codes but I know that the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.110
 samsung jÃ©t huge code that you 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.689
 will you note this whole code and 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.970
 there are sites that generate foot because in 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.330
 Truth this code is just a crypton 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.550
 Trust is just not to speak for example. 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.380
 for any such person but has a 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.570
 generator zinhos a program 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.430
 if you put this code it gives you the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.880
 password that is here on your computer in the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.220
 bios it decodes this code 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.470
 it was hard to find a good site that did 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.450
 really this promises several and does not 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.510
 nothing but I found one that I'm going to leave 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.450
 here in the video description and I'll 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.250
 show you here a print that I 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.140
 I took the site 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.180
 and this site is very simple you type 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.700
 this code he will give you the password 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.770
 then you turn off your computer again 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.440
 on the go is not safe call button 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.860
 can be up to same table pc process 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.920
 hold down the power button until forced 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.920
 Turn the power off and on again 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.110
 back to the password asking for what you ask for 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.500
 the password again and you enter the password 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.950
 that the site gave you here already know the password 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.950
 So 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.930
 and then the computer will start smoothing 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.940
 Just to finish the video, I 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.269
 I wanted to say the following this video is for 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.580
 you go there without it without having to open the 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.090
 computer but several technicians 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.489
 You know what you give it to you. 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.040
 battery that holds the battery 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.050
 bios in two ways 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.760
 and then he loses so I'm with 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.220
 motherboard here in hand 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.260
 I just got it to show it to the plate. 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.810
 Mother has these various tires here and 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:45.180
 I have this gp are these thorns and have 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.030
 this battery that keeps the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.370
 computer running and maintains some 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.560
 information about the initialization of the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.110
 computer running 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.060
 all this is stored on a chip that 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.830
 opened the case of this motherboard 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.320
 probably the one here 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.440
 a spicy one that sits inside 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.180
 of a chip of this technology and shows 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.030
 so you can even search google 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.350
 you will talk how to clean the simmons 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.150
 english clerk's and moss and we pass is nothing 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.030
 more than you come here personal and 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.049
 this battery because 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.129
 which keeps information about life 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.930
 ready you leave her way a while until 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:29.650
 she has lost the data that is inside the 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.449
 chip or have one thing that the 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.889
 manufacturer leaves ready what is today is the 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:38.949
 To tell you the truth, ah, excuse me. 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.720
 will abn news come with this chick here 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.150
 You have to find it on the motherboard. 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.629
 is usually close to the bios chip and 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.520
 such 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:49.240
 just to give an example I will say that this 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.190
 here is it going to be written create some 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.120
 thing on the board 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.909
 then you take that next pininho pulls it 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.949
 looks like those of hd article put 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:04.930
 as master the slayer and you put in the 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.599
 pocket and sometimes strip some 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.430
 to take Joseph was and another you change 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.620
 position if he was in those two 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.620
 First little boy you get these ones. 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.639
 two more here and reconnect the day 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.819
 all of it 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.099
 Then he will see you and you will come back to him. 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.500
 location again and you or the computer 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.810
 will not have password anymore then this is it 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.349
 Who do you like the jewelry and I go a lot. 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.349
 thank you
