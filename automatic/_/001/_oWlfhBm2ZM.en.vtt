00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.490 
looking around and trying to find them
now<00:01:41.340> that's<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.360> lot<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.540> times<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:43.079> I'll<00:01:43.229> run

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
now that's a lot of times when I'll run

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.710 
now that's a lot of times when I'll run
this<00:01:43.680> volume<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.399> 10<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.030> I'll<00:01:45.240> tell<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> why

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
this volume on 10 and I'll tell you why

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.080 
this volume on 10 and I'll tell you why
because<00:01:46.259> I'm<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.740> concerned<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.610> practice

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
because I'm not concerned and practice

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.410 
because I'm not concerned and practice
about<00:01:48.630> catching<00:01:49.140> those<00:01:49.290> fish<00:01:49.970> when<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.000> crank

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
about catching those fish when I crank

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.170 
about catching those fish when I crank
that<00:01:51.570> thing<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> 10<00:01:52.380> any<00:01:53.100> bass<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.880> are<00:01:54.030> on

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that thing up to 10 any bass that are on

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
that thing up to 10 any bass that are on
the<00:01:54.390> very<00:01:54.570> bottom<00:01:55.140> you'll<00:01:55.350> never<00:01:55.619> see<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.100> your

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the very bottom you'll never see on your

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.270 
the very bottom you'll never see on your
graph<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.020> turn<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.439> thing<00:01:58.680> up<00:01:58.860> really

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
graph so if I turn that thing up really

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.670 
graph so if I turn that thing up really
high<00:01:59.460> what's<00:02:00.240> gonna<00:02:00.390> happen<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> when<00:02:01.560> I'm

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
high what's gonna happen is and when I'm

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440 
high what's gonna happen is and when I'm
watching<00:02:01.890> my<00:02:02.189> graph<00:02:02.460> I'll<00:02:02.759> get<00:02:03.000> I'll<00:02:03.180> watch

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
watching my graph I'll get I'll watch

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.170 
watching my graph I'll get I'll watch
these<00:02:03.719> fish<00:02:04.020> raise<00:02:04.950> up<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.369> little<00:02:05.549> bit<00:02:05.729> they'll

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
these fish raise up a little bit they'll

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.999 
these fish raise up a little bit they'll
swim<00:02:06.540> up<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:07.049> they're<00:02:07.229> curious<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.860> know

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
swim up because they're curious you know

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.979 
swim up because they're curious you know
they<00:02:08.160> hear<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.520> shad<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:08.879> they<00:02:09.300> see<00:02:09.360> they

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
they hear that shad and they see they

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.979 
they hear that shad and they see they
hear<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> feeding<00:02:10.770> they'll<00:02:11.280> swim<00:02:11.640> up<00:02:11.879> I'm<00:02:12.510> not

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
hear the feeding they'll swim up I'm not

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
hear the feeding they'll swim up I'm not
worried<00:02:13.230> about<00:02:13.290> catch

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
worried about catch

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.550 
worried about catch
so<00:02:14.370> I'll<00:02:14.520> drop<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.850> waypoint<00:02:15.180> right<00:02:15.960> where<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.230> am

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so I'll drop a waypoint right where I am

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.490 
so I'll drop a waypoint right where I am
and<00:02:16.830> then<00:02:17.520> when<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:17.850> come<00:02:18.180> back<00:02:18.330> around<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:19.260> fish

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and then when I come back around to fish

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.830 
and then when I come back around to fish
for<00:02:19.740> them<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.100> may<00:02:20.670> turn<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.120> volume<00:02:21.600> back

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
for them I may turn that volume back

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.600 
for them I may turn that volume back
down<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.560> I'll<00:02:22.650> know<00:02:22.830> exactly<00:02:22.950> where<00:02:23.460> they

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
down but I'll know exactly where they

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.430 
down but I'll know exactly where they
are<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:24.390> worked<00:02:24.690> for<00:02:24.870> me<00:02:25.020> several<00:02:25.230> times

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
are it's worked for me several times

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.250 
are it's worked for me several times
during<00:02:26.070> tournaments<00:02:26.760> also<00:02:27.180> where<00:02:27.450> I've<00:02:27.600> been

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
during tournaments also where I've been

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.110 
during tournaments also where I've been
catching<00:02:28.500> them<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> Ledge<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.000> know

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
catching them on a Ledge and you know

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.090 
catching them on a Ledge and you know
may<00:02:30.300> have<00:02:30.480> my<00:02:30.690> buoy<00:02:30.900> out<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.440> I'm<00:02:31.530> fishing<00:02:31.770> and

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
may have my buoy out and I'm fishing and

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.220 
may have my buoy out and I'm fishing and
I'm<00:02:32.190> not<00:02:32.370> really<00:02:32.610> getting<00:02:32.850> bit<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.930> roll<00:02:34.200> up

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
I'm not really getting bit so I roll up

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.380 
I'm not really getting bit so I roll up
my<00:02:34.530> buoy<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:34.980> as<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.280> start<00:02:35.580> fishing<00:02:35.820> they<00:02:36.210> may

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
my buoy and as I start fishing they may

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.780 
my buoy and as I start fishing they may
have<00:02:36.540> moved<00:02:36.780> 40<00:02:37.230> or<00:02:37.320> 50<00:02:37.620> yards<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.220> always

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
have moved 40 or 50 yards so always

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.410 
have moved 40 or 50 yards so always
remember<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:40.110> your<00:02:40.860> graph<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.850> fish<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.300> are

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
remember on your graph the fish that are

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.690 
remember on your graph the fish that are
on<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.630> very<00:02:42.810> bottom<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.350> won't<00:02:43.530> see<00:02:43.770> you'll

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
on the very bottom you won't see you'll

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.900 
on the very bottom you won't see you'll
never<00:02:45.030> see<00:02:45.300> them<00:02:46.040> but<00:02:47.040> if<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.550> bring<00:02:47.700> them

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
never see them but if you can bring them

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.200 
never see them but if you can bring them
up<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.180> couple<00:02:48.210> feet<00:02:48.950> you'll<00:02:49.950> see<00:02:50.250> them<00:02:50.400> use

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
up a couple feet you'll see them use

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.840 
up a couple feet you'll see them use
that<00:02:51.240> hideaway<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:51.930> practice<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.550> big

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
that hideaway for practice it's a big

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.050 
that hideaway for practice it's a big
big<00:02:54.150> tool<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:54.930> that
