00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.329
 to 1 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.619
 the duel of the constituent that the tj ratio but a video tutorial 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.019
 continent bonds 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.659
 but we talk about titles we have to understand the reactions why this 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.220
 because to acquire titles in the first cdv of wanting missions and after 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.340
 finish the missions you will win medals and with the medals you 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:39.810
 asset titles 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.490
 then you show them how it works 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.490
 clicking on the emissions icon in the bottom corner of the screen 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.590
 we have two below 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.540
 the personal evaluation piaba title 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.540
 in the personal mission tab we have the vision of all the mentions 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.390
 the first mission to reaction tutorial 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.630
 this quest you win the first time you entered the game 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.510
 When you finish the real geek mission you gain ten units of evidence 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.510
 which is enough to acquire the first four titles 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.240
 important observation 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.300
 the missions to a wing mode or have no evidence and following the 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.600
 area with the tenth when completed 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.649
 the other missions to be completed are basically the same 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.960
 and you get varied unit designate the southern order medal 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.910
 but I will take as an example the version of assault 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.480
 The mission of assault to be completed you have support of acronyms two medals 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.930
 gave an order to the rain 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.020
 let's stop by title 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.350
 people ask me but the tj 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.170
 What is a title like it does to get a degree 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.330
 What I do with the brooches then the medals and orgasm 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.240
 no process is simple but requires attention as there 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.020
 what are titles titles are resources acquired through jÃ´ 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.680
 near worse neither subject 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.340
 with the titles you acquire new abilities for supersalarios 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.289
 example 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.560
 but more speed activity shot but giving of shot among others 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.299
 each title has positive effect with negative effect I pus has also 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 the greenhouse effect that can release the specific weapon 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.779

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:20.939
