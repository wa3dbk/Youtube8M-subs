00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
to your volume knob it cleans up really

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.319 
to your volume knob it cleans up really
nicely

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329

it can actually be EQ to be pretty

asymmetrically<00:00:50.460> which<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.789> don't<00:00:50.850> know

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
asymmetrically which I don't know

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.299 
asymmetrically which I don't know
exactly<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.719> means<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.440> apparently

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
exactly what that means but apparently

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.619 
exactly what that means but apparently
it<00:00:53.489> means<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.940> sounds<00:00:54.239> good<00:00:54.420> because

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
it means that it sounds good because

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.350 
it means that it sounds good because
that's<00:00:55.110> my<00:00:55.829> experience<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:56.910> far<00:00:57.149> but

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that's my experience with it so far but

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.119 
that's my experience with it so far but
that's<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.199> about<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.010> be

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
that's what this is about for you to be

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.000 
that's what this is about for you to be
the<00:00:59.280> judge<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.320> loudness<00:01:01.320> which<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> volume

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the judge so loudness which is volume

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.880 
the judge so loudness which is volume
drive<00:01:02.879> which<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.359> gain<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:03.960> Drive<00:01:04.199> frequency

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
drive which is gain or Drive frequency

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.160 
drive which is gain or Drive frequency
which<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:05.970> basically<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> function

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
which is you know basically the function

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.950 
which is you know basically the function
of<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.350> tone<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.830> kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> shaping<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.090> EQ

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
of a tone just kind of shaping the EQ

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.440 
of a tone just kind of shaping the EQ
curve<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.950> what's<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.299> then

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
curve of what's going on there and then

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.039 
curve of what's going on there and then
your<00:01:12.689> old<00:01:12.869> trusty<00:01:13.799> on/off<00:01:14.130> switch<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.180> I'm

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
your old trusty on/off switch and I'm

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.450 
your old trusty on/off switch and I'm
playing<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> Nash<00:01:17.280> t57<00:01:18.240> Telecaster<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.460> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
playing the Nash t57 Telecaster on the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.270 
playing the Nash t57 Telecaster on the
bridge<00:01:20.820> pickup<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:22.500> playing<00:01:22.770> into<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
bridge pickup and I'm playing into the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.789 
bridge pickup and I'm playing into the
Morrigan<00:01:23.640> RCA<00:01:24.000> 35<00:01:24.570> which<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> very<00:01:25.500> clean

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
Morrigan RCA 35 which is a very clean

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:35.810 
Morrigan RCA 35 which is a very clean
amp<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.340> clean<00:01:27.060> tone<00:01:27.720> sounds<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:29.009> this

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:48.300 

here<00:01:36.820> is<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.270> light<00:01:37.450> speed<00:01:37.870> like<00:01:38.860> this

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.860 

so<00:01:49.310> that's<00:01:49.580> kind<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:49.910> what<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.150> sounds<00:01:50.180> like

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
so that's kind of what it sounds like

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.260 
so that's kind of what it sounds like
there<00:01:51.410> I<00:01:51.740> think<00:01:52.010> that<00:01:52.250> was<00:01:52.520> set<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:52.880> slight

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
there I think that was set to a slight

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.220 
there I think that was set to a slight
boost<00:01:53.540> if<00:01:53.870> memory<00:01:54.170> serves<00:01:54.410> correctly<00:01:56.230> so

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
boost if memory serves correctly so

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.830 
boost if memory serves correctly so
let's<00:01:57.790> well<00:01:58.790> it's<00:01:58.880> not<00:01:59.030> full<00:01:59.240> with<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.600> too

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
let's well it's not full with that too

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.050 
let's well it's not full with that too
much<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.800> loudness<00:02:00.980> does<00:02:01.340> interact<00:02:01.610> with<00:02:01.940> the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
much the loudness does interact with the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.150 
much the loudness does interact with the
drive<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.540> it'll<00:02:02.750> get<00:02:02.930> louder<00:02:03.200> as<00:02:03.440> it<00:02:03.560> goes<00:02:03.800> so

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
drive and it'll get louder as it goes so

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.700 
drive and it'll get louder as it goes so
let's<00:02:04.730> go<00:02:04.970> through<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.600> drive<00:02:05.870> knob<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.470> see

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
let's go through the drive knob and see

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.980 
let's go through the drive knob and see
where<00:02:07.610> we're<00:02:07.850> at<00:02:07.880> when<00:02:08.240> we're<00:02:08.390> at<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.540> bottom

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
where we're at when we're at the bottom

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.190 
where we're at when we're at the bottom
here<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:13.850> actually<00:02:14.000> quieter<00:02:14.690> at<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
here so it's actually quieter at the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:31.130 
here so it's actually quieter at the
bottom<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.500> as<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.860> drive<00:02:22.100> increases<00:02:22.730> wolf

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:43.360 

you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.970 

so<00:02:44.370> I'd<00:02:44.460> say<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> light<00:02:45.060> -<00:02:45.360> maybe<00:02:45.710> mid-drive<00:02:46.710> is

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
so I'd say a light - maybe mid-drive is

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.850 
so I'd say a light - maybe mid-drive is
how<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.460> might<00:02:47.670> classify<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:49.140> pedal<00:02:49.590> being

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
how you might classify this pedal being

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.770 
how you might classify this pedal being
given<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.790> know<00:02:50.820> doesn't<00:02:51.300> doesn't

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
given that it you know doesn't doesn't

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.069 
given that it you know doesn't doesn't
sustain<00:02:52.110> forever<00:02:53.040> anything

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.780 

it<00:02:58.079> has<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> nice<00:02:58.469> tone<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.129> when<00:02:59.519> you're<00:02:59.640> up

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
it has a nice tone to it when you're up

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.729 
it has a nice tone to it when you're up
there<00:02:59.819> let's<00:03:00.659> back<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.049> off<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:02.519> bit<00:03:03.739> and

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
there let's back this off just a bit and

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.979 
there let's back this off just a bit and
let's<00:03:05.489> look<00:03:05.849> at<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.269> frequency<00:03:08.989> let's

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
let's look at the frequency let's

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:17.119 
let's look at the frequency let's
actually<00:03:10.200> bring<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.769> up<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:15.170> it's<00:03:16.170> very<00:03:16.439> kind

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
actually bring this up so it's very kind

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:35.410 
actually bring this up so it's very kind
of<00:03:17.250> dark<00:03:17.579> down<00:03:17.819> there

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.770 

real<00:03:36.580> crispy<00:03:37.580> up<00:03:37.730> there<00:03:37.940> at<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.120> top<00:03:38.360> if<00:03:38.630> you

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
real crispy up there at the top if you

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.380 
real crispy up there at the top if you
like<00:03:38.810> some<00:03:39.349> crisp<00:03:41.080> so<00:03:42.080> let's<00:03:42.620> just<00:03:43.010> give<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:43.940> few

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
like some crisp so let's just give a few

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.290 
like some crisp so let's just give a few
other<00:03:44.950> few<00:03:45.950> other<00:03:46.099> settings<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.730> try<00:03:46.940> maybe

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
other few other settings to try maybe

00:03:47.300 --> 00:04:01.960 
other few other settings to try maybe
darker<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.410> pretty<00:03:48.650> heavy

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.300 

let's<00:04:02.970> go<00:04:03.210> for<00:04:03.450> something<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.960> little<00:04:04.310> lighter

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
let's go for something a little lighter

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:44.630 
let's go for something a little lighter
and<00:04:05.870> crispier<00:04:06.870> maybe

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.540 

let's<00:04:45.640> get<00:04:45.850> something<00:04:46.390> I<00:04:48.660> kind<00:04:49.660> of<00:04:49.690> liked<00:04:49.930> the

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
let's get something I kind of liked the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:05:10.289 
let's get something I kind of liked the
neutral<00:04:51.550> ish<00:04:51.730> setting<00:04:52.150> on<00:04:52.300> this

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:10.299 

00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:14.320 

so<00:05:11.299> definitely<00:05:12.080> sounds<00:05:13.009> good<00:05:13.309> definitely<00:05:13.969> has

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
so definitely sounds good definitely has

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.519 
so definitely sounds good definitely has
Oh<00:05:14.569> actually<00:05:14.809> I<00:05:15.019> did<00:05:15.379> want<00:05:15.409> to<00:05:17.169> look<00:05:18.169> at<00:05:18.319> the

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:18.529 
Oh actually I did want to look at the

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:30.429 
Oh actually I did want to look at the
the<00:05:19.099> cleanup<00:05:19.459> ability<00:05:20.269> of<00:05:20.449> it<00:05:20.599> also<00:05:29.439> the

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:30.439 
the cleanup ability of it also the

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.259 
the cleanup ability of it also the
difference<00:05:30.829> there's<00:05:31.069> just<00:05:31.399> playing<00:05:31.639> soft<00:05:31.999> and

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:32.269 
difference there's just playing soft and

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:42.100 
difference there's just playing soft and
versus<00:05:32.599> playing<00:05:32.869> hard

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.630 

they're<00:05:43.110> writing<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:43.560> being<00:05:43.800> sensitive<00:05:44.310> to

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
they're writing it being sensitive to

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.120 
they're writing it being sensitive to
pick<00:05:45.030> attack<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.570> let's<00:05:45.690> see<00:05:45.930> about<00:05:46.260> volume

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
pick attack and let's see about volume

00:05:47.130 --> 00:06:06.880 
pick attack and let's see about volume
knob<00:05:47.370> to<00:05:47.700> get<00:05:48.000> some<00:05:48.210> cleans

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:13.040 

petal<00:06:07.890> on<00:06:08.010> and<00:06:08.520> volume<00:06:08.880> back<00:06:09.120> dog<00:06:11.870> so<00:06:12.870> that's

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
petal on and volume back dog so that's

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.780 
petal on and volume back dog so that's
definitely<00:06:13.230> cool<00:06:13.620> that<00:06:13.920> you<00:06:14.070> can<00:06:14.340> it<00:06:14.610> does

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
definitely cool that you can it does

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.520 
definitely cool that you can it does
respond<00:06:15.300> so<00:06:15.570> well<00:06:15.810> to<00:06:16.080> that<00:06:16.230> and<00:06:16.410> you<00:06:16.500> can

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
respond so well to that and you can

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.410 
respond so well to that and you can
definitely<00:06:16.860> clean<00:06:17.310> it<00:06:17.460> up<00:06:17.580> especially<00:06:18.270> if<00:06:18.330> you

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
definitely clean it up especially if you

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.990 
definitely clean it up especially if you
mix<00:06:18.690> up<00:06:18.900> pic<00:06:19.650> attack<00:06:19.980> and<00:06:20.220> changing<00:06:20.880> your

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
mix up pic attack and changing your

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.870 
mix up pic attack and changing your
volume<00:06:21.390> you<00:06:21.510> can<00:06:21.690> definitely<00:06:21.870> get<00:06:22.260> it<00:06:22.440> down<00:06:22.650> to

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
volume you can definitely get it down to

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.690 
volume you can definitely get it down to
clean<00:06:23.880> while<00:06:24.180> leaving<00:06:24.450> the<00:06:24.630> pedal<00:06:25.020> on<00:06:25.700> which

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
clean while leaving the pedal on which

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.970 
clean while leaving the pedal on which
definitely<00:06:27.150> has<00:06:27.240> its<00:06:27.420> uses<00:06:27.780> and<00:06:27.960> can<00:06:28.680> let<00:06:28.830> you

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
definitely has its uses and can let you

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.400 
definitely has its uses and can let you
cover<00:06:29.160> a<00:06:29.280> lot<00:06:29.340> of<00:06:29.490> ground<00:06:29.580> totally<00:06:30.180> so<00:06:30.450> good<00:06:31.260> to

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
cover a lot of ground totally so good to

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.430 
cover a lot of ground totally so good to
