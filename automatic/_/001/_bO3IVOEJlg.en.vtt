are<00:06:12.090> I<00:06:12.300> like<00:06:12.630> to<00:06:12.780> do<00:06:12.960> Greek<00:06:13.530> yogurt<00:06:13.979> and<00:06:14.190> some

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
are I like to do Greek yogurt and some

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.339 
are I like to do Greek yogurt and some
fresh<00:06:14.669> fruit<00:06:14.699> and<00:06:15.389> the<00:06:15.780> cool<00:06:15.990> thing<00:06:16.199> is

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
fresh fruit and the cool thing is

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:17.810 
fresh fruit and the cool thing is
because<00:06:16.889> they're<00:06:17.009> thinner<00:06:17.250> than<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:17.520> pancake

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
because they're thinner than a pancake

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.180 
because they're thinner than a pancake
