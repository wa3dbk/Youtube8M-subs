00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
and then as you carry it away use

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.710 
and then as you carry it away use
gravity<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.310> case<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.030> kind<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.330> angle

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
gravity in this case so I kind of angle

gravity in this case so I kind of angle
my<00:02:33.840> right<00:02:34.050> hand<00:02:34.320> like<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.740> use<00:02:35.430> gravity<00:02:35.850> to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
my right hand like this use gravity to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.770 
my right hand like this use gravity to
let<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.270> slide<00:02:36.510> off<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:37.020> flip<00:02:37.590> over<00:02:38.540> okay<00:02:39.540> then

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
let it slide off and flip over okay then

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.300 
let it slide off and flip over okay then
you're<00:02:40.140> going<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.320> take<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.740> remaining<00:02:41.070> right

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
hand cars and bring them on top but

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.130 
hand cars and bring them on top but
you're<00:02:44.970> going<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.150> keep<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.420> pinky<00:02:45.720> break<00:02:45.900> in

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
you're going to keep a pinky break in

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.020 
you're going to keep a pinky break in
between<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:46.980> packet<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.610> remaining

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
between this packet and the remaining

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.210 
between this packet and the remaining
cards<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.350> hold<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.710> pinky<00:02:50.040> break

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
cards so you hold that pinky break

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.160 
cards so you hold that pinky break
you're<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.580> transfer<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.150> into<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.720> thumb

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
you're going to transfer it into a thumb

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.600 
you're going to transfer it into a thumb
break<00:02:52.380> which<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.890> same<00:02:53.070> idea

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
break which is the same idea

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.180 
break which is the same idea
I<00:02:53.640> said<00:02:54.240> now<00:02:54.420> you're<00:02:54.630> using<00:02:54.870> your<00:02:55.080> thumb<00:02:55.380> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
I said now you're using your thumb to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.670 
I said now you're using your thumb to
mark<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.550> spot<00:02:56.960> so<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:58.020> just<00:02:58.200> keep<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.500> little

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
mark the spot so you just keep a little

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.110 
mark the spot so you just keep a little
opening<00:02:59.010> at<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.130> back<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.610> front<00:02:59.880> it's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
opening at the back of the front it's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.320 
opening at the back of the front it's
not<00:03:00.210> noticeable<00:03:01.490> once<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.670> have<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.030> break

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
not noticeable once you have that break

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.770 
not noticeable once you have that break
you're<00:03:04.020> going<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.230> do<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> swivel<00:03:05.130> cut<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:06.750> you

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
you're going to do a swivel cut so you

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.330 
you're going to do a swivel cut so you
approach<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.530> deck<00:03:07.650> from<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.950> back<00:03:08.130> with

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
approach the deck from the back with

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.790 
approach the deck from the back with
your<00:03:08.430> left<00:03:08.610> thumb<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:09.780> lift<00:03:10.050> off<00:03:10.260> all<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
your left thumb you lift off all the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.940 
your left thumb you lift off all the
cards<00:03:11.160> above<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:12.060> thumb<00:03:12.330> break<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.740> do

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
cards above the thumb break and you do

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.290 
cards above the thumb break and you do
that<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.370> we'll<00:03:14.550> cut<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.850> we<00:03:14.970> talked<00:03:15.150> about

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
that so we'll cut that we talked about

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.730 
that so we'll cut that we talked about
in<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.600> beginning<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:18.300> then<00:03:18.990> you<00:03:19.020> slap<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
in the beginning and then you slap the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.040 
in the beginning and then you slap the
remaining<00:03:20.100> crowns<00:03:20.280> right<00:03:20.490> on<00:03:20.640> top<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.180> that's

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
remaining crowns right on top and that's

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.930 
remaining crowns right on top and that's
the<00:03:22.170> whole<00:03:22.380> sequence<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.400> preserves

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the whole sequence that that preserves

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.400 
the whole sequence that that preserves
the<00:03:24.090> order<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.570> deck<00:03:24.780> now<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.050> single

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
the order of the deck now the single

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.390 
the order of the deck now the single
card<00:03:25.650> moves<00:03:26.370> from<00:03:26.970> beginning<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.420> end<00:03:28.400> all

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
card moves from beginning to end all

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.340 
card moves from beginning to end all
right<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:30.000> once<00:03:30.210> again<00:03:30.390> I'll<00:03:30.750> do<00:03:30.960> that<00:03:31.170> all<00:03:31.320> in

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
right so once again I'll do that all in
