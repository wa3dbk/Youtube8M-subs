moving forward inside the rock and of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.920 
moving forward inside the rock and of
course<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.489> soon<00:00:32.550> as<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.820> feel<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.059> continue

pushed<00:00:36.000> inside<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.690> rock<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.590> spot<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.040> is

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
pushed inside the rock this spot this is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.100 
pushed inside the rock this spot this is
extremely<00:00:38.700> easy<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.910> get<00:00:39.090> into<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.660> not<00:00:39.930> very

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
extremely easy to get into it's not very

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.959 
extremely easy to get into it's not very
difficult<00:00:40.290> whatsoever<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> really

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
difficult whatsoever but what I really

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.340 
difficult whatsoever but what I really
like<00:00:42.120> about<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.510> spot<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> fact<00:00:43.230> that

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
like about this spot is the fact that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.139 
like about this spot is the fact that
not<00:00:43.530> only<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.219> out<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.550> rock<00:00:44.760> but

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
not only can you see out the rock but

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.340 
not only can you see out the rock but
you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.360> also<00:00:45.480> shoot<00:00:45.780> through<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.079> rock

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
you can also shoot through the rock

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.630 
you can also shoot through the rock
which<00:00:46.800> means<00:00:47.010> when<00:00:47.160> people<00:00:47.460> come<00:00:47.610> running

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
which means when people come running

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760 
which means when people come running
past<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.360> wish<00:00:48.539> they<00:00:48.719> will<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.620> get

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
past you wish they will you can get

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.470 
past you wish they will you can get
kills<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.160> inside<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.270> course

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
kills from inside here and of course

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.729 
kills from inside here and of course
people<00:00:51.660> won't<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.079> expecting<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> be

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
people won't be expecting you to be

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.380 
people won't be expecting you to be
inside<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> rock<00:00:53.399> which<00:00:53.850> means<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.270> take

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
inside the rock which means you can take

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.939 
inside the rock which means you can take
a<00:00:54.420> lot<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.629> people<00:00:54.809> by<00:00:55.079> surprise<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
a lot of people by surprise and get a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.220 
a lot of people by surprise and get a
couple<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.370> kills<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:57.360> bust<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.809> definitely

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
couple of kills this bust is definitely

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.260 
couple of kills this bust is definitely
very<00:00:58.410> useful<00:00:58.920> especially<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.760> game<00:01:00.000> modes

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
very useful especially in game modes

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
very useful especially in game modes
such<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> certian<00:01:01.050> destroy<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.620> infected

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
such a certian destroy and infected

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.520 
such a certian destroy and infected
where<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> main<00:01:02.969> objective<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.719> hide<00:01:04.049> but

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
where the main objective is to hide but

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.929 
where the main objective is to hide but
of<00:01:04.619> course<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.129> use<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.580> other<00:01:05.670> game

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
of course you can use this in other game

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.370 
of course you can use this in other game
modes<00:01:06.210> such<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.450> team<00:01:06.750> deathmatch<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
modes such as team deathmatch and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
modes such as team deathmatch and
domination<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.460> guess<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> all<00:01:09.060> comes<00:01:09.090> down<00:01:09.390> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
domination I guess it all comes down to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.000 
domination I guess it all comes down to
which<00:01:09.780> strategy<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> want<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> use<00:01:10.799> when

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
which strategy you want to use when

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.520 
which strategy you want to use when
playing<00:01:11.250> online<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.390> overall<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.140> both<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
playing online so overall this both is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.050 
playing online so overall this both is
definitely<00:01:13.920> very<00:01:13.950> useful<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.670> use<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
definitely very useful to use as a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.149 
definitely very useful to use as a
hiding<00:01:15.479> spot<00:01:15.509> when<00:01:15.990> playing<00:01:16.290> online<00:01:16.470> it's

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
hiding spot when playing online it's

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.039 
hiding spot when playing online it's
very<00:01:17.400> easy<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:17.850> inside<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> rock<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
very easy to get inside the rock and of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.270 
very easy to get inside the rock and of
course<00:01:19.259> once<00:01:19.530> you're<00:01:19.650> inside<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.009> rock<00:01:20.159> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
course once you're inside the rock you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.460 
course once you're inside the rock you
can<00:01:20.310> shoot<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.150> loads<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.509> kills<00:01:21.720> so

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
can shoot out and get loads of kills so

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.929 
can shoot out and get loads of kills so
