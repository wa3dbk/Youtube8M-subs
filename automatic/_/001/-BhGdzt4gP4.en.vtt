 today there is a little more here that I know 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.450
 what is this 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.600
 I 'm going to die 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.600
 because I can not go out to die 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.620
 and you cheated on me how you want me to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.650
 I trust you doing these things 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.250
 as in port I carry a point but if 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.980
 you will arrive at the top there is a button 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.850
 you would earn two points 2 2 because you do not even know 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.850
 happen to get to the top 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.230

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.750

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.860
 tricked as a reliable media of you sure 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.860
 that there was no imposter 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.450
 we go blocks fall on him bursting of 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.450
 head 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.190
 something else should have creative 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.760
 to fly and see how they are giving you 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.760
 milestones blocks 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.180
 that's why I'm going to ask you to once 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.099
 screen so if I die before the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.200
 guys can see your screen and a notepad 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.940
 I like that you think everything with the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.940
 head with what you never think 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.060
 I told him the colonel's voice when he did not 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.099
 I have the Colonel's dialogue in front of me 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.260
 today you are holding a lot do not you think 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.260
 all is one of linate and healthy 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.700
 you will not be one of the gomina to you kisses 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.870
 osasuna lumina to you is also a 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.150
 danger to start I have to finish with 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.830
 three soldiers blocks to throw more 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.870
 blocks 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:07.379
 well if it goes up and everything 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:11.900
 but she better not stop climbing is not 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.900
 that those are rabbit ears 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.470
 you are an impostor you are an impostor 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.270
 true strip stops rabbit and sure 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.100
 that would reach the top 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.600
 but this is not the tetis that I play the 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.080
 that I play is to stack blocks not of 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.080
 that the blocks 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.390
 play offline you can not give the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.390
 button 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.820
 10 have to put up the anvil 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.260
 here and here 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.909
 and oh that I fall I do not want to fall 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.909
 I want that no no no no no no 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.010
 because I'm dying so fast because it's better 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.569
 it does not do more than carmen anvil is block 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.739
 this what I want but they do not kill me and I 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.739
 change though in the head 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.510
 the game modified by the anvil 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.639
 always fall on my bald head already 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.979
 Of course, if you have said it where it is most 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.710
 easier white to have a 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.790
 butter then but then no 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.110
 should give me because if I like you 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.370
 butter things always remain for 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.090
 the butter so I had to 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.090
 to be floating upside down 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.350
 it also has butter 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.379
 that always falls where butter like this 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.340
 hahaha how funny are you 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.090
 when you take a week in the 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.529
 dungeon 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.380
 or two 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:51.390
 and already this one takes 2 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.340
 until the idiots come back those who 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.290
 we have sent to do the mission 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.120
 I always have some pringao that makes 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.590
 missions for us so I do not have to 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.830
 pay my soldiers because I only know 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.830
 remain 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.289
 although he does his mission 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.869
 twenty 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:12.499
 can be changed if it arrives would be all 

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:14.930
 tie I will get to the opponent all go 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:17.639
 see if you do not get up at all for 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.370
 the following ones of the dungeon 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.530
 only when it returns to bricks until 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.569
 do not come back in your filthy cat and the 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.569
 idiot of your boyfriend will not be able to leave 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:44.689
 give it all the button let's go let's go 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:44.689
 dale to generate is true is so the rest 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.820
 desired as 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.270
 We're not going to win if you're not going to win me 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.590
 I think I win not but good but what happens 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.199
 here because I always fall for 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.070
 anvils because I always have friends 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.290
 tino although there none 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.140
 I do not fall blocks I fall anvil 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.000

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.390
 uncle 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.420
 this may be the fastest challenge the 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.990
 express challenge the challenge lends to the 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.330
 what to call the rite wait or never be 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.220
