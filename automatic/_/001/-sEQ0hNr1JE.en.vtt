00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
kind of get in the swing of things but

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.150 
kind of get in the swing of things but
as<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.630> come<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:36.989> against<00:00:37.290> our<00:00:37.530> opponent<00:00:38.010> here

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
Argentine team and he's got two

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.060 
Argentine team and he's got two
centre-backs<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> CDM<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.649> probably<00:00:43.920> not

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
centre-backs as a CDM it's probably not

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.010 
centre-backs as a CDM it's probably not
the<00:00:44.100> smartest<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.820> things<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.390> they<00:00:45.960> do

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the smartest of things but they do

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
the smartest of things but they do
probably<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:47.129> higher<00:00:47.370> chemistry<00:00:47.850> than

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
probably get higher chemistry than

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.880 
probably get higher chemistry than
normal<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.079> loyalty<00:00:49.530> thing

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
normal because of that loyalty thing

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.470 
normal because of that loyalty thing
they<00:00:50.039> added<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.399> year<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.910> may<00:00:51.059> might

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
they added this year so they may might

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.600 
they added this year so they may might
have<00:00:51.510> seven<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:52.440> eight<00:00:52.710> chemistry<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.370> too

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
have seven or eight chemistry not too

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.970

making<00:07:25.110> a<00:07:25.350> new<00:07:25.560> team<00:07:25.830> there<00:07:26.460> were<00:07:26.580> some<00:07:26.910> things

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
making a new team there were some things

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.360 
making a new team there were some things
going<00:07:27.330> on<00:07:27.750> with<00:07:28.140> with<00:07:28.560> the<00:07:28.680> team<00:07:28.890> i<00:07:28.920> was<00:07:29.190> using

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370 
going on with with the team i was using

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.790 
going on with with the team i was using
I<00:07:29.550> just<00:07:29.790> felt<00:07:30.060> like<00:07:30.150> my<00:07:30.810> strikers<00:07:31.350> were<00:07:31.500> doing

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 
I just felt like my strikers were doing

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.470 
I just felt like my strikers were doing
most<00:07:32.130> of<00:07:32.280> the<00:07:32.340> assisting<00:07:33.000> rather<00:07:33.270> than

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.480 
most of the assisting rather than

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.960 
most of the assisting rather than
actually<00:07:33.870> the<00:07:33.990> scoring<00:07:34.530> so<00:07:35.130> I'm<00:07:35.730> not<00:07:35.910> really

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:35.970 
actually the scoring so I'm not really
