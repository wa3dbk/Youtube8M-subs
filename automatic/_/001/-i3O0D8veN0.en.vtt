 excellent 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:49.919
 Gaultier it is a multiculti system the actors balance - the user in 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.229
 general the owner of the mac

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.319
 here the user folder 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.630
 contains 5 different user 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.669
 the active user 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.129
 it is the user who is introduced by the small house 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.129
 in this case they form 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:20.620
 the shared folder 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.699
 allows 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.580
 to communicate data 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.499
 between them the earth psychiatrists

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:01.229
 little house 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:02.719
 and then

 eq sequence 

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:22.129
 in addition there is I believe 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.749
 the office folder 

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:27.749
 downloading 

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.539
