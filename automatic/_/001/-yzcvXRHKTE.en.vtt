00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.630
 Hello everyone and welcome today 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.119
 we will prepare a nice dessert with strawberries 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.730
 a delicious and fresh cheese cake 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.839
 let's see the ingredients for the 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.040
 base you will need 150 g of butter e 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.570
 300 grams of biscuits from Steve DJs 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.100
 you can use a mixer to mention i 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.750
 cookies or put it in a 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.200
 bag for food and crushes b 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.200
 with a rolling pin 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.660
 maybe put a few at a time 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.960
 and crush them 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.470
 if you want you can also use 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.500
 some other type of biscuit not 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.380
 necessarily these are enough 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.869
 dry and not covered faces with 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.920
 chocolate and above all that you succeed in 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.280
 chop powder without problems 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.649
 you see they will have to be very very fine 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.399
 now you can melt the butter or negrone 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.700
 or in a saucepan add the 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.700
 melted butter 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.060
 stir well 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.320
 now take a hinged mold of the 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.790
 I have already placed a diameter of 24 cm 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.470
 paper to form this way when 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.970
 you will go to cut the various slices of 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.390
 cheese cakes will not stick to the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.390
 background transferred to the cookies 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.060
 crush with your hands or if you want with 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.620
 a glass I prefer with my hands 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.250
 try to get more or less the same 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.250
 thickness 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.680
 now refrigerate for at least one 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.540
 in the meantime let's go to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.690
 prepare the cream of cheeses for the 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.549
 cheesecake now we're going to prepare the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.650
 Cheesecake together let's see what 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:57.269
 we need 500 grams of mascarpone 200 ml 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:02.040
 of cream 250 g of ricotta 150 g of 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.079
 sugar 250 ml of strawberry yoghurt e 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.799
 12 grams of gelatin in sheets I have 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:11.310
 already soaked in cold water 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.519
 start by working the mascarpone with lo 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.519
 sugar 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.800
 add the ricotta now 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.650
 take the yogurt with the strawberries 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.010
 all 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.690
 now the state of the cream in the microwave you 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.480
 you can always use either the microwave or a 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.120
 small pot we have removed all 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.849
 bowls that we no longer needed 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.860
 we have wrung out the jelly and this is it 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:13.670
 the warmed cream here I go to 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.670
 reach the jelly 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.730
 and I dissolve it 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.600
 and a pa to add the jelly 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.140
 dissolved in the cream the mixture of 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.140
 cheeses 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.930
 here we have amalgamated all I 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:46.800
 took the mold from the fridge and now to the 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.800
 cheese cream 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.850
 revealed the surface a little 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.649
 here it is 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:02.869
 now you can put it in the fridge for at least 

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:05.779
 three hours or at least until the cheese 

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:08.419
 cake will not be firmed while cheese 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:09.739
 cake and in the fridge set up we prepare the 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.079
 strawberry sauce we will use to 

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:15.139
 garnish it I will need 300 grams of 

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:17.869
 strawberries and 30 grams of powdered sugar 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.229
 take the strawberries and cut them into 

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:20.229
 pieces 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:26.209
 take a container with high edges 

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:29.649
 where are you going to blend the strawberries with 

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:29.649
 an immersion blender 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:38.709
 take the chopped strawberries 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:40.449
 and add the powdered sugar and now 

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:42.629
 using a blender to puree dipping 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.629
 the whole 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.680
 the strawberry sauce is ready and you will have to 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.680
 just phil meat like a colander 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.040
 I used the same bowl where 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.330
 there was icing sugar 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.070
 this is the cheesecake I got from 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.620
 fridge as you can see I put some 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.790
 film to prevent it from absorbing 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.070
 smells of the fridge fir delicately 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.650
 zipper and maybe help yourself with one 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.480
 spatula in order to detach the 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.050
 cheesecake from the edges without it 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.050
 slits 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:38.730
 and here's a nice slice now 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:42.410
 bust cheese cake with strawberries and 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.410
 add a little strawberry sauce 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:52.830
 and here's a nice slice of cheesecake 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.440

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.740
