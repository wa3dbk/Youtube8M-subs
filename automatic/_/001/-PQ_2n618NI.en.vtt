really looking for the right balance of

really looking for the right balance of
drag<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.230> lift<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.590> too<00:00:35.370> much<00:00:35.520> track<00:00:35.850> and

drag and lift on too much track and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.729 
drag and lift on too much track and
really<00:00:36.270> slow<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> ball<00:00:36.780> down<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.380> too<00:00:37.410> little

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
really slow the ball down but too little

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.139 
really slow the ball down but too little
drag<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.790> make<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> ball<00:00:39.270> fly<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.440> year

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
drag can make the ball fly out of a year

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.479 
drag can make the ball fly out of a year
in<00:00:42.149> casing<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.540> really<00:00:42.870> something<00:00:43.230> but

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
in casing is really something but

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.529 
in casing is really something but
controls<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.700> ball<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.149> passes<00:00:45.360> through

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
controls the ball as it passes through

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.479 
controls the ball as it passes through
the<00:00:45.809> air<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.140> we've<00:00:46.320> able<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> develop<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the air and we've able to develop the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.810 
the air and we've able to develop the
casing<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.180> t9<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> trace<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> is

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
casing for the t9 to trace of it is

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.910 
casing for the t9 to trace of it is
aerodynamically<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.210> efficient<00:00:51.920> really

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
aerodynamically more efficient really

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.470 
aerodynamically more efficient really
what<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.160> does<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.550> hold<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.000> ball<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
what this does is hold the ball in the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.260 
what this does is hold the ball in the
air<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.199> stop<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.100> from<00:00:56.309> moving<00:00:56.370> around<00:00:57.030> or

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
air and stop it from moving around or

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.760 
air and stop it from moving around or
nothing<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.379> some<00:00:58.649> other

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
nothing like we see on some other

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.639 
nothing like we see on some other
occasions<00:00:59.430> we<00:01:00.149> use<00:01:00.359> micro<00:01:00.930> tech<00:01:01.079> chure<00:01:01.230> casing

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
occasions we use micro tech chure casing

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
occasions we use micro tech chure casing
to<00:01:01.829> help<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.489> accuracy<00:01:03.090> basically<00:01:03.719> help<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
to help with accuracy basically help the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.660 
to help with accuracy basically help the
ball<00:01:04.350> fly<00:01:04.650> through<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.890> air<00:01:04.979> straighter<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
ball fly through the air straighter and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.780 
ball fly through the air straighter and
faster<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.420> more<00:01:06.540> true<00:01:07.100> we<00:01:08.100> found<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.610> our

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
faster and more true we found that our

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.390 
faster and more true we found that our
ball<00:01:09.320> performs<00:01:10.320> much<00:01:10.590> better<00:01:10.619> than<00:01:11.010> anything

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400

over here if you look at traditional

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.810 
over here if you look at traditional
goal<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.440> scene<00:01:51.650> described<00:01:52.160> if<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:52.580> look<00:01:52.700> at

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
goal the scene described if you look at

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.090 
goal the scene described if you look at
the<00:01:52.970> teen<00:01:53.270> RIT<00:01:53.570> try<00:01:53.750> so<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.320> scenes<00:01:54.980> are

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
the teen RIT try so the scenes are

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.710 
the teen RIT try so the scenes are
actually<00:01:55.310> curved<00:01:55.610> there<00:01:55.970> is<00:01:56.090> no<00:01:56.270> hot<00:01:56.540> spots

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
actually curved there is no hot spots

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.360 
actually curved there is no hot spots
there's<00:01:57.080> no<00:01:57.170> soft<00:01:57.470> spots<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.890> therefore<00:01:58.250> you

as possible in the past graphics were

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.670 
as possible in the past graphics were
always<00:02:17.270> kind<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.540> an<00:02:17.660> aesthetic<00:02:17.870> treatment<00:02:18.440> we

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
always kind of an aesthetic treatment we

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.900 
always kind of an aesthetic treatment we
try<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.980> look<00:02:19.190> at<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.580> different<00:02:19.610> way

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
try to look at it in a different way

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.390 
try to look at it in a different way
visual<00:02:20.600> acuity<00:02:20.810> or<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.350> visual<00:02:21.860> signals<00:02:22.280> that

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
visual acuity or the visual signals that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.880 
visual acuity or the visual signals that
the<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:23.270> ball<00:02:23.420> gives<00:02:23.660> off<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:24.110> something<00:02:24.739> that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
the the ball gives off is something that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.320 
the the ball gives off is something that
we've<00:02:25.100> been<00:02:25.250> developing<00:02:25.520> over<00:02:25.910> many<00:02:26.270> years

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
we've been developing over many years

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.650 
we've been developing over many years
the<00:02:26.959> flicker<00:02:27.230> effect<00:02:27.590> is<00:02:28.030> effectively<00:02:29.030> like<00:02:29.630> a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
the flicker effect is effectively like a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.810 
the flicker effect is effectively like a
strobe<00:02:30.080> light<00:02:30.140> as<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:31.070> ball<00:02:31.280> comes<00:02:31.459> towards

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
strobe light as the ball comes towards

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.190 
strobe light as the ball comes towards
you<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.090> get<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:32.420> light<00:02:32.750> dark<00:02:32.959> light<00:02:33.050> dark

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
you you get this light dark light dark

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.410 
you you get this light dark light dark
and<00:02:33.620> therefore<00:02:33.980> your<00:02:34.550> eyes<00:02:34.760> can<00:02:35.060> see<00:02:35.090> that

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
and therefore your eyes can see that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.300 
and therefore your eyes can see that
much<00:02:35.600> better<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.080> much<00:02:36.140> lesser<00:02:36.530> players<00:02:37.070> have

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
much better and much lesser players have

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.040 
much better and much lesser players have
told<00:02:37.489> us<00:02:37.610> they<00:02:37.880> identify<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.510> ball<00:02:38.780> quickly

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
told us they identify the ball quickly

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.190 
told us they identify the ball quickly
it<00:02:39.709> allows<00:02:39.920> them<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.190> judge<00:02:40.459> spin<00:02:40.850> by<00:02:41.810> having

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
it allows them to judge spin by having

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.500 
it allows them to judge spin by having
that<00:02:42.250> split-second<00:02:43.250> upon<00:02:43.730> by<00:02:44.030> seeing<00:02:44.360> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
that split-second upon by seeing the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.120 
that split-second upon by seeing the
ball<00:02:44.690> earlier<00:02:45.080> we're<00:02:45.470> able<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.770> achieve<00:02:45.860> your

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
ball earlier we're able to achieve your

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.150 
ball earlier we're able to achieve your
goal<00:02:46.520> much<00:02:46.850> easier<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:48.110> need<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.560> ball<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:49.010> go

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
goal much easier you need the ball to go

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.280 
goal much easier you need the ball to go
where<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.459> want<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.880> it's<00:02:50.450> what<00:02:50.810> your<00:02:50.989> job<00:02:51.230> is
