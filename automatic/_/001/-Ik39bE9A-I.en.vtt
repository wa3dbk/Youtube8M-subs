get a lot better idea of my storage

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.380 
get a lot better idea of my storage
capability<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.640> speaking<00:04:40.970> of<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.090> storage

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
capability and speaking of the storage

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.390 
capability and speaking of the storage
capability<00:04:41.900> this<00:04:42.050> thing<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:42.470> mean<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:43.010> asked<00:04:43.190> for

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
capability this thing I mean I asked for

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.610 
capability this thing I mean I asked for
an<00:04:43.490> extra<00:04:43.760> wide<00:04:44.000> but<00:04:44.330> it<00:04:44.480> is<00:04:44.660> freaking<00:04:45.290> huge

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
an extra wide but it is freaking huge

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.740 
an extra wide but it is freaking huge
it's<00:04:46.130> absolutely<00:04:46.640> huge<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.300> I<00:04:47.360> think<00:04:47.570> that

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
it's absolutely huge and I think that

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.370 
it's absolutely huge and I think that
the<00:04:48.580> lid<00:04:49.580> on<00:04:49.730> there<00:04:50.000> is<00:04:50.150> two<00:04:50.419> feet<00:04:50.690> wide<00:04:51.020> and<00:04:51.290> go

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
the lid on there is two feet wide and go

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.470 
the lid on there is two feet wide and go
two<00:04:51.530> feet<00:04:51.740> deep<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:52.280> of<00:04:52.400> course<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:53.180> width<00:04:53.390> of

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
two feet deep and of course the width of

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.260 
two feet deep and of course the width of
the<00:04:53.600> truck<00:04:53.840> on<00:04:54.050> there<00:04:54.290> so<00:04:54.790> should<00:04:55.790> be<00:04:55.820> plenty

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
the truck on there so should be plenty

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.180 
the truck on there so should be plenty
of<00:04:56.390> storage<00:04:56.720> capability<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.590> love<00:04:57.950> that

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
of storage capability and I love that

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.100 
of storage capability and I love that
fact<00:04:58.460> that<00:04:59.150> there's<00:04:59.330> not<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.570> bunch<00:04:59.720> of<00:04:59.870> small
