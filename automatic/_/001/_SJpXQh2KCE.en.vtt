00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.080 

this<00:00:07.399> problem<00:00:08.120> deals<00:00:08.750> with<00:00:09.440> lift<00:00:10.160> and<00:00:10.519> drag

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
this problem deals with lift and drag

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.640 
this problem deals with lift and drag
and<00:00:11.570> also<00:00:12.559> how<00:00:12.799> we<00:00:12.860> can<00:00:13.070> calculate<00:00:13.630> power

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
and also how we can calculate power

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.249 
and also how we can calculate power
knowing<00:00:15.650> both<00:00:16.040> those<00:00:16.550> quantities<00:00:17.270> so<00:00:17.750> we<00:00:17.779> have

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:18.259 
knowing both those quantities so we have

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.929 
knowing both those quantities so we have
a<00:00:18.650> light<00:00:19.279> aircraft<00:00:19.610> it<00:00:20.270> has<00:00:20.660> a<00:00:21.169> wing<00:00:21.650> area<00:00:22.040> so

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
a light aircraft it has a wing area so

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.589 
a light aircraft it has a wing area so
our<00:00:22.970> area<00:00:23.720> equals<00:00:25.869> 250<00:00:26.869> feet<00:00:27.500> squared<00:00:28.099> and<00:00:28.599> a

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
our area equals 250 feet squared and a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.380 
our area equals 250 feet squared and a
lift<00:00:30.470> coefficient<00:00:30.860> of<00:00:32.620> 0.4<00:00:33.620> Oh<00:00:33.980> a<00:00:34.550> drag

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
lift coefficient of 0.4 Oh a drag

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.970 
lift coefficient of 0.4 Oh a drag
coefficient<00:00:35.860> of<00:00:38.260> 0.05<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:40.750> given<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:41.980> velocity

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
coefficient of 0.05 and given a velocity

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.349 
coefficient of 0.05 and given a velocity
of<00:00:43.309> a<00:00:44.149> hundred<00:00:44.839> feet<00:00:45.350> per<00:00:45.649> second<00:00:46.489> what<00:00:47.030> we

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
of a hundred feet per second what we

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.910 
of a hundred feet per second what we
want<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.899> find<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:48.679> the<00:00:48.739> lift<00:00:49.429> the<00:00:49.910> drag<00:00:50.359> and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
want to find is the lift the drag and

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.720 
want to find is the lift the drag and
the<00:00:51.920> power<00:00:52.749> required<00:00:53.749> to<00:00:53.960> maintain<00:00:54.730> level

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
the power required to maintain level

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.380 
the power required to maintain level
flight<00:00:55.989> so<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.679> first<00:00:57.980> thing<00:00:58.309> we<00:00:58.730> need<00:00:58.999> to<00:00:59.030> do

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
flight so the first thing we need to do

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.360 
flight so the first thing we need to do
is<00:00:59.690> to<00:01:00.440> find<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:01.129> lift<00:01:01.789> and<00:01:01.999> our<00:01:02.420> lift<00:01:02.749> is<00:01:03.070> C<00:01:04.070> sub

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
is to find a lift and our lift is C sub

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.890 
is to find a lift and our lift is C sub
L<00:01:04.580> times<00:01:05.269> one<00:01:05.840> half<00:01:06.260> times<00:01:06.950> Rho<00:01:07.360> u<00:01:08.360> squared

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
L times one half times Rho u squared

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.950 
L times one half times Rho u squared
over<00:01:09.740> area<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.030> only<00:01:11.180> thing<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:11.810> we're

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
over area so the only thing that we're

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.680 
over area so the only thing that we're
missing<00:01:11.990> there<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.430> grow<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:13.940> which<00:01:14.510> is

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
missing there is the grow and which is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.740 
missing there is the grow and which is
the<00:01:14.870> density<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.710> remember<00:01:16.340> we<00:01:16.550> have<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:17.090> use

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
the density and remember we have to use

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.370 
the density and remember we have to use
our<00:01:18.130> English<00:01:19.130> units<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.060> that's<00:01:20.360> two<00:01:20.900> point

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
our English units so that's two point

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.990 
our English units so that's two point
three<00:01:21.860> eight<00:01:21.890> times<00:01:22.670> ten<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:23.900> minus<00:01:24.050> third

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
three eight times ten to the minus third

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.800 
three eight times ten to the minus third
slugs<00:01:26.000> per<00:01:26.840> feet<00:01:27.680> cube<00:01:28.120> so<00:01:29.120> now<00:01:29.300> let's<00:01:29.570> put

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
slugs per feet cube so now let's put

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.510 
slugs per feet cube so now let's put
this<00:01:29.990> all<00:01:30.230> together<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:31.160> is<00:01:31.780> 0.4<00:01:32.780> times

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
this all together this is 0.4 times

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.300 
this all together this is 0.4 times
point<00:01:34.520> five<00:01:34.880> times<00:01:35.720> two<00:01:36.440> point<00:01:36.740> three<00:01:37.160> eight

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
point five times two point three eight

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.740 
point five times two point three eight
times<00:01:38.270> ten<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:38.960> minus<00:01:39.080> third<00:01:39.920> slugs<00:01:40.910> per

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
times ten to the minus third slugs per

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.340 
times ten to the minus third slugs per
feet<00:01:42.200> cubed<00:01:42.760> multiplied<00:01:43.760> by<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.660> hundred<00:01:45.230> and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
feet cubed multiplied by a hundred and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.810 
feet cubed multiplied by a hundred and
fifty<00:01:45.920> feet<00:01:46.550> per<00:01:47.120> second<00:01:47.750> squared<00:01:48.310> times<00:01:49.310> two

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
fifty feet per second squared times two

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.130 
fifty feet per second squared times two
hundred<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.450> fifty<00:01:51.050> feet<00:01:51.620> squared<00:01:52.370> and<00:01:53.140> when

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
hundred and fifty feet squared and when

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.180 
hundred and fifty feet squared and when
we<00:01:54.580> calculate<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.610> all<00:01:56.180> out<00:01:56.630> what<00:01:57.530> we<00:01:57.830> end<00:01:58.160> up

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
we calculate that all out what we end up

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.260 
we calculate that all out what we end up
with<00:01:58.760> is<00:01:59.480> two<00:02:00.290> thousand<00:02:00.950> six<00:02:01.580> hundred<00:02:01.820> and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
with is two thousand six hundred and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.710 
with is two thousand six hundred and
seventy<00:02:02.690> seven<00:02:03.260> point<00:02:03.740> five<00:02:04.220> now<00:02:04.910> let's<00:02:05.450> look

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
seventy seven point five now let's look

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.190 
seventy seven point five now let's look
at<00:02:05.870> our<00:02:06.050> units<00:02:06.620> slug<00:02:07.460> foot<00:02:08.209> per<00:02:08.660> second

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
at our units slug foot per second

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.880 
at our units slug foot per second
squared<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:10.239> we<00:02:11.239> want<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.629> change<00:02:11.989> that<00:02:12.349> to

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
squared and we want to change that to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.839 
squared and we want to change that to
pound<00:02:13.160> force<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.749> conversion<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.739> this

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
pound force and the conversion is this

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.610 
pound force and the conversion is this
so<00:02:17.390> if<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.599> notice

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
so if you notice

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.190 
so if you notice
it's<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.040> exact<00:02:19.459> same<00:02:19.819> number<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:21.019> we're

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
it's the exact same number but we're

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.690 
it's the exact same number but we're
putting<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.800> in<00:02:22.010> town<00:02:22.910> force<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.379> this<00:02:24.769> lift<00:02:25.190> is

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
putting it in town force so this lift is

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.250 
putting it in town force so this lift is
also<00:02:26.390> going<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.200> equal<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.459> weight<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
also going to equal the weight of the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.610 
also going to equal the weight of the
aircraft<00:02:30.500> now<00:02:31.400> let's<00:02:31.849> figure<00:02:32.209> out<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:33.290> drag

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
aircraft now let's figure out the drag

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.850 
aircraft now let's figure out the drag
so<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.400> drag<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:35.030> going<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.510> equal<00:02:35.629> C<00:02:36.319> sub<00:02:36.650> D

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
so the drag is going to equal C sub D

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.080 
so the drag is going to equal C sub D
times<00:02:37.489> one<00:02:37.910> half<00:02:38.239> times<00:02:38.930> Rho<00:02:39.200> times<00:02:39.890> u<00:02:40.580> squared

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
times one half times Rho times u squared

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.530 
times one half times Rho times u squared
times<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:42.230> area<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.220> only<00:02:43.549> thing<00:02:44.209> that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
times the area so the only thing that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.460 
times the area so the only thing that
changes<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.250> our<00:02:46.790> C<00:02:47.090> sub<00:02:47.450> D<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.290> our

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
changes in this is our C sub D so our

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.069 
changes in this is our C sub D so our
drag<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.430> going<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.060> equal<00:02:50.380> instead<00:02:53.079> 0.05

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
drag is going to equal instead 0.05

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:00.220 
drag is going to equal instead 0.05
times<00:02:54.910> one<00:02:55.910> half<00:02:56.269> times<00:02:57.110> our<00:02:57.760> 238<00:02:58.760> times<00:02:59.480> 10<00:02:59.989> to

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
times one half times our 238 times 10 to

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.440 
times one half times our 238 times 10 to
the<00:03:00.260> minus<00:03:00.799> third<00:03:01.130> I'm<00:03:01.730> not<00:03:01.940> putting<00:03:02.299> the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
the minus third I'm not putting the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.720 
the minus third I'm not putting the
unit's<00:03:02.900> in<00:03:03.440> here<00:03:03.799> because<00:03:04.310> they're<00:03:04.579> exactly

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
unit's in here because they're exactly

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.559 
unit's in here because they're exactly
the<00:03:05.480> same<00:03:05.629> as<00:03:06.230> before<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:07.579> when<00:03:08.000> we<00:03:08.180> figure

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
the same as before and when we figure

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.699 
the same as before and when we figure
out<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.989> drag<00:03:09.319> what<00:03:10.220> we<00:03:10.400> come<00:03:10.670> out<00:03:10.700> with<00:03:11.239> is

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
out the drag what we come out with is

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.180 
out the drag what we come out with is
three<00:03:12.709> hundred<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:14.019> thirty<00:03:15.019> five<00:03:15.440> pound

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
three hundred and thirty five pound

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.650 
three hundred and thirty five pound
force<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.269> we<00:03:18.170> expect<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.890> drag<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.700> be<00:03:19.910> less

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
force and we expect the drag to be less

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.150 
force and we expect the drag to be less
than<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.650> lift

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
than the lift

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.940 
than the lift
so<00:03:22.430> how<00:03:22.639> do<00:03:22.700> we<00:03:22.819> get<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.239> power<00:03:23.569> from<00:03:23.989> that<00:03:24.230> so

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
so how do we get the power from that so

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.729 
so how do we get the power from that so
the<00:03:25.100> power<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.819> going<00:03:26.389> to<00:03:26.480> equal<00:03:26.690> our<00:03:27.170> three

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
the power is going to equal our three

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.490 
the power is going to equal our three
hundred<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.250> thirty<00:03:28.489> five<00:03:28.880> pound<00:03:29.630> force

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
hundred and thirty five pound force

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.240 
hundred and thirty five pound force
times<00:03:31.280> our<00:03:31.639> velocity<00:03:32.530> which<00:03:33.530> is<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.739> hundred

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
times our velocity which is a hundred

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.000 
times our velocity which is a hundred
and<00:03:34.370> fifty<00:03:34.819> feet<00:03:35.329> per<00:03:35.750> second<00:03:36.260> which<00:03:36.410> equals

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
and fifty feet per second which equals

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.750 
and fifty feet per second which equals
fifty<00:03:37.519> thousand<00:03:38.209> two<00:03:38.780> hundred<00:03:38.950> pound<00:03:39.950> force

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
fifty thousand two hundred pound force

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.530 
fifty thousand two hundred pound force
times<00:03:41.500> meter<00:03:42.500> per<00:03:43.069> second<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:43.730> if<00:03:44.060> we<00:03:44.209> want<00:03:44.450> to

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
times meter per second and if we want to

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.059 
times meter per second and if we want to
put<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:44.930> in<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.590> more<00:03:46.150> recognizable<00:03:47.680> form<00:03:48.680> all

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
put this in a more recognizable form all

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.270 
put this in a more recognizable form all
we<00:03:49.549> have<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:50.000> do<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.480> convert<00:03:51.109> it<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.349> watts<00:03:51.709> by

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
we have to do is convert it to watts by

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.059 
we have to do is convert it to watts by
taking<00:03:52.819> this<00:03:53.000> 50<00:03:53.510> thousand<00:03:54.410> two<00:03:55.040> hundred

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069
