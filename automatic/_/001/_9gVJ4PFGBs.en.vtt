00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.860
Let me show you hot to grow your own wedding
bouquet, or a bouquet for friends.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.240
There are a lot of reasons to grow beautiful
flowers in your garden.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.500
And one of the reasons that I like growing
Lilies is because I love to give them to friends

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.500
as gifts.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.130
Just look at this variety -- this pale butter
yellow is called Yelloween, like in Halloween,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.250
but Yelloween.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.250
And I just wish you could smell the aroma
-- that's the reason my friends love this.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.050
You show up at the front door with a bouquet
of these -- they just go crazy.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.230
Whenever I cut flowers from my garden, whether
I'm using them for my home or giving them

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.260
to someone, I like cut them early in the morning,
and I like to put them immediately into cold

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.260
water.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:53.470
And I always go for a mixture of lots of buds,
like this one, and some that are already open.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.120
And any of the flowers that are almost spent
-- and you can see, this is a good example

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.120
of one that's almost spent.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.450
You can see, it's looking kind of tired.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.239
I would avoid that flower.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.559
So these look really good and fresh.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.180
And I always try and cut the stems about the
same length.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.900
Yelloween is actually an Oriental Lilly hybrid.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.130
And what's fantastic about it is that it can
grow up to, well, 5 to 6 feet tall.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.360
And each of these bloom stalks can have up
to a dozen flowers on them.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.270
You see, these were actually developed for
the cut flower industry, but then somebody

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.670
discovered that these actually grow very well
outside of a greenhouse and in gardens.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.410
Believe me, these have done beautifully in
my garden.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.700
In this part of my cutting garden, we planted
these bulbs three years ago, and they just

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.310
keep coming back year after year with more
and more blooms.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.780
Now, one of the things that I've discovered
about these Lilies, and this goes for any

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.689
kind of Lily that I grow out here in my garden,
if I cut off the seed pods -- and let me show

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.229
you an example of a seed pod.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.140
You see, here, after they flower, the seed
pod forms.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.110
The seed pod is from here to here.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.860
What I like to do is go along and cut the
tops of these Lilies out, because I don't

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.250
really want these Lilies to put energy into
making seed pods -- they're not any good to

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.250
me.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.629
I want the energy go back in building up a
big bulb, so I'll have lots of blooms next

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.629
year.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.709
Now once I have this bouquet assembled, what
I'll do is I'll tie a big ribbon around it,

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.430
and I can deliver these to my friends without
any water as long as they're not out too long.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.790
And when I arrive, I'll ask my friends to
recut the stems and get them in water as soon

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.790
as possible.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.890
Also, if they're planning to use these Lilies
anywhere near fabrics, what we might do is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.400
clip out these stamens that have pollen on
them, because if this pollen gets onto fabric

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.650
it can stain it.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.709
That's why when these Lilies are used for
wedding bouquets, whether they're for the

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.239
brides or the bridesmaids, they always cut
the stems out.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.989
A beautiful addition to a wedding.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.049
