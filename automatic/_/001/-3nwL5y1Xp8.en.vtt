usually is in September so we've I think

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.300 
usually is in September so we've I think
we're<00:00:21.390> well<00:00:21.539> prepared<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:22.100> well<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.250> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
we're well prepared for well it's a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.740 
we're well prepared for well it's a
different<00:00:23.609> offensive<00:00:24.029> coordinator<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
different offensive coordinator it's a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.050

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
different quarterback they're using a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.750 
different quarterback they're using a
lot<00:00:27.119> more<00:00:27.500> their<00:00:28.500> offense<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.160> based<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
lot more their offense is based on the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.279 
lot more their offense is based on the
running<00:00:30.060> game<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.510> then<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> passing<00:00:31.140> game

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
running game and then the passing game
