00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.160
YESTERDAY'S DOWNPOUR MADE FOR

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.420
A CHALLENGING DRIVE ON ON THE

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.130
ROADWAYS.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.660
FOR THOSE ON INTERSTATE 80 NEAR

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.960
WHAT AVENUE, IT WAS NEARLY

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.430
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.970
FLOODING SHOT DOWN

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.600
THE FAMILY IN

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.940
BOTH DIRECTIONS DURING THE RUSH

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.640
HOUR COMMUTE.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.100
WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHAT

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.080
CAUSED THAT FLOODING.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.280
KRISTEN TALKED WITH CAL TRANS

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.750
TODAY.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.550
FLOODING ON

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.780
THE HIGHWAYS ARE

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.550
NOT UNCOMMON THIS TIME OF YEAR.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.950
THAT IS WHY CALTRANS HAS PUMPS

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.620
IN PLACE TO HELP KEEP ORDER OFF

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.660
THE ROADWAYS AND THE TRAFFIC

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.790
FLOWING SMOOTHLY.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.530
BUT THIS TIME US NOT, THE

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.730
INTERSTATE LOOK MORE LIKE A

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.530
LAKE.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.800
CAL TRANS ANSWERED OUR

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.270
QUESTIONS.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.240
THEY BACK UP WENT FOR WHAT

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.010
SEEMED LIKE MILES.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.380
THE COMMUTE LASTED HOURS,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.840
LEAVING MANY TO WONDER HOW DOES

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.280
THIS HAPPEN ON A MAJOR

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.080
SACRAMENTO FREEWAY.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.080
OFFICIALS SAY IT ALL STARTED

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.680
WITH A POWER OUTAGE.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.980
THIS HAPPENED A LITTLE BIT

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.220
BEFORE 4:00.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.450
WE HAD A TROUBLESHOOTER RESPOND

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.920
QUICKLY.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.730
WE WERE ABLE TO RESTORE

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.290
POWER.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.900
BUT THE DAMAGE WAS DONE.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.200
OUR FAILURE STOPPED THEY PUNT

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.970
THAT WOULD NORMALLY SIPHON WATER

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.170
FROM THE INTERSTATE RIGHT WHEN

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.370
THEY HEAVIEST RAIN WAS COMING

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.170
DOWN.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.770
WHEN YOU HAVE THIS MUCH

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.590
VOLUME OF RAIN AND WATER GOING

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.950
THROUGH, SOMETIMES IT OVERPOWERS

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.210
OUR CRUISE.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.420
CALTRANS DOES HAVE A BACKUP

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.050
PLAN.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.720
THEY USE GENERATORS TO KEEP THE

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.660
PUMPS WORKING.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.760
BUT THEY WERE ALREADY SHUT DOWN

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.930
-- BUT YOU ALREADY IN USE HERE

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.130
WHERE THERE WAS COPPER WIRE

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.600
THEFT.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.070
CALTRANS SAYS THEY

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.700
PREPARE FOR

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.110
STORMS LIKE THIS WHEN ALL YEAR.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.940
BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE WERE

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.170
SOME THINGS THEY JUST COULDN'T

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.880
PREDICT.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.760
WE HAVE DONE ADVANCED

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.780
CLEANING OF DREAMS.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.350
WE HAD OUR CRUISE OUT THERE

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.950
PRIOR TO THE RAINFALL BECAUSE WE

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.120
KNEW WHAT THE WEATHER SCHEDULE

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.590
WAS.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.830
'S NOD TELLS US -- SMUD

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.260
TOWS

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.960
US THAT YESTERDAY WAS THE

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.370
BUSIEST SINCE 2008.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.100
CALTRANS SAYS THEY WILL ASSESS

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.170
WHETHER OR NOT ANY UPGRADES ARE

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.170
NEEDED TO THEIR EQUIPMENT BUT IT

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.470
DOES LOOK WAY -- LOOK LIKE A

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.410
UNIQUE CASE.
