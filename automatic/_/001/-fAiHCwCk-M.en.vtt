00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.750
 It was all special 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.750
 I've seen 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.920
 is a review 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.140
 for the cards 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.140
 in 2008 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.390
 peter blake and that is the one that was auctioned 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.390
 well, recently 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.640
 and good 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.150
 in the description of each of the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.150
 characters 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.569
 Hello 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.920

 the short recording description of the 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.670
 same recording 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.780
 on day 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.740
 the month 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.740
 life 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.870
 of 67 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.280

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.280
 Print 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.569

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.640
 i 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.350
 I like that you put the end of the 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.620
 life the end of the end really the 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.620
 final 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.020
 well I'm disappointed because I 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.020
 I expected it to be heard 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.110
 very well on this album or at least the 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.110
 needle 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.990
 it does not reproduce 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:11.270
 Luis Comparato appears in the mural 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.270
 monkey of 2009 if it appears 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.000
 so let's see if someone helps us if 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.090
 can someone tell us if his disc 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.330
 has one of this final part what 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.330
 disappointment
