00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.970
 Hello everyone today in the budget review 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:17.050
 Phone from the company Beeline Beeline smart 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:22.679
 2 this phone is produced by the setter 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:27.999
 and was originally called ztv 811 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:32.680
 Let's start the review with a 4-inch appearance 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:35.800
 the display is below three buttons in which 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:43.470
 LED illuminated from behind the camera 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:47.710
 and corrugated cover inscription Beeline 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:52.210
 at the top is a power button 35 connector for 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.690
 headphone mini jack and bottom micro 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.690
 usb connector 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.420
 tft display 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.130
 bit unusual and enjoyed after 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.280
 fps screens because we see what 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:20.690
 viewing angles but over time you get used and 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.360
 you don't feel discomfort yet 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:32.569
 volume key located on the right 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:34.670
 butt of the phone it costs 490 rubles but 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.520
 teach it without excluding package 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.479
 which must be connected when 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.750
 buying a phone package is already worth it 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:50.000
 2160 rubles and with this package 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:52.280
 the amount of 2,650 leaves that also not to do 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.970
 the phone is less attractive because 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.069
 for such a price is hard to find 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:03.800
 Russified and phone with growth 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.340
 China of course can be ordered but it is already 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.340
 other story 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.260
 installed dual-core processor 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.989
 qualcomm 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.440
 512 RAM we give 302 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:24.010
 graphic core won tu that issues 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:30.860
 about 12 thousand and a half scaring them 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:33.250
 but where it has since December 1730 is in this 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.910
 enough to run almost everything 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.769
 modern 3d games asphalt 8 and gta 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.140
 the truth is not at maximum settings 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.140
 graphics naturally but at least so 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:55.239
 android set April 4, one of the most 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.239
 latest versions 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.730
 kitkat 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.190
 what can be distinguished from the minuses of this 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.310
 phone first of all absence 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.580
 Front camera anyway at times 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:24.510
 she needed also no flash 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:28.290
 and and usually used as a flashlight and 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.630
 really is not enough sometimes 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.670
 one more of the minuses is one dynamic 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.330
 total is not behind the speaker 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:43.000
 Ie he and colloquially and through him 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:46.980
 plays all sound files with this 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.980
 You can accept a low price 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.410
 1200 milliamp per hour battery 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.600
 lasting enough for a day but if 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:06.070
 use reasonable and remove from the cache 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:10.390
 running programs for quite a day 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.780
 may be enough the phone was delivered in 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.250
 such a miniature box here 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.250
 all its specifications are written 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:36.060
 there was such an adapter for 500 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.060
 focuses on 500 milliamps 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:48.660
 and here is a usb cable box of all kinds 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:56.100
 waste paper warranty card and usually 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:05:00.230
 nobody needs it think beeline smart 2 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.350
 will repeat the success of the first smart and will 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.620
 sell well take into account its low 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.620
 the cost 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.580
