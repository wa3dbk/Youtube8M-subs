00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.290
 Iceland 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.290

 next peak alive 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.620

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.750
 but by that pinch 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.360
 peter 3000 variator 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.360
 grabbing thread workers 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.910
 but hairstyles two loops again working thread 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.280
 albeit newbies range of trolley crashing 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 on the stove 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.700

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.580
 during vacation please ask 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.220

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.190
 complicate 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.930
 to not return 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.930

 such a step 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.199
 how beautiful is the edge 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:25.299
 I didnâ€™t even consider this play 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.689
 this is supposedly ovsepyan 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.729
 two air loops 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:30.879
 spend 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.010

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.729

 I want to be there today today 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.039
 what 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.799
 business aerial 5 3 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.199
 ESPCH if they 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.689
 air hinges and through the window 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.709
 can also be through two nato need to watch 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.039
 what it depends on the thickness of the thread 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.039
 that is, experiment 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.029
 how do you know you have learned 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.829
 and now experimenting 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.650
 then it gets more and more 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.189
 air 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.119
 dossier on the walls trick to watch 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.969
 already from which thread seems canvas 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.969
 what will be prettier 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.429
 and now we will become 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:52.839
 can not only 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.229
 bag thicker here so here is this thread 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.169
 Saratov she replenished 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.899
 and this is how these differences look
