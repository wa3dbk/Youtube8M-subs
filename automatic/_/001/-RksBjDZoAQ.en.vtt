00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.730
 here we are on the sherco booth the 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.000
 French manufacturer who presents us 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.750
 finally his motorcycle enduro time a motorcycle 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.190
 that we will discover in 2014 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.950
 so here is the brand new engine block 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.600
 sherco an engine that is made in france 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.580
 so you have to know that at charcot 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.630
 so far for enduro bikes 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.520
 produced said capturing and the time 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.230
 this year is the novelty then on 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.290
 the single-cylinder of time we can see 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.210
 that it is powered by a carburettor 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.120
 but sherco the injection is already in 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.220
 the pipes and we work actively 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.750
 on the time sherco engine which 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.360
 will be declined in two hundred fifty 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.860
 and a 300 years we find a management 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.300
 electronic valve exhaust 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.700
 that is, there will be no 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.469
 spring on the pulpit we find 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.100
 so a set of white suspension 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.870
 power at the front as well as at the back with 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.490
 the links 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.440
 and we can see that at the frame 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.560
 it's very much inspired by what we 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.660
 already found on the 4-stroke range with 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.150
 only a modification at the level of 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.770
 the bottom part of the frame so on 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.740
 the sherco we find the panoply 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.710
 complete of an enduro bike with a 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.550
 double ignition curve of the eggs and 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.570
 cut in the mass 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.360
 a translucent tank of protections 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.150
 at the frame level is as well as a hoof 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.180
 engine with for heating also a 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.960
 expansion tank and finally a magnificent 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.760
 quiet 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.470
 so this dear 2014 we the 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.869
 find again in the spring of 2013 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.400
 and you will also find it in 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.400
