00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:11.040 

you

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.050 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.760 

I<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:13.630> very<00:00:13.780> happy<00:00:13.930> with<00:00:14.170> my<00:00:14.230> forest<00:00:14.650> in

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
I was very happy with my forest in

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.320 
I was very happy with my forest in
Australia<00:00:15.160> come<00:00:15.340> on<00:00:15.460> maybe<00:00:16.030> it<00:00:16.150> could<00:00:16.240> have

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
Australia come on maybe it could have

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.970 
Australia come on maybe it could have
been<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:16.660> little<00:00:16.780> bit<00:00:16.960> faster<00:00:17.110> but<00:00:17.530> generally<00:00:17.890> I

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
been a little bit faster but generally I

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.190 
been a little bit faster but generally I
was<00:00:18.160> on<00:00:18.280> it<00:00:18.369> always<00:00:18.640> ends<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.180> in<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.020> race

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
was on it always ends and in the race

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.990 
was on it always ends and in the race
probably<00:00:20.740> more<00:00:20.950> on<00:00:21.100> it<00:00:21.250> than<00:00:21.279> I've<00:00:21.520> ever<00:00:21.700> been

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
probably more on it than I've ever been

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.280 
probably more on it than I've ever been
I<00:00:22.240> think<00:00:22.300> I<00:00:22.510> really<00:00:22.750> had<00:00:22.869> one<00:00:23.020> of<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.170> best

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
I think I really had one of the best

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:34.569 
I think I really had one of the best
races<00:00:23.680> today<00:00:24.040> so<00:00:24.580> I<00:00:24.910> was<00:00:25.180> quite<00:00:25.270> happy

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.639 

not<00:00:35.179> always<00:00:35.329> to<00:00:35.570> get<00:00:35.659> the<00:00:35.809> chance<00:00:36.079> to<00:00:36.320> do<00:00:36.499> it

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
not always to get the chance to do it

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.770 
not always to get the chance to do it
and<00:00:36.829> just<00:00:36.980> show<00:00:37.159> your<00:00:37.339> skill<00:00:37.640> like<00:00:38.269> that<00:00:38.480> for

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
and just show your skill like that for

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.599 
and just show your skill like that for
me<00:00:38.929> it<00:00:39.140> was<00:00:39.170> very<00:00:39.579> straightforward<00:00:40.579> very

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
me it was very straightforward very

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.090 
me it was very straightforward very
normal<00:00:41.390> overtaking<00:00:42.170> in<00:00:42.320> terms<00:00:42.559> of<00:00:42.710> what<00:00:42.979> I've

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
normal overtaking in terms of what I've

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.219 
normal overtaking in terms of what I've
experienced<00:00:43.609> in<00:00:43.699> my<00:00:43.789> racing<00:00:44.329> career<00:00:44.449> so<00:00:44.839> it

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229 
experienced in my racing career so it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.169 
experienced in my racing career so it
was<00:00:45.350> all<00:00:45.469> very<00:00:45.500> textbooks<00:00:46.250> for<00:00:46.429> me<00:00:46.579> but<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:47.149> be

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
was all very textbooks for me but to be

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.369 
was all very textbooks for me but to be
able<00:00:47.269> to<00:00:47.420> that<00:00:47.570> should<00:00:47.719> do<00:00:47.809> it<00:00:47.839> in<00:00:48.019> for<00:00:48.229> a<00:00:48.260> long

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
able to that should do it in for a long

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.110 
able to that should do it in for a long
way<00:00:48.530> it's<00:00:48.710> not<00:00:48.829> that<00:00:49.010> easy<00:00:49.129> to<00:00:49.280> overtake<00:00:49.699> was

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
way it's not that easy to overtake was

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.819 
way it's not that easy to overtake was
really<00:00:50.420> exciting<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.869> me<00:00:50.989> in<00:00:51.049> the<00:00:51.140> car<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.559> it

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
really exciting to me in the car and it

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.760 
really exciting to me in the car and it
it<00:00:52.609> just<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:52.939> strong

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.800 

I<00:00:59.860> think<00:01:00.580> it's<00:01:00.700> great<00:01:00.790> for<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.270> things<00:01:01.480> i<00:01:01.720> have

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
I think it's great for the things i have

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.740 
I think it's great for the things i have
the<00:01:01.930> podium<00:01:02.260> in<00:01:02.380> Bahrain<00:01:02.830> Jensen's<00:01:03.520> win<00:01:03.750> in

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
the podium in Bahrain Jensen's win in

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.570 
the podium in Bahrain Jensen's win in
Australia<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:05.350> think<00:01:05.620> it's<00:01:05.800> fantastic<00:01:05.920> the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
Australia I think it's fantastic the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.550 
Australia I think it's fantastic the
show<00:01:06.760> our<00:01:06.940> race<00:01:07.270> pace<00:01:07.480> do<00:01:07.780> do<00:01:07.840> we<00:01:07.990> can<00:01:08.200> is

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
show our race pace do do we can is

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.590 
show our race pace do do we can is
clearly<00:01:08.950> quite<00:01:09.310> good<00:01:09.670> but<00:01:10.030> we<00:01:10.180> still<00:01:10.210> need<00:01:10.570> to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
clearly quite good but we still need to

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.240 
clearly quite good but we still need to
improve<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:11.170> think<00:01:11.470> it's<00:01:11.680> just<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.950> big<00:01:12.100> positive

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
improve I think it's just a big positive

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.670 
improve I think it's just a big positive
and<00:01:12.670> that's<00:01:13.480> what<00:01:13.630> we<00:01:13.750> strive<00:01:14.020> for<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.470> when

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
and that's what we strive for it when

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.250 
and that's what we strive for it when
the<00:01:15.280> scene<00:01:15.490> working<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.030> hard<00:01:16.240> with<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:16.960> its

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
the scene working so hard with and its

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.390 
the scene working so hard with and its
really<00:01:17.410> good<00:01:17.620> to<00:01:17.650> be<00:01:17.800> able<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.979> pay<00:01:18.100> them<00:01:18.250> back

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
really good to be able to pay them back

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:27.469 
really good to be able to pay them back
with<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.910> kind<00:01:19.150> of<00:01:19.210> success

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.880 

he<00:01:28.479> travels<00:01:28.930> as<00:01:29.110> old<00:01:29.290> as<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.409> can<00:01:29.650> from

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
he travels as old as you can from

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.190 
he travels as old as you can from
Australia<00:01:30.610> get<00:01:30.939> into<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.330> heat<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:31.750> into<00:01:32.080> the

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
Australia get into the heat and into the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.929 
Australia get into the heat and into the
time<00:01:32.409> zone<00:01:32.650> as<00:01:32.680> quick<00:01:33.100> as<00:01:33.189> possible<00:01:33.220> at<00:01:33.790> least

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
time zone as quick as possible at least

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.820 
time zone as quick as possible at least
that's<00:01:34.150> how<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.299> do<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:35.110> have<00:01:35.259> two<00:01:35.440> days<00:01:35.560> to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
that's how I do you have two days to

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.530 
that's how I do you have two days to
relax<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.430> then<00:01:36.520> then<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:36.940> do<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.119> little<00:01:37.420> bit

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
relax and then then you do a little bit

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.060 
relax and then then you do a little bit
of<00:01:37.600> working<00:01:38.049> out<00:01:38.140> on<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.409> Wednesday<00:01:38.799> and<00:01:38.979> then

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
of working out on the Wednesday and then

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.920 
of working out on the Wednesday and then
you're<00:01:39.220> there<00:01:39.400> straight<00:01:40.000> into<00:01:40.030> work<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.690> the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
you're there straight into work on the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.929 
you're there straight into work on the
Thursday<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:42.100> actually<00:01:42.340> works<00:01:42.700> quite<00:01:42.880> well

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
Thursday so it actually works quite well

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:50.490 
Thursday so it actually works quite well
because<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.390> roll<00:01:43.600> straight<00:01:43.930> into<00:01:44.259> it

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.910 

I<00:01:50.590> like<00:01:51.580> it<00:01:51.760> start<00:01:52.240> coming<00:01:52.600> here<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.870> 2007<00:01:53.590> had

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
I like it start coming here in 2007 had

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.250 
I like it start coming here in 2007 had
good<00:01:54.310> result<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.820> 2008<00:01:55.510> was<00:01:55.840> again<00:01:56.080> quite

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
good result in 2008 was again quite

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.380 
good result in 2008 was again quite
competitive<00:01:56.560> but<00:01:57.040> not<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.670> best<00:01:57.790> result<00:01:58.210> and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
competitive but not the best result and

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.530 
competitive but not the best result and
then<00:01:58.750> 2009<00:01:59.620> not<00:01:59.890> an<00:02:00.010> easy<00:02:00.130> race<00:02:00.430> for<00:02:00.760> sure<00:02:00.940> with

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
then 2009 not an easy race for sure with

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.240 
then 2009 not an easy race for sure with
the<00:02:01.630> weather<00:02:01.780> but<00:02:02.320> generally<00:02:02.860> get<00:02:03.010> on<00:02:03.100> really

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
the weather but generally get on really

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.230 
the weather but generally get on really
well<00:02:03.340> here<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.670> it's<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.820> very<00:02:03.850> high<00:02:04.180> speed

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
well here and it's a very high speed

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.480 
well here and it's a very high speed
circuit<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.290> need<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.470> very<00:02:05.740> stable<00:02:05.950> rear<00:02:06.280> end

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
circuit you need a very stable rear end
