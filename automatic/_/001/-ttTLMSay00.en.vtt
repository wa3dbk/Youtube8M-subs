mesh<00:02:18.569> from<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> car<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.230> guess<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.530> gonna

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
mesh from a car but I guess I just gonna

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:33.980 
mesh from a car but I guess I just gonna
have<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.890> do<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:21.560> Hey

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.450 

she's<00:02:34.990> like<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.290> just<00:02:35.320> think<00:02:35.920> he'd<00:02:36.100> mean<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.430> a

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
she's like I just think he'd mean to a

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.140 
she's like I just think he'd mean to a
deathmatch<00:02:36.730> as<00:02:37.120> well<00:02:37.330> get<00:02:37.960> out<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.970> is

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
deathmatch as well get out this is

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.020 
deathmatch as well get out this is
probably<00:02:40.450> like<00:02:40.510> his<00:02:40.870> own<00:02:41.080> vehicle<00:02:41.730> or<00:02:42.730> if<00:02:42.940> I

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
probably like his own vehicle or if I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.740 
probably like his own vehicle or if I
can<00:02:43.180> like<00:02:43.570> Nick<00:02:43.960> it

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.890 

so<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.010> nap<00:02:48.640> kit<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:49.450> too<00:02:49.660> hot<00:02:49.870> to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
so this is a nap kit it's too hot to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.120 
so this is a nap kit it's too hot to
modify<00:02:50.350> okay<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.680> see

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
modify okay I see

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.650 
modify okay I see
so<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.610> one's<00:02:51.850> been<00:02:52.030> modified<00:02:52.450> it's

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
so this one's been modified it's

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.530 
so this one's been modified it's
obviously<00:02:52.960> Kenzi<00:02:53.410> for<00:02:53.710> them<00:02:54.240> it's<00:02:55.240> already

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
obviously Kenzi for them it's already

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.900 
obviously Kenzi for them it's already
been<00:02:55.660> modified<00:02:56.140> or<00:02:56.620> something<00:02:57.460> like<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.610> or

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
been modified or something like that or

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.160 
been modified or something like that or
it<00:02:58.090> might<00:02:58.210> be<00:02:58.270> too<00:02:58.390> expensive<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.840> modify<00:03:01.170> so

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
it might be too expensive to modify so

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.540 
it might be too expensive to modify so
I'll<00:03:02.230> take<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.710> a<00:03:02.770> write<00:03:02.950> anyway<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.280> know

well<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.660> guess<00:03:28.780> first<00:03:29.200> thing<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.470> can<00:03:29.590> do<00:03:29.709> is

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
well I guess first thing you can do is

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.390 
well I guess first thing you can do is
go<00:03:30.040> collect<00:03:30.370> my<00:03:30.490> car<00:03:30.850> from<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.240> lockup<00:03:31.720> and

go collect my car from the lockup and

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.610 
go collect my car from the lockup and
I'm<00:03:33.400> probably<00:03:33.520> not<00:03:33.730> going<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:33.940> pay<00:03:34.120> for<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.510> so

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
I'm probably not going to pay for it so

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.949 
I'm probably not going to pay for it so
it's<00:03:35.620> good<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:35.920> see<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.160> back
