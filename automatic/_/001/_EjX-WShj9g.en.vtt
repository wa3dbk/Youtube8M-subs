00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
cement right that was one of the last

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.550 
cement right that was one of the last
things<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.270> cut<00:04:34.450> anything<00:04:34.660> yeah<00:04:35.020> because<00:04:35.410> you

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
things to cut anything yeah because you

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.590 
things to cut anything yeah because you
can<00:04:35.740> see<00:04:35.980> there<00:04:36.669> is<00:04:36.760> a<00:04:36.790> shot<00:04:37.090> where<00:04:37.270> he<00:04:37.330> flies

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
think in the script he got blinded by

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.830 
think in the script he got blinded by
the<00:04:43.680> silent<00:04:44.680> lights<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.340> lands<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.180> his<00:04:46.300> feet

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840
