00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
rather quickly and it ended up being

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.410 
rather quickly and it ended up being
about<00:01:10.860> two<00:01:11.220> seconds<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> whole<00:01:11.939> film<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
about two seconds of the whole film and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.090 
about two seconds of the whole film and
we<00:01:12.540> spent<00:01:12.810> half<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.170> day<00:01:13.200> doing<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.770> part<00:01:14.010> of

we spent half a day doing that part of
the<00:01:14.159> film<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.090> pretty<00:01:15.270> interesting<00:01:15.720> how

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
