00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
still gonna use that palm muting

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.320 
still gonna use that palm muting
technique<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.669> what<00:00:20.669> we're<00:00:20.789> gonna<00:00:20.849> do<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.119> all

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.249 
technique and what we're gonna do is all
these<00:00:21.509> patterns<00:00:21.720> I'm<00:00:21.929> going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> show<00:00:22.199> you

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
these patterns I'm going to show you

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.320 
these patterns I'm going to show you
we're<00:00:22.439> still<00:00:22.679> going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.859> use<00:00:22.919> that<00:00:23.160> E<00:00:23.400> power

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
we're still going to use that E power

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.460 
we're still going to use that E power
chord<00:00:24.839> again<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.769> six<00:00:26.009> string<00:00:26.220> open<00:00:27.470> 5th

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
chord again the six string open 5th

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.050 
chord again the six string open 5th
string<00:00:28.560> 2nd<00:00:29.160> fret<00:00:30.169> 4th<00:00:31.169> string<00:00:31.230> 2nd<00:00:31.740> fret<00:00:32.060> so

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
string 2nd fret 4th string 2nd fret so

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.610 
string 2nd fret 4th string 2nd fret so
pretty<00:00:33.300> much<00:00:33.420> most<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.900> those<00:00:34.020> who<00:00:34.170> are<00:00:34.290> using

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
pretty much most of those who are using

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.280 
pretty much most of those who are using
all<00:00:34.920> those<00:00:35.250> 3<00:00:35.579> strings<00:00:35.940> sometimes<00:00:36.720> you'll<00:00:37.110> see

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
all those 3 strings sometimes you'll see

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.280 
all those 3 strings sometimes you'll see
me<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.440> hover<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.580> string<00:00:39.170> or<00:00:40.170> just

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
me just hover on the one string or just

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.630 
me just hover on the one string or just
give<00:00:40.380> me<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.620> well<00:00:40.740> on<00:00:40.830> the<00:00:40.890> sixth<00:00:41.190> string

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.560 

but<00:00:44.640> again<00:00:44.820> I'll<00:00:44.910> kind<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.180> tell<00:00:45.330> you<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.450> if

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
but again I'll kind of tell you this if

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
but again I'll kind of tell you this if
you<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.900> but<00:00:46.140> basically<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.830> if<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.190> were

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
you do that but basically that if I were

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.170 
you do that but basically that if I were
playing<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.760> chord

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
playing a chord

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.960 
playing a chord
it's<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.810> e<00:00:49.050> power<00:00:49.680> chord<00:00:49.860> now<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.790> first

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
it's that e power chord now that first

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.860 
it's that e power chord now that first
we're<00:00:51.150> gonna<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.540> just<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> very<00:00:51.960> simple<00:00:52.230> one

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
we're gonna do is just a very simple one

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.280 
we're gonna do is just a very simple one
it's<00:00:54.870> gonna<00:00:54.960> sound<00:00:55.200> like<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:59.750> just<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.870> basic

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
it's gonna sound like this just a basic

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.700 
it's gonna sound like this just a basic
good<00:01:01.470> old<00:01:01.820> strong<00:01:02.820> sound<00:01:03.330> in<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> kind<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
good old strong sound in a kind of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.980 
good old strong sound in a kind of
strumming<00:01:05.040> pattern<00:01:05.519> we're<00:01:06.299> doing<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:06.780> eight

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
strumming pattern we're doing all eight

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.499 
strumming pattern we're doing all eight
notes<00:01:07.320> we're<00:01:08.159> doing<00:01:08.430> 1<00:01:09.299> &amp;<00:01:09.600> 2<00:01:09.899> &amp;<00:01:10.170> 3<00:01:10.380> &amp;<00:01:10.710> 4<00:01:11.009> and

notes we're doing 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 and
basically<00:01:12.509> 8<00:01:12.810> down<00:01:13.229> strokes<00:01:13.710> again<00:01:14.369> by<00:01:14.549> still

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
basically 8 down strokes again by still

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.760 
basically 8 down strokes again by still
doing<00:01:15.149> that<00:01:15.240> palm<00:01:15.570> mute<00:01:15.840> makes<00:01:16.469> it<00:01:16.590> sound

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
doing that palm mute makes it sound

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.880 
doing that palm mute makes it sound
really<00:01:16.920> strong<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.119> thick

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.920 

what<00:01:24.890> kind<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.160> notice<00:01:25.370> -<00:01:25.820> normally<00:01:26.720> when<00:01:26.780> we

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
what kind of notice - normally when we

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.420 
what kind of notice - normally when we
strum<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.380> kind<00:01:27.530> of<00:01:27.590> move<00:01:27.740> our<00:01:27.890> arm<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.310> little

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
strum and kind of move our arm a little

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.460 
strum and kind of move our arm a little
more<00:01:28.760> in<00:01:28.970> this<00:01:29.330> case<00:01:29.570> we're<00:01:29.810> moving<00:01:30.080> more<00:01:30.290> of

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
more in this case we're moving more of

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.680 
more in this case we're moving more of
our<00:01:30.650> kind<00:01:31.340> of<00:01:31.490> wrists<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.060> our<00:01:32.180> fingers<00:01:32.450> a

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
our kind of wrists and our fingers a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.290 
our kind of wrists and our fingers a
little<00:01:32.990> bit<00:01:33.140> so<00:01:33.440> we<00:01:33.560> can<00:01:33.680> keep<00:01:33.860> that<00:01:33.920> hand<00:01:34.400> that

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
little bit so we can keep that hand that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.930 
little bit so we can keep that hand that
karate-chop<00:01:36.020> glued<00:01:36.740> right<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:37.430> our<00:01:37.580> strings

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
karate-chop glued right to our strings

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.580 
karate-chop glued right to our strings
there<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:38.630> that's<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.930> first<00:01:39.140> pattern<00:01:39.380> all

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
there so that's the first pattern all

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.630 
there so that's the first pattern all
downstrokes

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.469 

now<00:01:43.640> again<00:01:43.820> when<00:01:43.910> you're<00:01:44.030> playing<00:01:44.240> this<00:01:44.360> you

now again when you're playing this you

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.420 
now again when you're playing this you
want<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.660> play<00:01:44.780> nice<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.020> clean<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.800> know<00:01:46.370> you

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
want to play nice and clean you know you

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.820 
want to play nice and clean you know you
can<00:01:46.640> speed<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:46.910> up

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.830 

again<00:01:51.830> take<00:01:52.460> your<00:01:52.490> time<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.090> work<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.450> slow

then<00:01:54.260> add<00:01:54.500> some<00:01:55.030> faster<00:01:56.030> changes<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.660> two

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
then add some faster changes in the two

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.249 
then add some faster changes in the two
now<00:01:57.470> this<00:01:57.590> next<00:01:57.830> one<00:01:58.600> what<00:01:59.600> we're<00:01:59.720> gonna<00:01:59.810> do<00:02:00.050> is

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
now this next one what we're gonna do is

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.200 
now this next one what we're gonna do is
we're<00:02:00.440> gonna<00:02:00.530> add<00:02:01.180> again<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.360> non<00:02:02.690> power<00:02:03.350> chord

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
we're gonna add again a non power chord

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.249 
we're gonna add again a non power chord
kind<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.270> note<00:02:05.450> in<00:02:05.600> there<00:02:05.750> where<00:02:05.900> we'll<00:02:06.080> just

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
kind of note in there where we'll just

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.010 
kind of note in there where we'll just
play<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.530> strings<00:02:07.330> with<00:02:08.330> no<00:02:08.540> Mew

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020

way again use your ear and just try to

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.110 
way again use your ear and just try to
match<00:04:21.650> what<00:04:22.010> I'm<00:04:22.130> doing<00:04:22.520> as<00:04:22.669> opposed<00:04:23.030> to

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
match what I'm doing as opposed to

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.120 
match what I'm doing as opposed to
thinking<00:04:23.600> of<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.810> as<00:04:23.900> much<00:04:24.139> because<00:04:24.290> when<00:04:25.010> you

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
thinking of it as much because when you

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.610 
thinking of it as much because when you
get<00:04:25.310> some<00:04:25.520> faster<00:04:26.090> speeds<00:04:26.479> some<00:04:27.350> of<00:04:27.410> these<00:04:27.500> are

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
get some faster speeds some of these are

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.830 
get some faster speeds some of these are
almost<00:04:27.800> impossible<00:04:27.949> to<00:04:28.490> count<00:04:28.760> but<00:04:29.210> try<00:04:29.810> it

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
almost impossible to count but try it

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.480 
almost impossible to count but try it
again<00:04:29.960> I'll<00:04:30.169> do<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.350> slow<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.280> little

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
again I'll do it slow and a little

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.710 
again I'll do it slow and a little
faster

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:57.550 

and<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.780> little<00:04:43.990> faster

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.350 

it's<00:04:58.560> a<00:04:58.620> Hasson<00:04:59.010> phone<00:04:59.220> with<00:04:59.400> it<00:04:59.760> work<00:05:00.030> on<00:05:00.210> that

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
it's a Hasson phone with it work on that

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.810 
it's a Hasson phone with it work on that
rhythm<00:05:00.600> work<00:05:01.290> on<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.620> pon<00:05:01.920> you<00:05:02.160> again<00:05:02.520> work

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
rhythm work on that pon you again work

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.790 
rhythm work on that pon you again work
slow<00:05:03.240> then<00:05:03.630> build<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:03.990> speed<00:05:04.230> up<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.620> have
