00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
back to another destiny video in today's

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.650 
back to another destiny video in today's
video<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.070> want<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.340> talk<00:00:17.430> about<00:00:17.640> shaders<00:00:18.300> but

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
video I want to talk about shaders but

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.750 
video I want to talk about shaders but
not<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.350> way<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.710> think<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:20.520> time

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
not in the way that you think this time

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.550 
not in the way that you think this time
I'm<00:00:20.939> not<00:00:21.150> talking<00:00:21.449> about<00:00:21.480> armagh<00:00:21.930> shaders<00:00:22.230> but

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
I'm not talking about armagh shaders but

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.890 
I'm not talking about armagh shaders but
instead<00:00:22.859> ship<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.519> vehicle<00:00:24.210> shaders<00:00:24.539> yes

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
instead ship and vehicle shaders yes

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.259 
instead ship and vehicle shaders yes
that's<00:00:25.080> right<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.740> heard<00:00:25.769> me<00:00:26.010> correctly

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
that's right you heard me correctly

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.460 
that's right you heard me correctly
shame<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.449> will<00:00:27.720> change<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> color<00:00:28.320> of

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
shame is that will change the color of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.439 
shame is that will change the color of
your<00:00:28.769> ever<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.189> useful<00:00:29.340> ship<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.910> your<00:00:30.179> fancy

below so vehicle and ship shaders what
does<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.059> mean<00:00:51.420> well<00:00:52.320> there<00:00:52.770> are<00:00:52.800> two<00:00:52.920> items

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
does this mean well there are two items

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.709 
does this mean well there are two items
that<00:00:53.579> while<00:00:54.000> they<00:00:54.090> don't<00:00:54.239> currently<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.629> a

made my ship will be completely red

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.109 
made my ship will be completely red
alternatively<00:01:13.710> there<00:01:14.130> may<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.760> separate

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
shaders for such an occasion but i'm

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.219 
shaders for such an occasion but i'm
down<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.040> either<00:01:17.450> then<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.689> addition<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.110> this

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
down for either then in addition to this

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.170 
down for either then in addition to this
there's<00:01:19.590> also<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> vehicle<00:01:20.580> shader<00:01:20.790> template

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
there's also a vehicle shader template

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.600 
there's also a vehicle shader template
which<00:01:21.540> reads<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.080> layer<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.500> translation<00:01:23.400> code

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
which reads a layer of translation code

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.280 
which reads a layer of translation code
that<00:01:23.790> allows<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.240> shader<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.840> interface<00:01:25.259> with

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
that allows a shader to interface with

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.320 
that allows a shader to interface with
vehicle<00:01:25.860> coatings<00:01:26.220> again<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> same

vehicle coatings again the same

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.030 
vehicle coatings again the same

principle applies whether this will be

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.319 
principle applies whether this will be
something<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.369> will<00:01:29.520> mirror<00:01:29.820> your<00:01:29.970> guardian

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
something that will mirror your guardian

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.039 
imagine they'll be separate people want
choice<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.210> force<00:01:36.420> them<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.600> match<00:01:36.840> their

guardian<00:01:37.350> shader<00:01:37.560> kind<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.100> goes<00:01:38.189> against

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
guardian shader kind of goes against

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.030 
guardian shader kind of goes against
that<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.530> about<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.770> this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that so what do you think about all this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
that so what do you think about all this
personally<00:01:41.909> I'm<00:01:42.090> not<00:01:42.119> too<00:01:42.420> fussed<00:01:42.689> about<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
personally I'm not too fussed about the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.510 
personally I'm not too fussed about the

huge fan of personalization and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.319 
huge fan of personalization and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
something that allows you to pick and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.660 
something that allows you to pick and
choose<00:02:21.680> which<00:02:21.920> colors<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.459> shader

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.789 
choose which colors of the shader
effects<00:02:23.060> which<00:02:23.299> part<00:02:23.629> of<00:02:23.810> your<00:02:23.870> armor<00:02:24.319> either

way<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.310> remains<00:02:25.609> to<00:02:25.760> be<00:02:25.790> seen<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.329> kind<00:02:26.840> of

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
way that remains to be seen I kind of

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.420 
way that remains to be seen I kind of
like<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.170> idea<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.439> combining<00:02:27.650> two<00:02:28.069> shaders

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
like the idea of combining two shaders

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.160 
like the idea of combining two shaders
kinda<00:02:28.909> like<00:02:28.969> how<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.299> guild<00:02:29.540> wars<00:02:29.629> 2<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.109> can

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
kinda like how in guild wars 2 you can

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.839 
kinda like how in guild wars 2 you can
combine<00:02:30.439> dies<00:02:30.799> to<00:02:31.040> make<00:02:31.189> cool<00:02:31.400> new<00:02:31.549> colors

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
combine dies to make cool new colors

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.729 
combine dies to make cool new colors
that<00:02:32.540> way<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.780> can<00:02:33.019> have<00:02:33.140> some<00:02:33.290> pretty<00:02:33.590> unique

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
that way you can have some pretty unique

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.369 
that way you can have some pretty unique
color<00:02:34.280> combos<00:02:34.640> either<00:02:35.359> way<00:02:35.599> not<00:02:36.200> much<00:02:36.349> is

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
color combos either way not much is

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.839 
color combos either way not much is
known<00:02:36.620> about<00:02:36.680> any<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.129> these<00:02:37.220> right<00:02:37.430> now<00:02:37.549> but

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
known about any of these right now but

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.670 
known about any of these right now but
speculation<00:02:38.450> dictates<00:02:38.989> that<00:02:39.200> will<00:02:39.409> likely

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
speculation dictates that will likely

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.979 
speculation dictates that will likely
see<00:02:40.010> these<00:02:40.189> in<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.519> upcoming<00:02:40.639> dark<00:02:41.209> below<00:02:41.389> DLC

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.839 
dlc so now you're loading screen can
look<00:02:50.750> different<00:02:51.139> all<00:02:51.290> over<00:02:51.560> again<00:02:51.859> all<00:02:52.609> jokes

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.670 
look different all over again all jokes
aside<00:02:52.939> some<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.599> these<00:02:53.659> do<00:02:53.870> look<00:02:53.900> pretty<00:02:54.290> cool

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
aside some of these do look pretty cool

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.199 
aside some of these do look pretty cool
one<00:02:55.069> of<00:02:55.159> them<00:02:55.280> has<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.579> same<00:02:55.760> shape<00:02:56.000> as<00:02:56.150> the

the beta but I haven't seen this in the

the beta but I haven't seen this in the
full<00:02:59.689> game<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.200> that's<00:03:00.379> familiar<00:03:00.530> but<00:03:01.129> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
full game so that's familiar but the

other two are definitely knew I really

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.599 
other two are definitely knew I really

spring to mind is that if they can

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.409 
spring to mind is that if they can
extend<00:03:24.379> these<00:03:24.500> two<00:03:24.680> ships<00:03:24.949> and<00:03:25.159> speeders<00:03:25.940> or
