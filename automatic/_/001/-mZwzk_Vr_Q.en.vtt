put some Tara Stiles on the felt which

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.200 
put some Tara Stiles on the felt which
will<00:01:08.549> stick<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> throw<00:01:09.930> itself<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.210> we're

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
will stick to the throw itself and we're

going to put fill trips around the edges

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.249 
going to put fill trips around the edges
to<00:01:14.100> make<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.280> look<00:01:14.460> finished<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.049> thicker

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
to make it look finished it's a thicker

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
to make it look finished it's a thicker
felt<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.770> 4<00:01:17.009> mil<00:01:17.189> felt<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.700> sticks<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.210> the

felt a 4 mil felt that sticks in the
corners<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.920> stops<00:01:19.920> obviously<00:01:20.240> splits

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
corners and stops obviously splits

happening<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> felt<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:23.460> finishes<00:01:23.729> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
happening in the felt and it finishes it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.200 
happening in the felt and it finishes it
off<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.450> looks<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.840> nice<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.560> pretty

off and it looks really nice and pretty
when<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> put<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> felt<00:01:27.750> closer<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
when you put the felt closer to the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.809 
when you put the felt closer to the
walls<00:01:29.030> again<00:01:30.079> roughly<00:01:31.079> six<00:01:31.439> inches<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
walls again roughly six inches up to of

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.039 
walls again roughly six inches up to of
course<00:01:32.999> of<00:01:33.119> bricks<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.569> is<00:01:33.659> object<00:01:33.780> aided

by<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> previous<00:01:34.590> felt<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.009> know<00:01:35.100> how<00:01:35.249> I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
by the previous felt but we know how I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.690 
by the previous felt but we know how I
try<00:01:35.670> because<00:01:35.939> our<00:01:36.119> existing<00:01:36.960> felt<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.289> there

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
try because our existing felt is there

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.230 
try because our existing felt is there
with<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> baton<00:01:39.140> pull<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.259> down<00:01:40.999> scrape<00:01:41.999> out

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
with a baton pull it down scrape out

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.870 
with a baton pull it down scrape out
keep<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.840> tops<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.259> keep<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> white<00:01:43.710> band<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
keep on tops and keep the white band so

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:55.500 
keep on tops and keep the white band so
we're<00:01:45.030> able<00:01:45.179> to<00:01:46.460> burn<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> film

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.649 

with<00:01:56.510> this<00:01:56.659> felt<00:01:56.930> we<00:01:57.110> don't<00:01:57.320> need<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.650> heat<00:01:58.659> as

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
with this felt we don't need to heat as

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.290 
with this felt we don't need to heat as
much<00:02:00.140> as<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.470> previous<00:02:00.740> felt<00:02:01.190> because<00:02:02.150> of

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
much as the previous felt because of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.930 
much as the previous felt because of
thicker<00:02:02.630> belt<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.740> bitching<00:02:04.100> at<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.640> back<00:02:04.820> of

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
thicker belt the bitching at the back of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.040 
thicker belt the bitching at the back of
the<00:02:05.030> felt<00:02:05.240> becomes<00:02:05.690> very<00:02:06.680> very<00:02:07.040> wet<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.460> hot

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
the felt becomes very very wet and hot

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.870 
the felt becomes very very wet and hot
so<00:02:09.050> it<00:02:09.110> makes<00:02:09.320> it<00:02:09.470> stick<00:02:09.800> here<00:02:10.009> makes<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.729> more

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
so it makes it stick here makes it more

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.340 
so it makes it stick here makes it more
sticky<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.930> speak<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.410> wall<00:02:17.110> again<00:02:18.110> push

the baton and the scraper to just eat

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:43.660 
the baton and the scraper to just eat
that<00:02:31.730> other<00:02:32.420> side<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.020> felt<00:02:42.400> just<00:02:43.400> push<00:02:43.550> it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
that other side of the felt just push it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.870 
that other side of the felt just push it
out<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.880> your<00:02:43.970> hand

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
out of your hand

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.670 
out of your hand
and<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.120> would<00:02:47.300> stick<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.050> existing<00:02:48.440> felt

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
and it would stick to the existing felt

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.250 
and it would stick to the existing felt
push<00:02:51.680> at<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.890> front<00:02:52.660> make<00:02:53.660> sure<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:53.959> step

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
push at the front make sure it's step

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.170 
push at the front make sure it's step
right<00:02:54.590> down<00:02:54.650> without<00:02:55.459> any<00:02:55.730> water<00:02:55.910> getting

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
right down without any water getting

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.449 
right down without any water getting
underneath<00:02:56.420> half<00:02:56.690> help

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.399 

and<00:03:01.819> as<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.120> proportion<00:03:02.689> I'll<00:03:02.780> just<00:03:02.989> give<00:03:03.290> it

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
and as a proportion I'll just give it

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.830 
and as a proportion I'll just give it
the<00:03:03.439> all<00:03:03.590> heat<00:03:07.269> maybe<00:03:08.269> just<00:03:08.540> calm<00:03:08.689> it<00:03:08.810> down

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the all heat maybe just calm it down

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.449 
the all heat maybe just calm it down
again<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.560> make<00:03:09.709> sure<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:10.069> entirely

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
again just to make sure is entirely

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.270 
again just to make sure is entirely
stuck<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.840> that's<00:03:15.019> how<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.290> install<00:03:15.409> a<00:03:15.920> felt
