is pretty good really high pitch and
this<00:01:14.060> one<00:01:14.240> way<00:01:14.450> is<00:01:14.749> let's<00:01:15.079> see<00:01:16.209> 0.1<00:01:17.209> ounces<00:01:17.599> and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.100 
and if we're wearing it around my neck
and<00:03:00.580> on<00:03:00.700> my<00:03:00.790> shirt<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.330> don't<00:03:01.540> have<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.930> worry

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
and on my shirt I don't have to worry

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.140 
and on my shirt I don't have to worry
about<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.470> touching<00:03:02.830> my<00:03:03.010> skin<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:03.730> making<00:03:04.030> me

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
about it touching my skin and making me

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.720 
about it touching my skin and making me
cold<00:03:04.360> however<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.320> do<00:03:05.440> like<00:03:06.220> this<00:03:06.459> one<00:03:06.760> with<00:03:07.150> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
cold however I do like this one with the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.680 
cold however I do like this one with the
waterproof<00:03:09.730> capsule<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.269> think<00:03:10.480> that's<00:03:10.630> a

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
waterproof capsule I think that's a

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.740 
waterproof capsule I think that's a
pretty<00:03:10.810> cool<00:03:11.019> idea<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.430> also<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.450> was<00:03:13.600> one

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
pretty cool idea and so also it was one

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.870 
pretty cool idea and so also it was one
of<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.930> loudest<00:03:14.049> of<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.650> four<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.100> tried

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
of the loudest of the four that I tried

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.360 
of the loudest of the four that I tried
out<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.360> if<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.260> had<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.440> choose<00:03:17.680> it'd<00:03:17.980> be<00:03:18.130> one<00:03:18.280> of

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
out so if I had to choose it'd be one of

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.770 
out so if I had to choose it'd be one of
these<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:18.790> think<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.090> could<00:03:19.239> hang<00:03:19.420> this<00:03:19.570> one

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
these and I think I could hang this one

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.360 
these and I think I could hang this one
wrong<00:03:20.049> my<00:03:20.170> neck<00:03:20.470> maybe<00:03:20.709> just<00:03:20.950> keep<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.190> on<00:03:21.280> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
wrong my neck maybe just keep it on the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.250 
wrong my neck maybe just keep it on the
up<00:03:21.489> side<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:22.360> my<00:03:22.510> shirt<00:03:22.720> was<00:03:22.840> touching<00:03:23.170> it

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
up side so my shirt was touching it

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.509 
up side so my shirt was touching it
