 I have a bad result from summer for jester from summer 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.500
 It feels like it's a pretty difficult partner by the way 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.000
 Especially as a player 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:12.080

 I think you are really good at that person, Yutapon you belong to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:07.920
 After all, even if it is not one to one, it is an English game so one person is very good at it 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.280
 I can not win by myself, but after all that five people's power is put together and say that I will beat the opponent 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.149
 However 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.149
 It is attractive 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:22.340

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.300

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.540

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:11.710
 If there was already another time to practice, it would be fun with so many movements 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:14.650
 I tried to belong to 4 dn when I was watching delivery of x-ray players by chance 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.880
 25 of legends dad playing 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.130
 Seeing that I had a game like this 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.130

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.610

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.439
 After all, Korea is said to be the strongest in the world 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.699
