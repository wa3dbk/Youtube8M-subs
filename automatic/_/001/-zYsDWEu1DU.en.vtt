00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.769 

we'll<00:00:29.310> look<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> front<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.330> see<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
we'll look at the front you can see it

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:42.069 
we'll look at the front you can see it
right<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.369> its<00:00:32.700> title<00:00:34.160> symbol<00:00:39.890> and

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
right up here as its title symbol and

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.619 
right up here as its title symbol and
wait<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.350> did<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.460> realize<00:00:44.940> there's<00:00:45.180> my<00:00:45.329> first

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
wait I did not realize there's my first
