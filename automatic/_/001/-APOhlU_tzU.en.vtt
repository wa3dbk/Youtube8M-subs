00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.450
 and videos to all a new video in this 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.490
 occasion is a bit special because 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.530
 you know that all my videos are usually 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.800
 exclusively from books but this time 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.640
 decided to do a little more general about 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.800
 me and it's to tell you a few 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.390
 things about me are not exactly 50 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.510
 as they usually are because it has been 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.930
 special I have not found so many and they are 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.510
 about 30 and long I do not know my name 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.970
 real is emerald why do they tell me that 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.960
 not as some believe it is unique 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:38.350
 sme cullen of twilight I was born on the 18th 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.269
 of July of 1991 according to my mother his uncle 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.629
 He told him that when there was a full moon 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.969
 I was going to give birth and that's how I was the only child 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.469
 I am a manchega from a town of albacete mi 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.510
 maternal grandfather was the one who taught me to 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.489
 read even before he taught me in 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.260
 the school I faint I lose 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.569
 completely the knowledge to see 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.030
 blood in real life because then I 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:02.229
 I see because I am more okavango I see 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.559
 movies like show I see of walking dead ' 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.140
 I see all that kind of movies 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.180
 the truth and I do not faint although once 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.439
 yes I saw a movie at the institute that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.110
 I was quite embarrassed but I 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.979
 I fainted because one of them cut his veins 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.570
 I started to give juju and I fell round not 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.250
 You blame me for being so sensitive 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.320
 because it comes from my father who is 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.840
 completely like me I do not like 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.020
 the cats minus the ig since it is 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.759
 super cute but it's true is I think that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.860
 they are treacherous and once I was 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.829
 half an hour with a cat of my cousin 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.140
 caressing him and 4g to get off a 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.130
 snorted and ran away and is that not 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.500
 we like nothing I like to see them but 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.330
 have them I have enough respect not 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.310
 I trust them but of course yes 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.500
 I love animals especially 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.810
 the dogs I take with my boyfriend from the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.399
 15 years and luckily my boyfriend has a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.409
 animal shop where I enjoyed a 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.720
 I've never asked for a brother 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.970

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.950

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.009
 I wanted to put his bus but nobody 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.600
 I left because I love the sugus 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.760

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.390
 fish tank with several fish but each time 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.970

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.010
 something related to hate numbers 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.989

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.730
 to chocolate every day although eating 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.319
 even a little sailing albeit not 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.330
 I always have to be covered though 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.120
 be with a sheet because I do not know 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.010
 I feel unprotected I do not know whose 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.870
 the ghosts of my room but that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.880
 yes in summer I have to have my feet 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.800
 out of the sheet and the languages ​​covered 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.050

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.620
 Mountain anything but the beach is 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.480
 always be painted with flour and such 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.910
 I like nothing but every once in a while I 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.100
 like to go they always tell me that I laugh and 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.819
 I smile for everything but seeing it but nothing 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.500

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.250
 Fall asleep while it's raining 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.519
 I have always liked winter more 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.040

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.230
 many blankets and not have more cold than 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.239
 To be very hot and I can not do anything

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.700

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.500
 English literature and classical culture with 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.030
 the one that I discovered Greek mythology and 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.040
 as always preferred 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.470

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.050

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.489
 fears are the spiders the clowns and 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.470
