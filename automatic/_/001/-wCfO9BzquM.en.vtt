handle they've literally knocked out a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
handle they've literally knocked out a
section<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.320> what's<00:00:31.590> called<00:00:31.679> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

the majority of the handle is made out
of<00:00:40.950> aluminum<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
of aluminum and then they have this

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.470 
of aluminum and then they have this
stainless<00:00:43.170> steel<00:00:43.410> plate<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.480> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
stainless steel plate in that and you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.090 
stainless steel plate in that and you
get<00:00:45.660> basically<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> advantage<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.920> both

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.840 
is very slim in fact let me give you a
measurement<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:55.020> that

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.320 

so<00:01:59.850> less<00:02:00.360> than<00:02:00.600> half<00:02:00.900> an<00:02:01.050> inch<00:02:01.440> point<00:02:02.300> three

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
so less than half an inch point three

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.750 
so less than half an inch point three
basically<00:02:03.900> 0.4<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.800> an<00:02:05.310> inch<00:02:06.440> overall<00:02:07.440> length

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
basically 0.4 of an inch overall length

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.310 
basically 0.4 of an inch overall length
this<00:02:08.760> comes<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:10.970> 7<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.180> 3/4<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.110> an<00:02:13.230> inch

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
this comes in at 7 and 3/4 of an inch

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.140 
this comes in at 7 and 3/4 of an inch
and<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.920> has<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> three<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.880> quarter

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
and then it has a three and a quarter

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.220 
and then it has a three and a quarter
inch<00:02:15.480> blade<00:02:17.600> now<00:02:18.600> if<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.840> don't<00:02:18.930> want<00:02:19.140> the
