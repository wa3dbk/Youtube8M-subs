00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.430
 we do not have 778 stadiums because it does not come 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.400
 understands that it only shows that it is 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.980
 loading and when we analyze then 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.040
 this in this case we can see clearly 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.500
 that the strip is torn but if 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.400
 was united and we had a doubt of 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.920
 that if it's the power flex then it 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.950
 charge but it does not turn on what we're going to 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.500
 do is the following 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.390
 the clues that make it turn on the 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.700
 most of the cases all phone that 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.310
 has a flex with a power button and 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.520
 one of the lines goes to ground and the other 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.830
 is going to be receiving the voltage that goes out 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.930
 times the processor or some circuit 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.710
 to control the ignition in this case 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.170
 this track that we see here 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.270
 we'll call it the number one pizza two 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.070
 three four and five the number one is the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.899
 that has to do with the ignition the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.510
 other has to do with the key of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.670
 lower and raise volume then if I want 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.340
 give solution to power but I want to be 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.199
 sure if that is the flaw in this case 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.630
 I can see it clearly in a few times 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.720
 the flex is fine but just load 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.780
 turn on I'm going to connect the battery I'm going to 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.670
 take a clamp and I will put this clue 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.340
 and I'm going to make ground contact and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.990
 I should turn on the phone 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.560
 I'm going to feed him then with the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.140
 voltage here we see and here I'm going to play 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.530
 this track and the other will put 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.530
 land 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.620
 if you are making good contact 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.750
 battery should turn on touch this 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:41.040
 track and the other earth 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.680
 ay already vibrated and let's see it should be 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.590
 turning on then I'm sure that 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.610
 if it's English problem and I proceed then 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.500
 to repair it when it's going to be repaired 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.869
 then as I do not have the flex for 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.450
 replace it then what I'm going to do 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.810
 is to lift this this stick and the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.400
 sticker that brings as there are some 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.140
 lines that are coming out 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.660
 there they can analyze in all 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.590
 power button contacts for 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.590
 place it here 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.870
 observe well 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.360
 and the poor button then takes two 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.340
 contacts one that goes to ground that in 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.010
 this case the outside one and we see how it is 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.860
 here a thick cited edge that joins 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.350
 the negative part the flex and in the part 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.320
 positive of the power button then it's 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.680
 this point from the center below passes a 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.470
 a line and it joins this then goes through 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.570
 here and start making your way towards 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.130
 the point that I already told you that we call 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.270
 that was the number one track 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.270
 what is is here 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.240
 and there I must make the bridge 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.160
 the negative part earth 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.950
 the negative part of the button 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.709
 the earth 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.989
 and the other part from here I can 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.840
 take out so that it does not get in the way of 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.430
 over if I would not have to do some 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.819
 procedures that will already show others 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.739
 videos encintar here pass the cable quoted 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.319
 they will quote again but as I have already left 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.319
 here this point happens because I know why 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.230
 Scrape the project continuity and here 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.390
 here and gave me continuity as of my 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.390
 it continues very easy all more multimeters 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.800
 we put it on the continuity scale 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.470
 we put one of the cuts 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.660
 here to find out if it was for a 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.430
 shaved and when it costs you very 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.500
 notice that the line below makes 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.870
 contact with this why I know that 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.630
 making a bridge from here to number one 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.640
 of the contacts that I already explained to you and 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.590
 another earth when you press the button 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.650
 power will do the same function when the 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.500
 dam good and should light here already 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.540
 I have it almost ready what I did was 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.819
 scrape the part the part that is 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.130
 cover 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:03.550
 we want it to be scraped so I apply fruits 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.240
 applied fruit to that line is to the line 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.630
 negative that I'm going to solder a cablecito 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.260
 I apply flush took the soldering iron with a 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.290
 minute at least before there 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.350
 been preheated to be able to weld well 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.930
 and applied this year on that point today 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.370
 we see that I now grab all the cables 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.930
 cited in this case are an alhambra 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.870
 special for that 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.870
 and we apply then here the cable quoted 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.840
 I already have the negative part that will go to 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.840
 land 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.880
 and now I then missing part 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.140
 that is going to be the line so to speak 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.140
 positive line of the power button 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.140
 so 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.920
 the poplars here also 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.940
 and I already have the two contacts that are going to 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.580
 go soldier at the time 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.280
 Now we re-assemble and weld 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.560
 curled and we have finished all the 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.420
 work that we did take the pizza that 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.610
 went earth and weld anywhere 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.950
 that is land to water anywhere 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.810
 negative the other point we release it to 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.580
 where we already said it was the track number 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.460
 one that has to do with the fire 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.670
 the others have to do with the button 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.740
 of volume going down and going up here like 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.750
 I knew that the ignition track will be 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.350
 first because doing follow-up to 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.380
 the whole line took me to that point at 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.320
 what were we talking about here then 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.540
 We can observe 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.400
 which they are welded the two points we have 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.220
 given solution if I want to repair already the 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.230
 our volume would have to take out the 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.390
 freight track the tracks and 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.120
 know which of each one of them to 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.340
 where is it going and be able to do the same 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.540
 the same a seal that came out 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:14.540
 it should light up if it does not turn on 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.960
 just without pressing the button is because we 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.410
 the work went wrong 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:24.249
 and we have to short it has to work 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:26.469
 only when we press the button 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:28.480
 the power there we see it already lighting 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:31.210
 usually 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.100
 and so we have been able to solve this to 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.810
 this fault service the technical service 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.560
 professional in mobile telephony and 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.560
 mobile devices
