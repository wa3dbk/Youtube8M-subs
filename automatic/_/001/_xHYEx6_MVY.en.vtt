ball<00:00:07.170> wheels<00:00:07.680> i<00:00:07.940> hear<00:00:08.940> these<00:00:09.240> wheels<00:00:10.080> are

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
ball wheels i hear these wheels are

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.720 
ball wheels i hear these wheels are
really<00:00:10.440> good<00:00:10.620> for<00:00:10.769> downhill<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.280> freeride<00:00:11.340> I

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
really good for downhill and freeride I

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.120 
really good for downhill and freeride I
bought<00:00:12.150> him<00:00:12.269> for<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.480> skateboard<00:00:13.049> deck<00:00:13.230> so

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
bought him for a skateboard deck so

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:44.690 
bought him for a skateboard deck so
let's<00:00:14.519> get<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.880> marketing<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.890> these<00:00:44.309> wheels

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
let's get a marketing so these wheels

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.479 
let's get a marketing so these wheels
measure<00:00:45.270> 65<00:00:46.140> millimeters<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.860> diameter<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
measure 65 millimeters in diameter and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.510 
measure 65 millimeters in diameter and
they<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> 45<00:00:49.230> millimeter<00:00:49.739> contact<00:00:50.250> patch

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
they have a 45 millimeter contact patch

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.319 
they have a 45 millimeter contact patch
and<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.750> contact<00:00:52.199> patch<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.489> amount<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and the contact patch is the amount of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
and the contact patch is the amount of
wheel<00:00:54.570> which<00:00:54.840> makes<00:00:55.289> contact<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
wheel which makes contact with the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.330 
wheel which makes contact with the
ground<00:00:56.489> while<00:00:56.789> riding<00:00:57.410> these<00:00:58.410> wheels<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
ground while riding these wheels have a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.410 
ground while riding these wheels have a
width<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.730> 45<00:01:00.239> millimeters<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:03.180> wheels

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
width of 45 millimeters and the wheels

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.590 
width of 45 millimeters and the wheels
also<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:04.080> rounded<00:01:05.040> lips<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.210> guys<00:01:06.330> can

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
also have rounded lips as you guys can

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.810 
also have rounded lips as you guys can
see<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.280> rounded<00:01:08.640> lips

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
see and because of the rounded lips

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.850 
see and because of the rounded lips
there's<00:01:09.750> almost<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.500> unnoticeable

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
there's almost an unnoticeable

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.440 
there's almost an unnoticeable
transition<00:01:11.820> between<00:01:12.619> sliding<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.890> grip<00:01:14.450> so

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
transition between sliding and grip so

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
transition between sliding and grip so
these<00:01:15.990> wheels<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.920> cool<00:01:17.130> smoke

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
these wheels have a really cool smoke

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.570 
these wheels have a really cool smoke
design<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.750> guys<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:20.490> wheels

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
design you guys can see the wheels

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.350 
design you guys can see the wheels
mostly<00:01:21.150> gray<00:01:21.409> it<00:01:22.409> has<00:01:22.590> black<00:01:23.580> sector<00:01:24.210> 9

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
mostly gray it has black sector 9

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.039 
mostly gray it has black sector 9
writing<00:01:25.189> with<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.490> yellow<00:01:26.820> highlight<00:01:27.810> online

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
writing with a yellow highlight online

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.130 
writing with a yellow highlight online
writing<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.979> looks<00:01:29.130> pretty<00:01:29.340> cool<00:01:30.140> so

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
writing and it looks pretty cool so

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
writing and it looks pretty cool so
these<00:01:31.500> wheels<00:01:31.920> are<00:01:32.130> made<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.640> material

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
these wheels are made out of a material

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.620 
these wheels are made out of a material
ecology<00:01:33.570> Thrain<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.140> nice<00:01:34.979> rain<00:01:35.450> gives<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
ecology Thrain a nice rain gives the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.480 
ecology Thrain a nice rain gives the
wheels<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.650> good<00:01:37.770> grip<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.189> ground

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
wheels really good grip with the ground

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.420 
wheels really good grip with the ground
meaning<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.150> these<00:01:39.810> wheels<00:01:40.140> give<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.159> board

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
meaning that these wheels give the board

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.080 
meaning that these wheels give the board
a<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.420> control<00:01:42.840> these<00:01:43.799> wheels<00:01:44.220> also<00:01:44.909> have

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
a lot of control these wheels also have

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.810 
a lot of control these wheels also have
really<00:01:45.420> good<00:01:45.570> abrasion<00:01:46.020> resistance<00:01:46.979> which

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
really good abrasion resistance which

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.910 
really good abrasion resistance which
means<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.720> wheels<00:01:48.960> will<00:01:49.320> last<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.770> while

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
means that the wheels will last a while

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.690 
means that the wheels will last a while
instead<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.090> wearing<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:53.220> these

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
instead of just wearing out so these

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.539 
instead of just wearing out so these
wheels<00:01:54.149> measure<00:01:54.659> 78<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> hardness<00:01:56.159> which

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
wheels measure 78 and hardness which

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.270 
wheels measure 78 and hardness which
means<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.600> they're<00:01:58.110> good<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.500> sliding<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
means that they're good for sliding and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.670 
means that they're good for sliding and
other<00:01:59.369> types<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.939> freeride<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:01.259> guys<00:02:01.409> can

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
other types of freeride you guys can

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.139 
other types of freeride you guys can
kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> material<00:02:02.670> it's

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
kind of see the kind of material it's

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.260 
kind of see the kind of material it's
not<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> soft<00:02:03.719> material<00:02:04.850> it's<00:02:05.850> more<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.180> a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
not a soft material it's more of a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.719 
not a soft material it's more of a
material<00:02:06.600> where<00:02:07.290> you'll<00:02:08.039> get<00:02:08.190> less<00:02:08.459> friction

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
material where you'll get less friction

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.100 
material where you'll get less friction
with<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.000> ground<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.479> you'll<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:09.840> able<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
with the ground so you'll be able to

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.140 
with the ground so you'll be able to
slide<00:02:10.379> better<00:02:11.989> so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
slide better so

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.210 
slide better so
