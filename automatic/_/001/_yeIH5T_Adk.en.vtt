00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
just automatically put in the science

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.000 
just automatically put in the science
drunk<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.270> I<00:00:58.900> went<00:00:59.140> along<00:00:59.410> with<00:00:59.620> it<00:00:59.650> and<00:00:59.949> I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
drunk and I went along with it and I

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.799 
drunk and I went along with it and I
remember<00:01:00.430> thinking<00:01:00.460> this<00:01:01.059> is<00:01:01.210> what<00:01:01.360> one<00:01:01.570> does

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
remember thinking this is what one does

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.510 
remember thinking this is what one does
when<00:01:02.140> one<00:01:02.320> does<00:01:02.500> well<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.770> good<00:01:02.980> one<00:01:03.130> becomes<00:01:03.430> a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
when one does well is good one becomes a

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.550 
when one does well is good one becomes a
doctor<00:01:03.880> and<00:01:04.180> I<00:01:04.540> thought<00:01:04.780> what<00:01:05.020> I<00:01:05.050> really<00:01:05.410> love

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
doctor and I thought what I really love

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.870 
doctor and I thought what I really love
to<00:01:05.710> do<00:01:05.800> is<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.070> write<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.460> I<00:01:06.490> thought<00:01:06.670> you<00:01:06.850> know

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
to do is to write and I thought you know

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.210 
to do is to write and I thought you know
I'm<00:01:07.060> going<00:01:07.210> to<00:01:07.300> become<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.570> doctor<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.290> then

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
I'm going to become a doctor and then

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.719 
I'm going to become a doctor and then
I'll<00:01:09.399> write<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:09.940> then<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:12.070> i<00:01:12.190> think<00:01:12.430> it<00:01:12.580> was

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
I'll write and then but i think it was

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.330 
I'll write and then but i think it was
and<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.119> went<00:01:13.390> into<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:14.800> University<00:01:15.310> of

good<00:01:24.910> which<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.660> know<00:01:26.160> but<00:01:27.160> it<00:01:27.280> was<00:01:27.369> also<00:01:27.550> the

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
good which you know but it was also the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.310 
good which you know but it was also the
sense<00:01:27.970> in<00:01:28.090> which<00:01:28.149> I<00:01:28.450> was<00:01:28.479> doing<00:01:28.780> well<00:01:28.990> I'm<00:01:29.170> sort

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
sense in which I was doing well I'm sort

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.139 
sense in which I was doing well I'm sort
of<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:29.890> know<00:01:29.950> we<00:01:30.130> do<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.369> test<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.820> get<00:01:31.030> them

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
of you know we do the test and get them

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.969 
of you know we do the test and get them
all<00:01:31.270> right<00:01:31.539> but<00:01:31.750> it<00:01:31.869> was<00:01:31.990> boring<00:01:32.530> i<00:01:32.649> had<00:01:32.770> no

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
all right but it was boring i had no

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.010 
all right but it was boring i had no
interest<00:01:33.490> in<00:01:33.700> these<00:01:34.030> things<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.540> so<00:01:34.869> what<00:01:34.990> i

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
interest in these things and so what i

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.560 
interest in these things and so what i
did<00:01:35.140> was<00:01:35.320> i<00:01:35.530> decided<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.159> flee<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:37.210> study<00:01:37.479> of

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
did was i decided to flee the study of

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.120 
did was i decided to flee the study of
medicine<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.080> thought<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:38.380> know<00:01:38.500> I<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.830> really

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
medicine I thought you know I I really

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.700 
medicine I thought you know I I really
also<00:01:39.280> did<00:01:39.520> not<00:01:39.549> like<00:01:39.880> biology<00:01:40.299> at<00:01:40.690> all<00:01:40.930> I<00:01:41.229> I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
also did not like biology at all I I

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.469 
also did not like biology at all I I
quite<00:01:42.130> liked<00:01:42.400> chemistry<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.150> so<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.299> thought

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
quite liked chemistry and so I thought

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.690 
quite liked chemistry and so I thought
I'd<00:01:43.630> wait<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.900> do<00:01:43.990> farmers<00:01:44.350> instead<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.549> that

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
I'd wait to do farmers instead so that

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.160 
I'd wait to do farmers instead so that
way<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:45.939> might<00:01:46.060> be<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.299> bit<00:01:46.450> more<00:01:46.600> interested<00:01:47.080> I

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
way it might be a bit more interested I

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.750 
way it might be a bit more interested I
sort<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.380> like<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.799> organic<00:01:48.220> chemistry<00:01:48.670> and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
sort of like the organic chemistry and

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.760 
sort of like the organic chemistry and
drawing<00:01:49.030> those<00:01:49.270> things<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:50.080> then<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.290> went<00:01:50.470> to

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770
