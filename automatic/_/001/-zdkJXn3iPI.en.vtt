00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
another example this is easy there's a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.370 
another example this is easy there's a
red<00:02:10.720> seats<00:02:10.989> you<00:02:11.230> have<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.500> grab<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.890> red<00:02:12.069> seats

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
red seats you have to grab the red seats

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.220 
red seats you have to grab the red seats
one<00:02:14.380> more<00:02:14.620> maybe<00:02:14.830> okay<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.840> know<00:02:16.959> what<00:02:17.140> you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
one more maybe okay you know what you

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.949 
one more maybe okay you know what you
have<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.440> grab<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:21.330> isn't<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.450> ghost<00:02:22.660> because

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
have to grab it isn't the ghost because

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.509 
have to grab it isn't the ghost because
that's<00:02:23.260> why<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.739> isn't<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.069> book<00:02:24.280> because

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
that's why it isn't the book because

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.680 
that's why it isn't the book because
there's<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.760> book<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.239> it's<00:02:25.360> on<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.510> rats

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
there's a book and it's on the rats

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.140 
there's a book and it's on the rats
because<00:02:26.080> there's<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.890> red<00:02:27.370> bottle<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.880> isn't

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
because there's a red bottle it isn't

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.509 
because there's a red bottle it isn't
the<00:02:28.239> bottle<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.170> have<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.680> grab<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.280> grey

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
the bottle so you have to grab the grey

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.640 
the bottle so you have to grab the grey
mouse<00:02:30.790> because<00:02:31.510> there's<00:02:31.720> no<00:02:31.900> gray<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.410> no

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
mouse so as you can see it's kinda

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.100 
mouse so as you can see it's kinda
complicated<00:02:36.640> it's<00:02:37.330> something<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.840> really

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110
