00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.330 
that's good for backing up vocals what
I'm<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.490> do<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:09.259> place<00:02:10.259> my<00:02:10.740> third<00:02:11.009> finger

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
I'm going to do is place my third finger

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.890 
I'm going to do is place my third finger
at<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.300> third<00:02:12.330> fret<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:13.080> string<00:02:13.980> six<00:02:14.750> now<00:02:15.750> this

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
at the third fret on string six now this

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.050 
at the third fret on string six now this
is<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.050> little<00:02:16.320> bit<00:02:16.440> trickier<00:02:16.860> because<00:02:17.730> what<00:02:18.030> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
is a little bit trickier because what I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.510 
is a little bit trickier because what I
want<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.390> do<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.720> block<00:02:19.020> out<00:02:19.260> string<00:02:19.680> five<00:02:20.280> I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
want to do is block out string five I

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.870 
want to do is block out string five I
just<00:02:20.700> want<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.880> make<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.030> click<00:02:21.390> there<00:02:22.880> you'll

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
just want to make a click there you'll

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.550 
just want to make a click there you'll
probably<00:02:24.120> find<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.720> quite<00:02:24.750> easy<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.260> do

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
probably find it's quite easy to do

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.370 
probably find it's quite easy to do
because<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:26.970> let<00:02:27.150> our<00:02:27.330> third<00:02:28.080> finger

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
because if we just let our third finger

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.410 
because if we just let our third finger
be<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> little<00:02:28.980> bit<00:02:29.130> lazy<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.820> lean<00:02:30.090> across

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
be a little bit lazy and lean across

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.960 
be a little bit lazy and lean across
that<00:02:30.720> fifth<00:02:30.959> string<00:02:31.260> it'll<00:02:31.440> block<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.800> out

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
that fifth string it'll block it out

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.040 
that fifth string it'll block it out
what<00:02:32.970> I'm<00:02:33.090> going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.540> with<00:02:33.660> my<00:02:33.810> right<00:02:34.020> hand

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
what I'm going to do with my right hand

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.210 
what I'm going to do with my right hand
is<00:02:34.380> strum<00:02:34.680> right<00:02:34.980> down<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.940> second<00:02:36.360> string

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
is strum right down to the second string

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.830 
is strum right down to the second string
so<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.400> reality<00:02:38.670> I'll<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.209> strumming<00:02:39.480> five

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
so in reality I'll be strumming five

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.530 
so in reality I'll be strumming five
strings<00:02:40.350> but<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.010> only<00:02:41.280> want<00:02:41.640> four<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.240> sound

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
strings but I only want four to sound

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.270 
strings but I only want four to sound
because<00:02:43.020> I'm<00:02:43.170> blocking<00:02:43.560> out<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.890> fifth

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
because I'm blocking out that fifth

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.780 
because I'm blocking out that fifth
string

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
string

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:53.710 
string
here's<00:02:45.330> my<00:02:45.570> G<00:02:45.959> chord

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.480 

now<00:02:54.720> these<00:02:54.960> next<00:02:55.350> two<00:02:55.500> ways<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:55.920> playing<00:02:56.190> G

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
now these next two ways of playing G

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.310 
now these next two ways of playing G
chord<00:02:56.790> aimed<00:02:57.300> at<00:02:57.540> players<00:02:57.810> who've<00:02:58.110> been

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
chord aimed at players who've been

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.070 
chord aimed at players who've been
playing<00:02:58.500> guitar<00:02:59.070> for<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.430> little<00:02:59.610> while<00:03:00.080> for

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
playing guitar for a little while for

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.020 
playing guitar for a little while for
example<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.650> probably<00:03:01.830> know<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.490> D<00:03:02.700> chord

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
example you probably know the D chord

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.350 
example you probably know the D chord
shape<00:03:03.710> but<00:03:04.710> what<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.070> may<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:05.520> know<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.150> that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
shape but what you may not know is that

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.890 
shape but what you may not know is that
if<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.630> move<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:07.140> D<00:03:07.380> chord<00:03:07.740> shape<00:03:08.840> up<00:03:09.840> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
if you move this D chord shape up the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.940 
if you move this D chord shape up the
fingerboard<00:03:11.990> until<00:03:12.990> your<00:03:13.200> first<00:03:13.470> finger

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
fingerboard until your first finger

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.630 
fingerboard until your first finger
reaches<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.360> seventh<00:03:15.780> fret

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
reaches the seventh fret

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.250 
reaches the seventh fret
I'm<00:03:17.640> just<00:03:17.910> keeping<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.360> exact<00:03:18.630> same<00:03:18.870> shape

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
I'm just keeping the exact same shape

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.310 
I'm just keeping the exact same shape
the<00:03:19.650> D<00:03:19.830> chord<00:03:20.040> shape<00:03:20.540> but<00:03:21.540> now<00:03:21.690> if<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.900> play<00:03:22.140> the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
the D chord shape but now if I play the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.480 
the D chord shape but now if I play the
first<00:03:22.560> three<00:03:22.890> strings<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:24.980> have<00:03:25.980> another<00:03:26.250> way

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
first three strings I have another way

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.780 
first three strings I have another way
of<00:03:26.790> playing<00:03:26.940> G<00:03:27.420> chord<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:32.340> here's<00:03:32.580> another

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790

chord shape that you'll already know if

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.200 
chord shape that you'll already know if
you've<00:03:35.010> been<00:03:35.190> playing<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.580> while<00:03:35.790> I'm<00:03:36.030> just

I'll have a G chord and now I'd like to
show<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.560> two<00:04:10.980> more<00:04:11.160> G<00:04:11.490> chord<00:04:11.730> shapes<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.330> I

show you two more G chord shapes that I

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.840 
show you two more G chord shapes that I
find<00:04:12.660> very<00:04:12.780> useful<00:04:13.050> in<00:04:13.770> specific<00:04:14.370> musical

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
find very useful in specific musical

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.780 
find very useful in specific musical
situations<00:04:15.620> for<00:04:16.620> example<00:04:16.710> if<00:04:17.310> we're<00:04:17.549> playing

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
situations for example if we're playing

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.020 
situations for example if we're playing
songs<00:04:18.270> by<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.320> Eagles<00:04:19.950> for<00:04:20.250> example<00:04:20.820> this

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
songs by the Eagles for example this

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.300 
songs by the Eagles for example this
next<00:04:21.420> G<00:04:21.630> chord<00:04:21.900> shape<00:04:22.170> would<00:04:22.500> be<00:04:22.560> very<00:04:22.860> useful

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.040 

and<00:04:50.530> in<00:04:50.650> many<00:04:50.830> instances<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.820> would<00:04:52.300> use<00:04:52.510> that<00:04:52.780> G

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
and in many instances I would use that G

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.400 
and in many instances I would use that G
chord<00:04:53.320> shape<00:04:53.620> if<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.550> was<00:04:54.700> changing<00:04:55.300> from<00:04:55.720> G<00:04:56.140> to

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
chord shape if I was changing from G to

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.490

type<00:04:59.860> guitar<00:05:00.370> sound<00:05:00.760> all<00:05:01.600> I'd<00:05:01.780> have<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.960> do<00:05:02.200> if

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
type guitar sound all I'd have to do if

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.530 
type guitar sound all I'd have to do if
I<00:05:02.380> wanted<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.710> change<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.640> C<00:05:03.910> chord

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
I wanted to change to the C chord

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.560 
I wanted to change to the C chord
I<00:05:04.570> would<00:05:05.320> simply<00:05:05.710> move<00:05:06.280> my<00:05:06.610> second<00:05:07.390> finger

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
I would simply move my second finger

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.350 
I would simply move my second finger
down<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.170> fifth<00:05:08.470> string<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:09.210> we'd<00:05:10.210> be

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
down to the fifth string and we'd be

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.450 
down to the fifth string and we'd be
creating<00:05:10.810> a<00:05:11.460> c2<00:05:12.460> court<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:14.040> that<00:05:15.040> sounds<00:05:15.400> like

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
creating a c2 court and that sounds like

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.240 
creating a c2 court and that sounds like
this<00:05:15.550> here's<00:05:15.910> my<00:05:16.060> G<00:05:16.300> chord

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.190 

and<00:05:19.670> if<00:05:19.790> I<00:05:19.850> wanted<00:05:20.120> to<00:05:20.180> change<00:05:20.510> to<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:20.930> c2

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
and if I wanted to change to the c2

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.040 
and if I wanted to change to the c2
Court<00:05:21.890> I<00:05:22.040> simply<00:05:22.520> move<00:05:23.120> my<00:05:23.360> second<00:05:23.780> finger

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
Court I simply move my second finger

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.300 
Court I simply move my second finger
down<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:24.970> strum<00:05:25.970> five<00:05:26.810> strings<00:05:27.310> incidentally

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
down and strum five strings incidentally

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.100 
down and strum five strings incidentally
with<00:05:28.520> this<00:05:28.730> C<00:05:28.940> chord<00:05:29.210> I'd<00:05:29.330> be<00:05:29.480> blocking<00:05:29.720> out

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
with this C chord I'd be blocking out

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.490 
with this C chord I'd be blocking out
the<00:05:30.320> fourth<00:05:30.560> string

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.030 

so<00:05:34.100> here's<00:05:34.370> those<00:05:34.520> two<00:05:34.760> chords<00:05:35.000> again<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.510> G

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:45.870 

to<00:05:38.730> see

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.540 

and<00:05:46.880> this<00:05:47.180> last<00:05:47.390> g-chord<00:05:47.990> I'm<00:05:48.410> playing<00:05:49.220> by

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
and this last g-chord I'm playing by

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.480 
and this last g-chord I'm playing by
placing<00:05:50.120> my<00:05:50.240> first<00:05:50.630> finger<00:05:51.160> at<00:05:52.160> the<00:05:52.460> third

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
placing my first finger at the third

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.530 
placing my first finger at the third
fret<00:05:53.090> on<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:54.380> second<00:05:54.950> string<00:05:55.210> my<00:05:56.210> third

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
fret on the second string my third

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.650 
fret on the second string my third
finger<00:05:56.840> at<00:05:57.260> the<00:05:57.620> fifth<00:05:57.830> fret<00:05:57.950> on<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:59.390> 5th

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
finger at the fifth fret on the 5th

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.080 
finger at the fifth fret on the 5th
string<00:06:00.020> and<00:06:00.200> my<00:06:00.560> fourth<00:06:00.860> finger<00:06:01.130> at<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:01.850> fifth

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
string and my fourth finger at the fifth

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.379 
string and my fourth finger at the fifth
fret<00:06:02.360> on<00:06:02.630> the<00:06:03.230> fourth<00:06:03.560> strength

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.350 

and<00:06:06.810> I<00:06:07.020> find<00:06:07.289> this<00:06:07.409> is<00:06:07.620> very<00:06:07.860> useful<00:06:08.460> if<00:06:08.669> I'm

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
and I find this is very useful if I'm

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.929 
and I find this is very useful if I'm
moving<00:06:09.810> from<00:06:09.990> C<00:06:11.060> to<00:06:12.060> an<00:06:12.210> f2<00:06:13.939> which

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939 
moving from C to an f2 which

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:16.520 
moving from C to an f2 which
incidentally<00:06:15.389> is<00:06:15.689> going<00:06:15.930> to<00:06:16.050> be<00:06:16.169> the<00:06:16.319> same

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
incidentally is going to be the same

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.279 
incidentally is going to be the same
shape<00:06:16.889> the<00:06:17.219> exact<00:06:17.550> same<00:06:17.759> shape<00:06:18.090> as<00:06:18.300> this<00:06:18.990> G

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
shape the exact same shape as this G

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.629 
shape the exact same shape as this G
chord<00:06:19.560> so<00:06:20.460> when<00:06:20.610> I<00:06:20.639> move<00:06:20.909> that<00:06:21.469> f2<00:06:22.469> chord<00:06:22.889> up

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
chord so when I move that f2 chord up

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.790 
chord so when I move that f2 chord up
two<00:06:24.030> frets<00:06:24.360> it<00:06:24.659> becomes<00:06:25.199> a<00:06:25.500> G<00:06:25.889> chord<00:06:27.800> let's

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
two frets it becomes a G chord let's

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.320 
two frets it becomes a G chord let's
have<00:06:28.979> a<00:06:29.009> listen<00:06:29.189> to<00:06:29.400> how<00:06:29.430> these<00:06:29.819> three<00:06:30.090> chords
