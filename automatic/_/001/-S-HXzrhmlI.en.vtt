I tried to play aggressive take the ball
early<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.510> then<00:00:21.779> because<00:00:22.199> I'm<00:00:22.350> doing<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.710> vs

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
early and then because I'm doing at vs

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.609 
early and then because I'm doing at vs
to<00:00:23.130> do<00:00:23.279> too<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.019> play<00:00:25.199> differently

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
to do too so I have to play differently

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.099 
to do too so I have to play differently
against<00:00:25.949> international<00:00:26.400> playing<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.900> player

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
against international playing the player

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.509 
against international playing the player
of<00:00:28.230> many<00:00:28.439> other<00:00:28.590> players<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.130> he<00:00:29.220> has<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.429> be

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
of many other players and he has to be

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.700 
of many other players and he has to be
the<00:00:29.640> same<00:00:29.820> thing<00:00:30.090> because<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:31.140> know<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.560> do

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the same thing because you know just do

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.229 
the same thing because you know just do
the<00:00:31.920> regular<00:00:31.949> rallied<00:00:32.550> always<00:00:32.880> making<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the regular rallied always making a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.220 
the regular rallied always making a
novena<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.250> that's<00:00:35.250> why<00:00:35.430> sometimes<00:00:36.329> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
novena and that's why sometimes it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.540 
novena and that's why sometimes it
sounds<00:00:37.380> more<00:00:37.620> difficult<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.250> more

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
sounds more difficult actually more

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.580 
sounds more difficult actually more
simple<00:00:38.910> because<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.540> exactly<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.530> you

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
simple because you know exactly what you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.369 
simple because you know exactly what you
need<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.309> only<00:00:41.430> get<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:41.640> shot<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
need to do you only get one shot and

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.830 
need to do you only get one shot and
evaluate<00:00:43.379> some<00:00:43.559> time<00:00:44.090> this<00:00:45.090> way<00:00:45.329> African

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
evaluate some time this way African

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.779
