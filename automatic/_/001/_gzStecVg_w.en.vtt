00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.839 
healing of bones so this may have been
an<00:02:29.200> evolutionary<00:02:30.200> thing<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.580> cats

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
an evolutionary thing that that cats

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.150 
an evolutionary thing that that cats
kind<00:02:32.569> of<00:02:32.660> acquired<00:02:33.019> along<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.530> way<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.739> help

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
kind of acquired along the way to help

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.820 
kind of acquired along the way to help
them<00:02:34.400> heal<00:02:34.730> faster<00:02:35.599> there's<00:02:36.050> all<00:02:36.290> kinds<00:02:36.769> of

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
them heal faster there's all kinds of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.600 
them heal faster there's all kinds of
neat<00:02:37.099> things<00:02:37.130> about<00:02:37.790> purrs<00:02:38.660> but<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.950> really

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
neat things about purrs but I really

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.479 
neat things about purrs but I really
like<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:41.209> idea<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:42.590> know<00:02:42.620> cats<00:02:43.010> whether

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
like the idea that you know cats whether

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.600 
like the idea that you know cats whether
they<00:02:43.670> /<00:02:44.030> or<00:02:44.330> not<00:02:44.569> they<00:02:45.260> can<00:02:45.319> still<00:02:45.799> show<00:02:46.099> how

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
they / or not they can still show how

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.820 
they / or not they can still show how
they<00:02:46.819> love<00:02:47.090> us<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.510> communicate<00:02:48.319> with<00:02:48.500> us<00:02:48.650> in

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
they love us and communicate with us in

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.130 
they love us and communicate with us in
so<00:02:49.040> many<00:02:49.190> different<00:02:49.459> ways<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.150> that's<00:02:50.269> it<00:02:50.630> for

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
so many different ways and that's it for

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.729 
so many different ways and that's it for
ask<00:02:51.319> Amy<00:02:51.650> today<00:02:52.180> hers<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.750> drills<00:02:54.079> until<00:02:54.560> next

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
ask Amy today hers and drills until next

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.040 
ask Amy today hers and drills until next
time
