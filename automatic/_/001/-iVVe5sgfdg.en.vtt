00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.580
 but it's not the white knight who 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.120
 pretends to be also that's where the l 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.120
 ambiguity for me morning men 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.340
 blacks so his hand claude juncker 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.050
 the six finalists michel little and one 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.090
 politician we discovered the stamp 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.869
 tonight no what seems to have turned on a 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.470
 triple gold ball but also the six 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.300
 dies that quit thank you I hope that 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.860
 either here or elsewhere anyway 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.790
 unfortunately god be the end 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.030
 justifies the means 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.680
 why not maybe to put in 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.420
 put into practice at the price of ambition 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.900
 nobler as White Knight 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.730
 maybe maybe sometimes the 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.780
 hero they need to know too 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.100
 shooting art that's why rihanna 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.989
 it is that there is no he is very much 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.760
 more severe than me your life terrain he 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.750
 there are no ars if they come a little 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.400
 in the kind of christophe is that you 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.989
 seem to endorse a species 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.420
 of endemic obsession in politics on 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.070
 may not anyway morning 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.750
 like the others here it is in the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.550
 diplomatic game anywhere too 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.320
 high be it to the uefa when one is 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.030
 elected president there are bound to be people 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.010
 who vote for you who do not have the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.540
 moral probity that you because at 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.680
 every time there is March 26 by is 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.470
 bought 1 in any election 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.430
 finally I do not know but it's not buying 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.870
 but it is that you are obliged to 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.979
 pass alliances of this degree she 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.180
 exists and I have trouble with all 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:28.180
 these rotten finally christophe that's it a 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:30.100
 little that bothers me in sympathy says the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.260
 Iss crisis in Valois majority 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.150
 it's the law of the majority you are 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.500
 obliged to make you allies who 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.540
 gives anyway not the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.970
 moral virtues that you would like 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.920
 maybe have and if you are obligated 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.150
 to go through games of influence and 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.130
 it's the same on the political world 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:52.000
 global geopolitics it's the same with 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.060
 turn is back on platoche we will not 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.860
 we will not discover that during 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.610
 the attribution of the cups of the world 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.200
 djo and there are comments of the games 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.800
 of influenced behind the attributes are 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.070
 these people there when you say that platini is going 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.770
 see sarkozy that as president 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.120
 kind before the vote and that one of the most 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.240
 illustrious representatives of sport 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.820
 French and that actually has 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.980
 probably influenced his vote and that 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.690
 behind you go a lot of companies 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.490
 French who will take advantage of its 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.520
 nominal aunts to build 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.810
 stadiums and that the French economy 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.940
 will benefit directly and indirectly 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.090
 of it like today football 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.520
 French in this yard is saved and 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.840
 will be saved by qatar and money 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.940
 TV rights be it national 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.140
 this is recorded so that the out 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.630
 later that's of course so is very 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.040
 nervous it's towards bin so very very 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.500
 naively we are discovering 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.840
 that there is this stuff is that this 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.470
 kind of things that's bad so kind of 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.560
 things are bad 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.320
 so I replied then due platini 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.520
 because the morning is not a 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.350
 investigation to charge is really a 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.880
 chapter and a half on the qatar on 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.410
 could talk about his son underlined 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.489
 ambiguity that is to say that his son 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.860
 troy bodie casse arrive via the 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.390
 targeted equipment during the survey that 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.980
 that we could not approach but who is 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.420
 it seems very sweet and very modest 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.950
 I saw in particular mourad boudjellal 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.660
 since who is president of the club of 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.790
 toulon because their platinum and 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.610
 few months after the designation by 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.019
 his father from qatar to psg works at 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.150
 psg after worked at the guards there 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.680
 is debauched by here so the fund 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.269
 qatari is today the director 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.860
 General BURRDA what 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.690
 the Qatari equipment supplier team toulon en 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.570
 rugby belgium and tunisia so I 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.190
 do not dispute these qualities 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.470
 exactly you are nice growing up 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.209
 so and an ambiguity for me to 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.739
 platini after all that is told in 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.690
 the island is really how Platinum is 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.190
 regulate actually because his son 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.250
 works for bordeaux sport this is at 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.269
 to say that platini vote gives his vote 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.250
 for qatar while he wanted to vote 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.989
 for sixteen united when we think that the 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.370
 already done but I have a question and that 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.970
 confuses her the nascar the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.880
 sphere this term 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.210
 This office is hired by 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.980
 bfm in three months time so I 'm 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.280
 bad honest I did not say that I said that 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.570
 so I melt wrongly because 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.750
 it's ambiguous because these marbles to 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.220
 what's the matter for me it's ambiguous 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.740
 drogba who is good I am so I 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.760
 so if my son tightly and 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.590
 it's because I'm honest we 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.170
 finance your son and you grab where the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.030
 people I ride people in the lives of 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.230
 people in life or not to deny to find 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.190
 from job right to left in the 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.490
 legs for the loan would be so that's 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.200
 ambiguous 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.490
 daniel but week end to look at you 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.960
 a debate because because he 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:35.740
 is present behind how this lack 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:40.150
 one of the young Martiniquans could 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.400
 pascal allias your case because 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.580
 the big difference is that 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.930
 platini has a role and influence between 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.660
 quotes that you do not have the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:54.640
 first reason la and compared to your 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.340
 supposed son here had done it's tomorrow 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.630
 I do it at the drm scale stopped a year 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.670
 now there are rams and his 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.260
 different which is nice name but if the 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.640
 guy so really night inhabitants and if 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.990
 win them and we do not know was not the 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.400
 bcma the problem it would really make me 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.200
 at home what interests me trees 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.420
 then who is it that is what bothers me 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.770
 in what you say daniel I understand 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.660
 what do you mean arnaud in their 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.920
 saying there is no proof 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.810
 dishonesty so I do not see where is 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.680
 the problem okay I see that I 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.710
 want to tell you something else 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.680
 I'm surprised you're not going to be 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.270
 not interested in the facts 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.650
 chronological and understood on this 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.000
 go to the elysée but I'm more 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.440
 that interested I will be well I understand 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.180
 everything clearly but that's it to mermoz is 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.550
 due to listening michel we have some 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.300
 interests with the qatar the france of everything 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.740
 you give your vote 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.510
 ok I should say me well eh me 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.160
 well it does not surprise me 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.180
 it does not surprise you it does not shock me 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.500
 but me what to rethink your 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.720
 mail stéphane no it's not naivety 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.400
 and I find it will not serve become 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.810
 delusional daniel throw the days I the 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.040
 not selling the relationship with Antoine 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.970
 we made our case of annie told 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.140
 how complaints there me what 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.210
 I am interested in reading arnaud's book 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.810
 it's on this case as on 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.670
 other 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.620
 is that these things have to be 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.630
 say that does not mean that people 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.580
 are dishonest tonight it's small but 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.110
 because it says that you me me 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.150
 want to be told everything daniel that you 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.100
 tell me what surprises me is the 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.020
 naivety yours that of people we get 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.880
 fool that people are naive if 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.560
 people are learning 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.030
 things and can say it's 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.440
 still someone for someone 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.120
 who is said to be a man of influence 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.610
 since it has a lot of influence 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.990
 I can find it very suggestible 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.670
 on this one there for example and reindeer 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.990
 that is, does it somewhere 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.190
 platini that had decided of under 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.660
 treatment to support another 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.280
 application he is returned 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.600
 maybe for not personal interests 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.800
 not for this account double by point 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.330
 all this I agree passed by a 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.400
 money makes me I'm interested in 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.080
 discover that he is not corrupted 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:39.030
 dogs but it is suggestible by the 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:43.560
 President d with all the souls interested 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.210
 to know if platini the opposite had 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.860
 did this appointment there said I'm 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.000
 sorry sir sarkozy but me these 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.050
 interests there no matter 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.280
 because what interests me and 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.450
 footballistic me and I think the 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.680
 common mandate more reason than she 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.780
 would contain you knew it's no but 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.280
 listen to me me I'm not platini 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.990
 so me here the vest what are you doing 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.340
 me if I pop the stem is simpler 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.170

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.500
