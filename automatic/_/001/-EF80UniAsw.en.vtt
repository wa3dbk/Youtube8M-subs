00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
one is in sky blue and I thought this

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.970 
one is in sky blue and I thought this
would<00:02:26.629> be<00:02:26.659> really<00:02:27.019> pretty<00:02:27.230> too<00:02:29.530> why<00:02:30.530> my<00:02:30.769> eyes

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.739 
would be really pretty too why my eyes
and<00:02:31.430> then<00:02:31.639> she's<00:02:31.849> like<00:02:31.969> a<00:02:32.030> black<00:02:32.450> liner

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:32.749 
and then she's like a black liner

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:36.629 
and then she's like a black liner
underneath<00:02:33.079> it<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:35.269> that's<00:02:35.450> how<00:02:35.599> that<00:02:35.659> looks

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
underneath it so that's how that looks

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.190 
underneath it so that's how that looks
it's<00:02:37.639> showing<00:02:37.939> that<00:02:37.969> green<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.629> camera<00:02:39.019> but

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
it's showing that green on camera but

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.420 
it's showing that green on camera but
it's<00:02:39.409> like<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.709> really<00:02:40.280> light<00:02:40.549> style<00:02:40.969> food<00:02:42.430> so

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
it's like a really light style food so

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.429 
it's like a really light style food so
that's<00:02:43.639> that<00:02:43.879> one<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.659> one<00:02:44.719> I<00:02:45.019> really<00:02:45.290> like
