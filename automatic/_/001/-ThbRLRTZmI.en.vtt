00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.400
 This is how I say, the band is harmonious. 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.860
 We really want to play in this final. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.200
 Everyone is good. 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.300
 We are a very young team. 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.880
 As the name says: Juventus, Juventud (youth), Juventus. 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.080
 Come, I'll show you something. 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.260
 Here's Buffon and Pirlo! 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.520
 What are you doing with this tablet? 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.320
 Buffon has applications that are special, do fote and count late. 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.020
 He says Buffon has an application that takes a photo and calculates the age of a person. 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.580
 Look, we'll do one thing. 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.080
 It is true! He says you're 5 million years old! 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.940
 What a hen, 5 million! Buffoni, sroni, pasta ... 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.260
 You exaggerated, Buffon. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.000
 In fact, we have not been so young before, and now we are not so old. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.900
 We can say that our team has extensive experience. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.900
 We've been training to the max in recent weeks. 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.680
 We give everything. 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.200
 We give our max to the final of the Champions League. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.820
 Because you know, it's the final and you have to win it. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.300
 But you have to go match after match ... 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.280
 That the next match is already the final? 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.820
 I did not know that. 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.040
 At the final! 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.780
 We want to be the champions of Europe. 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.720
 We will win! 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.800
 We want the Champions League 2025. 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.480
 How 2025? After all, the final is on Saturday. 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.540
 No! On Saturday, Messi will play! Nothing for us. 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.000
 We are preparing for the final in 2025. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.600
 2025 ?! 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.160
 Relax, we're still young. 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.940
 So we have to go after the match until 2025, because it's hard for them to do it right away. 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.800
 Amiga Morata, he's got me to the market. Belissima! 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.500
 Let's go to Morata while we're in the promotion. 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.360
 So what was this Mussolini? Did you say high or low? He liked spaghetti?
