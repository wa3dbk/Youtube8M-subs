00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.560
 copyright garden just five years for such 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.949
 relatively short term desert 15 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.570
 acres 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.400
 unique works were transformed 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.859
 design art 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.260
 landlord Vladimir has long been fascinated 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.539
 landscape design and made everything your 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.519
 hands garden divided into zones 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.099
 islets that connect similar 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.320
 plant structures to me and another lawn on 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.059
 its background plants are grouped in 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.390
 single composition look especially 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.969
 effectively in the center of the garden is a pond 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 it is decorated with different plants and is surrounded 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.270
 small retaining wall 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.219
 but this is one of the first things that happened 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.230
 plot made mean here was 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.899
 big pile of trash we decided and first 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.649
 removed removed understood that something needed 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.870
 such a central you were digging a pit 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.410
 the proceeds this three levels of steps along 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.520
 45 centimeters and laid out the film dug 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.850
 this technology is msi 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.220
 sand sifted it compacted laid 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.990
 the film was taken up with water and the question became how 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.110
 to decorate it to not see 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.049
 it was then prompted us a year you can with 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.310
 stone well granite it's ugly I'm 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.820
 wanted something more openly here we are 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.530
 chose limestone and steel slowly 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.060
 landscaping which 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.700
 around the pond 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.520
 all summer gentle blossom is active here 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.180
 multi-colored water lilies planted around 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.850
 plant 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.649
 different flowering period including conifers 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.649
 which look particularly decorative 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.679
 in winter the following large areas 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.720
 performed slightly by other technologies 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.600
 lay out decorative granite around 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.000
 pond grow weeping birch hydrangea 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.009
 his spherical barberry is here 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.310
 supported the same concept that in 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.780
 succeeding each other almost 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.369
 year-round bloom make a pond 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.630
 do it yourself is not as difficult as it seems 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.970
 at first sight 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.819
 the main desire and patience and of course 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.039
 knowledge of technology is usually 2 3 steps 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.610
 do with steps up to 45 centimeters 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.250
 50 then at 45 tilt another one 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.500
 step and so three steps then the steering wheel 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.690
 all manually selected small bast 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.519
 top slides all that is then 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.180
 on top of the wet sand rubbed like 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.920
 plastering sleep and put specially 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.160
 film for ponds but better from german 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.480
 which they have 30 years warranty 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.890
 you fill up with water you bring 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.200
 big pond and two days of people 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.329
 filled with pond and decorative 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.690
 any contour can pond do it but 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.670
 you have on our garden all the ponds they are all in 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.920
 different style made between ponds 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.209
 the rose garden is located it is divided by color 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.359
 buds into three sectors 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.420
 they are divided by the lawn by their paths rose 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.010
 surrounded by all sorts of cereals and 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.319
 my ground cover plants beyond capricious 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.480
 flowers need meticulous care is important 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.230
 process and spray for diseases and 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.299
 pests 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.930
 offered care different roses who 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.010
 someone offered to fill them with chips 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.319
 We mumble in the winter of course 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.780
 Mulch is mandatory so that the rose does not 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.120
 froze but not cover why me 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.569
 like these varieties that it is from the category 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.500
 floribunda or spina well because i 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.769
 hybrid tea which leads the frame 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.940
 closes aerate and say efficiency 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.190
 in the spring you can get 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.170
 it is not clear that hemp and these roses 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.170
 whimsical they bloom from the earliest 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.000
 spring before frost even the first light 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.870
 they survive the cold 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.819
 little secret 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.760
 under the corner should bury fish 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.280
 bones phosphorus is very useful for flowers 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.769
 by the way it is useful to put it under the roots of an apple tree 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.760
 iron cans in a rose garden planted and 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.920
 standard roses 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.900
 They differ from ordinary ones in color 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.950
 twice a season 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.920
 Vladimir and developed his way 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.879
 storing this tender plant in their winter 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.819
 we dug dug into the ground under 90 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.340
 degrees and covered up and spruce branches and 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.760
 when we didnâ€™t survive in spring, we understood 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.799
 what should I do in the garden should be beautiful 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.510
 look any time of the year in winter and 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.120
 In the summer this plays a big role 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.620
 coniferous vladimir organized on his 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.290
 plot such a personal green island 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.970
 there are a lot of hvoynik that from different 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.289
 varieties 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:21.959
 yellow green pyramid also 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:26.220
 blue flat tree golden tree sedum 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.810
 Autumn and and then a little bit decorated to 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.160
 the end of here it is necessary to impose and I will have 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.010
 such an island on 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.880
 elevations this is a further perspective 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.820
 back can see the whole garden 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.280
 which is like any of our Russian 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.020
 person is present on which and 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.250
 raspberry if strawberry is small 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.430
 quantity is also all 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.810
 greens began to live for the proud and state 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.610
 its not to grow it probably 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.190
 a bit trite 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.280
 all retaining walls on the site are made 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.229
 of limestone which is planted cement in 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.599
 the uniform style is maintained and 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.370
 material limestone and granite granite 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.030
 because it is less destroyed by 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.830
 humidity 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.930
 and limestone has a certain 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.910
 altitude y also if we have such 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.430
 I liked the big table by the fireplace 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.500
 my brought installed at 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.080
 metal welded construction and 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.210
 turned out a table mushroom here for 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.530
 in the morning when roses are fragrant 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.849
 good weather is very good to drink coffee 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.349
 the main criterion successfully executed 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.260
 landscape design 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.389
 beauty care and functionality design 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.970
 do it yourself almost everybody 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:33.979
 this process is creative and laborious not 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.979
 enduring haste and thoughtlessly sti
