00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.499 
think people would be piping up a lot
more<00:01:43.619> than<00:01:43.740> years<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.280> he<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.119> playing<00:01:45.360> in

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
more than years but he is playing in

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.940 
more than years but he is playing in
this<00:01:45.630> slightly<00:01:45.869> weaker<00:01:46.200> French<00:01:46.439> league<00:01:46.680> he's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
this slightly weaker French league he's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.700 
this slightly weaker French league he's
had<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.820> few<00:01:48.060> injury<00:01:48.420> problems<00:01:48.630> issues<00:01:48.930> mr.<00:01:49.409> few

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
had a few injury problems issues mr. few

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.770 
had a few injury problems issues mr. few
games<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.430> he<00:01:50.640> still<00:01:50.880> got<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> little<00:01:51.299> spark<00:01:51.689> of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
games but he still got a little spark of

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
games but he still got a little spark of
magic<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> middle<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.100> PSG<00:01:53.670> really

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
magic in the middle and the PSG really

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.899 
magic in the middle and the PSG really
rely<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.649> them<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.460> I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
rely on that to get them going so I

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.209 
rely on that to get them going so I
think<00:01:57.090> they<00:01:57.420> might<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.840> able<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.990> score<00:01:58.259> but

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
think they might be able to score but

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.039 
think they might be able to score but
