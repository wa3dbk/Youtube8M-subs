00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
upgrading the processors in the graphics

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.130 
upgrading the processors in the graphics
cards<00:01:17.310> they<00:01:17.400> also<00:01:17.580> added<00:01:17.850> bigger<00:01:18.180> hard<00:01:18.840> drives

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
cards they also added bigger hard drives

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.800 
cards they also added bigger hard drives
to<00:01:19.350> both<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.130> actually<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.580> three<00:01:20.850> they<00:01:21.540> added

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
to both to actually all three they added

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
to both to actually all three they added
a<00:01:22.340> 320<00:01:23.340> gigabyte<00:01:23.970> hard<00:01:24.180> drive<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.759> 13<00:01:26.759> inch

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
a 320 gigabyte hard drive to the 13 inch

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.410 
a 320 gigabyte hard drive to the 13 inch
and<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.450> 500<00:01:28.290> gigabytes<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.729> 15<00:01:30.240> inch

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and up to 500 gigabytes in the 15 inch

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.890 
and up to 500 gigabytes in the 15 inch
and<00:01:30.630> 17<00:01:31.320> inch<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:32.759> apple<00:01:33.180> also<00:01:33.360> sort<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and 17 inch and apple also sort of

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.929 
and 17 inch and apple also sort of
mainly<00:01:34.290> focused<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> 15<00:01:35.460> inch<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
mainly focused on the 15 inch here I

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.179 
mainly focused on the 15 inch here I
think<00:01:36.119> because<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.470> look<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> store

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
think because if you look at the store

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
think because if you look at the store
they<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.700> three<00:01:39.060> base<00:01:39.390> versions<00:01:39.960> of

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
they have like three base versions of

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.920 
they have like three base versions of
the<00:01:40.200> 15-inch<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.220> choose<00:01:41.790> between<00:01:42.210> two

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the 15-inch you can choose between two

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.899 
the 15-inch you can choose between two
versions<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> 13-inch<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.460> version<00:01:44.850> of

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
versions of the 13-inch one version of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
versions of the 13-inch one version of
the<00:01:45.000> 17th<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> think<00:01:46.619> they're<00:01:46.860> really

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the 17th so I think they're really

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.190 
the 17th so I think they're really
targeting<00:01:47.549> people<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.970> go<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.600> 15<00:01:49.049> inch

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
targeting people to go for that 15 inch

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.980 
targeting people to go for that 15 inch
version<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.479> but<00:01:51.479> again<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
version if they can but again I have a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.200 
version if they can but again I have a
13-inch<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.740> think<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.250> works<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.640> fine<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
13-inch I think it works just fine and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.719 
13-inch I think it works just fine and
again<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.990> get<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.320> 2.66<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.520> probably

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
again if you get that 2.66 it's probably

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.719 
again if you get that 2.66 it's probably
going<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:56.969> very<00:01:57.479> good<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.250> addition<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
going to be very good now in addition to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.170 
going to be very good now in addition to
the<00:02:00.320> hardware<00:02:01.320> upgrades<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.850> hard

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the hardware upgrades with the hard

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.149 
the hardware upgrades with the hard
drive<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.689> process<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> graphics<00:02:04.860> card

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
drive the process of the graphics card

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.789 
drive the process of the graphics card
apple<00:02:05.909> also<00:02:06.090> extended<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> battery<00:02:07.350> life<00:02:07.560> of

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
