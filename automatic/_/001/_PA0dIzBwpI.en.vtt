in the 1956 state championship game

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.010 
in the 1956 state championship game
where<00:01:36.030> Corpus<00:01:37.030> Christi<00:01:37.390> was<00:01:37.540> getting<00:01:37.870> ready

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
to score on us and and we held him on

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.469 
to score on us and and we held him on
the<00:01:41.260> goal<00:01:41.470> line<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:42.100> Jimmy<00:01:42.400> Carter<00:01:42.580> went<00:01:42.970> 94

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.969 
the goal line and Jimmy Carter went 94
yards<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.200> was<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.380> very<00:01:44.590> similar<00:01:44.830> situation

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979
