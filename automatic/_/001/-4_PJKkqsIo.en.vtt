00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.740
 good friends of u2 today we are going to learn 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:13.630
 to make a water pressure gun 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:13.630
 for this we are going to use 234 cubits 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.740
 two unions sought 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.620
 two 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:30.060
 two faces with cash 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.060
 in your respective cup 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.329
 and this 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:42.239
 the last couplet of this story water 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.920
 for pressure to wash motorcycle cars like this 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.770
 that we look 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.010
 and the figure 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.519
 and a form appears 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.180
 how is how to bat the gun to 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.550
 pressure likewise we're going to need you 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.449
 can be ordered to make the respective 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:06.399
 joints and glue equally well 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.340
 we're going to need a rubber that 's in 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.640
 the layers of soda 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.570
 and a jar 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.150
 any of this larger size 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:23.360
 we will use the same jar 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:28.750
 to indicate it at the top of 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.320
 the gun developed its moment located 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.450
 now the form 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.190
 of tank 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.590
 depression will then be driven by 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.040
 the gun barrel and this is a 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.040
 stopcock 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.970
 the connector 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.970
 for the way of water 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.119
 same what is the function of capital 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.489
 the water will come through here with the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.209
 pressure hose will collect all the 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.209
 channel all this sector here will come up 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.269
 here they will not go up that will have pressures in 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.860
 the tank once there is enough 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:27.480
 weight in the tank let's admire the key to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.690
 and this heel and the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.670
 half a year that will be this that later 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.790
 we can see the army 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.270
 similarly this plug will lead to 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.400
 equipment hole be all difficult 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.310
 one as created the pressure depending 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.910
 how we want the pressure 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.630
 here we can see the way and how it's going to 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.310
 stay 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.310
 the history of the water operation 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.350
 look at it well preserved 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:08.230
 I repeat what we need, we are going to 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:13.140
 need to join the 34 average payments to 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.970
 an adapter for water hose 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.900
 a screw the with its respective 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.510
 pitcher another screw with its respective 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.000
 adapter 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.560
 and this is going to be for the most 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.640
 forward let's explain how to insert 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.989
 the tank inside the altar so that it does not 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.989
 there are water leaks 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.880
 a t that is not normal thread 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:54.250
 and is with the little bit so that 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.170
 spill the water that we are going to apply it 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.580
 inside of the jar so it does not 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.380
 spilled the water 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.450
 and of course he lamented 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.520
 this is going to be the first part and 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.960
 then we will see the second part of how 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.960
 let's hit as good
