00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.990
 good afternoon first thank you 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.960
 to come and dedicate this time that you 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.170
 we have asked for and good the presentation of 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.660
 a calendar that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.500
 totally solidary and beneficial for a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 association of Seville that consists of 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.360
 raise food and funds for people 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.980
 very needy who is spending it 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.140
 Frankly bad is a social dining room 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.790
 and good they proposed me the idea 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.820
 We try to get to 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.950
 to do it because to me the truth that has 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.580
 it cost quite a lot to do it because it's a 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.430
 calendar where I never had 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.110
 reflected 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.090
 they do this to me for a long time 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.910
 propose long ago and really not what 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.310
 I would have done 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.500
 I think sometimes you have to try 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.370
 collaborate even if one of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.680
 of that opinion and nothing nothing but many 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.830
 thank you the per-store is going to be at 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.830
 sale 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.830
 and well so between all of us we are a little 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.730
 solidary 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.100
 sorry 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.430
 session bomb a selection as I have 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.400
 said that it is a 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.690
 try to raise funds and food 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.510
 for families that 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.440
 good that they are having a bad time 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.440
 five euros 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:36.230
 It is very complete very nice and good and I 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.230
 They have taken out in smaller cloths 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.409
 that's why more 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.330
 It has cost me a lot because that 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.980
 be with the live 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.980
 and go out and give them 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.440
 July July and July are the months of most 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.440
 heat and that's why I have less clothes 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.710
 First February is something very warm 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.220
 well I'm fine, we have not taken a step 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.220
 back the truth that I do not have in discomfort 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.890
 we are little by little today we have started 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.760
 with the ball and well I'm 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.760
 finding very good 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.560
 well I think I do not think the idea of 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.990
 coach is not to enter this end of 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.990
 week and good is the boss 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.390
 if it's the next one I think if everything 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.390
 it's normal I'll be 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.500
 man is the coach who commands but 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:49.490
 we have these centers right now 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.450
 cigars me Pablo and I think that central 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.450
 it would be welcome 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.409
 well I think I know more than me 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.700
 you know how it is you know how competitive 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:06.329
 he knows the kind of player he is 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.329
 It seems a good deal 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.220
 but not 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.350
 good is Pablo Pablo established 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.560
 we would also be 42 more older and two 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.560
 younger 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.430
 man talks to me very well about the guys 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.810
 that are coming as is not logical what 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.870
 I'm seeing trained because no no 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.780
 I'm with them but hey come on guys 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.489
 young people who contribute football that contributes 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.730
 speed that always welcome a 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.730
 team 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.440
 no no, they have not told me that they have a lot 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.330
 talent that is a player that despite 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.910
 to be very young because he has already been seen 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.430
 a lot of detail and I start very well with 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.650
 the team but how good is that 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.930
 who is young and that you have to 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.180
 Pamper him very much take care of him so that 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.790
 so as not to give all the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.989
 responsibility a team but go 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.989
 growing together with the team 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
 all right
