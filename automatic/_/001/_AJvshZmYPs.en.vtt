Channel when I'm gonna be having a look
at<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:03.990> video<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.560> way<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.830> multiplying

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.180 
at in this video is a way of multiplying

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.880 
at in this video is a way of multiplying
using<00:00:06.180> lines<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.720> get<00:00:06.870> our<00:00:06.990> answer<00:00:07.170> it's<00:00:07.830> an

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
using lines to get our answer it's an

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.200 
using lines to get our answer it's an
interesting<00:00:08.189> little<00:00:08.460> method<00:00:08.849> I'll<00:00:08.940> show<00:00:09.120> you

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
interesting little method I'll show you

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.919 
interesting little method I'll show you
how<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.480> works

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
how it works

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.680 
how it works
you<00:00:10.170> an<00:00:10.380> example<00:00:10.710> are<00:00:11.480> 12<00:00:12.650> times<00:00:14.179> 13<00:00:15.179> now<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
you an example are 12 times 13 now the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.920 
you an example are 12 times 13 now the
way<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.020> do<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:16.680> draw<00:00:16.890> diagonal<00:00:17.400> lines

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
way we do this is we draw diagonal lines

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.330 
way we do this is we draw diagonal lines
running<00:00:18.930> from<00:00:19.199> left<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.470> right<00:00:19.710> but<00:00:20.010> going

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
running from left to right but going

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.310 
running from left to right but going
diagonally<00:00:21.000> you'll<00:00:21.510> see<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.840> mean<00:00:21.869> so

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
diagonally you'll see what I mean so

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.620 
diagonally you'll see what I mean so
here<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.130> go<00:00:23.310> 12<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.939> draw<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.380> one<00:00:26.449> and<00:00:27.449> A<00:00:27.599> two

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
here we go 12 I draw is one and A two

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:37.310 
here we go 12 I draw is one and A two
and<00:00:28.519> 13<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.760> draw<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:31.219> 1<00:00:32.239> 1<00:00:33.239> 2<00:00:34.050> 3<00:00:35.059> ok<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.290> I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and 13 I draw as 1 1 2 3 ok and what I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
and 13 I draw as 1 1 2 3 ok and what I
do<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.829> separate<00:00:38.370> these<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.820> into<00:00:39.210> where<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
do is I separate these up into where the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.990 
do is I separate these up into where the
units<00:00:42.440> collide<00:00:43.440> together<00:00:43.710> where<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> tens

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
units collide together where the tens

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.540 
units collide together where the tens
and<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> units<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:46.590> these<00:00:46.860> Clyde<00:00:47.160> together

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and the units of these Clyde together

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459 
and the units of these Clyde together
and<00:00:47.820> where<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> tens<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.750> tens<00:00:49.079> card

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and where the tens and tens card

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590 
and where the tens and tens card
together<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.489> you'll<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.300> how

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
together so what you'll see here is how

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600 
together so what you'll see here is how
many<00:00:51.780> intersections<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.370> 1

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
many intersections do we have we have 1

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.150 
many intersections do we have we have 1
2<00:00:53.879> 3<00:00:53.910> 4<00:00:54.480> 5<00:00:55.079> 6<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> unit's<00:00:56.120> we<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.329> 1<00:00:57.719> 2<00:00:58.079> 3<00:00:58.680> 4

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
2 3 4 5 6 in the unit's we have 1 2 3 4

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.660 
2 3 4 5 6 in the unit's we have 1 2 3 4
5<00:00:59.840> in<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.050> part<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> tens<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
5 in that part in the tens and in the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.359 
5 in that part in the tens and in the
hundreds<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> 1<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.220> that's<00:01:05.220> here

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
hundreds we have a 1 and that's here

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.179 
hundreds we have a 1 and that's here
it's<00:01:05.460> 156<00:01:06.470> ok<00:01:07.470> that's<00:01:07.650> pretty<00:01:07.799> easy<00:01:07.920> right

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
it's 156 ok that's pretty easy right

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
it's 156 ok that's pretty easy right
I'll<00:01:08.670> tell<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.939> what<00:01:09.090> I'll<00:01:09.720> put<00:01:10.200> another<00:01:10.380> one

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
I'll tell you what I'll put another one

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.350 
I'll tell you what I'll put another one
up<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.070> see<00:01:11.610> how<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.880> go<00:01:12.119> with<00:01:12.150> this

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
up there and see how you go with this

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.480 
up there and see how you go with this
you<00:01:12.540> might<00:01:12.689> might<00:01:13.530> give<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.220> pause

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
you might might give this one a go pause

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.270 
you might might give this one a go pause
it<00:01:14.700> before<00:01:15.000> maybe<00:01:15.350> just<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.650> asked<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it before maybe just as I asked the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.800 
it before maybe just as I asked the
question<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.820> then<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.570> go

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
question and then see here you can go

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.490 
question and then see here you can go
with<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.939> here<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:20.970> go<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.990> question<00:01:22.170> I'll

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
with it so here we go the question I'll

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.469 
with it so here we go the question I'll
ask<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.810> 14<00:01:24.810> times<00:01:25.409> 12<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:26.970> might<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
ask is 14 times 12 so you might want to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.920 
ask is 14 times 12 so you might want to
pause<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.829> go<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:30.869> I

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
pause that see here you go but the way I

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.219 
pause that see here you go but the way I
work<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.250> go<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:34.079> 1<00:01:34.350> 1<00:01:35.070> 2<00:01:35.790> 3<00:01:36.229> 4

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
work this out is this I go so 1 1 2 3 4

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.929 
work this out is this I go so 1 1 2 3 4
4<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.590> 14<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.369> 12<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:39.270> 1<00:01:39.890> 1<00:01:41.240> 2<00:01:42.439> okay<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:43.799> I

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
4 the 14 and 12 is 1 1 2 okay so then I

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.210 
4 the 14 and 12 is 1 1 2 okay so then I
separate<00:01:44.939> these<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.810> end<00:01:48.990> up

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
separate these up and so we end up

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.550 
separate these up and so we end up
getting<00:01:50.220> our<00:01:50.430> units<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.090> tens<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.020> hundreds

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
getting our units here tens and hundreds

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.490 
getting our units here tens and hundreds
and<00:01:52.740> how<00:01:53.340> many<00:01:53.549> intersections<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.780> 1<00:01:54.990> 2<00:01:55.259> 3

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and how many intersections we have 1 2 3

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.899 
and how many intersections we have 1 2 3
4<00:01:55.860> 5<00:01:56.130> 6<00:01:56.490> 7<00:01:56.670> 8<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:58.189> 1<00:01:59.189> 2<00:01:59.430> 3<00:01:59.729> 4<00:02:00.119> 5<00:02:00.780> 6<00:02:01.170> 6<00:02:02.100> there<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
4 5 6 7 8 there 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 there and

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.880 
4 5 6 7 8 there 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 there and
one<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:05.280> answer<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.750> 168<00:02:06.890> pretty

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
one there so the answer is 168 pretty

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.389 
one there so the answer is 168 pretty
cool<00:02:08.039> right

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
cool right

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.990 
cool right
alright<00:02:08.759> let's<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.209> our<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.840> different<00:02:10.770> one

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
alright let's go our a different one

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.300 
alright let's go our a different one
what<00:02:12.000> about<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.390> are<00:02:12.569> get<00:02:13.110> one<00:02:13.260> where<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:13.590> have

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
what about we are get one where we have

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.550 
what about we are get one where we have
a<00:02:14.340> bit<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.879> reminder<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:16.110> how<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.319> deal

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
a bit of a reminder and how you deal

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.930 
a bit of a reminder and how you deal
with<00:02:16.590> those<00:02:16.770> it's<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.370> very<00:02:17.400> similar<00:02:17.819> to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
with those it's it's very similar to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.820 
with those it's it's very similar to
actually<00:02:18.330> normal<00:02:18.780> are<00:02:18.959> normally<00:02:19.500> how<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.650> do

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
actually normal are normally how you do

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.080 
actually normal are normally how you do
with<00:02:19.920> remainders<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.580> carry<00:02:20.819> things

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
with remainders you just carry things

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.839 
with remainders you just carry things
across<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.620> might<00:02:23.220> put<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> different<00:02:23.640> color

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
across so I might put a different color

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.850 
across so I might put a different color
up<00:02:24.150> okay<00:02:24.360> I'll<00:02:24.480> get<00:02:24.569> excited<00:02:25.020> here<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.379> what

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
up okay I'll get excited here so what

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.040 
up okay I'll get excited here so what
about<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.160> do<00:02:26.280> 14<00:02:27.030> times<00:02:28.459> 13<00:02:29.599> so<00:02:30.599> we<00:02:30.720> draw<00:02:30.900> this

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
about we do 14 times 13 so we draw this

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.809 
about we do 14 times 13 so we draw this
as<00:02:31.489> 1<00:02:32.489> 1<00:02:33.450> 2<00:02:34.170> 3<00:02:35.629> 4<00:02:36.629> almost<00:02:37.379> got<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.709> one<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.129> we

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
as 1 1 2 3 4 almost got that one and we

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:46.640 
as 1 1 2 3 4 almost got that one and we
do<00:02:39.030> our<00:02:39.269> 13<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.230> 1<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.730> 1<00:02:42.390> 2<00:02:43.670> 3<00:02:45.050> okay<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.349> let's

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
do our 13 so 1 and 1 2 3 okay so let's

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.850 
do our 13 so 1 and 1 2 3 okay so let's
see<00:02:46.890> how<00:02:47.099> we<00:02:47.160> go<00:02:47.400> with<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:48.349> this<00:02:49.349> color<00:02:49.590> now

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
see how we go with this this color now

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.990 
see how we go with this this color now
and<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.300> units<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:52.310> will<00:02:53.310> be<00:02:53.430> our<00:02:53.580> tens

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
and for the units that will be our tens

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.759 
and for the units that will be our tens
answers<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.989> this<00:02:55.170> will<00:02:55.349> be<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> hundred

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
answers here and this will be a hundred

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.850 
it's pretty cool method right I really
really<00:04:24.360> like<00:04:24.509> this<00:04:24.630> one<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:24.870> let's<00:04:25.650> have<00:04:25.800> a

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
really like this one so let's have a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.670 
really like this one so let's have a
look<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.569> the<00:04:27.569> question<00:04:28.020> I'm<00:04:28.110> going<00:04:28.319> to<00:04:28.440> ask

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
look and the question I'm going to ask

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.980 
look and the question I'm going to ask
now<00:04:29.250> what<00:04:30.000> about<00:04:30.120> our<00:04:30.509> bigger<00:04:31.080> number<00:04:31.550> 211

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
now what about our bigger number 211

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.320 
now what about our bigger number 211
times<00:04:34.400> fourteen<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.669> we'll<00:04:35.789> see<00:04:36.030> what<00:04:36.180> that

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
times fourteen and we'll see what that

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.800 
times fourteen and we'll see what that
equals

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
equals

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.839 
equals
so<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.590> way<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:37.710> do<00:04:37.860> it<00:04:37.949> left<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.430> right<00:04:38.460> that's

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
so the way I do it left to right that's

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:50.710 
so the way I do it left to right that's
211<00:04:39.690> one<00:04:39.919> two<00:04:40.919> and<00:04:41.280> 11<00:04:42.210> 1<00:04:42.479> 1<00:04:43.490> times<00:04:44.490> 14<00:04:44.970> 1<00:04:45.470> 1<00:04:46.819> 2<00:04:47.819> 3

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.260 

4<00:04:51.860> ok<00:04:52.860> this<00:04:53.669> one<00:04:53.819> you're<00:04:53.909> gonna<00:04:53.970> be<00:04:54.120> a<00:04:54.180> little

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
4 ok this one you're gonna be a little

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.760 
4 ok this one you're gonna be a little
bit<00:04:54.449> more<00:04:54.569> careful<00:04:54.960> separating<00:04:55.530> up<00:04:55.650> we're

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
bit more careful separating up we're

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.510 
bit more careful separating up we're
gonna<00:04:55.860> have<00:04:55.949> these<00:04:56.400> ones<00:04:56.759> here<00:04:57.289> these<00:04:58.520> ones

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
gonna have these ones here these ones

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.890 
gonna have these ones here these ones
yeah<00:05:00.080> these<00:05:01.190> ones<00:05:02.190> here<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:02.819> these<00:05:03.449> ones<00:05:03.720> here

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
yeah these ones here and these ones here

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.620 
yeah these ones here and these ones here
ok<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:04.830> let's<00:05:05.280> see<00:05:05.460> how<00:05:06.030> many<00:05:06.120> intersections

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
ok so let's see how many intersections

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.059 
ok so let's see how many intersections
we<00:05:06.930> have<00:05:07.050> we<00:05:07.229> have<00:05:07.349> 1<00:05:07.620> 2<00:05:08.039> 3<00:05:08.069> 4<00:05:10.099> we<00:05:11.099> have<00:05:11.340> 1<00:05:11.759> 2<00:05:12.539> 3<00:05:12.569> 4

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
very similar one to that sort of you

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.290 
very similar one to that sort of you
know<00:05:37.320> a<00:05:37.409> 2<00:05:37.770> 3<00:05:38.039> digit<00:05:38.340> number<00:05:38.370> type<00:05:38.849> thing

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
know a 2 3 digit number type thing

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:46.730 
know a 2 3 digit number type thing
what<00:05:39.630> about<00:05:41.090> 212<00:05:42.320> times<00:05:43.320> 13<00:05:45.259> okay<00:05:46.259> pause<00:05:46.500> it

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
what about 212 times 13 okay pause it

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.499 
what about 212 times 13 okay pause it
you<00:05:46.889> ready<00:05:47.070> go<00:05:48.169> all<00:05:49.169> right<00:05:49.469> heads<00:05:49.770> you<00:05:49.949> go

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
you ready go all right heads you go

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.029 
you ready go all right heads you go
let's<00:05:51.509> see<00:05:51.840> well<00:05:52.080> now<00:05:52.349> you<00:05:52.680> should<00:05:52.830> have<00:05:52.860> gone

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
let's see well now you should have gone

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.779 
let's see well now you should have gone
one<00:05:53.370> two<00:05:53.759> and<00:05:54.270> then<00:05:54.780> one<00:05:55.020> and<00:05:55.319> then<00:05:56.130> two<00:05:56.460> and

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
one two and then one and then two and

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:03.230 
one two and then one and then two and
then<00:05:57.479> 13<00:05:58.050> one<00:05:58.500> one<00:05:59.509> two<00:06:00.949> three<00:06:01.949> and<00:06:02.280> then<00:06:03.000> we'll

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
then 13 one one two three and then we'll

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.149 
then 13 one one two three and then we'll
separate<00:06:03.900> these<00:06:04.229> up<00:06:04.620> so<00:06:05.039> this<00:06:05.819> ones<00:06:07.159> these

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
separate these up so this ones these

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:12.589 
separate these up so this ones these
ones<00:06:09.289> these<00:06:10.289> ones<00:06:10.349> and<00:06:11.340> these<00:06:11.400> ones<00:06:11.909> and<00:06:12.479> that

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
ones these ones and these ones and that

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.950 
ones these ones and these ones and that
answer<00:06:13.310> is<00:06:14.310> as<00:06:14.520> follows<00:06:14.880> we<00:06:15.060> have<00:06:15.240> one<00:06:15.539> two

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
answer is as follows we have one two

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.920 
answer is as follows we have one two
three<00:06:15.990> four<00:06:16.740> five<00:06:17.069> six<00:06:17.400> in<00:06:17.639> the<00:06:17.729> unit's<00:06:18.030> we

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
three four five six in the unit's we

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.439 
three four five six in the unit's we
have<00:06:19.020> 1<00:06:19.229> 2<00:06:19.500> 3<00:06:19.530> 4<00:06:20.219> 5<00:06:21.030> in<00:06:21.509> the<00:06:22.020> tens<00:06:22.259> we<00:06:23.099> have<00:06:23.310> 1<00:06:23.729> 2<00:06:24.419> 3

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
have 1 2 3 4 5 in the tens we have 1 2 3

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.520 
have 1 2 3 4 5 in the tens we have 1 2 3
4<00:06:24.810> 5<00:06:25.319> 6<00:06:25.620> 7<00:06:26.039> in<00:06:26.430> the<00:06:26.610> hundredths<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.199> 1/2<00:06:28.490> in

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
4 5 6 7 in the hundredths and 1/2 in

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.140 
4 5 6 7 in the hundredths and 1/2 in
the<00:06:31.370> thousands<00:06:32.090> so<00:06:32.950> 2756<00:06:33.950> that's<00:06:34.880> a<00:06:34.970> pretty

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
the thousands so 2756 that's a pretty

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.990 
the thousands so 2756 that's a pretty
cool<00:06:35.360> method<00:06:35.690> right<00:06:36.190> the<00:06:37.190> only<00:06:37.370> limitation<00:06:37.940> I

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
cool method right the only limitation I

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.970 
cool method right the only limitation I
can<00:06:38.150> really<00:06:38.450> think<00:06:38.600> with<00:06:38.780> this<00:06:38.900> method<00:06:39.290> I<00:06:39.440> can

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
can really think with this method I can

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.440 
can really think with this method I can
get<00:06:40.160> a<00:06:40.190> little<00:06:40.340> bit<00:06:40.490> difficult<00:06:40.700> occasionally

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
get a little bit difficult occasionally

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.790 
get a little bit difficult occasionally
to<00:06:41.540> line<00:06:41.720> things<00:06:41.990> up<00:06:42.200> you<00:06:42.380> got<00:06:42.500> to<00:06:42.560> be<00:06:42.650> a<00:06:42.680> bit

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
to line things up you got to be a bit

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.350 
to line things up you got to be a bit
careful<00:06:42.950> that<00:06:43.250> and<00:06:43.430> also<00:06:43.670> when<00:06:43.880> you<00:06:44.000> start<00:06:44.270> to

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
careful that and also when you start to

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.110 
careful that and also when you start to
get<00:06:44.480> ridiculously<00:06:45.290> big<00:06:45.590> numbers<00:06:46.010> huh<00:06:46.310> you

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
get ridiculously big numbers huh you

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.390 
get ridiculously big numbers huh you
know<00:06:47.240> like<00:06:47.480> I'm<00:06:47.840> not<00:06:47.930> talking<00:06:48.470> big<00:06:49.040> numbers<00:06:49.370> in

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
know like I'm not talking big numbers in

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.450 
know like I'm not talking big numbers in
two<00:06:50.060> million<00:06:50.450> one<00:06:50.810> hundred<00:06:50.840> and<00:06:51.290> and<00:06:51.530> you<00:06:52.400> know
