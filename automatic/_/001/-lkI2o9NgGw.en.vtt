this<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.459> giant<00:03:16.819> ECM<00:03:17.480> or<00:03:17.690> electronics

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
this is a giant ECM or electronics

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.140 
this is a giant ECM or electronics
control<00:03:18.560> module<00:03:19.099> here<00:03:19.340> basically<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.940> big

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
control module here basically a big

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.940 
control module here basically a big
computer<00:03:20.569> that<00:03:20.690> runs<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:21.019> car<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.470> those

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
computer that runs this car and those

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.860 
computer that runs this car and those
batteries<00:03:22.430> through<00:03:22.700> here<00:03:22.970> feed<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.540> electric

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
batteries through here feed the electric

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.720 
batteries through here feed the electric
motor<00:03:24.049> which<00:03:24.290> is<00:03:24.470> relatively<00:03:25.099> unimpressive

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
motor which is relatively unimpressive

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.099 
motor which is relatively unimpressive
I've<00:03:25.970> seen<00:03:26.209> them<00:03:26.329> on<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.569> stand<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.049> know

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
I've seen them on the stand you know

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.140 
I've seen them on the stand you know
it's<00:03:27.470> about<00:03:27.980> yeah<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.400> size<00:03:28.609> of<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.730> pumpkin

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
it's about yeah the size of a pumpkin

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.240 
it's about yeah the size of a pumpkin
down<00:03:29.750> there<00:03:29.959> going<00:03:30.170> into<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.470> single<00:03:30.980> speed

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
down there going into a single speed

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.819 
down there going into a single speed
gearbox<00:03:32.180> not<00:03:32.690> really<00:03:32.959> a<00:03:32.989> transmission<00:03:33.530> there

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
gearbox not really a transmission there

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.470 
gearbox not really a transmission there
are<00:03:33.920> no<00:03:34.010> gears<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.459> change<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.150> basically

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
are no gears to change but it basically

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.449 
are no gears to change but it basically
sends<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.930> power<00:03:36.079> up<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.409> two<00:03:36.620> wheels<00:03:36.890> almost

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
sends the power up to two wheels almost

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.800 
sends the power up to two wheels almost
more<00:03:37.670> of<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.180> splitter<00:03:38.599> or<00:03:38.659> a

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
more of a of a splitter or a

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.420 
more of a of a splitter or a
differential<00:03:39.349> more<00:03:39.680> than<00:03:39.829> a<00:03:40.010> real

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
differential more than a real

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.610 
differential more than a real
transmission<00:03:41.180> with<00:03:41.299> multiple<00:03:41.690> gears<00:03:41.959> the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
transmission with multiple gears the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.659 
transmission with multiple gears the
difference<00:03:42.950> on<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:43.099> sport<00:03:43.489> is<00:03:43.549> the

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
difference on the sport is the

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.150 
difference on the sport is the
horsepower<00:03:44.260> 288<00:03:45.260> horse<00:03:45.530> out<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:45.799> this<00:03:45.980> guy

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
horsepower 288 horse out of this guy

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.819 
horsepower 288 horse out of this guy
versus<00:03:46.669> 248<00:03:47.090> out<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.989> standard<00:03:48.230> roadster

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
versus 248 out of a standard roadster

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.770 
versus 248 out of a standard roadster
and<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.280> will<00:03:49.400> improve<00:03:49.639> your<00:03:49.819> 0<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.120> 60<00:03:50.510> from

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
and that will improve your 0 to 60 from

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.119 
and that will improve your 0 to 60 from
3.9<00:03:51.709> to<00:03:52.450> 3.7<00:03:53.450> seconds<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.590> more<00:03:54.769> about<00:03:54.950> that

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
3.9 to 3.7 seconds so more about that

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.970 
3.9 to 3.7 seconds so more about that
motor<00:03:55.340> 185<00:03:56.329> kilowatt<00:03:57.139> it<00:03:57.650> seems<00:03:57.829> almost

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
motor 185 kilowatt it seems almost

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.069 
motor 185 kilowatt it seems almost
impossibly<00:03:58.819> high<00:03:59.209> draw<00:03:59.599> but<00:03:59.810> that's<00:03:59.959> what

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
impossibly high draw but that's what

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:00.909 
impossibly high draw but that's what
they<00:04:00.169> say

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
they say

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.699 
they say
it<00:04:01.250> also<00:04:01.489> will<00:04:01.849> get<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.120> about<00:04:02.269> 244<00:04:03.079> miles<00:04:03.379> on

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
it also will get you about 244 miles on

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.220 
it also will get you about 244 miles on
a<00:04:03.739> charge<00:04:03.889> that<00:04:04.819> charge<00:04:05.269> can<00:04:05.629> take<00:04:05.840> as<00:04:06.019> little

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
braking and friction braking when you're

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:20.920 
braking and friction braking when you're
driving<00:04:20.060> this<00:04:20.150> car<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.510> hit<00:04:20.599> the<00:04:20.630> brakes

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
driving this car and hit the brakes

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.870 
driving this car and hit the brakes
you're<00:04:21.320> going<00:04:21.680> on<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.099> friction<00:04:22.460> brake<00:04:22.669> so

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
you're going on to the friction brake so

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.969 
you're going on to the friction brake so
they're<00:04:23.090> Brembo<00:04:23.479> units<00:04:23.780> all<00:04:23.930> around<00:04:24.199> when<00:04:24.830> you

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
they're Brembo units all around when you

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.189 
they're Brembo units all around when you
lift<00:04:25.370> off<00:04:25.729> but<00:04:26.120> don't<00:04:26.270> go<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.539> the<00:04:26.690> brakes<00:04:26.930> the

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
lift off but don't go to the brakes the

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.110 
lift off but don't go to the brakes the
car<00:04:27.229> pops<00:04:27.710> into<00:04:28.039> a<00:04:28.070> regen<00:04:28.610> mode<00:04:28.849> and<00:04:29.030> you've

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
car pops into a regen mode and you've

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.879 
car pops into a regen mode and you've
got<00:04:29.330> electric<00:04:29.900> drag<00:04:30.199> that<00:04:30.530> is<00:04:30.650> running

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
got electric drag that is running

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.379 
got electric drag that is running
through<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.340> motor<00:04:31.639> backwards<00:04:32.150> to

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
through the motor backwards to

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.689 
through the motor backwards to
regenerate<00:04:32.990> power<00:04:33.320> so<00:04:33.949> it's<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.220> synthetic

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
regenerate power so it's a synthetic

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.760 
regenerate power so it's a synthetic
compression<00:04:35.510> braking<00:04:36.020> that's<00:04:36.229> really

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
compression braking that's really

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.980 
compression braking that's really
convincing<00:04:37.280> this<00:04:37.430> car<00:04:37.639> really<00:04:37.789> goes<00:04:38.030> when<00:04:38.870> you

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
convincing this car really goes when you

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.510 
convincing this car really goes when you
lift<00:04:39.229> off<00:04:39.470> even<00:04:39.949> before<00:04:40.039> you<00:04:40.280> hit<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.430> brakes

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
lift off even before you hit the brakes

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.430 
lift off even before you hit the brakes
