big storm this is the storm that knocked

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.940 
big storm this is the storm that knocked
out<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.330> power<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.050> world's<00:02:38.770> most

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
out the power in the world's most

out the power in the world's most
influential<00:02:39.580> city<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.680> there's<00:02:41.680> nothing<00:02:41.830> to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
influential city and there's nothing to

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.120 
influential city and there's nothing to
do<00:02:42.220> about<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:44.050> bigger<00:02:44.710> than<00:02:44.830> we<00:02:45.100> are

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
do about it this is bigger than we are

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.450 
do about it this is bigger than we are
so<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.270> chance<00:02:46.720> for<00:02:47.170> us<00:02:47.860> all<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.130> pull

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
so this is a chance for us all to pull

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.420 
so this is a chance for us all to pull
together<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.170> address<00:02:50.170> climate<00:02:50.650> change<00:02:50.890> to

together and address climate change to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.430 
together and address climate change to
all<00:02:51.520> get<00:02:51.760> together<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.420> work<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.260> make

the one exception was a big El Nino so
