road this is our launch that familiar G

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.280 
road this is our launch that familiar G
it's<00:00:13.280> a<00:00:13.460> familiar<00:00:13.720> chassis<00:00:14.720> with<00:00:15.080> the

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
it's a familiar chassis with the

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.870 
it's a familiar chassis with the
untiring<00:00:15.830> bodywork

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
untiring bodywork

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.130 
untiring bodywork
it's<00:00:17.330> a<00:00:17.450> 2.5<00:00:18.290> v6<00:00:19.190> it<00:00:19.910> has<00:00:20.030> the<00:00:20.180> three<00:00:20.330> series<00:00:20.990> of

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140

it's a 2.5 v6 it has the three series of
carburetors

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.870 

I<00:00:25.840> guess<00:00:26.840> it's<00:00:27.020> around<00:00:27.160> 1962<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:28.550> problem

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
I guess it's around 1962 the problem

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.700 
I guess it's around 1962 the problem
with<00:00:28.970> these<00:00:29.090> cars<00:00:29.450> is<00:00:29.720> they're<00:00:29.869> built<00:00:30.169> as

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
with these cars is they're built as

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.589 
with these cars is they're built as
machetes<00:00:31.310> and<00:00:31.340> bodies<00:00:31.730> were<00:00:31.880> built<00:00:32.150> and<00:00:32.390> then

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
machetes and bodies were built and then

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.530 
machetes and bodies were built and then
color<00:00:33.200> sat<00:00:33.470> around<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:33.860> factory<00:00:34.300> fooled<00:00:35.300> them

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
color sat around the factory fooled them

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.180 
color sat around the factory fooled them
so<00:00:35.870> this<00:00:36.650> one<00:00:36.950> is<00:00:37.190> a<00:00:37.220> registered<00:00:38.950> I've<00:00:39.950> always

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
Ferraris this is probably the entry

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.200

level into having a Superleggera a
bodywork<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:12.619> just<00:01:12.799> completely<00:01:13.579> handbill

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
bodywork it's just completely handbill

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.590 
bodywork it's just completely handbill
nothing<00:01:15.829> is<00:01:15.979> pressed<00:01:16.399> it's<00:01:16.700> all<00:01:16.850> hand<00:01:17.149> golden

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.080 
nothing is pressed it's all hand golden
English<00:01:18.079> will<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.890> then<00:01:19.100> stretched<00:01:19.429> over

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
English will and then stretched over

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.020 
English will and then stretched over
I<00:01:20.390> cut<00:01:20.869> out<00:01:20.899> a<00:01:21.049> very<00:01:21.350> thin<00:01:21.740> steel<00:01:22.549> tubing

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
I cut out a very thin steel tubing

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.940 
I cut out a very thin steel tubing
recording<00:01:23.630> it's<00:01:24.049> actually<00:01:24.350> quite<00:01:24.560> nice<00:01:24.740> to

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
recording it's actually quite nice to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.830 
recording it's actually quite nice to
drive<00:01:25.159> down<00:01:25.460> here<00:01:25.670> blast<00:01:25.969> down<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.359> a3

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
drive down here blast down the a3

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.949 
drive down here blast down the a3
because<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:28.219> can<00:01:28.369> do<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.299> speed<00:01:29.569> limit<00:01:29.869> and

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
because you can do the speed limit and

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.639 
because you can do the speed limit and
maybe<00:01:30.909> notice<00:01:31.909> it's<00:01:32.119> really<00:01:32.179> good<00:01:32.659> it's<00:01:33.049> a<00:01:33.109> GT

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
maybe notice it's really good it's a GT

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.949 
maybe notice it's really good it's a GT
so<00:01:33.890> it's<00:01:34.039> got<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.189> design<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.270> kind<00:01:35.599> of<00:01:35.659> drive

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
so it's got a design to kind of drive

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.649 
so it's got a design to kind of drive
across<00:01:36.259> continents<00:01:36.950> from<00:01:37.219> Italy<00:01:38.209> to<00:01:38.450> France

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
across continents from Italy to France

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.480 
across continents from Italy to France
to<00:01:39.140> Germany<00:01:39.349> type<00:01:39.709> of<00:01:39.829> thing<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.130> now<00:01:40.280> he's<00:01:40.459> a

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
to Germany type of thing so now he's a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.490 
to Germany type of thing so now he's a
very<00:01:40.789> very<00:01:40.939> relaxing<00:01:41.390> car<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.780> dress<00:01:41.959> I<00:01:42.200> think

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
very very relaxing car to dress I think

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.249 
very very relaxing car to dress I think
I'll<00:01:42.709> probably<00:01:42.859> keep<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:43.640> until<00:01:44.359> it<00:01:44.509> gets<00:01:44.689> taxi

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
I'll probably keep it until it gets taxi

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.559 
I'll probably keep it until it gets taxi
and<00:01:45.590> then<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:45.799> probably<00:01:46.039> try<00:01:46.819> to<00:01:46.849> restore<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.450> to

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
and then I probably try to restore it to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.779 
and then I probably try to restore it to
come<00:01:47.810> cause<00:01:48.110> because<00:01:48.799> being<00:01:49.099> an<00:01:49.280> owner<00:01:49.640> you

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
come cause because being an owner you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:59.800 
come cause because being an owner you
always<00:01:50.149> see<00:01:50.629> the<00:01:50.810> little<00:01:57.489> robust<00:01:58.489> the<00:01:59.209> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
always see the little robust the the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.219 
always see the little robust the the
gearboxes<00:02:00.530> they<00:02:00.739> say<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.099> almost<00:02:01.280> kind<00:02:01.729> of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
gearboxes they say it's almost kind of

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.719 
gearboxes they say it's almost kind of
bulletproof<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.799> angel<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.429> long<00:02:04.520> as<00:02:04.610> you

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
bulletproof the angel and long as you

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.639 
bulletproof the angel and long as you
keep<00:02:04.879> it<00:02:05.060> topped<00:02:05.299> up<00:02:05.420> with<00:02:05.479> oil<00:02:05.810> unlike<00:02:06.439> modern

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
keep it topped up with oil unlike modern

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.669 
keep it topped up with oil unlike modern
cars<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.189> does<00:02:07.340> true<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.819> bit<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.060> oil<00:02:08.359> and<00:02:08.679> you
