00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.689
 and today I want to make a video 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:10.680
 quick how to change the liquid of the 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.680
 hydraulic steering 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.220
 the hydraulic direction regularly 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:23.930
 it is very very usual that not 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.490
 we never check the levels almost 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.310
 we usually never worry about 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.260
 this liquid is very important 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.210
 here in this case we have a car that 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.110
 it is visibly seen that I never know 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.110
 they change here it came to me 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.540
 I want to see the past here 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.960
 how to change the tools 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.640
 that occupied we are going to occupy are very 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.850
 easy in this case we are concerned branch 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.879
 very difficult tool 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.570
 is the transmission fluid and dragos of 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.570
 hydraulic steering 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.390
 this type of tool is a syringe 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.010
 of cooking and one 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.310
 and this I do not even know what it's called but 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.110
 what 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.760
 we press it up here and start 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.189
 talk liquid 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.570
 first, you want to give a 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.890
 visual inspection 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.260
 what is he 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.140
 to what is the liquid like in this case 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.880
 can see then there is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.700
 I think it's black you can not 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.280
 be pretty ugly the liquid 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.350
 at a glance, it is coffee as if 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.350
 was pure then as if it were 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.430
 the hydraulic steering liquid is 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.590
 which is similar to his liquid 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.370
 that oil is more transparent 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.370
 that motor oil 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.470
 and to make it look like that means 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.900
 what 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.060
 that really is very dirty and that's how 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.280
 you may want the level can 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.090
 we put the light 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.219
 and there, more or less, 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.590
 of our level so badly I'm missing 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.550
 little bit more 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:03.180
 but I think we're going to do 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:04.810
 let's put a claw xx you're 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.060
 it always drips 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.940
 have a container at hand 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.840
 and what we want to do is 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.840
 of this 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.379
 from here the deposit take out all the 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.890
 possible liquid from here of the 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.030
 Deposit as much liquid as possible 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.319
 I'm going to do it here with one hand to 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.319
 to show you 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.700
 I have a syringe is a syringe of 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.440
 kitchen they use to throw 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.970
 the chickens or the turkeys to inject the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.200
 to be the meat and see nothing more 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.200
 how is the liquid 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.440
 and what we want to do is 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.130
 also with this you can still roll 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.130
 with the 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.819
 It's a little more of a chorreadero but 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.650
 it is also possible more you put some good 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.650
 some good claws there over here 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.720
 if you have a vacuum pump or a 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.710
 liquid extractor better yet 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.840
 but what we want to do is this 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.300
 and repeat this procedure several 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.920
 times 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.480
 just as I am doing it as much as 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.080
 you can get as much out of the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.080
 Deposit 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.520
 and get back to fill 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.120
 we take everything we can from the 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.120
 Deposit 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.610
 once we have removed what is 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.210
 I can refill it 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.819
 we throw him back 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.819
 we learn the car 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.430
 we learn it we fill it again that 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.650
 we get everything we can get out of it 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.350
 we fill again we turn on the car 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.230
 and we turn the wheel 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.720
 everything for one side and everything for the other 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.690
 side and back again all for a 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.030
 side and everything to the other side and what 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.510
 is the steering wheel we put the right hand drive 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.820
 again we turn off the engine we come 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.549
 again and we do the same process another 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.530
 time in cases like this that he 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.780
 that the liquid is so dirty and that 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.220
 Flat is very ugly because I 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.729
 I would recommend that you do it three times 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.409
 full and the three times for what 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.070
 in the warehouse because we will not reach 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:40.980
 everything everything that is in the system but 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.680
 but if we re-fill it, let's go 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.760
 start to dilute all everything 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.270
 concentrate everything that is worse 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.270
 that way 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.729
 in three steps and you will start to see 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.680
 the cleanest liquid 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.809
 the hydraulic steering fluid does not 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.759
 it's expensive the tools are also not 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:02.500
 faces it's always good to do this guy 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.050
 of 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.390
 of cleaning let's get the liquid 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.980
 dirty because it's easy and it's going to help us 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.100
 enough let's avoid problems to 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.750
 future 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.830
 Well, in this case, on my part, it 's all 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.620
 I will continue doing 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.030
 the process and then if you want more or if 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.230
 you want to see more videos like this one does not 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.190
 forget to subscribe 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.190
 thanks for watching the video
