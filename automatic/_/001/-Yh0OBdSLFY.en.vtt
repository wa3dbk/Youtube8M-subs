00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello friends with you parking frezer and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.849
 Now I want to tell you such a thing in 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.259
 a particular case very when drilling 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:18.380
 holes often use means we 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.270
 handwheel vertical feeds 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.140
 drill with this handwheel 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.939
 very uncomfortable because of sensitivity 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.980
 Lost feedback is not and in 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.800
 principle, they can easily break the drill 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.000
 Yes, and turn back and forth if we assume 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.160
 deep hole this is awkward here 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.850
 let me now here in this red 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.300
 labels need to drill a hole 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.120
 a depth of 41 millimeters forty one 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.239
 millimeter and I will do it with 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.840
 using quill night using this one 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.350
 quill 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.739
 here is not a secret that with the help of pint 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.109
 drilling is often not quite 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.000
 accurate that is to a depth of forty one 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.840
 millimeter to get pretty 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.950
 problematic but there is one method means 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.880
 how can this be done with high precision 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.049
 principle with accuracy 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.530
 almost don 3 200 ok well can 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.630
 Basically finally background for how to get there means 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.680
 it will be done now i want 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.520
 clearly show 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:33.240
 then you look at the quill there 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.579
 trailer here is such a trailer which 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.579
 by turning the knob 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:44.700
 kicked rests on the spindle and no longer 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.390
 It goes as it is tucked here by this 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.299
 with a cog 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.540
 pretty tough and it turns out that 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.680
 here 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.430
 resting all drill no further goes like that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.110
 means 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.470
 we have such a point we have a point 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.899
 visor support 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:12.800
 now let down the drill on the surface and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.540
 using the vertical feed knob 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.459
 quietly bringing the village surface 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.410
 turn on the spindle and make touch with 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.330
 using a pen 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.220
 vertical feed while doing quill 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.250
 us is in the bottom dead center 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.380
 limit switch is rested on the spindle 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:42.600
 hold this case with your hand like this 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:50.000
 Here is the way we give Nick some tension 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:50.000
 pull on and do wrote 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.640
 but my touch was formed 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.290
 periodically a drill raised and watched 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.790
 whether touch appeared 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.000
 little white . 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.540
 next to the red cross here this 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.360
 the point made a drill 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.360
 so this is our so- called 0. 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:28.430
 formed formed 0. 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:33.800
 and now it means on the flywheel vertical 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:41.260
 filing do zeroing zeroing here 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:45.380
 in this way we compare the risk 0x 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.050
 now wait a second I apologize me 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.480
 a little interrupted means so I produced 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:56.000
 reset this. I have . 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.540
 touching the drill to the surface from 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.390
 which I need to drill to the depth 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.690
 forty one millimeter respectively 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.690
 not to get confused here on this line 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.450
 I'll put an integer let it be 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.450
 threesomes 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:24.350
 C grade I put you show it here 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.340
 threesomes 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.530
 and now I need using a pen and 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.680
 vertical feed using handwheel 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.200
 vertical feed screw forty one 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.740
 millimeter 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:44.240
 so I look at the line and I 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:47.950
 should turn out 71 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.950
 and so it went 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.670
 I apologize for trembling cameras and 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.900
 worried 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:05.910
 so well, that's 71 and now on the flywheel too 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:09.600
 compare to it was 71 millimeter 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:13.520
 a little overdone in general such a task 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.520
 what you need here so exactly put 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.560
 there is a slight backlash 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.280
 clockwise means like this 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.050
 compare all order now we 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:31.920
 deepened by 41 millimeters and now a 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.370
 from this point you can safely go to 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.370
 casino 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:48.620
 so now i 'm going to the coordinate and 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:48.620
 can begin the movement begins 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.960
 dear viewers I did not say that I drill 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:23.720
 I'm using right now I have thrown you this here 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:26.770
 so here's a view I will show you 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.400
 you will see the trailer in general, in principle 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.400
 we carry tasty 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.950
 how do i drill bored pretty 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:29.370
 bravely and confidently without thinking about 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:31.890
 miss i'm not up to whether i drill either 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.470
 before drilling or I'm too deep 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:38.250
 everything turned out pretty clear and 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:41.700
 confidently as i say i studied like this 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:44.700
 that's the way you can drill holes 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:48.360
 on the milling machine without problems easily and 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:50.580
 just not thinking about whether 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.480
 exactly or not thank you for your attention with you 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:57.169
 was pashkin frezer go visit padki 

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.169
