00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.590
 December 12 malvina fire in the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.350
 air is one of the authors yes I am one of 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.719
 the authors and the other author is from 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.050
 rodrigo which is a friend story where 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.149
 Mendoza with whom we share the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.750
 passion for aviation and who has this 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.829
 book this book what you have is that it is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.790
 a book about the four units of 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.679
 house and attack and a squadron of 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.600
 bombing but it's deleted from the 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.790
 human is not approached from him 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.650
 from the cockpit of what 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.930
 I felt at that moment in that flight 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.880
 lonely that he had to be towards the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.700
 Malvinas Islands 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.130
 attack and then return if they had their home 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.789
 as a certain 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.180
 and not everyone was lucky, no, and this 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:31.259
 it is a very moving story of all 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.240
 them all that were let's say that to 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.530
 through the time of those 74 days 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.979
 living different experiences 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.929
 traumatic but as professionals 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.789
 about taking them and trying to fulfill 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:46.560
 said they fulfilled their duty not of the 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.009
 story one of the stories is more what 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.009
 it moved 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.689
 they are several but 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:01.149
 maybe the 30's had one of the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.920
 of the stories that touched him more than me 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:09.229
 was his wife was about to have 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:13.970
 family and they were forced to turn to 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.519
 villa reynolds and he had a meeting with 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.590
 the woman agreed that he 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.870
 was going to go back with his classmates and that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.989
 it was his place so his daughter was born and 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.630
 took the first plane that was available 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.030
 and it came back 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.450
 risk or to join their cameras and 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.450
 fight 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.920
 and always when I can not speak 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.270
 with the pilots there is a huge respect 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.840
 for those who did not return 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.650
 not as a slogan from someone who 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.090
 He commanded a deeper sense 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.069
 they generally treat 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.550
 we would say the term just kind of 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.340
 fly over because it means something very 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.220
 strong for each of them because they have 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.500
 made a career together because they form 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.540
 the same squad because they went through 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.860
 the same circumstances and at best 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.150
 many that fortunately were not 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.970
 reached by enemy fire yes over 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.870
 they all shared that same feeling in the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.239
 cabins this through the stories of 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.769
 they can know that they could 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.810
 imagine what he was seeing a 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.480
 companion at those times the last 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.490
 moments or what he tried to do to 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.480
 save yourself or 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.430
 as he tried to come back let's say them 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.800
 can live in another cabin what 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.660
 their classmates were living because 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.990
 it was a was a very small group it 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.200
 they knew a lot and they had 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.240
 trained together and went to combat 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.970
 together but each one in a lonely way 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:54.950
 your cabin and that 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.650
 it's something that only they know and 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.210
 we try and then we dump it in this 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.300
 book so that people understand it not 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.270
 are unique feelings fly in the 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.150
 half of a sea an incredible loneliness 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.600
 where nobody was going to rescue them arrive 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.390
 just be a target practically with 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.190
 bad weather challenging one to the 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.320
 third world fleet with bombs 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.680
 very old with the come to live 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.430
 because sometimes useless and unusable 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.650
 they came back and the next day they went back up and 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.320
 they went out and like that every day until 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.689
 the conflict ended and above all to me 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:42.709
 what impressed me the most with rodrigo is 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.389
 that humility that beyond having 

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:49.009
 exceeded because for me many times 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:52.159
 they exceeded in duty it is not true they 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.469
 they do not take it that way and they just say that 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:57.159
 they met and that's really very 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:05:00.399
 important today in aviation they are 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:02.689
 the world view are a legend 

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:05.899
 undeniable is recognized by the 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.339
 own british and you write 

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:08.599
 this video 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:12.349
 Well, actually, I've been writing 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:14.719
 other books and this was a consequence 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.210
 last year of having written the one on the 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:18.699
 naval aviation not 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.100
 I thought there was something incomplete and with 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:23.470
 Rodrigo and we were talking about doing 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.039
 this book because it was really 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:30.009
 I do not think that he will relate those 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.690
 experiences can not be very good to us 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.460
 all and those lovers of vision 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:39.849
 they will discover new stories 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.780
 and let's say a deeper story of 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.030
 what was counted so far 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.040
 what we do not know people that do not know 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.790
 exactly thank you very much but if 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.790
 we pause
