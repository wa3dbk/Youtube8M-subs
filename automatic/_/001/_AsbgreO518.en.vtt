the rain and the smoke in the background

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.089 
the rain and the smoke in the background
i<00:04:31.789> just<00:04:32.360> prevented<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:32.990> background<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:34.009> you

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
i just prevented the background so you

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.070

to<00:04:40.610> create<00:04:40.819> the<00:04:40.970> rain<00:04:41.150> in<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.509> environment

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
to create the rain in the environment

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.620 
to create the rain in the environment
this<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:42.560> how<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:43.069> in<00:04:43.819> the<00:04:43.880> vision<00:04:44.060> original

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
this is how and in the vision original

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.540 
this is how and in the vision original
demonstration<00:04:45.169> I<00:04:45.319> added<00:04:45.590> smoke<00:04:45.919> from<00:04:46.220> action

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550

copilot right here includes the
explosions<00:04:50.690> but<00:04:51.470> that's<00:04:51.620> how<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:51.800> create<00:04:52.039> the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
explosions but that's how you create the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.249 
explosions but that's how you create the
smoke<00:04:52.580> or<00:04:52.849> that's<00:04:53.150> how<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:53.630> get<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.870> smoke<00:04:54.139> in

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
smoke or that's how you get the smoke in

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.439 
smoke or that's how you get the smoke in
there<00:04:54.440> you<00:04:54.979> have<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.310> rain<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:55.789> the<00:04:56.270> Grunch

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
there you have the rain and the Grunch

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.920 
there you have the rain and the Grunch
of<00:04:56.569> textures<00:04:56.930> as<00:04:57.520> you<00:04:58.520> see<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:59.509> now<00:04:59.660> you<00:04:59.720> can

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
of textures as you see and now you can

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.710 
of textures as you see and now you can
go<00:05:00.080> on<00:05:00.259> further<00:05:00.650> by<00:05:01.030> color<00:05:02.030> correcting<00:05:02.539> this

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
go on further by color correcting this

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.879 
go on further by color correcting this
by<00:05:02.900> going<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:03.139> effect<00:05:03.530> color<00:05:03.770> correction

over<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.270> red<00:05:11.389> Channel<00:05:12.610> so<00:05:13.610> you<00:05:13.699> have<00:05:13.789> a<00:05:13.849> cool

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
over the red Channel so you have a cool

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.480 
over the red Channel so you have a cool
feeling<00:05:14.300> like<00:05:14.599> that<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.650> very<00:05:15.680> easy<00:05:16.070> just

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
feeling like that so very easy just

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.159 
feeling like that so very easy just
create<00:05:16.909> an<00:05:17.000> ellipse<00:05:17.300> on<00:05:17.509> the<00:05:17.570> grunge<00:05:17.780> texture

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
create an ellipse on the grunge texture

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.560 
create an ellipse on the grunge texture
and<00:05:18.650> make<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:18.889> background<00:05:19.039> black<00:05:19.570> insert

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
and make the background black insert

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.450 
and make the background black insert
your<00:05:20.659> text<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.229> create<00:05:21.530> the<00:05:21.740> Raney's<00:05:22.070> in<00:05:22.190> CC

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
your text and create the Raney's in CC

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.520 
your text and create the Raney's in CC
particle<00:05:22.880> world<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:23.419> just<00:05:24.110> increase<00:05:24.319> the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
particle world and just increase the

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.770 
particle world and just increase the
gravity<00:05:25.039> now<00:05:25.520> this<00:05:25.789> is<00:05:25.909> very<00:05:26.090> easy<00:05:26.330> to<00:05:26.479> sorrell

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780
