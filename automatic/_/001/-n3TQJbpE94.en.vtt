Newhouse is going to finish third I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.490 
Newhouse is going to finish third I
think<00:01:40.500> he's<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.270> favorite<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.840> field<00:01:43.200> but

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
think he's a favorite in this field but

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.109 
think he's a favorite in this field but
there<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.829> two<00:01:44.280> players<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.000> think

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
there is just two players so I think

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.319 
there is just two players so I think
play<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> little<00:01:46.320> better<00:01:46.619> than<00:01:46.979> him<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.329> that's

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
play a little better than him and that's

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.569 
play a little better than him and that's
why<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> got<00:01:48.810> two<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.079> third<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:49.860> first<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
why I got two in third because first and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.600 
why I got two in third because first and
second<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.450> gone<00:01:51.990> already<00:01:52.430> well<00:01:53.430> let's
