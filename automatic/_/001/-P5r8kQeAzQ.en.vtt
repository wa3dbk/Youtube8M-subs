00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.840 

and<00:00:54.620> bring<00:00:54.830> it<00:00:54.920> out<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.070> little<00:00:55.280> bit<00:00:55.520> further

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
and bring it out a little bit further

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.310 
and bring it out a little bit further
than<00:00:56.680> where<00:00:57.680> lashes<00:00:58.280> end<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:59.050> the<00:01:00.050> good<00:01:00.200> thing

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
than where lashes end and the good thing

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.840 
than where lashes end and the good thing
about<00:01:00.350> shimmery<00:01:00.950> shadows<00:01:01.340> is<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:01.670> they

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
about shimmery shadows is that they

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.870 
about shimmery shadows is that they
blend<00:01:02.090> really<00:01:02.420> easily<00:01:02.810> so<00:01:03.520> that's<00:01:04.520> why<00:01:04.730> we

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
blend really easily so that's why we

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.330 
blend really easily so that's why we
keep<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.990> more<00:01:06.380> shimmery<00:01:06.740> color<00:01:07.010> at<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.310> top

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
keep the more shimmery color at the top

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.260 
keep the more shimmery color at the top
so<00:01:07.820> we're<00:01:07.940> going<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.120> blend<00:01:08.900> upward<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:10.640> when

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
so we're going to blend upward and when

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.730 
so we're going to blend upward and when
we<00:01:11.360> end<00:01:11.540> we're<00:01:11.660> gonna<00:01:11.780> take<00:01:11.900> a<00:01:11.930> fluffy<00:01:12.170> or<00:01:12.410> but
