there couldn't really have been much of

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
a better comparison between the two they

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.820 
a better comparison between the two they
have<00:02:13.020> almost<00:02:13.200> identical

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
have almost identical

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.140 
have almost identical
jumping<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:14.250> well<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> same<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.030> air

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.120 
jumping as well so the same in the air
and<00:02:15.390> yeah<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.290> thought<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.650> would<00:02:16.710> be<00:02:16.950> an

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
and yeah so I thought this would be an

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.390 
and yeah so I thought this would be an
ideal<00:02:17.340> partnership<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.120> go<00:02:18.270> through<00:02:18.540> now<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
ideal partnership to go through now and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.130 
ideal partnership to go through now and
bail<00:02:20.400> obviously<00:02:20.940> has<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> few<00:02:21.450> standout<00:02:21.870> stats

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
I am going to tell you guys about when i

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.490 
I am going to tell you guys about when i
played<00:02:36.300> with<00:02:36.450> bail<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> live<00:02:37.080> stream<00:02:37.350> now

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
played with bail in the live stream now

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.750 
played with bail in the live stream now
i'm<00:02:37.680> sure<00:02:37.950> there's<00:02:38.130> some<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.400> were<00:02:38.520> asleep

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
i'm sure there's some of you were asleep

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.890 
i'm sure there's some of you were asleep
because<00:02:39.000> we<00:02:39.180> actually<00:02:39.450> played<00:02:39.630> for<00:02:39.810> him

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
because we actually played for him

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.620 
because we actually played for him
between<00:02:40.140> i<00:02:40.410> think<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> seven-hour<00:02:41.580> 7am<00:02:42.420> and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
between i think the seven-hour 7am and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.770 
between i think the seven-hour 7am and
the<00:02:43.190> 1030am<00:02:44.190> sort<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.730> time<00:02:45.000> span<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.630> live

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the 1030am sort of time span of the live

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.750 
the 1030am sort of time span of the live
stream<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.260> definitely<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.950> was<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.340> earlier

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
stream so definitely it was the earlier

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.310 
stream so definitely it was the earlier
hours<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.420> sort<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.690> thing<00:02:48.870> when<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.080> lot<00:02:49.290> of

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
hours of the sort of thing when a lot of

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.340 
hours of the sort of thing when a lot of
people<00:02:49.410> weren't<00:02:49.740> really<00:02:49.980> around<00:02:50.220> now<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
people weren't really around now and

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.690 
people weren't really around now and
bail<00:02:52.350> was<00:02:52.740> honestly<00:02:53.160> one<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.580> best

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
bail was honestly one of the best

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.490 
bail was honestly one of the best
players<00:02:54.060> I've<00:02:54.270> ever<00:02:54.300> used<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.900> used<00:02:55.080> him<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.290> a

players I've ever used I used him in a
four<00:02:56.190> years<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:56.940> 42<00:02:57.330> with<00:02:57.570> Shaqiri<00:02:58.050> up<00:02:58.290> front

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
four years for 42 with Shaqiri up front

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.960 
four years for 42 with Shaqiri up front
alongside<00:02:58.830> him<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.310> there<00:02:59.760> was<00:02:59.850> something

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
alongside him and there was something

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.120 
alongside him and there was something
about<00:03:00.209> bail<00:03:00.570> which<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.140> unexplainable<00:03:01.680> I

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
about bail which is just unexplainable I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.550 
about bail which is just unexplainable I
personally<00:03:03.000> before<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:03.990> it<00:03:04.140> down<00:03:04.320> as

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
personally before this I have it down as

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.960 
personally before this I have it down as
Ronaldo<00:03:05.070> as<00:03:05.190> my<00:03:05.310> favorite<00:03:05.610> player<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
Ronaldo as my favorite player in the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.850 
Ronaldo as my favorite player in the
game<00:03:06.120> Messi<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.780> my<00:03:07.020> second<00:03:07.440> favorite<00:03:07.709> player

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
game Messi is my second favorite player

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.500 
game Messi is my second favorite player
in<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.010> game<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.280> know<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.610> bizarre<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.180> now

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
in the game I know it's bizarre and now

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.110 
in the game I know it's bizarre and now
is<00:03:09.750> genuinely<00:03:10.260> bail<00:03:10.560> as<00:03:10.830> my<00:03:11.130> third<00:03:11.370> favor<00:03:11.670> I'd

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
is genuinely bail as my third favor I'd

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.880 
is genuinely bail as my third favor I'd
probably<00:03:12.360> go<00:03:12.630> close<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:12.959> say<00:03:13.290> bail<00:03:13.800> is

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
probably go close to say bail is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.310 
probably go close to say bail is
actually<00:03:14.580> may<00:03:15.270> be<00:03:15.300> on<00:03:15.570> par<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:15.840> Messi<00:03:16.290> and

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
actually may be on par with Messi and

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.560 
actually may be on par with Messi and
very<00:03:16.800> close<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.220> Ronaldo<00:03:17.610> on<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.850> game<00:03:18.030> bail

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
very close to Ronaldo on this game bail

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.590 
very close to Ronaldo on this game bail
was<00:03:18.870> such<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.260> good<00:03:19.500> player<00:03:19.739> now<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.880> 95<00:03:21.360> pays

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
was such a good player now that 95 pays

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.630 
was such a good player now that 95 pays
is<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:22.200> course<00:03:22.350> ridiculous<00:03:22.950> but<00:03:23.070> added<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.519> the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
is of course ridiculous but added to the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.370 
is of course ridiculous but added to the
fact<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.000> dribbling<00:03:24.269> was<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:24.630> good<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.019> his

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
fact is dribbling was so good and his

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.780 
fact is dribbling was so good and his
shooting<00:03:25.620> was<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:25.890> good<00:03:26.040> it's<00:03:26.250> just<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:26.640> odd<00:03:26.760> to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
shooting was so good it's just so odd to

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.970 
shooting was so good it's just so odd to
explain<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.420> felt<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:27.840> almost<00:03:28.110> every<00:03:28.860> single

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
explain I felt like almost every single

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.650 
explain I felt like almost every single
time<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.519> just<00:03:29.700> pick<00:03:29.880> up<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.000> ball<00:03:30.239> run<00:03:30.420> with<00:03:30.540> it

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
time I just pick up the ball run with it

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.150 
time I just pick up the ball run with it
and<00:03:30.810> his<00:03:31.140> shots<00:03:31.410> would<00:03:31.560> go<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.890> back<00:03:32.040> of

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
and his shots would go in the back of

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.770 
and his shots would go in the back of
the<00:03:32.220> net<00:03:32.370> there<00:03:32.519> was<00:03:32.610> something<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.209> peculiar

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
the net there was something so peculiar

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.570 
the net there was something so peculiar
about<00:03:33.870> his<00:03:34.200> card<00:03:34.470> we're<00:03:35.010> literally<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.550> was

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
about his card we're literally it was

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.729 
about his card we're literally it was
like<00:03:35.820> there<00:03:35.940> was<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> magnet<00:03:36.570> just<00:03:37.170> attracting

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
like there was a magnet just attracting

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.350 
like there was a magnet just attracting
every<00:03:37.950> ball<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.489> goal<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.060> would<00:03:39.209> go

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
every ball to the goal and it would go

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.449 
every ball to the goal and it would go
with<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.630> much<00:03:39.750> power<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.200> was<00:03:40.350> like<00:03:40.530> almost<00:03:41.100> as

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
with so much power it was like almost as

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.650 
with so much power it was like almost as
if<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:41.730> was<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:42.060> was<00:03:42.150> like<00:03:42.330> playing<00:03:42.540> with

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
if it was I was like playing with

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.930 
if it was I was like playing with
sliders<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.140> described<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.610> actual

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
sliders I described that in the actual

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.910 
sliders I described that in the actual
stream<00:03:45.239> literally<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.050> felt<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:46.380> every<00:03:46.680> shot

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
stream literally it felt like every shot

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.949 
stream literally it felt like every shot
I<00:03:46.950> took<00:03:47.040> was<00:03:47.820> like<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.090> shot<00:03:48.330> power<00:03:48.510> sliders

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
I took was like the shot power sliders

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.960 
I took was like the shot power sliders
were<00:03:49.080> up<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.440> was<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.560> very<00:03:49.890> very<00:03:50.220> bizarre<00:03:50.640> so<00:03:50.820> as

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
were up it was a very very bizarre so as

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.030 
were up it was a very very bizarre so as
I'm<00:03:51.180> saying<00:03:51.420> gasps<00:03:51.959> Bell<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.440> one<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.860> best

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
I'm saying gasps Bell is one of the best

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.410 
I'm saying gasps Bell is one of the best
theories<00:03:53.310> if<00:03:53.430> somehow<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.820> have<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.180> coins

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
theories if somehow you have the coins

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.210 
theories if somehow you have the coins
to<00:03:54.600> game<00:03:54.780> then<00:03:55.230> definitely<00:03:55.590> get<00:03:55.860> but<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.100> am
