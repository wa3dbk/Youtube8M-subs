00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 crossed basically not wearing 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.760
 from this cradle 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.370
 and even those who wear it very rarely 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.290
 Sorry, read the instructions for what 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.269
 taught in the store the words of the pub if not 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.119
 taught then will attract either 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.820
 wrong or ours can happen to 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.360
 anyone except me let us go our 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.250
 most 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.160
 ninety percent love attached 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.850
 should absolutely the same here here 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.360
 cradles always have two guides 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.250
 crane leaked 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:48.820
 the lower part and I will remember for these 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:53.860
 guides fixed upper part at 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.240
 I get started up and here too 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.300
 there are side guides 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.750
 mandatory all have marking here 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.640
 such a white rectangle which 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.009
 Drusilla 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.820
 which has an icon off pillow 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:13.720
 safety 07 sure knows 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.399
 why instead of hands with an airbag 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.250
 triggered at a speed of 200 kilometers 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.140
 at one o'clock and if the child will go against 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.869
 travel and work cushions 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.950
 Security was not easy as he was 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.659
 will turn over possible injury 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.960
 incompatible with the life of the bushes dew 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.030
 this can not be left if 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.070
 here is the airbag 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:42.730
 kind of car seat in the front seat 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.770
 same with universal groups 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.880
 which can be put against the move 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.220
 movement here it is icon rectangles 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.670
 big on all sides like on all 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.280
 languages in Russian that is when the chair 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.960
 set against advancing the weekend 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.640
 airbag because how would 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.310
 my hard not cling as if not 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.990
 shone I did not throw in this direction 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.580
 there is no protection from the pillow itself 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.550
 those chairs that are put 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.560
 Already ear promotion on these chairs such 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.330
 you would not but let's say so 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.520
 Buyers recommend this either 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.260
 shut off for leave already on the back 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.030
 the seat because the kids are older 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.450
 you can already agree everything 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.980
 or haul from behind why because 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.770
 This pillow is triggered 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.300
 front at a certain height calculated 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.739
 the child is still shorter 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.060
 that is, you can additionally and 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.930
 trauma to be from her 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.930
 here and kids we like to love left right 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.180
 i.e. head anywhere but out of place 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.709
 if at this time the child will look 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.070
 here that is the little head somewhere here and 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.470
 work the pillow too injuries can be 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.930
 here is but manufacturers about this not all 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.560
 declare some advisory 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.830
 include pillow but surely this 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.930
 no and i don't know the authority is included or not 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.780
 but it seems to me very well if 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.850
 would be included to employees checking 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.519
 I will say that the presence was checked 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.680
 that's it but the chair because we drive 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.130
 1 study annually ferry rake cook 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.640
 germany traffic police itself 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.050
 without fail 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.180
 so I would really like to read 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:36.220
 read instructions understand that these 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:39.010
 here kartinochki tell 2 forest on 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.440
 people are 150 cm taller 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.530
 that is, when the child is 120 there is one hundred and ten 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.600
 centimeters to him this belt is very 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.240
 is located 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.940
 its lower in such cases if the child 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.500
 so let's say ten years then you can 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.750
 use mail in theory 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.450
 but this thing came up with a special 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.480
 to make this strap lower 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:06.120
 that is, it is in theory fastens the belt but 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.120
 what is it dangerous next slide can 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.800
 held contest that is the maximum 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.680
 deviation so let's say heads from 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.390
 initial point 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.740
 as much as possible that suits 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:26.620
 let's say 50 cm with this thing first 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.040
 very strong deviations from the belt acute 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:34.540
 the most dangerous thing is that it raises the bottom 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:38.580
 strap and me and going on very possibly 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:42.860
 grass belly is very dangerous if masked 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:48.530
 under the arms of the cross 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:51.259
 imagine that he and the lower bottom 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:55.069
 element of both clips and bottom 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:57.710
 people go through holes after 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:01.340
 ceremonial braking will occur 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.780
 here stop case this here is the thing 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.800
 she goes over the stomach 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.800
 next one
