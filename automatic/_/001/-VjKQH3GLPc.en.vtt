00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.660
 now everything is different I'm playing 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.149
 why bad party 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.309
 in this episode then let's go 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.320
 towards route 102 but first we go to 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.509
 an opening I have finished the sketch 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.039
 from the tracks of the rare I realized 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:19.650
 what were his traces 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.550
 well I do not know and my talent but good such 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.070
 we're going to be a lot of pokemon 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.940
 luckily with them 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.940
 now you 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.240
 if I am a pokémon with you socially 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.240
 because you can not count on me 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 the young man is ready he has it now 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.420
 and I put out a life of 5 so I'm going to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.339
 press the destroyer 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.990
 born united but for that I have 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.960
 absorb that it is a special movement 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.460
 And so I can 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.460
 I can win equally just 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.700
 I love the way of again 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.100
 to the loss of more then if I'm 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.140
 painted usually at level 5 should 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.000
 have trained him more to see you 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.830
 haha you are watching me this challenge with 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.530
 they chose me said and now he was here 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:31.260
 by my side really so I do not know what 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.260
 you go but good the 20.3 things well 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.670
 birthday 4 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.260
 they have no peak is assuming that this 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.260
 level so it does not scare me much 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.190
 has shot of now yes go to have 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.480
 shot of prey before the shots of 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.490
 farm 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.490
 let's leave the hands 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.960
 an appeal is only a pokémon and 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.420
 I'm wrong for now I'm going to get 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.430
 with the goal 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.799
 well I always try to enter 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.630
 train with full time for the 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.530
 game of always 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.220
 always after 12 pokemon and then already 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.550
 I get 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.550
 others 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.700
 as a shot of moraza me because not with 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.969
 more speed that creates so I of a 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.969
 shape 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.469
 eat what 2 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.740
 of herbs 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:54.170
 good also good years playing the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.450
 games but good if in this game I finish 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.990
 to start eating alfredo has with 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.990
 listen to 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.960
 First 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.880
 life 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.880
 I do not know what will do more destroyer grace 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.240
 at least it appears now it's bounded 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.510
 by the writer 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.430
 rico perez 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.430
 now he has a tail 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.240
 I hope you have it does not have my 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.210
 counterpart level 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.830
 He just came and I do not know what else but 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.370
 I will also bring the time with 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.370
 detector 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.599
 and it's over 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.840
 that critical hit should have 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.900
 given at the beginning 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.900
 why 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.390
 you have completely lost your skin is not 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.760
 it is simply lost only 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.439
 on top of arrimados 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.439
 here we have the berries for here 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.459
 and here we have also go the clock 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.700
 I'm going to help you finish your streak 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.970
 chicago 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.000
 I do not know I prefer the first destroyer 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.140
 and then absorb for 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.140
 recover ps 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.069
 to continue towards some damage in the ass 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:44.739
 So I am going to 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:44.739
 and he defeated it very well has been strong 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.050
 of jaguars 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.320
 to be able to transform this fight 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.960
 why 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.530
 since there is a sound I do not have another 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.530
 let's look for then 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.500
 drawing with I do not care but again 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.640
 to run 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.640
 and this combat has loaded 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.580
 the graphic a charger 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.139
 really explained 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.139
 his career has just stalled 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.090
 Social 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.319
 I have cured of the pokémon 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.260
 and now reprimand 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:55.550
 to greater desire 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.550
 they would like to get 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.630
 and 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.560
 term has a payment and a copy so 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.810
 let's go with him 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.700
 and 4 for your own hand 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.889
 good that really chicken that I'm going to 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.889
 teach them is the one that goes before me 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.720
 because all you want 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:42.050
 I think you have a lot of luck with 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.050
 he really has had luck because 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.080
 course 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.590
 real has weird pokemon but it 's 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.590
 cut 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.500
 I dont know 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.570
 yes now you will find a goal 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.399
 because bolt 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.659
 the game works automatically and very 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.659
 slowly maybe I do not know why 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.750
 in short I have one because bolt 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.760
 blasco say to a heyday or catch it 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:29.530
 and there is not the dragon star 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.530
 in this game those stars do not come out 

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:33.649
 Congratulations 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.090
 of course the richest cottage cheese because 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.550
 right now the normal team is a lot 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.729
 stronger than mine because I just 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.729
 start 

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:03.230
