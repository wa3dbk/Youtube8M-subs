we're going to learn about the basic

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.180 
we're going to learn about the basic
syntax<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.990> PHP<00:00:09.990> there<00:00:10.530> are<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> few<00:00:10.950> things

syntax of PHP there are a few things

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.799 
syntax of PHP there are a few things
that<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.400> should<00:00:11.429> know<00:00:11.670> about<00:00:11.700> PHP<00:00:12.090> syntax<00:00:12.420> I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
that you should know about PHP syntax I

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.350 
that you should know about PHP syntax I
will<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.170> using<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.559> w3schools<00:00:14.070> com<00:00:14.759> PHP

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
will be using the w3schools com PHP

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.029 
will be using the w3schools com PHP
syntax<00:00:15.680> web<00:00:16.680> page<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.640> show<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> PHP

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
syntax web page to show you so PHP

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.890 
syntax web page to show you so PHP
script<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.430> obviously<00:00:20.850> executed<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> server

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
script is obviously executed on a server

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.730 
script is obviously executed on a server
like<00:00:22.109> MAMP

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
like MAMP

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.060 
like MAMP
and<00:00:23.240> a<00:00:24.240> PHP<00:00:24.660> script<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.500> placed<00:00:25.740> anywhere

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and a PHP script can be placed anywhere

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
and a PHP script can be placed anywhere
in<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.279> document<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.960> our<00:00:27.960> case<00:00:28.170> we'll<00:00:28.320> be

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
in the document in our case we'll be

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.560 
in the document in our case we'll be
using<00:00:28.439> HTML<00:00:29.070> document<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> PHP<00:00:29.849> can<00:00:30.449> be

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
using HTML document and the PHP can be

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.020 
using HTML document and the PHP can be
anywhere<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.650> good<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> note<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.189> PHP

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
anywhere it's good to note that PHP

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.590 
anywhere it's good to note that PHP
scripts<00:00:33.510> always<00:00:33.899> start<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:35.600> opening

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
scripts always start with this opening

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.080 
scripts always start with this opening
bracket<00:00:36.960> question<00:00:37.170> mark<00:00:37.350> PHP<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.100> always<00:00:38.850> end

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
bracket question mark PHP and always end

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.760 
bracket question mark PHP and always end
with<00:00:39.210> question<00:00:39.570> mark<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.930> closing<00:00:40.440> bracket

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
with question mark and closing bracket

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.830 
with question mark and closing bracket
so<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.100> looks<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.370> little<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.760> this

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
so it looks a little bit like this

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.000 
so it looks a little bit like this
obviously<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.960> default<00:00:45.290> file<00:00:45.470> extension<00:00:45.980> for

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
obviously the default file extension for

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.560 
obviously the default file extension for
PHP<00:00:46.640> files<00:00:46.970> is<00:00:47.390> dot<00:00:48.320> PHP<00:00:49.220> that's<00:00:49.879> why<00:00:50.059> you<00:00:50.120> see

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
PHP files is dot PHP that's why you see

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.189 
PHP files is dot PHP that's why you see
in<00:00:50.809> our<00:00:52.150> code<00:00:53.150> that<00:00:53.360> we<00:00:53.449> just<00:00:53.660> worked<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:54.050> in

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
in our code that we just worked on in

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.600 
in our code that we just worked on in
the<00:00:54.260> previous<00:00:54.530> lecture<00:00:54.829> we<00:00:54.860> have<00:00:55.160> index<00:00:55.430> dot

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
the previous lecture we have index dot

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.750 
the previous lecture we have index dot
PHP<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:56.030> practice<00:00:56.510> PHP<00:00:57.230> those<00:00:57.739> are<00:00:57.890> PHP<00:00:58.309> files

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
PHP and practice PHP those are PHP files

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.280 
PHP and practice PHP those are PHP files
therefore<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.480> extension<00:00:59.900> is<00:01:00.339> dot<00:01:01.339> PHP

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
therefore the extension is dot PHP

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.370 
therefore the extension is dot PHP
here's<00:01:03.290> an<00:01:03.440> example<00:01:03.769> of<00:01:04.210> how<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.269> use<00:01:05.390> PHP<00:01:05.960> it's

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
here's an example of how to use PHP it's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.290 
here's an example of how to use PHP it's
very<00:01:06.619> similar<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.550> one<00:01:07.729> we<00:01:07.820> used<00:01:07.850> in<00:01:08.180> our

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
very similar to the one we used in our

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.700 
very similar to the one we used in our
first<00:01:08.690> page<00:01:09.110> practice<00:01:10.009> PHP<00:01:11.350> so<00:01:12.350> we're<00:01:12.530> just

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
first page practice PHP so we're just

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.310 
first page practice PHP so we're just
having<00:01:13.040> an<00:01:13.759> echo<00:01:14.150> statement<00:01:14.210> here<00:01:14.900> within<00:01:15.140> a

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
having an echo statement here within a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.210 
having an echo statement here within a
couple<00:01:15.680> PHP<00:01:16.660> tags<00:01:17.660> you<00:01:18.320> can<00:01:18.440> also<00:01:18.590> do<00:01:18.830> comments

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
couple PHP tags you can also do comments

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.219 
couple PHP tags you can also do comments
in<00:01:19.340> PHP<00:01:19.700> just<00:01:19.940> like<00:01:20.060> every<00:01:20.300> other<00:01:20.330> programming

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
in PHP just like every other programming

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.290 
in PHP just like every other programming
language<00:01:21.530> HTML<00:01:21.710> CSS<00:01:22.009> JavaScript<00:01:22.910> blah<00:01:23.090> blah

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
language HTML CSS JavaScript blah blah

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.779 
language HTML CSS JavaScript blah blah
blah<00:01:23.509> blah<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:24.160> they<00:01:25.160> look<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.430> little<00:01:25.550> bit

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
blah blah and they look a little bit

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.639 
blah blah and they look a little bit
like<00:01:26.180> this<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.020> there's<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.259> single<00:01:27.560> line

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
like this so there's a single line

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.499 
like this so there's a single line
comment<00:01:28.009> with<00:01:28.130> two<00:01:28.369> forward<00:01:28.670> slashes<00:01:28.700> there

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
comment with two forward slashes there

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.900 
comment with two forward slashes there
is<00:01:29.690> an<00:01:29.869> alternative<00:01:30.590> version<00:01:30.950> of<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.369> single

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
is an alternative version of a single

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.980 
is an alternative version of a single
line<00:01:32.000> comment<00:01:32.330> which<00:01:32.479> uses<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:32.780> pound<00:01:33.050> sign<00:01:33.320> and

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
line comment which uses a pound sign and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.139 
line comment which uses a pound sign and
you<00:01:35.990> could<00:01:36.110> do<00:01:36.170> multi-line<00:01:36.560> comments<00:01:37.100> with<00:01:37.910> a

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
you could do multi-line comments with a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.240 
you could do multi-line comments with a
forward<00:01:38.600> slash<00:01:38.630> asterisk<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.710> then<00:01:39.770> you

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
forward slash asterisk and then you

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.800 
forward slash asterisk and then you
write<00:01:40.460> all<00:01:40.610> your<00:01:40.640> stuff<00:01:41.060> in<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.330> middle<00:01:41.570> of<00:01:41.690> it

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
write all your stuff in the middle of it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.300 
write all your stuff in the middle of it
and<00:01:41.929> then<00:01:42.289> you<00:01:42.380> can<00:01:42.500> do<00:01:42.590> asterisks<00:01:43.220> and

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
and then you can do asterisks and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.630 
and then you can do asterisks and
forward<00:01:44.060> slash<00:01:45.130> let's<00:01:46.130> talk<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.310> little<00:01:46.520> bit

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
forward slash let's talk a little bit

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.200 
forward slash let's talk a little bit
about<00:01:46.789> PHP<00:01:47.539> case<00:01:48.200> sensitivity<00:01:49.210> so

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
about PHP case sensitivity so

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.780 
about PHP case sensitivity so
user-defined<00:01:50.900> functions<00:01:51.320> like<00:01:51.790> if-else

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
user-defined functions like if-else

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.270 
user-defined functions like if-else
while<00:01:53.270> echo<00:01:53.750> print<00:01:54.079> those<00:01:54.680> types<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.100> things

while echo print those types of things

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.890 
while echo print those types of things
which<00:01:55.490> will<00:01:55.700> get<00:01:55.880> there<00:01:56.119> I<00:01:56.150> don't<00:01:56.390> expect<00:01:56.780> you

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
which will get there I don't expect you

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.819 
which will get there I don't expect you
to<00:01:56.960> know<00:01:57.079> anything<00:01:57.380> about<00:01:57.470> that<00:01:57.650> right<00:01:57.799> now

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
to know anything about that right now

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.100 
to know anything about that right now
they<00:01:58.490> are<00:01:58.729> not<00:01:59.000> case-sensitive<00:01:59.360> so<00:01:59.840> for

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
they are not case-sensitive so for

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.179 
they are not case-sensitive so for
example<00:02:00.560> in<00:02:00.710> these<00:02:01.340> three<00:02:01.790> echo<00:02:02.479> statements

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
example in these three echo statements

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.120 
example in these three echo statements
you<00:02:04.189> can<00:02:04.220> see<00:02:05.110> they're<00:02:06.110> using<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.740> bunch<00:02:07.009> of

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
you can see they're using a bunch of

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.490 
you can see they're using a bunch of
different<00:02:07.520> ways<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.729> of<00:02:08.299> using<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.290> case

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
different ways that of using the case

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.110 
different ways that of using the case
sensitivity<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.250> I'll<00:02:10.369> upper<00:02:10.729> case<00:02:10.910> lower

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
sensitivity so I'll upper case lower

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.229 
sensitivity so I'll upper case lower
case<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.870> mix<00:02:12.079> of<00:02:12.320> both<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.799> they<00:02:13.340> all<00:02:13.519> echo

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
case and a mix of both and they all echo

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.319 
case and a mix of both and they all echo
the<00:02:14.480> same<00:02:14.690> thing<00:02:14.989> so<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.500> means<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.180> not

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
the same thing so this means it is not

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.360 
the same thing so this means it is not
case<00:02:17.660> sensitive<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.769> user-defined

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
case sensitive so the user-defined

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.960 
case sensitive so the user-defined
functions<00:02:19.820> are<00:02:20.530> not<00:02:21.530> case<00:02:21.860> sensitive<00:02:21.970> however

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
functions are not case sensitive however

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.840 
functions are not case sensitive however
on<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.239> flip<00:02:23.269> side<00:02:23.680> PHP<00:02:24.680> variables<00:02:25.220> are<00:02:25.400> case

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
on the flip side PHP variables are case

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.150 
on the flip side PHP variables are case
sensitive<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.480> for<00:02:26.660> example<00:02:27.079> in<00:02:27.260> these

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
sensitive so for example in these

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.400 
sensitive so for example in these
variables<00:02:28.519> now<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.750> variable<00:02:29.959> here<00:02:30.230> we're

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
variables now this variable here we're

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.569 
variables now this variable here we're
using<00:02:30.440> color<00:02:32.110> equals<00:02:33.110> red<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:34.130> if<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.370> were<00:02:34.489> to

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
using color equals red so if you were to

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.840 
using color equals red so if you were to
echo<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.510> color<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:37.160> one<00:02:37.430> would<00:02:37.700> actually

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
echo that color this one would actually

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.360 
echo that color this one would actually
print<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.450> color<00:02:38.660> this<00:02:39.620> one<00:02:39.950> would<00:02:40.190> not

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
print the color this one would not

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.990 
print the color this one would not
because<00:02:40.880> there<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.329> no<00:02:41.859> variable<00:02:42.859> that<00:02:43.489> is<00:02:43.700> set

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
because there is no variable that is set

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.330 
because there is no variable that is set
with<00:02:44.720> all<00:02:44.900> caps<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:45.739> one<00:02:45.920> would<00:02:46.130> also

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
with all caps and this one would also

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.259 
with all caps and this one would also
not<00:02:46.700> display<00:02:47.540> anything<00:02:48.040> because<00:02:49.040> there<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:50.030> no

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
not display anything because there is no

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.050 
not display anything because there is no
variable<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:51.290> looks<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:51.709> this<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.849> is

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
variable that looks like this so this is

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.050 
variable that looks like this so this is
case<00:02:53.989> sensitive<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.310> was<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.580> super

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
case sensitive so that was the super

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.490 
case sensitive so that was the super

quick<00:02:57.950> rundown<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.760> PHP<00:02:59.510> syntax<00:02:59.720> it's<00:03:00.610> it's

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
quick rundown of PHP syntax it's it's

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.460 
quick rundown of PHP syntax it's it's
very<00:03:01.670> simple<00:03:02.120> but<00:03:02.660> kind<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:02.960> boring<00:03:03.140> and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
very simple but kind of boring and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.440 
very simple but kind of boring and
you're<00:03:04.220> going<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.430> be<00:03:04.520> learning<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.910> as<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.300> go

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
you're going to be learning it as we go

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.850 
you're going to be learning it as we go
so<00:03:05.660> that's<00:03:05.810> why<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:05.990> didn't<00:03:06.230> want<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.440> touch<00:03:06.560> too

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
so that's why I didn't want to touch too

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.220 
so that's why I didn't want to touch too
much<00:03:06.890> on<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:07.760> let's<00:03:08.390> get<00:03:08.900> our<00:03:08.990> hands<00:03:09.110> dirty

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
much on it so let's get our hands dirty

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.120 
much on it so let's get our hands dirty
and<00:03:09.590> jump<00:03:09.980> into<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.490> next<00:03:10.670> lecture<00:03:11.120> which<00:03:11.690> is

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
and jump into the next lecture which is

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.230 
and jump into the next lecture which is
PHP<00:03:13.150> variables<00:03:14.150> see<00:03:14.690> they're<00:03:14.810> my<00:03:14.900> friends
