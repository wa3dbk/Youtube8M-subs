00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.619
 inflatable dinosaur barney 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.620
 most of all I like to represent 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:42.100
 like kids reboot something like shut up for 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.740

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.990
 kidding, I love children so creative 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.490
 way producers make it clear that the show 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.800
 Barney is off the air 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.170

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.850
 to their Hani boo boo boo ripped up 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.190
 for example and even if barney was 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.190
 mexicans from him would you have been sweetie 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.670
 By the way, I want to add this video 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.830
 just made my day 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.140
 because as a child I hated 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.479
 Barney can introduce me with my 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.540
 big head off i'm so big dunbar not 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.400
 settlement I never go shopping in 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.470

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.560

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.970
 so what about no role for black friday 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.610
 what have we got there this year 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.560
 a million movie views where a couple 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.900
 teenager came to make fun of the way 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.670
 by buyers in a wolfmart one of 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.470
 teenagers hid and cry out 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.450
 something out of the way is okay 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:49.200
 I personally think one of the buyers 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 myself but do not agree will go 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:02:00.200

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.390

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.970
 I read he broke a couple of laws when 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.440
 knocked her phone out of her hands but seriously 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.960
 it's just kids 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.520
 why say something like i kill you 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.440
 this is serious when somebody is 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.780

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.790

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.160

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.140

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.020

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.270

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.500
 generally filmed on video and now we 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.750
 we can personally kill everything this case 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.120
 Wisconsin occurred where two aircraft with 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.120
 ska and divers face the air 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.340

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.170
 skydiver gopro camera head and we 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:19.930
 can see clash from different 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:21.430
 angles and the most amazing thing is that all 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.110
 nine people survived 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.489

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.950

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.780
 in the sky so much space these two aircraft 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.459
 managed to fly over each other or something 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.319

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.420

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.180
 insurance if two planes flies friend 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.890

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.670
