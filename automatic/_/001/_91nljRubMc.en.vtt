00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.849 
miles per hour thanks to some new VW
technology<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> sukkot

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
technology so you have a sukkot

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.229 
technology so you have a sukkot
decoupler<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.210> really<00:00:33.800> decouple<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
decoupler so we can really decouple the

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.360 
decoupler so we can really decouple the
gas<00:00:36.239> engine<00:00:36.750> from<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.200> electric<00:00:37.770> drivetrain

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
gas engine from the electric drivetrain

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.540 
gas engine from the electric drivetrain
and<00:00:38.899> by<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.620> highest<00:00:40.800> efficiency<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and by that have highest efficiency the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.330 
and by that have highest efficiency the
cop<00:00:41.760> goes<00:00:42.329> electric<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.020> maximum<00:00:43.440> speed<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> 44

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
cop goes electric to maximum speed of 44

cop goes electric to maximum speed of 44
miles<00:00:45.329> power<00:00:45.629> which<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.110> very<00:00:46.320> high<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.590> very

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
miles power which is very high and very

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.510 
miles power which is very high and very
amazingly<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:48.960> zero<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.350> 60<00:00:49.739> s<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.980> 8.6

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
amazingly you know zero to 60 s and 8.6

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.139 
amazingly you know zero to 60 s and 8.6
seconds<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.870> another<00:00:52.140> proof<00:00:53.149> that

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
seconds and that's another proof that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.000 
seconds and that's another proof that
it's<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.390> lot<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.539> fun<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.899> drive<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.289> try<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it's a lot of fun to drive to try to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.099 
it's a lot of fun to drive to try to
have<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.309> car<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.730> driving<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> car<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
have that car and driving the car I

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.200 
have that car and driving the car I
think<00:00:58.710> much<00:00:58.920> different<00:00:59.399> than<00:00:59.520> what<00:01:00.090> is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
think much different than what is

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.580 
think much different than what is
currently<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.809> market<00:01:00.960> with<00:01:01.410> other

currently in the market with other

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.520 
currently in the market with other
hybrids<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:03.149> prius<00:01:03.570> has<00:01:03.750> been<00:01:03.930> around<00:01:04.229> for

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
hybrids the prius has been around for

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.830 
hybrids the prius has been around for
over<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.860> decade<00:01:05.189> now<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.640> has<00:01:05.909> dominated<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
over a decade now and has dominated the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.590 
over a decade now and has dominated the
hybrid<00:01:07.260> segment<00:01:07.830> now<00:01:08.400> volkswagen<00:01:09.210> looks<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
hybrid segment now volkswagen looks to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
hybrid segment now volkswagen looks to
expand<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.290> segment<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> buyer<00:01:11.670> that's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
expand that segment with a buyer that's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.580 
expand that segment with a buyer that's
looking<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.510> something<00:01:12.869> different<00:01:13.080> than<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
looking for something different than the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.280 
looking for something different than the
usual<00:01:13.799> hybrid<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.720> when<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.990> look<00:01:16.110> at

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
usual hybrid you know when you look at

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.730 
usual hybrid you know when you look at
the<00:01:16.920> regular<00:01:17.630> customer<00:01:18.630> base<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.110> hybrids<00:01:19.530> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the regular customer base of hybrids you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.899 
the regular customer base of hybrids you
see<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.420> medium<00:01:21.420> age<00:01:21.659> 61<00:01:22.909> empty

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
see that they are medium age 61 empty

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.770 
see that they are medium age 61 empty
nesters<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.240> i<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.750> know

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
nesters and so on and i think you know

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.880 
nesters and so on and i think you know
what<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.590> will<00:01:28.770> i<00:01:29.240> I'm<00:01:30.240> very<00:01:30.750> convinced<00:01:31.619> see

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
what we will i I'm very convinced see

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
that with the jetta hybrid we will go to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.800 
that with the jetta hybrid we will go to
two<00:01:34.590> younger<00:01:34.950> customers<00:01:35.600> buy<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
two younger customers buy that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.289 
two younger customers buy that
automatically<00:01:37.409> also<00:01:37.860> maybe<00:01:38.040> two<00:01:38.310> more

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
automatically also maybe two more

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.380 
automatically also maybe two more
families<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.869> kids<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.000> said<00:01:42.060> you

families with kids because as I said you
know<00:01:42.540> no<00:01:42.720> compromise<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.920> day-to-day<00:01:44.070> use<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
know no compromise on day-to-day use and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.190 
know no compromise on day-to-day use and
on<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> other<00:01:45.090> hand<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.450> lot<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.689> fun<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> drive

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
on the other hand a lot of fun to drive

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.330 
on the other hand a lot of fun to drive
and<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.360> also<00:01:48.630> see<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.079> diesel

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
and that is what we also see this diesel

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.240 
and that is what we also see this diesel
with<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> jetta<00:01:50.610> TDI<00:01:51.680> where<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> also<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
with the jetta TDI where you also have a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.780 
with the jetta TDI where you also have a
significantly<00:01:54.060> younger<00:01:54.590> audience<00:01:55.790> compared

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
significantly younger audience compared

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.179 
significantly younger audience compared
to<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.350> hybrid<00:01:58.350> segment<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.070> currently

to the hybrid segment as it's currently

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.120 
to the hybrid segment as it's currently
is<00:01:59.549> now<00:02:00.329> Volkswagen<00:02:01.079> knows<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.649> hybrids

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
is now Volkswagen knows that hybrids

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.889 
is now Volkswagen knows that hybrids
only<00:02:02.369> account<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.790> about<00:02:03.000> three<00:02:03.390> percent<00:02:03.570> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
only account for about three percent of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.840 
only account for about three percent of
the<00:02:04.020> overall<00:02:04.469> market<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.399> some<00:02:05.640> experts

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the overall market but some experts

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.330 
the overall market but some experts
expect<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.960> number<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.320> double<00:02:07.920> within<00:02:08.099> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
expect that number to double within the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.140 
expect that number to double within the
next<00:02:08.550> few<00:02:08.849> years<00:02:09.020> with<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.050> compact<00:02:10.739> segment

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
next few years with the compact segment

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.580
