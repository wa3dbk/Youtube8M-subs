two<00:01:13.610> seasons<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.270> then<00:01:14.660> you<00:01:14.780> have<00:01:14.930> the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
two seasons and then you have the

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.950 
two seasons and then you have the
experience<00:01:16.460> of<00:01:16.580> play<00:01:16.880> against<00:01:17.810> top

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
experience of play against top

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.470 
experience of play against top
competition<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:18.920> they<00:01:19.040> understand<00:01:19.520> playing

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480

in<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.750> big<00:01:20.900> game<00:01:21.220> left<00:01:22.450> I'll<00:01:23.450> get<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.810> step

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
in the big game left I'll get that step

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.950 
in the big game left I'll get that step
over<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.560> get<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.250> on

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.920

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.430

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.280 

all<00:01:43.440> right<00:01:44.330> motivation<00:01:45.330> does<00:01:45.690> come<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
all right motivation does come from the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.920 
all right motivation does come from the
fact<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.650> when<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.040> look<00:01:47.160> at<00:01:47.280> our<00:01:47.370> league
