needs
let's<00:00:19.800> go<00:00:19.920> ahead<00:00:20.010> check<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.520> out<00:00:20.609> right<00:00:20.760> now

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
let's go ahead check it out right now

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.029 
let's go ahead check it out right now
well<00:00:21.600> here's<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.990> code<00:00:22.410> three

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
well here's the code three

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.490 
well here's the code three
for<00:00:23.670> twenty<00:00:24.029> mini<00:00:24.600> light<00:00:24.900> bar<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.380> it's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
for twenty mini light bar and it's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.259 
for twenty mini light bar and it's
actually<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> very<00:00:26.130> well-constructed<00:00:26.789> light

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
actually a very well-constructed light

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.220 
actually a very well-constructed light
bar<00:00:27.510> indeed<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.710> basically<00:00:29.340> has<00:00:29.670> a

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
bar indeed it basically has a

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.479 
bar indeed it basically has a
polycarbonate<00:00:31.230> base<00:00:31.830> that's<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.369> I'm

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
polycarbonate base that's what I'm

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280 
polycarbonate base that's what I'm
showing<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.030> right<00:00:33.210> now<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.809> also<00:00:33.960> has

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
showing you here right now it also has

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.670 
showing you here right now it also has
got<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:34.829> magnets<00:00:35.340> included<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.680> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
got some magnets included in that the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.069 
got some magnets included in that the
dome<00:00:38.129> itself<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.820> also<00:00:39.030> polycarbonate<00:00:39.899> so

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
dome itself is also polycarbonate so

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.139 
dome itself is also polycarbonate so
basically<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.219> would<00:00:41.670> say<00:00:41.820> plastic

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
basically it's a I would say plastic

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.900 
basically it's a I would say plastic
light<00:00:43.050> bar<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.950> pretty<00:00:44.100> darn<00:00:44.340> close<00:00:44.610> but

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
light bar but it's pretty darn close but

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.639 
light bar but it's pretty darn close but
again<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.420> today's<00:00:45.600> modern<00:00:46.170> world<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
again in today's modern world of

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.529 
again in today's modern world of
plastics<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.550> very<00:00:47.879> tough<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.360> resilient

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
plastics it's very tough and resilient

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.130 
plastics it's very tough and resilient
so<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.230> good<00:00:50.160> solid<00:00:50.460> product<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.180> indeed<00:00:51.539> now

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
so a good solid product it is indeed now

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.049 
so a good solid product it is indeed now
this<00:00:52.530> particular<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:53.190> being<00:00:53.399> magnetic<00:00:53.850> mount

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
this particular one being magnetic mount

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.720 
this particular one being magnetic mount
does<00:00:54.420> come<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.020> course<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.829> power<00:00:56.340> cord

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
does come of course with a power cord

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.299 
does come of course with a power cord
which<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.840> clearly<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:59.160> an

which you can clearly see here with an

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.520 
which you can clearly see here with an
on/off<00:00:59.670> switch<00:00:59.699> again<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> tech<00:01:01.020> specs<00:01:01.320> are

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
on/off switch again the tech specs are

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
on/off switch again the tech specs are
available<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.910> website<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.600> go

another feature with this particular

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.590 
another feature with this particular
light<00:01:07.140> bar<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.729> actually<00:01:09.000> has<00:01:09.330> got<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
light bar is that it actually has got a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.840 
light bar is that it actually has got a
clear<00:01:09.930> outer<00:01:10.140> dome<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:11.070> also<00:01:11.250> has<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> red

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
you go this is the filter that's been

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.270 
you go this is the filter that's been
positioned<00:01:20.729> over<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.270> reflector<00:01:22.100> there<00:01:23.100> are

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
positioned over the reflector there are

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.530 
positioned over the reflector there are
two<00:01:23.780> h1<00:01:24.780> 55<00:01:25.350> watt<00:01:25.650> halogen<00:01:25.950> bulbs<00:01:26.610> inside<00:01:27.180> here

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
two h1 55 watt halogen bulbs inside here

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.289 
two h1 55 watt halogen bulbs inside here
you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.229> see<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.650> worm<00:01:28.979> drive<00:01:29.310> area<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you can see the worm drive area here and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.330 
you can see the worm drive area here and
this<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> electric<00:01:31.079> motor<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
this is the electric motor that the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.789 
this is the electric motor that the
actual<00:01:32.850> rotator<00:01:33.360> will<00:01:33.600> sit<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.229> spin

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
actual rotator will sit on and spin

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.620 
actual rotator will sit on and spin
around<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.340> although<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> technology<00:01:36.180> have

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
around so although the technology have

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.780 
around so although the technology have
been<00:01:36.750> around<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.229> many<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.460> many<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.729> year

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
been around for many and many a year

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
been around for many and many a year
it's<00:01:39.630> still<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> good<00:01:40.020> product<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.740> that's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it's still a good product and if that's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
it's still a good product and if that's
something<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.280> you're<00:01:41.400> looking<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.000> check
