we're<00:01:50.540> going<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:50.720> be<00:01:50.810> spraying<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:51.380> and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
we're going to be spraying it and

background at that point in time I would
say<00:01:54.170> about<00:01:54.350> 50%<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.250> time<00:01:55.370> we<00:01:55.520> do<00:01:55.640> new

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
it

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.690 
it
so<00:01:58.790> for<00:01:59.090> speed<00:01:59.540> and<00:01:59.840> to<00:02:00.470> actually<00:02:01.100> make<00:02:01.460> more

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
so for speed and to actually make more

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.340 
so for speed and to actually make more
money<00:02:01.910> because<00:02:02.510> it's<00:02:02.720> more<00:02:02.990> labor-intensive

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
money because it's more labor-intensive

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.100 
money because it's more labor-intensive
back<00:02:04.010> roll<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.340> we<00:02:04.610> don't<00:02:04.820> back<00:02:05.150> roll<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.630> if

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
back roll it we don't back roll it if

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.930 
back roll it we don't back roll it if
the<00:02:06.230> builders<00:02:06.650> require<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.430> or<00:02:07.610> it's<00:02:07.850> a

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
the builders require it or it's a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.479 
the builders require it or it's a
higher-end<00:02:08.270> custom<00:02:09.020> home<00:02:09.259> hiring<00:02:10.099> custom

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
higher-end custom home hiring custom

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.250 
higher-end custom home hiring custom
homes<00:02:10.729> we're<00:02:11.270> typically<00:02:11.629> going<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.930> invest

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
homes we're typically going to invest

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.229 
homes we're typically going to invest
more<00:02:12.470> labor<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:13.129> more<00:02:13.280> money<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:13.730> then<00:02:14.030> we

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
more labor and more money and then we

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.400 
more labor and more money and then we
would<00:02:14.360> back<00:02:14.569> roll<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> paint

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
would back roll the paint

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.380 
would back roll the paint
so<00:02:15.769> those<00:02:15.920> are<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.099> couple<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.849> scenarios

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
so those are a couple of scenarios

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.860 
so those are a couple of scenarios
hopefully<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:17.989> answers<00:02:18.409> your<00:02:18.469> quite

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
hopefully that answers your quite

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.110 
hopefully that answers your quite
whether<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:19.830> back<00:02:20.099> roll<00:02:20.370> or<00:02:20.580> back<00:02:20.760> roll<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
whether we back roll or back roll the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.770 
whether we back roll or back roll the
pain
