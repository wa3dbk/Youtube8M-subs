better<00:03:14.010> way<00:03:15.010> out<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.340> trimmers<00:03:15.760> we<00:03:15.879> can<00:03:16.000> get

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
better way out of trimmers we can get

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.900

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.700 

fairly<00:03:36.300> stable<00:03:36.600> however<00:03:36.990> there<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:40.650> don't

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
fairly stable however there you don't

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.470 
fairly stable however there you don't
want<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.010> do<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> back<00:03:41.490> a<00:03:41.520> little<00:03:41.820> m<00:03:41.970> on<00:03:42.120> trim<00:03:42.360> it

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.790 

can't<00:05:01.240> believe<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.629> taught<00:05:01.870> myself<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.319> fly<00:05:02.590> on

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
can't believe I taught myself to fly on

can't believe I taught myself to fly on
one<00:05:02.919> of<00:05:02.979> these<00:05:03.099> goofy<00:05:03.460> little<00:05:03.490> things<00:05:03.909> every

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
one of these goofy little things every

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.080 
one of these goofy little things every
since<00:05:04.960> it<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.490> of<00:05:06.490> course<00:05:06.699> the<00:05:06.759> bigger<00:05:06.939> they

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
since it is of course the bigger they

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.129 
since it is of course the bigger they
are<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.270> easier<00:05:07.689> to<00:05:07.900> fly<00:05:08.110> but<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:09.930> guess<00:05:10.930> for

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
are the easier to fly but I guess for

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.399 
are the easier to fly but I guess for
