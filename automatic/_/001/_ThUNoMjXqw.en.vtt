00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
spare shooter here this afternoon if you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.020 
spare shooter here this afternoon if you
would<00:01:48.200> like<00:01:48.429> it's<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.549> difference<00:01:49.879> in<00:01:50.000> the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
would like it's the difference in the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.569 
would like it's the difference in the
role<00:01:50.360> between<00:01:50.659> Danny<00:01:51.110> Weisman<00:01:51.379> shot<00:01:51.979> perhaps

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
role between Danny Weisman shot perhaps

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.459 
role between Danny Weisman shot perhaps
more<00:01:52.849> doses<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.569> seems<00:01:53.780> like<00:01:53.959> Danny's<00:01:54.289> ball

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
more doses it seems like Danny's ball

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:55.330 
more doses it seems like Danny's ball
probably<00:01:54.649> goes<00:01:54.860> into<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.069> roll<00:01:55.219> a<00:01:55.250> little

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
probably goes into a roll a little

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.459 
probably goes into a roll a little
earlier<00:01:55.700> well<00:01:56.030> I'd<00:01:56.239> plus<00:01:56.509> he<00:01:56.750> he<00:01:57.020> just<00:01:57.049> seems

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
earlier well I'd plus he he just seems

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.949 
earlier well I'd plus he he just seems
to<00:01:57.590> have<00:01:57.709> a<00:01:57.739> little<00:01:57.979> heavier<00:01:58.280> fingers<00:01:58.819> he<00:01:58.969> has

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
to have a little heavier fingers he has

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.899 
to have a little heavier fingers he has
a<00:01:59.989> nice<00:02:00.439> clean<00:02:00.920> hair<00:02:01.189> releasing<00:02:01.579> I<00:02:01.640> think<00:02:01.849> he

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
a nice clean hair releasing I think he

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.429 
a nice clean hair releasing I think he
goes<00:02:02.060> around<00:02:02.359> the<00:02:02.539> ball<00:02:02.719> his<00:02:02.899> hand<00:02:03.170> turns

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
goes around the ball his hand turns

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.199 
goes around the ball his hand turns
around<00:02:03.709> the<00:02:03.890> ball<00:02:04.069> more<00:02:04.250> which<00:02:04.939> actually

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
around the ball more which actually

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:06.279 
around the ball more which actually
would<00:02:05.479> make<00:02:05.599> you<00:02:05.689> think<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.959> ball<00:02:06.079> will<00:02:06.200> go

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
would make you think the ball will go

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:07.630 
would make you think the ball will go
further<00:02:06.500> down<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.859> lane<00:02:07.009> before<00:02:07.219> it<00:02:07.429> started

you<00:06:39.830> know<00:06:39.919> I<00:06:39.949> think<00:06:40.190> he's<00:06:40.280> starting<00:06:40.400> two

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
you know I think he's starting two

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.550 
you know I think he's starting two
fingers<00:06:41.060> at<00:06:41.210> those<00:06:41.360> fairs<00:06:41.660> I'm<00:06:41.930> not<00:06:42.080> sure<00:06:42.289> he's

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
fingers at those fairs I'm not sure he's

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.839 
fingers at those fairs I'm not sure he's
putting<00:06:42.800> all<00:06:42.949> three<00:06:43.250> fingers<00:06:43.610> in<00:06:43.639> the

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849 
putting all three fingers in the

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:45.159 
putting all three fingers in the
volleyball<00:06:44.060> or<00:06:44.360> the<00:06:44.539> two<00:06:44.690> fingers<00:06:44.990> in<00:06:45.110> the

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
volleyball or the two fingers in the

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.200 
volleyball or the two fingers in the
film<00:06:45.380> I<00:06:45.470> think<00:06:45.680> he's<00:06:45.800> maybe<00:06:46.460> using<00:06:46.789> just<00:06:47.120> the

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
film I think he's maybe using just the

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.510 
film I think he's maybe using just the
ring<00:06:47.419> finger<00:06:47.660> a<00:06:47.990> lot<00:06:48.500> Gary<00:06:48.740> Dickinson<00:06:49.250> yeah

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
ring finger a lot Gary Dickinson yeah

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.289 
well though Gary uses a little finger

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.080 
well though Gary uses a little finger
right<00:06:51.500> a<00:06:51.770> lot<00:06:52.639> of<00:06:52.699> different<00:06:52.729> ways<00:06:53.060> to

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
right a lot of different ways to

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.809 
right a lot of different ways to
straighten<00:06:53.930> that<00:06:53.990> thing<00:06:54.199> right<00:06:54.680> I<00:06:54.979> never<00:06:55.639> had

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:55.819 
straighten that thing right I never had

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.170

that<00:06:55.910> problem<00:06:56.770> well<00:06:57.770> of<00:06:58.340> course<00:06:58.430> you<00:06:59.060> never

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
that problem well of course you never

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.420
