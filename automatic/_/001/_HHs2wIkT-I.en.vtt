00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
about 15 minutes away and we we forgot

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.010 
about 15 minutes away and we we forgot
our<00:00:19.230> giant<00:00:20.039> base<00:00:20.250> there<00:00:20.820> before<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.810> came<00:00:21.960> here

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
our giant base there before we came here

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
our giant base there before we came here
we<00:00:22.380> couldn't<00:00:23.220> remember<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.730> big<00:00:23.880> base

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
we couldn't remember the big base

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300

luckily<00:00:24.720> they<00:00:24.869> had<00:00:25.019> one<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.350> these<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.099> I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
luckily they had one of these this is I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.429 
luckily they had one of these this is I
think<00:00:26.689> this<00:00:27.689> was<00:00:27.930> developed<00:00:28.349> by<00:00:28.560> NASA<00:00:30.439> for

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
think this was developed by NASA for

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.920 
think this was developed by NASA for
base<00:00:31.650> use<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.099> space<00:00:32.450> but<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.570> seems<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> be

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
base use in space but it seems to be

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.910 
base use in space but it seems to be
doing<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> job<00:00:34.380> where<00:00:34.530> do<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.620> think<00:00:34.710> pretty

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
doing the job where do you think pretty

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.620
