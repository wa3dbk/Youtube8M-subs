00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.500
 today I'm going to talk about john 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:27.149
 Mack a teacher who has a project 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.829
 supported by the rockefeller foundation of 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.809
 a character also already quite 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.840
 controversial but this foundation has 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:37.079
 supported the art and many aspects 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.530
 cultural events on this occasion supports 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.949
 a project about in abductions in 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.079
 the world that happens with those people 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.570
 who claim to have been directed by 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.330
 strange beings for beings that they 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.330
 they claim to be from another place in the universe 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.800
 this project is still in process and 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.760
 they have released some publications but 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.940
 part of this project is to interview the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.360
 dalai lama and how do you know the leader 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.820
 spiritual and political than it has 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.159
 what to do with Buddhism right now has already 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 left the baton of the political party and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.190
 is going to devote more to the part 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.740
 spiritual but good that 's another subject 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.979
 the thing is that he wanted to know the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.440
 lai's opinion nothing more about 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.119
 beings from another planet to younis lights 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.020
 in the sky all this kind of 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.600
 expressions that are next to the world 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.689
 the summary and I'll leave it below the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.090
 link to the blog villamayor faith took out this 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.640
 article are interesting but in summary 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.520
 the dalai lama talks about the possibility 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.280
 that this expression is not partly 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.399
 based on or created in our same 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.270
 thoughts on what I speak is that for 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:02.149
 what is asia is very clear that there is 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.349
 life outside the universe that exists life 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:09.530
 even in other dimensions not him 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.510
 In fact, he claims to be contacted with 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.170
 other beings that can not be seen 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.530
 they are simply conscience and that 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.510
 that criticizes is that in the good West it 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.510
 has returned or has moved away from this 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.769
 reality is not what you are looking for and he believes is 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.110
 that all this vast expression of light in 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.180
 the sky and even 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.180
 contacts with other beings are real 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.550
 but that many of them would also be 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.920
 possibly an expression an expression 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.020
 of whom he says of the cosmos a 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.380
 expression of the same universe and saying 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.110
 there you humans understand that they are not 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.750
 the only ones there is something beyond and that 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.050
 well they are only a small part of 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.370
 the reality speaks of there being three 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.620
 types of beings in the world that are the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.930
 that have shape and that also have 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.690
 good physical appearance what can be 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.810
 touch us we would only 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.240
 way but that can not be touched without 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.850
 to give an example what would be a 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.880
 typical ghost not a person a being 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.130
 that you just can not see but there 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.940
 this is like a kind of hologram and 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.910
 the third way of being would not be 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.140
 consciousness not pure consciousness 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.570
 you just can not touch level 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.000
 it's just there like that as a 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.740
 pretty interesting conscience the 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.070
 concept of the dalai lama 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.640
 and surely this topic will be 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.830
 retaken by all the associations 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.850
 of psychiatry and psychology that are 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.310
 supporting the dalai lama looking for a bit 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.350
 connect with them with awareness and be 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.360
 human with the unconscious and in fact 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.490
 has given them many results yet and that 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.890
 I feel that there is not create much 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.480
 have brought many of their methods of 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.400
 meditation and how to see the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.130
 conscious and the unconscious and make them 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.040
 incredible results to diseases 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.810
 ments that they believed had no cure 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.970
 in fact there is a lot of criticism towards the lama 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.230
 in the aspect that has become a 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.410
 image therefore very close to the big ones 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.070
 political leaders and very far to the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.550
 society and there good because there are many 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.660
 I 'm going to be commenting 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.820
 many situations that have to do 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.740
 with strange phenomena in relation to 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.800
 spiritual leaders in the world 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.979
 included 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.949
 or people are secretary of the map or people 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.569
 very close to different leaders and that 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.060
 Well, they are quite interesting that 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.740
 sounds even more crazy and 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.860
 even that this one that I'm telling 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.270
 but good to be in another day in 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.590
 another chapter and we will be here 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.590
 talking on the route bar
