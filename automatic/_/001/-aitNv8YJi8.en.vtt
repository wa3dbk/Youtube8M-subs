00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
definitely you know I think we had a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.500 
definitely you know I think we had a
great<00:00:20.279> spring<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.850> know<00:00:20.939> after<00:00:21.210> doing

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
great spring you know after doing

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.140 
great spring you know after doing
everything<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.289> did<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> offseason

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
everything that we did in the offseason

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.240 
everything that we did in the offseason
the<00:00:24.150> guys<00:00:24.330> came<00:00:24.570> out<00:00:24.660> working<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.199> really<00:00:25.980> had

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the guys came out working and really had

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.970 
the guys came out working and really had
the<00:00:26.400> focus<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.420> know<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.660> were<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.560> half

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the focus that you know we were a half

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
the focus that you know we were a half
of<00:00:29.130> football<00:00:29.279> away<00:00:29.730> from<00:00:30.060> being<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> Super

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
of football away from being in the Super

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.080 
of football away from being in the Super
Bowl<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.949> think<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> was<00:00:32.669> an<00:00:32.790> extra

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
Bowl and I think that was an extra

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.819 
Bowl and I think that was an extra
motivation<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.750> our<00:00:33.840> guys<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.050> come<00:00:34.680> together

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
motivation for our guys to come together

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.770 
motivation for our guys to come together
and<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.309> think<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:35.940> did<00:00:36.090> some<00:00:36.210> good<00:00:36.360> things<00:00:36.420> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and I think we did some good things and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.330 
and I think we did some good things and
training<00:00:37.200> camps<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> blast<00:00:37.950> touch

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
training camps going to be a blast touch

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.410 
training camps going to be a blast touch
me<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> little<00:00:38.730> bit<00:00:38.820> about<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.210> young

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
me a little bit about the young

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
me a little bit about the young
quarterback<00:00:39.989> Mark<00:00:40.770> Sanchez<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.340> mean

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
quarterback Mark Sanchez I mean

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.310 
quarterback Mark Sanchez I mean
certainly<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.329> watched<00:00:42.660> him<00:00:42.989> grow

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
certainly we all watched him grow

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.220 
certainly we all watched him grow
describe<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.370> me<00:00:44.550> how<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.059> saw<00:00:45.629> him<00:00:45.870> grow

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
describe to me how you saw him grow

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
describe to me how you saw him grow
throughout<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.770> season<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> think

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
throughout the season you know I think

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.250 
throughout the season you know I think
it<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.120> really<00:00:48.360> impressive<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.899> he<00:00:49.050> did

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
it was really impressive what he did

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.959 
it was really impressive what he did
about<00:00:49.950> halfway<00:00:50.160> through<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.550> season<00:00:50.730> he<00:00:50.940> was

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
about halfway through the season he was

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
about halfway through the season he was
having<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> little<00:00:51.449> down<00:00:51.690> spell<00:00:51.989> things

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
having a little down spell things

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.350 
having a little down spell things
weren't<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.800> great<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.100> him<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.180> at<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
weren't going great for him and at that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.939 
weren't going great for him and at that
point<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.020> look<00:00:55.230> at<00:00:55.350> rookies<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
point you know you look at rookies you

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.380 
point you know you look at rookies you
could<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.219> either<00:00:56.340> way<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:56.789> could<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.360> know

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
could go either way they could you know

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.490 
could go either way they could you know
put<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> tank<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.379> get

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
put it in the tank or they can get

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
put it in the tank or they can get
better<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.859> he<00:00:58.949> got<00:00:59.129> better<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.579> he<00:01:00.270> really

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
better and he got better and he really

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.209 
better and he got better and he really
showed<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> playoffs<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.100> know

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
showed that in the playoffs and you know

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.399 
showed that in the playoffs and you know
this<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.969> offseason<00:01:03.359> having<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.260> know

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
this this offseason having you know

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.800 
this this offseason having you know
being<00:01:05.040> physically<00:01:05.519> limited<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.689> has

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
being physically limited I think has

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.969 
being physically limited I think has
helped<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> ton<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.619> he<00:01:07.710> hadn't

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
helped in the ton because he hadn't

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.250 
helped in the ton because he hadn't
really<00:01:08.220> got<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.970> studied<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> learn<00:01:10.049> what

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
really got in and studied to learn what

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.289 
really got in and studied to learn what
he<00:01:10.320> had<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.710> he<00:01:11.220> seems<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.640> he's<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> natural

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
he had to he seems like he's a natural

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.090 
he had to he seems like he's a natural
leader<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:12.750> still<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> grow<00:01:13.560> into<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
leader but still have to grow into that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.429 
leader but still have to grow into that
role<00:01:14.369> meanwhile<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.210> lose<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.810> definitive

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
role meanwhile you lose a definitive

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.190 
role meanwhile you lose a definitive
leader<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> team<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.790> Alan<00:01:18.090> sanika<00:01:18.630> how

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.140 
leader on the team and Alan sanika how
much<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.100> loss<00:01:20.520> will<00:01:20.820> affect

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
