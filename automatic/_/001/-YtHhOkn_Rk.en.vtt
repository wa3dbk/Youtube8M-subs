00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.469
 and nice that you watch craft TV yes 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.660
 I always get my inspiration from myself 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.850
 magazines magazines and the shooter 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.949
 then the leaves from the articles 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.560
 let you of course have fun 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.269
 cutting dead that touch today what 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.160
 I need that for that 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.449
 first of all plan box i have a nice one 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.369
 need papers 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.009
 nice fabrics but how scraps of paper 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.160
 I also use some nice applications 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.930
 we need the plastic and east end 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.789
 well i need the shape of one of 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.260
 bake a cutout 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:44.300
 so what I am going to do is one 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:49.280
 bookstore to cut it out looked at him 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.399
 there that is about to the bottom of 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.260
 see this blue piece of ears that we have to 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.140
 go in smeer meet nice papers 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.149
 on the side shelves of everything there are 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.030
 chance of being where you filip 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.339
 nicely match this check mark for needed 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.740
 everything to watch does not work on one 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.940
 nice way because then small piece of that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.760
 you want to design use your life 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.350
 Normally if you run knowledge a lot 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.540
 larger pieces we stick 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.420
 look and the great thing about this line is that 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.310
 when you stick paper on paper it 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.350
 not going to schedule comes out but there is 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.360
 no water nose line 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.510
 they very often 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.570
 [Music] 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.100
 popular what you really drink something 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.260
 in addition, a parent looks like I have 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.030
 all our rolls are in the house and then 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.350
 can of course save in a boring one 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.509
 shoe box 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.490
 but I can also imagine a nice storage box 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.050
 from what i need you to 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.259
 start a shoe box 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.119
 various fabric applications and me too 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.100
 use the everything line 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.659
 well I have already selected some fabrics 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.909
 and cut to size 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.350
 then I put this on the box lines well what 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.600
 is very, very important if you have a line 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.460
 Use with dust so that you don't get too much 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.910
 glue used and otherwise let through the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.220
 dust 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.509
 and that doesn't look that good, therefore 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.789
 I go the lead first on the box 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.520
 apply to spawn later 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.630
 we stopped for a great combination 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.700
 made 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.080
 well i have blue with pink heart is beautiful 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.120
 only nice now together so we correct 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.590
 nice oh yeah and i'm going 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.790
 [Music] 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.040
 he that has become beautiful 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.390
 nice but is not quite ready yet 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.980
 because I want him a little bit too 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.319
 is decorated 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.030
 I have a poetry pictures call it 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.280
 is nice when clicking 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:41.250
 I actually want to block it above 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.760
 glue stick is handy for time and again 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.580
 that's a nice one 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.430
 passing from 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.270
 because yes that is about to do that is one 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.030
 good eh 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.660
 at the inconvenience with a flower 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.190
 look this is worst complication is nice very nice 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.190
 and I also had a few davy silence 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.140
 cut look and then that 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.000
 top look then this will be fine 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.569
 useful 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.380
 so that we go here is now mine 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.840
 is almost ready 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.000
 well I don't think those lines are time either 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.110
 there were so nice stutter miscreant himself 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.340
 So I have your party with tape over 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.940
 so it is completely new to have to 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.819
 release 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.170
 yeah to cheer that up there too 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.730
 a very nice joke 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.260
 [Music] 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.330
 so that already 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.330
 [Music] 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.189
 what are you gonna do i'm gonna be mine 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.680
 craft supplies in the stoppers 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.879
 now you try to lie through the entire house 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.810
 happy with the end result 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.000
 and view here yes I think it is beautiful 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.739
 but you 're not kidding me that already 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.200
 your craft stuff limits 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.359
 I am afraid that I have more of these 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.189
 have to make boxes when I have everything gone 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.680
 wants to work but is fun to do 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:56.280
 anyway i think it just seemed like that and that 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.280
 watch your lesson 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.050

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.050
 [Music] 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.950
 [Music] 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.959

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.130
 I'm going to make something else anyway 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.300
 namely this painting where you are not 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.550
 for having to paint and draw 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.210
 if this is a bit too childish 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.550
 The episode 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.550
