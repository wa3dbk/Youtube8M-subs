it's<00:00:12.420> pretty<00:00:12.690> simple<00:00:13.019> figure-eight<00:00:13.730> you're

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
it's pretty simple figure-eight you're

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.210 
it's pretty simple figure-eight you're
basically<00:00:15.089> making<00:00:15.269> like<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:16.049> horizontal<00:00:17.040> eight

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
basically making like a horizontal eight

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.200 
basically making like a horizontal eight
with<00:00:17.910> your<00:00:18.060> arm<00:00:18.590> now<00:00:19.590> there's<00:00:19.919> also<00:00:20.099> a<00:00:20.640> circle

with your arm now there's also a circle
that<00:00:21.300> goes<00:00:21.509> behind<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.349> way<00:00:22.559> like<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.380> as

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that goes behind you this way like so as

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.900 
that goes behind you this way like so as
you<00:00:25.559> can<00:00:25.680> notice<00:00:25.890> think<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.520> clock

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you can notice think of it like a clock

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.499 
you can notice think of it like a clock
okay

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
okay

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.970

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
over to the other side of our body once

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
over to the other side of our body once
we<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.040> twelve<00:00:38.280> o'clock

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
pulls over to this side of the body

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.730 
pulls over to this side of the body
twelve<00:00:42.030> o'clock<00:00:42.480> pulls<00:00:42.990> over<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.440> side

twelve o'clock pulls over to this side

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.190 
twelve o'clock pulls over to this side
twelve<00:00:44.430> o'clock<00:00:44.790> so<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.690> practice<00:00:45.810> that

pull it over like you're slashing the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.440 
pull it over like you're slashing the
sword<00:00:50.130> Shoom<00:00:50.430> I'll<00:00:50.610> stand<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.000> direction<00:00:51.329> so

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
sword Shoom I'll stand this direction so

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.910 
sword Shoom I'll stand this direction so
you<00:00:51.540> can<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.870> once<00:00:52.380> way<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> twelve<00:00:52.860> o'clock

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
you can see once way to twelve o'clock

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
you can see once way to twelve o'clock
we're<00:00:53.550> pulling<00:00:53.790> it<00:00:53.910> over<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:54.239> other<00:00:54.360> side

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
we're pulling it over to the other side

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.280 
we're pulling it over to the other side
of<00:00:54.720> our<00:00:54.810> body

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
of our body

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.920 
of our body
12<00:00:55.560> o'clock<00:00:55.710> /<00:00:56.390> eventually<00:00:57.390> you'll<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.750> be

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
12 o'clock / eventually you'll just be

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.100 
12 o'clock / eventually you'll just be
making<00:00:58.079> these<00:00:58.350> slashes<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.550> looks<00:00:59.700> like<00:00:59.790> a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
making these slashes and it looks like a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.420 
making these slashes and it looks like a
infinity<00:01:01.110> sign<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:01.500> sideways<00:01:01.890> eight<00:01:02.070> that's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
infinity sign or sideways eight that's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.819 
infinity sign or sideways eight that's
exactly<00:01:02.970> what<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.270> want<00:01:03.480> now<00:01:04.290> tighten<00:01:04.649> it<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
exactly what you want now tighten it a

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.370 
exactly what you want now tighten it a
little<00:01:04.860> bit<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.759> that<00:01:05.970> by<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.930> way<00:01:07.079> you<00:01:07.110> will

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
little bit like that by the way you will

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.289 
little bit like that by the way you will
be<00:01:07.500> burning<00:01:07.710> yourself<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.430> use<00:01:08.549> fire

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
be burning yourself if you use fire

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.789 
be burning yourself if you use fire
nunchucks<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.929> this<00:01:10.109> because<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> fire

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
nunchucks like this because the fire

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.230 
nunchucks like this because the fire
would<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.069> like<00:01:11.219> right<00:01:11.429> underneath<00:01:11.759> your<00:01:11.969> arm

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
would be like right underneath your arm

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.690 
would be like right underneath your arm
so<00:01:12.920> that's<00:01:13.920> when<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.249> start<00:01:14.549> working

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
so that's when you start working

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.129 
so that's when you start working
something<00:01:15.090> called<00:01:15.359> wrist<00:01:15.600> rolls<00:01:15.840> which<00:01:16.049> is

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.139 
something called wrist rolls which is

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:17.480 
something called wrist rolls which is
something<00:01:16.289> that<00:01:16.409> we'll<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.740> working<00:01:16.889> on<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
something that we'll be working on a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.639 
something that we'll be working on a
little<00:01:18.179> bit<00:01:18.299> later<00:01:19.280> here<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.789> here<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.749> now

little bit later here here here here now

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.260 
little bit later here here here here now
we're<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:22.859> to<00:01:22.920> stop<00:01:23.189> I'm<00:01:23.789> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:23.999> turn<00:01:24.119> it

splashing upwards before see how we're

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:59.149 
splashing upwards before see how we're
slashing<00:01:57.359> downwards<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.289> you're<00:01:58.859> doing<00:01:59.069> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
slashing downwards if you're doing the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.370 
slashing downwards if you're doing the
reverse<00:01:59.490> figure<00:01:59.880> 8<00:02:00.029> slashing<00:02:00.899> upwards<00:02:01.229> like

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
reverse figure 8 slashing upwards like

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.830 
reverse figure 8 slashing upwards like
this<00:02:01.439> up<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.909> every<00:02:03.209> time<00:02:03.359> it<00:02:03.450> hits<00:02:03.539> six

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
this up so every time it hits six

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.580 
this up so every time it hits six
o'clock<00:02:04.169> slashes<00:02:05.159> up<00:02:05.310> six<00:02:06.029> o'clock<00:02:06.329> up<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.529> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
o'clock slashes up six o'clock up so it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.389 
o'clock slashes up six o'clock up so it
looks<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.859> this

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
looks like this

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.140 
looks like this
or<00:02:09.269> if<00:02:09.420> we're<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.049> direction<00:02:14.150> okay

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
or if we're going this direction okay

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.759 
or if we're going this direction okay
for<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.049> direction<00:02:16.560> up<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.849> up

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
for this direction up up up

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.500 
for this direction up up up
as<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.099> see<00:02:20.340> there's<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.849> circle<00:02:21.180> here<00:02:21.390> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
as you can see there's a circle here to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.910 
as you can see there's a circle here to
circle<00:02:21.870> here<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.230> it's<00:02:22.319> just<00:02:22.500> crossing

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
circle here and it's just crossing

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.210 
circle here and it's just crossing
between<00:02:23.220> these<00:02:23.340> two<00:02:23.610> circles<00:02:24.120> right<00:02:25.220> every

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
between these two circles right every

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.000 
between these two circles right every
time<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:26.519> hit<00:02:26.640> six<00:02:26.909> o'clock<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.629> pulls<00:02:27.930> up<00:02:28.170> six

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
time we hit six o'clock it pulls up six

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.270 
time we hit six o'clock it pulls up six
o'clock<00:02:29.370> pulls<00:02:30.299> up<00:02:30.540> six<00:02:31.140> o'clock<00:02:31.470> pulls<00:02:32.040> up

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
o'clock pulls up six o'clock pulls up

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.369 
o'clock pulls up six o'clock pulls up
six<00:02:32.819> o'clock<00:02:33.120> pulls<00:02:33.420> up<00:02:33.599> here's<00:02:34.200> an

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
six o'clock pulls up here's an

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.080 
six o'clock pulls up here's an
interesting<00:02:34.590> thing<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.579> pull<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.849> up<00:02:35.940> at

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
interesting thing if we pull it up at

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.270 
interesting thing if we pull it up at
six<00:02:36.360> o'clock<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.989> once<00:02:37.440> we<00:02:37.560> hit<00:02:37.650> 12<00:02:37.980> o'clock

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
six o'clock and once we hit 12 o'clock

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.449 
six o'clock and once we hit 12 o'clock
we<00:02:38.489> can<00:02:38.670> turn<00:02:38.879> 180<00:02:39.540> degrees<00:02:39.920> okay<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.129> then<00:02:41.340> we

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
we can turn 180 degrees okay and then we

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.210 
we can turn 180 degrees okay and then we
can<00:02:41.640> reverse<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.239> let<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.140> sit<00:02:43.470> for<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.769> second

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
can reverse it let that sit for a second

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.309 
can reverse it let that sit for a second
okay<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.090> what<00:02:45.239> I'm<00:02:45.359> saying<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:45.930> I'm<00:02:46.079> doing

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
okay so what I'm saying is if I'm doing

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.319 
okay so what I'm saying is if I'm doing
reverse<00:02:47.040> here<00:02:47.430> we're<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:47.849> up<00:02:47.970> at<00:02:48.090> six

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
reverse here we're going up at six

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.720 
reverse here we're going up at six
o'clock<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:49.410> moment<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.769> had<00:02:49.890> 12<00:02:50.160> o'clock<00:02:50.459> I

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
o'clock the moment I had 12 o'clock I

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.880 
o'clock the moment I had 12 o'clock I
can<00:02:51.120> turn<00:02:51.329> this<00:02:51.450> direction<00:02:52.109> and<00:02:52.319> now<00:02:52.379> we'll<00:02:52.769> do

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
can turn this direction and now we'll do

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.339 
can turn this direction and now we'll do
a<00:02:52.920> regular<00:02:53.280> figuring<00:02:53.940> at<00:02:54.090> 12<00:02:54.329> o'clock<00:02:54.629> it'll

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
a regular figuring at 12 o'clock it'll

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.099 
a regular figuring at 12 o'clock it'll
it'll<00:02:55.769> move<00:02:56.010> perfectly<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:57.060> I'm<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.989> in

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
it'll move perfectly so I'm going in

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.470 
it'll move perfectly so I'm going in
Reverse<00:02:58.440> every<00:02:59.370> time<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.609> hit<00:02:59.819> six<00:03:00.120> o'clock<00:03:00.450> you

time to learn but I'm telling you this

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.080 
time to learn but I'm telling you this
is<00:03:36.180> like<00:03:36.389> the<00:03:36.959> core<00:03:37.410> because<00:03:38.280> what<00:03:38.940> you're

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
is like the core because what you're

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.520 
is like the core because what you're
doing<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.389> you're<00:03:39.510> opening<00:03:39.810> movement<00:03:40.139> you're

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
doing is you're opening movement you're

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.470 
doing is you're opening movement you're
opening<00:03:40.829> your<00:03:41.040> ability<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.639> be<00:03:42.030> able<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.359> move

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480
