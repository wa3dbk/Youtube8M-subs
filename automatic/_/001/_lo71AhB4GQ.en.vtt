00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.660 

so<00:00:03.210> I<00:00:03.240> say<00:00:03.570> we<00:00:03.600> are<00:00:03.840> some<00:00:04.080> students<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.740> grab<00:00:05.640> a

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
so I say we are some students to grab a

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.440 
so I say we are some students to grab a
random<00:00:06.029> number<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.779> counties<00:00:07.519> and<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:09.179> arts

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
random number of counties and the arts

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.720 
random number of counties and the arts
and<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.719> count<00:00:09.990> them<00:00:10.200> but<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:10.980> time<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.460> said

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
and to count them but this time we said

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.459 
and to count them but this time we said
to<00:00:11.880> them<00:00:12.030> can<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.719> tell<00:00:12.929> me<00:00:13.049> whether<00:00:13.230> or<00:00:13.349> not

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
to them can you tell me whether or not

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.310 
to them can you tell me whether or not
the<00:00:13.889> number<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.670> you've<00:00:15.059> got<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.630> even<00:00:16.199> or

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
the number that you've got is even or

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.429 
the number that you've got is even or
odd<00:00:16.379> oh<00:00:17.039> no<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.119> there<00:00:18.600> an<00:00:18.750> efficient<00:00:19.230> way<00:00:19.410> to

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
odd oh no is there an efficient way to

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.870 
odd oh no is there an efficient way to
represent<00:00:20.070> an<00:00:20.550> even<00:00:20.910> number<00:00:21.240> odd<00:00:21.600> number<00:00:22.880> you

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
represent an even number odd number you

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.460 
represent an even number odd number you
can<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.390> represent<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.930> numbers<00:00:25.260> this

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
can see if we represent the numbers this

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.310 
can see if we represent the numbers this
way<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:27.090> even<00:00:27.359> when<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.689> collection<00:00:28.109> gets

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
way and even when the collection gets

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.040 
way and even when the collection gets
really<00:00:28.740> large<00:00:28.949> when<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.970> organizing<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.840> two

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
really large when the organizing to two

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.620 
really large when the organizing to two
Negroes<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.369> obviously<00:00:32.820> an<00:00:33.120> even

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
Negroes like this it's obviously an even

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.370 
Negroes like this it's obviously an even
number<00:00:34.070> what<00:00:35.070> about<00:00:35.190> an<00:00:35.460> odd<00:00:35.610> number<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
number what about an odd number so you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.950 
number what about an odd number so you
can<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.680> an<00:00:37.800> odd<00:00:37.920> numbers<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.540> an<00:00:39.690> even

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
can see an odd numbers is like an even

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
can see an odd numbers is like an even
number<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.559> either<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.070> either<00:00:41.430> plus

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
number but it's either just either plus

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.150 
number but it's either just either plus
1<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.120> minus<00:00:42.750> 1<00:00:42.960> from<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.530> even<00:00:43.829> number<00:00:44.129> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
1 or minus 1 from that even number so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.490 
1 or minus 1 from that even number so
it's<00:00:44.460> got<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.879> extra<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.960> counter

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it's got that extra little counter

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.220 
it's got that extra little counter
seeing<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> top<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:48.390> once<00:00:48.570> again<00:00:48.690> even<00:00:49.140> if

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
seeing at the top and once again even if

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.830 
seeing at the top and once again even if
the<00:00:49.410> collection<00:00:49.890> gets<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.489> large<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:51.570> it's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the collection gets really large if it's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.810 
the collection gets really large if it's
represented<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.710> way<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.219> see<00:00:53.610> with

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
represented in this way we can see with

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.720 
represented in this way we can see with
even<00:00:54.270> without<00:00:54.539> counting<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
even without counting them that it's a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.920 
even without counting them that it's a
an<00:00:56.940> odd<00:00:57.390> numbered<00:00:57.840> collection<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.510> let's<00:01:00.690> see

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
an odd numbered collection so let's see

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.900 
an odd numbered collection so let's see
what<00:01:00.960> happens<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.620> start<00:01:01.890> adding<00:01:02.219> be

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
what happens when we start adding be

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
what happens when we start adding be
even<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.270> even<00:01:03.449> numbers<00:01:03.750> even<00:01:04.680> an<00:01:04.979> odd

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
even and even numbers even an odd

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.140 
even and even numbers even an odd
numbers<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> even<00:01:06.299> odd<00:01:06.510> an<00:01:06.689> odd<00:01:06.840> numbers<00:01:08.150> if

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
numbers and even odd an odd numbers if

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.510 
numbers and even odd an odd numbers if
we<00:01:09.390> look<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:10.049> even<00:01:10.470> number<00:01:10.740> let's<00:01:11.280> take<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
we look at a an even number let's take a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.179 
we look at a an even number let's take a
small<00:01:11.880> number<00:01:12.180> say<00:01:12.390> six<00:01:12.830> notice<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.010> we

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
small number say six notice that we

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.399 
small number say six notice that we
could<00:01:14.400> bust<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.880> number<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.420> into<00:01:15.750> two<00:01:15.930> parts

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
could bust that number up into two parts

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.179 
could bust that number up into two parts
in<00:01:16.590> 24<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.570> 24<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.630> 2<00:01:18.990> by<00:01:19.409> themselves<00:01:19.920> are

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
in 24 and 24 and 2 by themselves are

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.969 
in 24 and 24 and 2 by themselves are
both<00:01:20.460> even<00:01:21.150> numbers<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.710> when<00:01:22.860> we

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
both even numbers and so that when we

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.340 
both even numbers and so that when we
add<00:01:23.159> two<00:01:23.460> even<00:01:24.090> numbers<00:01:24.119> together<00:01:24.630> we'll<00:01:25.229> get

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
add two even numbers together we'll get

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.120 
add two even numbers together we'll get
another<00:01:25.710> fever<00:01:26.009> number<00:01:27.619> what<00:01:28.619> about<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:29.009> we

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
another fever number what about if we

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.440 
another fever number what about if we
add<00:01:29.310> an<00:01:29.600> even<00:01:30.600> number<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.350> an<00:01:31.560> odd<00:01:31.680> number<00:01:32.450> so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
add an even number and an odd number so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.380 
add an even number and an odd number so
let's<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:35.189> one<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.670> example<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
let's look at this one for example and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.440 
let's look at this one for example and
we've<00:01:36.509> got<00:01:36.750> six<00:01:37.079> plus<00:01:37.320> five<00:01:38.000> notice<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> six

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
we've got six plus five notice the six

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.960 
we've got six plus five notice the six
is<00:01:39.630> even<00:01:40.140> because<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:40.950> shown<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:41.729> those

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
is even because it can be shown as those

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.410 
is even because it can be shown as those
two<00:01:42.329> nice<00:01:42.570> even<00:01:43.110> rows<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.590> three<00:01:43.759> but<00:01:44.759> fives<00:01:45.090> an

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
two nice even rows of three but fives an

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.499 
two nice even rows of three but fives an
odd<00:01:45.659> number<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.710> got<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.159> two<00:01:47.790> rows<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.090> two

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
odd number it's got the two rows of two

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.050 
odd number it's got the two rows of two
plus<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.259> extra<00:01:49.380> one<00:01:49.710> at<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> top<00:01:50.130> notice<00:01:50.939> if

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
plus the extra one at the top notice if

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.370 
plus the extra one at the top notice if
you<00:01:51.090> were<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.630> join<00:01:51.869> those<00:01:52.170> together

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you were to just join those together

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.350 
you were to just join those together
you're<00:01:53.159> still<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.149> odd

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
you're still going to have that odd

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.069 
you're still going to have that odd
numbered<00:01:54.840> shape<00:01:56.299> once<00:01:57.299> again<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.930> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
numbered shape once again see this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.100 
numbered shape once again see this
example<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:59.000> push<00:02:00.000> those<00:02:00.270> three<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
example here push those three on to the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.289 
example here push those three on to the
top<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:02.009> once<00:02:02.219> again<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.700> still<00:02:02.969> at<00:02:03.090> odd

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
top and once again is still at odd

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.260 
top and once again is still at odd
numbered<00:02:03.719> shape<00:02:04.219> so<00:02:05.219> an<00:02:05.369> even<00:02:05.670> number<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.149> an

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
numbered shape so an even number and an

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.930 
numbered shape so an even number and an
odd<00:02:06.390> number<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.990> an<00:02:07.229> odd<00:02:07.350> number<00:02:07.789> but<00:02:08.789> what

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
odd number is an odd number but what

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.020 
odd number is an odd number but what
about<00:02:08.970> an<00:02:09.360> odd<00:02:09.599> number<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.289> an<00:02:10.890> odd<00:02:11.039> number<00:02:11.250> so

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
about an odd number and an odd number so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.730 
about an odd number and an odd number so
let's<00:02:12.270> say<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:12.450> had<00:02:12.690> five<00:02:12.989> plus<00:02:13.349> four

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
let's say we had five plus four

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.670 
let's say we had five plus four
I've<00:02:14.600> if<00:02:15.600> that's<00:02:15.840> not<00:02:15.990> immediately<00:02:16.590> obvious

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
I've if that's not immediately obvious

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.800 
I've if that's not immediately obvious
what<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.940> look<00:02:18.120> what<00:02:18.330> happens<00:02:18.660> if

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
what it is have a look what happens if

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.050 
what it is have a look what happens if
you<00:02:18.930> turn<00:02:19.200> around<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.830> top<00:02:20.070> 5<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:20.850> turn<00:02:21.030> it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
you turn around that top 5 just turn it

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.380 
you turn around that top 5 just turn it
upside<00:02:21.450> down<00:02:21.740> see<00:02:22.740> how<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.010> two<00:02:23.160> now<00:02:23.610> meet<00:02:24.210> Lee

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
upside down see how the two now meet Lee

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.530 
upside down see how the two now meet Lee
together<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.050> you'll<00:02:25.530> get<00:02:25.680> an<00:02:25.770> even<00:02:26.070> number

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
together and you'll get an even number

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.850 
together and you'll get an even number
and<00:02:27.540> once<00:02:27.720> again<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.140> doesn't<00:02:28.320> matter<00:02:28.560> how

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
and once again it doesn't matter how

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.070 
and once again it doesn't matter how
large<00:02:29.130> those<00:02:29.580> collections<00:02:30.000> get<00:02:30.510> two<00:02:30.870> odd

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
large those collections get two odd

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.010 
large those collections get two odd
numbers<00:02:31.560> turn<00:02:32.250> one<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.610> them<00:02:32.730> upside<00:02:33.060> down<00:02:33.360> and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
numbers turn one of them upside down and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.590 
numbers turn one of them upside down and
it<00:02:34.140> will<00:02:34.260> fit<00:02:34.440> neatly<00:02:34.800> into<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.490> other<00:02:35.640> one<00:02:35.850> so

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
it will fit neatly into the other one so

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.540 
it will fit neatly into the other one so
an<00:02:36.750> odd<00:02:36.870> number<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.410> an<00:02:37.530> odd<00:02:37.680> number<00:02:37.890> isn't

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
an odd number and an odd number isn't

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.000 
an odd number and an odd number isn't
even
