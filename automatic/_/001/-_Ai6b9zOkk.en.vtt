we knew it was happening based on what

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
we knew it was happening based on what
we<00:01:38.310> had<00:01:38.460> been<00:01:38.579> taught<00:01:38.880> like<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> wind<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.170> how

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
we had been taught like the wind and how

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.080 
we had been taught like the wind and how
the<00:01:40.380> wind<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> going<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> affect<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> behavior

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the wind is going to affect the behavior

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.050 
the wind is going to affect the behavior
of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> fire<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.049> how<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.409> may<00:01:43.560> heat<00:01:44.220> stand

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
of the fire and how it may heat stand

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880 
of the fire and how it may heat stand
nearby<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.020> you'll<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> radiant<00:01:46.740> heat

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
nearby and you'll have the radiant heat

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.560 
nearby and you'll have the radiant heat
coming<00:01:47.250> off<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.820> may<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.119> spotting

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
coming off and then you may get spotting

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.810 
coming off and then you may get spotting
