00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.680
 Look, this video of ours is one that gave 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.780
 wrong because there was a problem that 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.630
 I 'll explain but it serves very well. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.179
 to tell you when to use the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.109
 close to us we are doing the painting 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.279
 car crash with the classic 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:27.390
 to read it is matte 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.760
 Look here is his painting here 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.309
 on the hood of the car 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.570
 the original bright original fifth of 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.149
 car it get more strength but shape 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.760
 this rubberized protective layer against 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.300
 those stone pogues like that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.700
 hence what happens in the car 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.850
 as you travel by using the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.289
 the front of the car is chopped 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 marking forces, especially those who 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.160
 travels a lot of road 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.079
 there is the effect it is force is 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.059
 ink in the normal shiny car 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.850
 the error was the following we need to give 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.180
 one exit and a rainstorm of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.050
 suddenly what happened to a show at the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.940
 throw the time off 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:21.550
 a show then we're going to have to remove 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:26.090
 a step of and reapply then an error is 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.620
 let the unit pick up on your 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.810
 product during application 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.170
 so seizing the error happened to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.000
 entertain the placid user so that 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.270
 make the same mistake 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.910
 here we have another deliberate mistake 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.800
 and it has already been spoiled even in the 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.800
 we used to show 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.130
 do not try to dry with the hair dryer 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.000
 or thermal blower was that it does 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.230
 these bubbles there it risk here in the image 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.540
 You will not see 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:05.420
 but it formed micro bubbles who in this 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.330
 selected region 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.060
 because there is the use of air on top of it 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.740
 promotes these bubbles wines and spoils 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.010
 product does not use 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.780
 hair or thermal blower let 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.970
 they are, of course, only 15 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.750
 minutes and prevents this from happening 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.180
 problem 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.760
 so there is a video that did not work 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.550
 But I could tell you what not 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.630
 to do one more time is just painting 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:44.250
 normal bright and how it stays 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:48.330
 protected by the player part 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.220
 the transparent matte is not there miledge 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.000
 We'll post a video later. 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.000
 with the brilliant
