bolts in into the wood and I put 10 inch
rooms<00:01:48.210> across<00:01:48.810> sticks<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.469> it<00:01:49.560> makes<00:01:49.710> it

roughly 24 inches long these holes
you'll<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.429> holes<00:01:53.700> around<00:01:54.030> each<00:01:54.420> side

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
you'll see these holes around each side

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.429 
you'll see these holes around each side
that's<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:56.450> like<00:01:57.450> great<00:01:57.780> points<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.409> that

work<00:02:22.920> at<00:02:23.220> all<00:02:24.079> when<00:02:25.079> I<00:02:25.110> use<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:26.400> would<00:02:27.060> get

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
work at all when I use this it would get

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.110 
work at all when I use this it would get
my<00:02:27.510> quadcopter<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.950> engine<00:02:29.459> on<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.760> after

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
my quadcopter the engine on it after

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.300 
my quadcopter the engine on it after
this<00:02:30.540> fine<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> little<00:02:31.290> over<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.650> minute<00:02:31.859> or<00:02:32.280> two

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
this fine a little over a minute or two

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.369 
this fine a little over a minute or two
minute<00:02:32.730> did<00:02:33.540> be<00:02:33.840> burning<00:02:34.650> hot<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:36.209> um<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.930> mean

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
minute did be burning hot so um I mean

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.770 
minute did be burning hot so um I mean
burning<00:02:37.859> hot<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.519> what<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.209> ended<00:02:39.269> up<00:02:39.599> just

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
burning hot so what I ended up just

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.750 
burning hot so what I ended up just
doing<00:02:40.109> was<00:02:40.319> chopping<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.069> two<00:02:41.220> wires<00:02:41.459> off

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
doing was chopping the two wires off

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
doing was chopping the two wires off
here<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.500> pretty<00:02:43.500> much<00:02:43.590> scrapping<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.340> but

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
here and pretty much scrapping this but

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.970 
here and pretty much scrapping this but
underneath<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:46.200> I'll<00:02:46.470> show<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.859> a

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
underneath this I'll show you in a

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.680 
underneath this I'll show you in a
second<00:02:47.370> what's<00:02:47.639> happened<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.359> they<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.660> a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
second what's happened is they have a

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.030 
second what's happened is they have a
whole<00:02:48.930> bunch<00:02:49.079> of<00:02:49.200> different<00:02:49.500> solder<00:02:49.769> points

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
whole bunch of different solder points

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.420 
whole bunch of different solder points
and<00:02:51.319> pretty<00:02:52.319> much<00:02:52.380> like<00:02:52.650> at<00:02:52.889> the<00:02:53.010> bottom<00:02:53.310> of

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
and pretty much like at the bottom of

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.400 
and pretty much like at the bottom of
this<00:02:53.549> right<00:02:53.760> here<00:02:54.000> transia<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.200> show<00:02:55.349> you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
this right here transia and show you

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.449 
this right here transia and show you
this<00:02:56.209> see<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.540> right<00:02:57.810> there<00:02:58.099> there's<00:02:59.099> little

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
this see so right there there's little

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.830 
this see so right there there's little
solder<00:02:59.669> points<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.359> soldered<00:03:00.720> on

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
solder points and I just soldered on

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.210 
solder points and I just soldered on
bullet<00:03:01.230> connectors<00:03:01.650> all<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:02.010> way<00:03:02.099> around

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
bullet connectors all the way around

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.330 
bullet connectors all the way around
like<00:03:02.579> this<00:03:02.959> but<00:03:03.959> in<00:03:04.319> here<00:03:04.849> so<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:07.099> if<00:03:08.099> an

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
like this but in here so that now if an

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.339 
like this but in here so that now if an
engine<00:03:08.579> or<00:03:09.090> an<00:03:09.209> ESC<00:03:09.690> or<00:03:09.720> something<00:03:10.169> like<00:03:10.290> that

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
engine or an ESC or something like that

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.690 
engine or an ESC or something like that
goes<00:03:10.739> out<00:03:10.919> all<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:11.910> have<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.239> do<00:03:12.569> is<00:03:13.459> unplug<00:03:14.459> it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
goes out all I have to do is unplug it

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.879 
goes out all I have to do is unplug it
and<00:03:14.790> replug<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.359> back<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.560> that's<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.859> really

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
and replug it back in so that's a really

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.470 
and replug it back in so that's a really
nice<00:03:17.280> feature<00:03:17.519> as<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.880> can<00:03:18.030> see<00:03:18.239> right<00:03:18.269> now

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
nice feature as you can see right now

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.159 
nice feature as you can see right now
about<00:03:18.930> right<00:03:19.620> there<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:21.209> bullet<00:03:21.569> connector

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
about right there is a bullet connector

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.970 
about right there is a bullet connector
looking<00:03:22.470> straight<00:03:22.919> at<00:03:23.099> it<00:03:24.470> them<00:03:25.470> are<00:03:25.620> just<00:03:25.650> all

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
looking straight at it them are just all

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.099 
looking straight at it them are just all
around<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:26.609> thing<00:03:26.849> because<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.930> has<00:03:28.079> that

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
around this thing because it has that

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.979 
around this thing because it has that
the<00:03:29.010> UM<00:03:29.750> power<00:03:30.750> distributor<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.569> that<00:03:33.569> is<00:03:33.750> so

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
the UM power distributor and that is so

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.140 
the UM power distributor and that is so
nice<00:03:34.230> having<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.680> power<00:03:35.220> distributor<00:03:35.940> and

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
nice having that power distributor and

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.449 
nice having that power distributor and
another<00:03:36.660> thing<00:03:36.810> i<00:03:37.169> really<00:03:37.410> like<00:03:37.590> with<00:03:38.010> this<00:03:38.190> is

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
another thing i really like with this is

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.869 
another thing i really like with this is
the<00:03:39.359> fact<00:03:39.629> that<00:03:39.919> right<00:03:40.919> here<00:03:41.129> are<00:03:41.250> zoom<00:03:41.549> in<00:03:41.730> on

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
the fact that right here are zoom in on

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.089 
the fact that right here are zoom in on
it<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.180> can<00:03:42.450> see<00:03:42.629> it<00:03:42.750> right<00:03:43.440> here<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.919> see

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
it so you can see it right here you see

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.699 
it so you can see it right here you see
a<00:03:44.129> little<00:03:44.340> positive<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.389> negative<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.620> you

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
a little positive and negative so you

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.550 
a little positive and negative so you
can<00:03:46.949> plug<00:03:47.160> in<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:47.639> want<00:03:47.669> lights<00:03:48.289> but<00:03:49.289> for

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
can plug in if you want lights but for

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.210 
can plug in if you want lights but for
me<00:03:49.680> for<00:03:49.709> aerial<00:03:50.280> filming<00:03:50.489> right<00:03:50.789> now

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
I will be soldering a wire harness that

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.850 
I will be soldering a wire harness that
leads<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.690> my<00:04:02.160> game<00:04:03.160> book<00:04:03.400> over<00:04:03.970> here<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:05.020> down

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
leads to my game book over here so down

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.730 
leads to my game book over here so down
here<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.880> shoots<00:04:07.120> down<00:04:07.330> there<00:04:07.600> is<00:04:08.110> my<00:04:08.350> gimbal

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
here it shoots down there is my gimbal

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.940 
here it shoots down there is my gimbal
and<00:04:08.980> right<00:04:09.640> now<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:09.820> have<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.420> battery<00:04:10.720> on<00:04:11.050> it<00:04:11.170> so

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
and right now I have a battery on it so

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.130 
and right now I have a battery on it so
you<00:04:12.880> know<00:04:13.000> it's<00:04:13.270> a<00:04:13.330> little<00:04:13.510> bit<00:04:13.720> of<00:04:13.810> extra

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
wire here into a power lead from here

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.600 
wire here into a power lead from here
because<00:04:25.390> it<00:04:25.540> these<00:04:25.870> here<00:04:26.110> little<00:04:26.470> things<00:04:26.800> but
