eleven<00:01:11.430> dollars<00:01:12.049> okay<00:01:14.000> if<00:01:15.000> I'm<00:01:15.180> doing<00:01:15.299> my<00:01:15.509> math

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
eleven dollars okay if I'm doing my math

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.990 
eleven dollars okay if I'm doing my math
correctly<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.560> rough<00:01:16.770> estimate<00:01:16.979> about<00:01:17.369> 11

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
correctly just a rough estimate about 11

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.800 
correctly just a rough estimate about 11
bucks<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.720> those<00:01:19.439> cash<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.130> were<00:01:20.640> about<00:01:21.540> five

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
bucks and those cash you were about five

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.539 
bucks and those cash you were about five
dollars<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.320> fifty<00:01:22.590> cents<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.220> took<00:01:23.369> up

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
dollars and fifty cents so that took up

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.440 
dollars and fifty cents so that took up
half<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:25.159> half<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.369> everything<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.850> bought<00:01:27.090> so

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
half of half of everything I bought so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.390 
half of half of everything I bought so
for<00:01:28.020> everything<00:01:28.380> else<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:28.770> about<00:01:28.950> five<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
for everything else was about five and a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
for everything else was about five and a
half<00:01:29.430> bucks<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.390> think<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> pretty<00:01:31.170> good

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
half bucks so I think it's a pretty good

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.480 
half bucks so I think it's a pretty good
deal<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.740> me<00:01:31.890> that's<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.430> pretty

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
deal for me that's that's pretty

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.230 
deal for me that's that's pretty
inexpensive<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> anyway<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:35.790> wanted<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
inexpensive so anyway I just wanted to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.620 
inexpensive so anyway I just wanted to
show<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:37.020> what<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.850> what<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> came<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.360> with

depends if my wife eats some of it two

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.109 
depends if my wife eats some of it two
or<00:01:48.960> three<00:01:48.990> days<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:50.040> beans<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.579> last<00:01:50.850> two<00:01:51.090> or

three days the apples were probably last

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.690 
three days the apples were probably last
three<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.460> four<00:01:53.490> days<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:55.259> tomatoes<00:01:56.070> two<00:01:56.460> days

three or four days the tomatoes two days
so<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.200> couple<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.740> days

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so you know if this is a couple of days

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.280 
so you know if this is a couple of days
of<00:01:59.189> vegetables<00:01:59.790> along<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> other

of vegetables along with the other
vegetables<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.299> my

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
vegetables that I have you know in my

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.880 
vegetables that I have you know in my
refrigerator<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.350> out<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:07.259> know<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.860> can

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
refrigerator and out so you know you can

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.820 
refrigerator and out so you know you can
you<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:09.179> buy<00:02:09.450> food<00:02:09.780> inexpensively<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
you can buy food inexpensively and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.720 
you can buy food inexpensively and
actually<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.810> find<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
actually I find that the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.330 
actually I find that the
that<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.000> most<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.020> time<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.590> vegetables

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
that the most of the time the vegetables

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.910 
that the most of the time the vegetables
are<00:02:17.459> far<00:02:17.790> cheaper<00:02:17.819> than<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.410> buy<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
are far cheaper than if you buy in the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.280 
are far cheaper than if you buy in the
like<00:02:20.580> fresh<00:02:20.970> Mart<00:02:21.270> it's<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:21.599> convenient<00:02:22.020> in

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
like fresh Mart it's just convenient in

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.089 
like fresh Mart it's just convenient in
fresh<00:02:22.470> much<00:02:22.650> because<00:02:22.800> if<00:02:22.890> you're<00:02:22.980> going

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
fresh much because if you're going

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.610
