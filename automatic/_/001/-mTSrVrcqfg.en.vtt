00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello to you all Chris and u know 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.010
 a few years ago porn oxygen but only 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.710
 started and 1 console gene index 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.590
 It is considered view who would not say what 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.440
 yes console view was essentially with 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.500
 obsolete iron and so on but still 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.420
 she was the first x gene console and nobody with 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.840
 I hope it will not be arguing 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.599
 the point is that the console had quite good 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.779
 exclusives like bayonetta 2 or 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.309
 zambia and about the second project now i 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.579
 I want to talk to you 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.129
 not so long ago, Zambia was ported to 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.129
 ps4 and xbox one for now 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.430
 and removed with a bet then you bukovki 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.379
 there is now this zombie game but today i 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.570
 browsed the port of the game for you 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.899
 Well, in principle, I will tell my opinion from 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.079
 this game Sit back heed 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.020
 and reprimand for you also I am a pleasant chris 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.600
 viewing drove and the first thing you want 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.840
 say this is port quality 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.990
 honestly the port turned out quite good 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.360
 no honest 1200 rubles for a good port 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.000
 it is in our time very well let's say 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.310
 good money pony that game in 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.770
 principle is not bad for me so well 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.110
 secondly we get a great port 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.229
 management is redone to play well 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.869
 it feels great and all the chips view 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.360
 were quite well adapted under bye 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.490
 and honestly played on so far 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.549
 I do not touch the console version although I think 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.220
 Kate Kate as they heard the same 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.680
 good and the first thing to say 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.869
 that all the chips view tablet have gone 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.710
 we now have no so the whole interface and 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.860
 all other 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.680
 on our screen as you know it is not 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.229
 plus and not minus I will tell you honestly 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.939
 adapted well and that's all you can 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.369
 had anything come up innovative 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.590
 but as a result, in principle, a good idea is 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.840
 there are with interfaces all brought them clearly 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.780
 just on the screen did more 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.119
 comfortable that is, you can use it 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.360
 you can play and so on it is not 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.209
 annoying let's say honestly next chip with 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.009
 multiplayer and he nafig drank that is 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.560
 Here are these tips that helped 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.170
 leave olya dark souls them you 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.819
 horseradish do not know why maybe steam 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.209
 narrow multiplayer does not suit nintendo 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.480
 maybe something else and scales 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.300
 pardon well and appear and multiplayer 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.030
 now we have no 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.989
 thing that has come down unchanged and should be 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.060
 It was used to know this graphics two years ago 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.670
 when the game came out she was already with 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.160
 outdated graphics and here it turns out 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.580
 we see already quite outdated 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.380
 graphics ie 2015 forgive this 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.840
 greek some very amateur 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.600
 project unity of some and damn 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.970
 looks like a thousand with us inconspicuous in general 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.090
 not not that but if you don't find fault ul so 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.360
 the graphics then we got zambia just for 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.310
 so far there is no youth and this is probably 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.099
 problem of this pc game 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.040
 I will tell you to play comfortably play everything 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.650
 ok and so on 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.680
 I personally have one big such problem 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.030
 here probably many will not understand but chips 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.650
 There is no view and this is a real problem if 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.750
 when you played blame you all 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.000
 interfaces everything else was on the tablet 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.980
 it was relatively interesting to play 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.470
 and cool because fish preview they were 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.079
 but not bad days to be honest now 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.880
 without them, the game looks somehow mundane 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.060
 the game is short passed for hours 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.000
 five hours at best and 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.980
 damn, that is, and how we do 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.220
 a short game with not so much 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.829
 innovative gameplay and without any 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.870
 interesting chips in here are all the usual zombies 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.900
 only survived in 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.200
 linear reality inshape port turned out 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.750
 not bad yes the game itself is not bad but 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.900
 she is not bad in reality video in reality 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.049
 playstation 4 or looks like 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.569
 somehow figovin to honestly therefore 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.760
 I personally advise you not to buy this game 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.600
 for 1200 rubles for it really 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.440
 high price 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.870
 I personally think brute force if you 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.019
 you can afford it then buy it 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.810
 on the view and really it will be worth it 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:26.070
 for the rest, if you rate the game 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.620
 the game but for now I will probably put 6 5 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.610
 here and 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.430
 and on the view I would put 8 and 5 out of 10 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.860
 considering the console well, and that's all with you 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.949
 was i chris write your opinion about this 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.949
 the game in the comments successful meetings yet
