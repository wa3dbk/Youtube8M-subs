00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.560
 Hello my life, welcome to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.300
 There is a new video of me today 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.570
 with me a super fast 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.059
 shake pizza the recipe I have with 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.489
 It's actually discovered on Facebook 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.949
 now in my case no chute 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.470
 tips but rather a tube-pizza 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.870
 yes that's a little hype there 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.120
 just a little bit on facebook bypasses that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.510
 is a very low calorie local pizza 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.159
 no flour comes in and yes I have 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.680
 thought I just try it in the 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.780
 imitate schedule 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.220
 yes I hope it succeeds more than 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.799
 It can not go wrong 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.479
 we'll start right now and that's right 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.670
 Preheat with the oven 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.930
 You can open your oven 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.950
 Preheat 240 degrees above ground 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.470
 We start with one red and one 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.090
 yellow paprika I have washed now 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.689
 guts these white bonnets 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.790
 cut out and so big about in 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.700
 pieces cut 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.220
 they could keep up with that one then 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.380
 I'll do the cooked one right away 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.190
 ham and I have now 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.060
 here 150 grams of cooked shiithe 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.160
 I now times are arranged in rows as one page 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.160
 that was nicely distributed 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.189
 who likes can now also onions 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.820
 to give but I leave today 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.100
 Let my children eat like that and it 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.219
 I have to downsize now and that 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.069
 I'm now so 30 down first 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.479
 Level 5 and then look like tall or 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:09.369
 small the pieces celebration 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:12.720
 they are relatively small if 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.280
 you want her to be taller you should 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.370
 switch off before or just two 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.010
 seconds to change the whole small 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.140
 so I go now the edible of the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.579
 down what is high here has power 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.579
 So just sign everything 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.130
 many eggs 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:45.799
 a cup that is exactly 200 kings 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.709
 cream cheese then come 100 grams 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.799
 grated cheese or you can too 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.160
 mozzarella take in small pieces and 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:58.099
 because just add 100 grams and it 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:07.220
 come still rich tablespoon of wheat bran 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:08.840
 you can also live here but me 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.900
 Call two at the same time I believe I have 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.359
 collected on facebook 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.650
 Someone took some ground almonds 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.930
 So you can decide that 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.480
 so and now only one comes 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.629
 a few spices add a little salt 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.629
 bit of pepper 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.810
 and a teaspoon I'll take this 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.670
 pizza and pasta spice from maqi but 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.190
 if you as such has a mixture a 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.980
 herbal mixture on oregano thyme 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.580
 basil you can also Italian 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:55.530
 herbs just go through foliage 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:56.480
 the measure of it all on the left running each 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.670
 case 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:09.300
 I would say for 4 seconds 4 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:15.360
 earlier and I try so good 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:18.630
 So now you can if you have one 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.400
 baptism have the whole mass easy 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.930
 Distribute on a magic stone or you 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.910
 just divide the mass into one 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.520
 baking tray with baking paper of course 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.600
 interpret before and all the time up 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.600
 a baking sheet dead 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.590
 so and now comes a pizza for 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.560
 about 30 minutes at 240 degrees above 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.110
 heat down to the bottom of the oven 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.360
 and do so my love I have 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.710
 our for pizza from the oven fetched 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.010
 I already have five now 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.040
 minutes earlier brought out because they me 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.480
 but relatively dark, I was there 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.510
 not even counting I 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.180
 thought there you do not need to look and 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.680
 then it has become like that 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.830
 do not find it burned now though 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.140
 she is a little bit out of life here 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.430
 dark 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.570
 Of course, I would like to join you now 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.700
 Try it now looks completely 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.220
 thin 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:34.160
 and here you can see there is a small factory 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.700
 pieces of yellow and red and now 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.700
 I'll try 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:50.400
 tastes really now why 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:54.070
 Prospect pizza now does not like such a 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:58.180
 typical pizza from italian but for that 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:09.010
 that's a very low calorie record 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:14.320
 pizza is no longer in it 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:18.940
 no yeast is just some of these eggs 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:24.790
 Cream cheese so great I have to say there 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:27.660
 it is really delicious 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.820
 especially if we accept it now 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:34.320
 ever look at our bikini figure 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.310
 work great summer for me soon 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.890
 Of course you can now too 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.250
 instead of the cooked ham tuna 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:50.260
 take or salami is just then again 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:50.770
 a bit calorie-containing so me 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.270
 I am sooo delicious 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:07:00.220

00:06:52.270 --> 00:07:02.169
