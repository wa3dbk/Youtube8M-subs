00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.930 
to show you the reasons why hast is ten
times<00:00:21.960> worse<00:00:22.259> the<00:00:22.890> first<00:00:23.099> reason<00:00:23.250> why<00:00:23.550> hate<00:00:23.760> is

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
like a hundred times better is because

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.400 
like a hundred times better is because
slingshock<00:00:27.180> takes<00:00:27.449> more<00:00:27.630> often<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.050> that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
slingshock takes more often and that

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.750 
slingshock takes more often and that
sounds<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.800> high<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:28.980> mighty<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.550> but

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
sounds all high and mighty in that but

global cooldown is the way to go the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.109 
global cooldown is the way to go the
fourth<00:01:07.680> region<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.430> obviously<00:01:08.789> it

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
fourth region is that obviously it

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.140 
fourth region is that obviously it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
reduces costs time of your everything so

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
reduces costs time of your everything so
obviously<00:01:13.020> which<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.409> test<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.830> your

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.690 
if this Lazarus with a proper mastery I
would<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.140> won<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:47.400> you<00:01:47.490> could<00:01:47.579> have

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
would have won and then you could have

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.960 
would have won and then you could have
been<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:48.650> instead<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:50.670> would<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.850> won

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
been like instead you would have won

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.100 
been like instead you would have won
because<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.390> would<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.600> been<00:01:51.810> casting

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
because you would have been casting

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
because you would have been casting
about<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> million<00:01:52.619> things<00:01:52.799> at<00:01:52.979> once<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.670> taste

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
about a million things at once the taste

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.749 
about a million things at once the taste
so<00:01:54.180> case<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> way<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.950> sure<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.579> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
so case is the way to go for sure and it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.039 
so case is the way to go for sure and it
gives<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.030> more<00:01:57.240> survivability<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:57.960> you

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
gives you more survivability with you

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.319 
gives you more survivability with you
healing<00:01:58.380> tide<00:01:58.619> give<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.729> more<00:01:59.909> damage

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
there's a larva stage props and the fact

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.160
