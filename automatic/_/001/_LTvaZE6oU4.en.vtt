00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.400
 This time I'm here and I 'm going to do it. 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.870
 a video of you as you are 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.389
 adding in your videos in resolution 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.389
 4k the new youtube resolution 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.100
 so come on guys it's pretty easy to do 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.180
 this before I start the video I 'm going to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.210
 say something for you to understand 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 make that resolution 4k resolution 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.369
 our vegas pro or sony vegas like you 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.530
 They want to prefer to talk, I tried to do it. 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.750
 can not because they are a little 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 old but it does not have the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.010
 maximum to handle with 4k resolution 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.600
 Also having sung studio also did not 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.210
 worked because it does not have the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.149
 ability to withstand this resolution and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.370
 I tried here in the after effects s6 and in the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.379
 if you think it was the only one that 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.300
 My case that you accepted should also

 when initiating 4k resolution on my idol 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.740
 the case is very 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.830
 You have to have a monster monitor to 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.240
 you can see and if this is 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.890
 the project that is causing them to 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.080
 They are planning a beauty. 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.550
 So that's what I'm going to give up. 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.680

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.470
 he imagines the business a thousand times called 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.900
