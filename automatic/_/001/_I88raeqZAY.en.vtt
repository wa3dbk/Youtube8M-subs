gave<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.739> some<00:02:52.980> welly<00:02:53.189> and<00:02:53.459> it's<00:02:53.579> just

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
gave it some welly and it's just

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.390 
gave it some welly and it's just
happened

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
happened

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.000 
happened
so<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.180> think

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
so I think

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.270 
so I think
the<00:02:56.400> boys<00:02:56.610> are<00:02:56.849> on<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.030> way<00:02:57.120> back<00:03:01.280> they

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
the boys are on the way back they

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.100 
the boys are on the way back they
quickly<00:03:02.640> mended<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.330> again<00:03:03.599> but<00:03:03.870> by<00:03:04.049> this

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
quickly mended it again but by this

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.930 
quickly mended it again but by this
