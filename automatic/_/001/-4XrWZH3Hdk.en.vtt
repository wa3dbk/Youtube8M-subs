cycles<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:50.729> did<00:01:50.970> irritate<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> dogs

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
cycles it really did irritate the dogs

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.380 
cycles it really did irritate the dogs
now<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.070> language<00:01:53.399> barrier<00:01:53.850> but

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
now we do have this language barrier but

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
now we do have this language barrier but
I<00:01:54.450> believe<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:54.960> said<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.649> dogs<00:01:55.920> were<00:01:56.130> actually

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
I believe he said the dogs were actually

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.120 
I believe he said the dogs were actually
hiding<00:01:56.880> behind<00:01:57.390> objects<00:01:58.110> which<00:01:58.740> made<00:01:58.979> me

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
hiding behind objects which made me

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.450 
hiding behind objects which made me
laugh<00:01:59.360> he<00:02:00.360> added<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.320> realized<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
laugh he added to that I realized the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.209 
laugh he added to that I realized the
generator<00:02:03.060> annoyance<00:02:03.840> now<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.920> personally

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
generator annoyance now I personally

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.389 
generator annoyance now I personally
believe<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.930> 10,000<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> 15,000<00:02:07.860> cycles<00:02:08.250> is

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
believe that 10,000 to 15,000 cycles is

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.999 
believe that 10,000 to 15,000 cycles is
too<00:02:08.700> low<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.060> frequency<00:02:09.599> because<00:02:10.440> people<00:02:10.800> will

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
too low of frequency because people will

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.890 
too low of frequency because people will
hear<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.489> another<00:02:12.150> thing<00:02:12.420> I'd<00:02:12.599> like<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
hear it another thing I'd like to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.540 
hear it another thing I'd like to

this<00:02:13.700> man<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.240> Italy<00:02:14.690> said<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.140> he<00:02:15.290> used<00:02:15.320> five

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
this man in Italy said that he used five

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.030 
this man in Italy said that he used five
watts<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.670> drive<00:02:16.910> these<00:02:17.270> tweeters<00:02:17.690> and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
watts to drive these tweeters and

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.680 
watts to drive these tweeters and
personally<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.070> think<00:02:19.550> five<00:02:19.790> watts<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.360> not

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
personally I think five watts is not

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.410 
personally I think five watts is not
enough<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.320> do<00:02:21.680> understand<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.640> when<00:02:23.300> you're

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
enough I do understand that when you're

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.240 
enough I do understand that when you're
talking<00:02:23.840> about<00:02:23.930> piezo<00:02:24.470> tweeters<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.070> you're

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
talking about piezo tweeters that you're

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.580 
talking about piezo tweeters that you're
not<00:02:25.400> really<00:02:25.610> concerned<00:02:26.090> with<00:02:26.270> watts<00:02:26.720> but

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
not really concerned with watts but

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.530 
not really concerned with watts but
you're<00:02:27.800> actually<00:02:28.070> concerned<00:02:28.730> with<00:02:28.910> voltage

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
you're actually concerned with voltage

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.110 
you're actually concerned with voltage
the<00:02:30.500> voltage<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.220> signal<00:02:31.430> that's<00:02:31.820> applied

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
the voltage of the signal that's applied

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.300 
the voltage of the signal that's applied
to<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.360> tweeter<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.960> I<00:02:33.800> don't<00:02:33.860> think

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
to the tweeter and I don't think

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.400 
to the tweeter and I don't think
personally<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.300> five<00:02:35.600> watt<00:02:36.020> amplifier

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
personally that a five watt amplifier

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.280 
personally that a five watt amplifier
will<00:02:37.370> give<00:02:37.550> enough<00:02:37.850> voltage<00:02:38.390> level<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.260> a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
will give enough voltage level to a

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.530 
will give enough voltage level to a
piezo<00:02:39.710> tweeter<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.340> deliver<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.030> power<00:02:41.240> that

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
piezo tweeter to deliver the power that

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.200 
piezo tweeter to deliver the power that
I<00:02:41.600> think<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.020> needed<00:02:42.230> unless<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.340> use<00:02:43.580> say<00:02:43.910> a

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
I think is needed unless you use say a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.260 
I think is needed unless you use say a
frequency<00:02:44.990> capable<00:02:45.700> voltage<00:02:46.700> step-up

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
frequency capable voltage step-up

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.990 
frequency capable voltage step-up
transformer<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:47.960> some<00:02:48.320> type<00:02:48.560> let<00:02:49.550> me<00:02:49.640> just<00:02:49.820> say

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
transformer of some type let me just say

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.240 
transformer of some type let me just say
one<00:02:50.180> more<00:02:50.360> thing<00:02:50.420> from<00:02:50.780> my<00:02:50.960> own<00:02:51.080> opinion<00:02:51.590> make

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
one more thing from my own opinion make

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.370 
one more thing from my own opinion make
sure<00:02:52.490> you<00:02:52.640> know<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.060> resonant<00:02:53.600> frequency<00:02:54.170> of

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
sure you know the resonant frequency of

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.580 
sure you know the resonant frequency of
any<00:02:54.710> particular<00:02:55.390> piezo<00:02:56.390> tweeter<00:02:56.780> there<00:02:57.440> are

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
any particular piezo tweeter there are

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.640 
any particular piezo tweeter there are
frequencies<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.940> tweeters<00:02:59.840> are<00:03:00.050> more

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
frequencies that tweeters are more

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.500 
frequencies that tweeters are more
efficient<00:03:01.220> at<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.580> that's<00:03:01.880> where<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.300> need

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
efficient at and that's where you need

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.690 
efficient at and that's where you need
to<00:03:02.630> use<00:03:02.660> them<00:03:03.050> but<00:03:03.680> thanks<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.160> much<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.580> this
