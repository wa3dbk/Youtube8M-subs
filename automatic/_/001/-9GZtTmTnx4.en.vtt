like that all the legal stuff rule the
air<00:00:38.130> and<00:00:39.130> then<00:00:39.880> on<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.420> bottom<00:00:42.870> you've<00:00:43.870> got

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
air and then on the bottom you've got

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.640 
air and then on the bottom you've got
pretty<00:00:44.860> much<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:45.280> weeds<00:00:45.640> FCC<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.960> it's<00:00:47.470> also

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
pretty much that weeds FCC and it's also

shows its Android hearing and capable
and<00:00:50.260> then<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.460> believe<00:00:51.760> this<00:00:52.150> is<00:00:52.360> what's<00:00:52.570> in<00:00:52.660> the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
and then I believe this is what's in the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.900 
and then I believe this is what's in the
box<00:00:52.900> it's<00:00:53.530> all<00:00:53.650> says<00:00:53.890> its<00:00:54.040> carbon<00:00:54.280> free<00:00:54.670> it's

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
box it's all says its carbon free it's

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.640 
box it's all says its carbon free it's
used<00:00:55.120> by<00:00:55.240> versa<00:00:55.540> it's<00:00:55.840> using<00:00:56.170> recycled

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
used by versa it's using recycled

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.620 
used by versa it's using recycled
plastic<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:57.250> it's<00:00:57.400> a<00:00:57.520> kind<00:00:57.730> of<00:00:57.820> little<00:00:58.540> bit

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
plastic so it's a kind of little bit

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.750 
plastic so it's a kind of little bit
more<00:00:58.800> environmentally<00:00:59.800> friendly<00:01:00.310> so<00:01:00.640> let's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
more environmentally friendly so let's

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.510 
more environmentally friendly so let's
go<00:01:00.850> ahead<00:01:00.880> and<00:01:01.330> open<00:01:01.810> up<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.320> box<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.740> by<00:01:03.460> the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
go ahead and open up the box and by the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.160 
go ahead and open up the box and by the
way<00:01:03.760> while<00:01:04.269> I'm<00:01:04.390> doing<00:01:04.509> this<00:01:04.659> I<00:01:04.809> will<00:01:04.930> go<00:01:05.049> ahead

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
way while I'm doing this I will go ahead

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.550 
way while I'm doing this I will go ahead
and<00:01:05.439> say<00:01:05.679> that<00:01:05.890> this<00:01:06.009> is<00:01:06.189> going<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.460> be<00:01:06.729> also<00:01:07.030> a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
me to have that but I guess it would be

me to have that but I guess it would be
more<00:02:32.870> convenient<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.440> have<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:33.920> way<00:02:34.720> on

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
it which again is kind of surprising but

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.610

network and your location like i said

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.070 
network and your location like i said
before<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:49.190> does<00:04:49.280> have<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.520> 3<00:04:49.940> megapixel<00:04:50.180> camera

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
before it does have a 3 megapixel camera

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.740 
before it does have a 3 megapixel camera
which<00:04:52.009> actually<00:04:52.250> looks<00:04:52.580> pretty<00:04:52.759> nice<00:04:53.060> for

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
which actually looks pretty nice for

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.999 
which actually looks pretty nice for
being<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.800> 3<00:04:54.979> megapixel<00:04:55.099> camera<00:04:59.470> so<00:05:00.470> that's

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
being a 3 megapixel camera so that's

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.760 
being a 3 megapixel camera so that's
what<00:05:01.160> it's<00:05:01.280> going<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.430> look<00:05:01.520> like<00:05:02.530> so<00:05:03.530> it's<00:05:03.650> not

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
what it's going to look like so it's not

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.120 
what it's going to look like so it's not
bad<00:05:04.039> of<00:05:04.940> course<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.270> does<00:05:05.419> show<00:05:05.660> 3<00:05:06.500> megapixels

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
bad of course it does show 3 megapixels

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.700 
bad of course it does show 3 megapixels
down<00:05:07.250> at<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.400> bottom<00:05:09.880> so

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.040 

let's<00:05:14.310> uh<00:05:14.400> get<00:05:15.180> back<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.450> the<00:05:15.540> home<00:05:15.690> screen

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.780 

okay<00:05:21.050> so<00:05:21.110> this<00:05:21.380> this<00:05:21.860> phone<00:05:22.100> does<00:05:22.370> come<00:05:22.670> with

going to if it will update to 2.2 all I

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.530 
going to if it will update to 2.2 all I
know<00:05:28.760> is<00:05:28.880> it<00:05:28.970> is<00:05:29.060> launching<00:05:29.420> with<00:05:29.570> 2.1<00:05:31.030> also<00:05:32.030> it

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
know is it is launching with 2.1 also it

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.020 
know is it is launching with 2.1 also it
is<00:05:32.840> a<00:05:32.870> 3<00:05:33.380> inch<00:05:33.590> screen<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.400> resolution<00:05:34.790> is

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
is a 3 inch screen the resolution is

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.520 
is a 3 inch screen the resolution is
actually<00:05:35.330> 320<00:05:35.960> x<00:05:36.110> 240<00:05:36.800> which<00:05:38.020> sadly<00:05:39.020> is<00:05:39.290> not

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
actually 320 x 240 which sadly is not

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.080 
actually 320 x 240 which sadly is not
that<00:05:39.770> great<00:05:40.160> of<00:05:40.220> a<00:05:40.400> resolution<00:05:40.790> you<00:05:41.060> can

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
that great of a resolution you can

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.250 
that great of a resolution you can
definitely<00:05:41.570> see<00:05:41.690> just<00:05:41.930> from<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.110> phone

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
definitely see just from the phone

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.230 
definitely see just from the phone
starting<00:05:42.650> up<00:05:42.770> that<00:05:42.980> it<00:05:43.400> kind<00:05:43.610> of<00:05:43.670> pixel<00:05:44.090> lights

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
starting up that it kind of pixel lights

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.930 
starting up that it kind of pixel lights
a<00:05:44.360> little<00:05:44.480> bit<00:05:45.460> but<00:05:46.460> I<00:05:46.520> guess<00:05:46.700> that's

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
a little bit but I guess that's

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.010 
a little bit but I guess that's
