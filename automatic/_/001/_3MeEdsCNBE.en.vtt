 and the navigator itself 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.730
 case for lexan dough 70 made form 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.739
 a small bag made of suede tie in 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.329
 material it gets dirty very quickly 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.760
 collecting all the dust and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.549
 but to protect the navigator from scratches is quite 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.009
 can stay outwardly 0 not 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.500
 different from minus navigators lexand

 second generation android navigators already 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.360
 looks different but specifically considering 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.340
 the model has the same plastic from the case 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
 chrome plated and gray

 back cover 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.039
 device design unassuming and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.259
 practical on the front side is 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.190
 only thick black frame with logo 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.590
 manufacturer 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.610
 located behind the speaker and recessed 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.640
 The reset button on the top is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.340
 power button dimple for mounting and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.250
 holes for an already useless stylus 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.590
 headphone jack on the left 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.950
 mini usb for charging and card compartment 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.000
 micro sd memory for and and insert well 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.000
 they have long nails 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.689
 the same will not interfere with its withdrawal 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.979
 below there are only two killings for 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.640
 mounting on the glass to the right there is nothing 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.910
 single-core boxchip a13 processor from 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.340
 chinese company elvenar navigator 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.590
 there is 512 megabytes of RAM 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.170
 and 4 gigabytes of built-in 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.750
 battery capacity is 3000 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.000
 milliampere hour screen navigators not 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.060
 diagonal of 7 jinn when solving everything 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.620
 800 by 480 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.900
 use is clearly not expensive matrix with 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.900
 pale colors and poor viewing angles 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.519
 And which manages android 4 0 4 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.040
 why not control very quickly 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.769
 responsiveness of the interface and clearly not the most 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.690
 high for ease of calling basic 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.790

 Russian services including 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.010
