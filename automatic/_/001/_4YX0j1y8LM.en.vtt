00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.639
 Hi, I know it's not very winter 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.530
 but I wanted a salad 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.110
 lentils so here you have it 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.029
 it would have been better to soak the 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.590
 lentils the night before but if you 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.380
 suddenly they crave it also 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.869
 you can put directly with water in 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.210
 a pot with four times the water 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.009
 of lentils you can also put a 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.349
 pinch of salt and a splash of oil 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.149
 of extra virgin olive we put the fire to 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.980
 stop when it starts to boil we lower it 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.010
 to the minimum and we leave it until they are 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.719
 soft between half and one hour apart from 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.969
 the lentils the salad will have to 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.969
 brown so in abundant boiling water 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.859
 we put it about 18 minutes and if you want 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.050
 that take some flavor you can put 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.879
 plus a pinch of salt and a 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.159
 trickle of olive oil a tooth of 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.859
 garlic and a bay leaf while 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.230
 do all this we are going to chop the radish 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.899
 and we 're going to hydrate it with the onion 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.319
 that is to say that we put it in water between 5 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.319
 and 10 minutes 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.450
 apart we are going to prepare a vinaigrette to 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.280
 mustard base we put a spoonful of 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.700
 mustard a good jet of oil 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.960
 extra virgin olive a pinch of salt and 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.960
 a little wine vinegar 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.730
 and stir until you get it right 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.960
 good lentils are ready the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.960
 we drain and let them cool 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.150
 and we are going to complete the salad with 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.150
 chopped chives 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.280
 we put it next to the vinaigrette the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.710
 lentils 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.540
 rice 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.540
 radishes and onions 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.140
 and it's no longer season of tomatoes but 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.580
 some cherry can be supported like this 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.580
 that we are going to add a handful 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.550
 do not 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.550
 we mix everything well 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.010
 two 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.430
 and this putting the lettuce in the base 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.140
 It looks very nice but then it's something 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.420
 cumbersome to eat it 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.740
 and well this is already I hope that I have 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.740
 liked a hug until then
