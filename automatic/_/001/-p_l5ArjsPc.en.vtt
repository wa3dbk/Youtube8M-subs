00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.940
 1 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 me 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 1 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.190
 hello to all and welcome 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.530
 in this funny game on the witcher 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.199
 more precisely the second installment of the 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.060
 assassin's of kings series so this 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.590
 suite was released on pc in 2011 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.419
 four years after his elder 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.919
 why I chose the second then 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.389
 first of all because you are strong 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.250
 probably more to have 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.720
 heard about it and that at the level of 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.280
 realization and especially at the level of 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.050
 the atmosphere we achieve something 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.610
 more pronounced than the first 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.100
 indeed thanks to the evolution of 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.110
 the witcher 2 graphics is so a rpg 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.460
 in which despite a great narration 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.690
 is a pretty dirigiste story 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.610
 we are led to explore a universe 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.259
 fantastic medieval through 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.449
 different areas as and when 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.130
 the story what I really wanted 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.960
 represented in this dancing mcv the 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.820
 goods the colorful environments and 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.460
 varied deep its fantastic scenery 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.050
 are making dream this background game that 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.849
 gives an impression of grandeur with 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.470
 it's blurry it's light is this cycle 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.539
 day night that changes the colors and 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.820
 the general atmosphere of each place has 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.830
 what do you tape in front of your screen 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.650
 the home engine of cd projekt the raid 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.060
 engine does wonders even if one 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.710
 lacks a little bit of freedom 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.659
 movement we can stay for hours at 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.030
 admire the textures on the ground the sky the 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.539
 vegetation moving and even 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.710
 monsters 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.389
 at least until we get 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.260
 take a nice slap for the drawing 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.180
 I chose a place quite 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.280
 emblematic of this second component the forest 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.780

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.190

 will pass letter for the first time in 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.300
 anyway these gigantic trees their 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.550
 roots creating reliefs in the middle of 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.699
 rocks of streams or ruins 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.500
 all with variations atmospheres 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.060
 as the day progresses 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.060
