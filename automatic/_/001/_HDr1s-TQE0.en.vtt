00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
it's all about driving we choose that

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.750 
it's all about driving we choose that
one<00:02:22.350> can<00:02:23.350> see<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.950> outline<00:02:24.100> of<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> engine

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
one can see the outline of the engine

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.540 
one can see the outline of the engine
back<00:02:24.910> there<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.450> will<00:02:25.720> not<00:02:25.900> be<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:27.100> for

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
back there that will not be this for

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.360 
back there that will not be this for
debugging<00:02:27.910> purposes<00:02:28.620> won't<00:02:29.620> be<00:02:29.770> possible<00:02:29.980> in

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
debugging purposes won't be possible in

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.270 
debugging purposes won't be possible in
the<00:02:31.030> finished<00:02:31.450> version<00:02:31.950> there<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.070> not<00:02:33.250> much

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the finished version there is not much

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.790 
the finished version there is not much
room<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:33.700> longer<00:02:34.180> two<00:02:34.330> more<00:02:34.360> if<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.900> if<00:02:35.560> you

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
room for longer two more if you if you

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.250 
room for longer two more if you if you
check<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.190> way<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:36.730> yeah<00:02:37.330> transverse<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.140> is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
check this way so yeah transverse it is

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.690 
check this way so yeah transverse it is
and<00:02:38.730> what<00:02:39.730> we<00:02:39.940> are<00:02:40.180> going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.870> do<00:02:41.020> here<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.620> to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.560 

don't<00:02:45.700> care<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.030> first<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.560> then<00:02:48.459> you<00:02:48.880> will

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
don't care for first and then you will

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.380 
don't care for first and then you will
be<00:02:49.750> happy<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.290> see<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.769> following<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:52.030> you

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
be happy to see the following if you

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.949 
be happy to see the following if you
place<00:02:52.750> events<00:02:53.230> in<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:54.130> back<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:55.239> will<00:02:55.660> now

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
place events in the back this will now

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.910 
place events in the back this will now
work<00:02:56.940> there's<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.150> very<00:02:58.480> buggy<00:02:58.690> but<00:02:59.380> in

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
work there's the very buggy but in

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.800 
work there's the very buggy but in
principle<00:03:00.070> there<00:03:00.489> working<00:03:00.910> we<00:03:01.360> are<00:03:01.480> not<00:03:01.600> going

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
principle there working we are not going

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.970 
principle there working we are not going
to<00:03:01.930> put<00:03:02.080> all<00:03:02.260> too<00:03:02.470> much<00:03:02.620> power<00:03:03.160> into<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.910> sky

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
to put all too much power into the sky

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.759 
to put all too much power into the sky
so<00:03:05.980> what<00:03:06.250> we<00:03:06.459> are<00:03:06.660> aiming<00:03:07.660> for<00:03:08.110> here<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:09.329> just

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
so what we are aiming for here is just

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.340 
so what we are aiming for here is just
like<00:03:11.769> 200<00:03:12.190> kilowatts<00:03:12.600> let<00:03:13.600> me<00:03:13.750> quick<00:03:14.079> build

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
like 200 kilowatts let me quick build

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.220 
like 200 kilowatts let me quick build
one<00:03:14.709> engine<00:03:15.130> here<00:03:15.310> all<00:03:16.239> right<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:16.810> here<00:03:17.110> we<00:03:17.200> go

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
one engine here all right so here we go

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.870 
one engine here all right so here we go
this<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.880> tool<00:03:19.480> eater<00:03:20.130> v8<00:03:21.130> cross<00:03:21.549> plane

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
this is a tool eater v8 cross plane

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.800 
this is a tool eater v8 cross plane
engine

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
engine

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:31.670 
engine
you<00:03:22.900> are<00:03:22.989> going<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.260> put<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.620> back

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.020 

I<00:03:31.739> am

abomination very nice very nice it
should<00:03:43.110> do<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.940> nice<00:03:45.300> rise<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
should do like this nice rise of the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.890 
should do like this nice rise of the
curve<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.470> perfect<00:03:47.160> very<00:03:48.000> nice<00:03:48.830> and<00:03:50.720> what<00:03:51.720> we

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
curve is perfect very nice and what we

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.150 
curve is perfect very nice and what we
are<00:03:51.930> going<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.320> do<00:03:52.500> now<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.700> give<00:03:53.910> aid<00:03:54.210> a

are going to do now is to give aid a

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.970 
are going to do now is to give aid a
manual<00:03:56.160> course<00:03:56.880> we<00:03:57.150> oh<00:03:57.540> yeah<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.830> see

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
manual course we oh yeah and you can see

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.310 
manual course we oh yeah and you can see
here<00:03:59.220> different<00:03:59.700> gear<00:03:59.820> choices<00:04:00.270> up<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.200> eight

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
here different gear choices up to eight

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.750 
here different gear choices up to eight
years<00:04:02.720> for<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.200> automatics<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.370> manual

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
years for the automatics and the manual

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.730 
years for the automatics and the manual
has<00:04:05.910> up<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.090> seven<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:06.900> we<00:04:07.050> aren't<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.380> only

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
has up to seven but we aren't you only

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.680 
has up to seven but we aren't you only
going<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.070> give<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.370> five<00:04:08.880> because<00:04:09.300> it's<00:04:09.510> not

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
going to give it five because it's not

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.680 
going to give it five because it's not
that<00:04:10.140> fast<00:04:10.620> only<00:04:11.100> 300<00:04:11.490> kilometers<00:04:12.120> now<00:04:12.270> that's

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
that fast only 300 kilometers now that's

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.640 
that fast only 300 kilometers now that's
like<00:04:13.230> nothing<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.630> sportiness<00:04:16.050> trick

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
like nothing so the sportiness trick

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.650 
like nothing so the sportiness trick
there<00:04:16.980> yeah<00:04:17.610> this<00:04:18.330> is<00:04:18.560> it's<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.710> fatass<00:04:20.160> and

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
there yeah this is it's a fatass and

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.020 
there yeah this is it's a fatass and
here<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:21.780> can<00:04:21.900> see<00:04:22.190> we<00:04:23.190> have<00:04:23.220> added<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.790> few

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
here you can see we have added a few

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.080 
here you can see we have added a few
break<00:04:24.960> options<00:04:25.350> more<00:04:25.770> pistol<00:04:26.190> choices<00:04:26.880> for

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
break options more pistol choices for

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.980 
break options more pistol choices for
you<00:04:27.500> took<00:04:28.500> down<00:04:28.710> force<00:04:29.100> yeah<00:04:29.430> i<00:04:29.700> think<00:04:29.990> this

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
you took down force yeah i think this

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.690 
you took down force yeah i think this
come<00:04:31.230> instead<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.710> down<00:04:31.890> force<00:04:31.920> it's<00:04:32.460> it's

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
come instead of down force it's it's

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.990 
come instead of down force it's it's
very<00:04:33.210> nicely<00:04:33.570> shaped<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.580> nicely<00:04:35.580> shaped

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
very nicely shaped and nicely shaped

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.090 
very nicely shaped and nicely shaped
things<00:04:36.270> usually<00:04:36.480> create<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.050> lot<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:37.410> lift<00:04:37.620> so

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
things usually create a lot of lift so

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.460 
things usually create a lot of lift so
that<00:04:38.460> hit<00:04:39.390> then<00:04:39.540> would<00:04:39.750> be<00:04:39.870> detrimental<00:04:40.050> to

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
that hit then would be detrimental to

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.620 
that hit then would be detrimental to
our<00:04:40.590> spot<00:04:41.250> in<00:04:41.280> this<00:04:41.460> performance<00:04:41.700> when<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.240> go

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
our spot in this performance when you go

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.240 
our spot in this performance when you go
flying<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.200> 250<00:04:43.770> bombers<00:04:44.040> now<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.800> yes<00:04:46.800> but<00:04:47.130> no

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
flying it 250 bombers now and yes but no

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.100 
flying it 250 bombers now and yes but no
we<00:04:47.520> don't<00:04:47.730> go<00:04:47.910> super<00:04:48.210> light<00:04:48.360> because<00:04:48.690> this<00:04:48.900> is

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
we don't go super light because this is

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.010 
we don't go super light because this is
a<00:04:49.260> driver's<00:04:49.860> car<00:04:50.100> we<00:04:50.490> don't<00:04:50.910> need<00:04:51.210> fancy<00:04:51.540> stuff

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
a driver's car we don't need fancy stuff

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.140 
a driver's car we don't need fancy stuff

steering<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.820> should<00:05:03.000> be<00:05:03.180> very<00:05:03.570> direct<00:05:03.780> and

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
steering it should be very direct and

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.830 
steering it should be very direct and
its<00:05:04.470> light<00:05:04.950> on<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.220> front<00:05:05.400> wheel<00:05:05.730> search<00:05:06.090> it's

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
its light on the front wheel search it's

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.330 
its light on the front wheel search it's
easy<00:05:07.230> to<00:05:07.440> steer<00:05:08.330> then<00:05:09.330> we<00:05:09.600> need<00:05:09.840> yeah<00:05:10.830> just<00:05:11.130> for

easy to steer then we need yeah just for
safety<00:05:11.880> can<00:05:12.660> probably<00:05:13.050> switch<00:05:13.290> it<00:05:13.410> off<00:05:13.530> them

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
safety can probably switch it off them

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.440 
safety can probably switch it off them

gear<00:05:20.960> standards<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:22.240> then<00:05:23.240> we<00:05:23.870> are<00:05:24.350> going<00:05:24.680> to

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
gear standards and then we are going to

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.710 
gear standards and then we are going to
test<00:05:24.950> a<00:05:25.040> car<00:05:25.960> and<00:05:27.190> as<00:05:28.190> you<00:05:28.310> can<00:05:28.460> see<00:05:28.490> we<00:05:28.910> have<00:05:29.240> a

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
test a car and as you can see we have a

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.160 
test a car and as you can see we have a
very<00:05:30.560> much<00:05:30.860> like<00:05:31.370> I<00:05:31.580> was<00:05:32.390> going<00:05:32.660> for<00:05:32.720> a

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
very much like I was going for a

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.400 
very much like I was going for a
driver's<00:05:33.890> car<00:05:34.160> has<00:05:34.700> lots<00:05:35.060> of<00:05:35.150> Tanner's<00:05:35.570> even

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
driver's car has lots of Tanner's even

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.920 
driver's car has lots of Tanner's even
more<00:05:36.590> sportiness<00:05:37.040> basically<00:05:38.000> no<00:05:38.210> comfort<00:05:38.510> and

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
more sportiness basically no comfort and

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.200 
more sportiness basically no comfort and
a<00:05:40.240> pretty<00:05:41.240> low<00:05:41.930> prestige<00:05:42.560> for<00:05:42.770> what<00:05:43.040> it<00:05:43.160> is<00:05:43.310> but

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
a pretty low prestige for what it is but

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.320 
a pretty low prestige for what it is but
on<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.810> other<00:05:44.900> hand<00:05:45.020> it's<00:05:45.710> really<00:05:46.400> cheap<00:05:46.670> it's

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
on the other hand it's really cheap it's

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.660 
on the other hand it's really cheap it's
like<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:47.930> cost<00:05:48.230> like<00:05:48.740> one<00:05:49.010> and<00:05:49.160> a<00:05:49.220> half<00:05:49.250> times

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
like the cost like one and a half times

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.530 
like the cost like one and a half times
the<00:05:50.030> cost<00:05:50.300> of<00:05:50.540> a<00:05:51.310> reasonable<00:05:52.310> normal<00:05:52.970> car<00:05:53.210> and

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
the cost of a reasonable normal car and

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.240 
the cost of a reasonable normal car and
weighs<00:05:54.500> below<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:54.890> ton<00:05:55.130> which<00:05:55.670> is<00:05:55.850> twice<00:05:56.120> that

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
weighs below a ton which is twice that

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.420 
weighs below a ton which is twice that
so<00:05:58.250> let's<00:05:58.550> look<00:05:58.730> at<00:05:58.880> the<00:05:59.030> stats<00:05:59.810> here<00:06:00.080> a<00:06:00.400> bit<00:06:01.400> of

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
so let's look at the stats here a bit of

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.480 
so let's look at the stats here a bit of
new<00:06:01.700> UI<00:06:01.940> as<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.330> can<00:06:02.420> see<00:06:02.570> it's<00:06:02.720> not<00:06:02.810> finished

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
it's still looking with whacking in

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.980 
it's still looking with whacking in
