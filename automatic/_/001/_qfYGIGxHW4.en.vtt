00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.220
 ballaballa 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.500
 hey people there was a lot again 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.250
 interesting recipe wish and that 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:23.150
 this time from ppm 0 2 and he wanted one 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.190
 have so far made of red beets and travel 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.920
 and yes, that's another recipe 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.210
 you think how can this fit but yes 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.360
 fight work a bit around 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.500
 experimented and come out is one 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.160
 caramelized beetroot pudding with 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.660
 orange sauce okay let 's go first 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.059
 I have a peeled beetroot here 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.650
 that's about 200 grams how can i 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.000
 It's best to grate it right in 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.339
 a bowl of pure liquid 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.620
 Do not get lost and just hang up 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:53.360
 then its a little coarser side needs 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.600
 you can give her a small pot 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.780
 ever first on the highest level 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.220
 heat up 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.470
 You can do that with a small ship 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.960
 marine are now even 30 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.920
 gram and nine tablespoons sugar 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.770
 that's about 150 grams it has to be me 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.119
 Now a little bit to wait until 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.119
 her maria begins to melt 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.060
 In any case, should stand next to it 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:23.990
 stay if the sugar will be very much later 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.729
 quickly turn brown and as soon as the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.320
 margarine is completely melted 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.920
 you can now turn it down on 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.920
 the half 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.320
 after a few minutes and starts 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.130
 caramel i smell in the room and the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.939
 Sugar is getting more liquid now 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:48.590
 In any case, always stir otherwise 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.990
 it gets very nice too dark and about 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.180
 five minutes can pray her your red 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.470
 Not 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.150
 man that is already pretty dark 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.150
 Now the red beet comes along 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 mix in 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.640
 Rudolf pretty quickly gets her liquid 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.640
 submit 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.760
 then you can juice the half 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.420
 to give lemon and also three 150 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.250
 milliliters of water and it can 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.140
 first so three to five minutes before 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.790
 Simmer down when the whole thing 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.410
 you have simmered a bit 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.700
 Cook only once and with a 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.780
 the whole thing is going to be nice now 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:42.310
 can be finely pureed so it has time 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.720
 then turn on middle again 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.700
 you need about 100 milliliters 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.400
 apple juice and if you want you can 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.520
 by the way, instead of the three 150 milliliters 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.260
 water to 3 150 milliliters over 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.260
 then take the whole apple juice 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.019
 just a little sweet under the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.590
 apple juice I now give 67 teaspoons 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.780
 Strength 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.480
 that is about 50 degrees and clenched 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:14.680
 that could then be red beet cooks again 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:16.180
 just stir it up once so stir 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.209
 Basically, the pudding is now everything 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.720
 Already finished I give but now 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.840
 150 grams of frozen churches for the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.250
 a short time down to the product 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.140
 dissipate, you can now basically 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.769
 lie what you want I have here now 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.790
 such heart-shaped shape 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.790
 who just enter there? 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.600
 otherwise you can still bowl today 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.160
 take or pass or what you like 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.180
 would like to 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.310
 and after the polin a bit 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.250
 you can simply cool down in the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.200
 grab a fridge and there are a few 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.690
 just hours cool by cool 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.459
 let it be so you need two oranges 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.220
 that should definitely bio oranges 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.260
 because of the one we need 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.450
 first time the shell is now first 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.620
 quickly then could the orange 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.620
 squeeze in half 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.100
 we just need of 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.840
 one and a half oranges for half 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.180
 we need the same you can 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.049
 also first in which measuring cup 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.020
 three tablespoons of sugar and 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:27.040
 a teaspoon of karaman as well seven 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.890
 tablespoon cream and with a blender 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.340
 or in a whisk blow 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.170
 the whole then pretty frothy on now 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.740
 with your half orange with one 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:43.690
 sharp knife you can peel 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:48.820
 Simply differences as close as possible a 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:53.110
 pieces over and beautiful thin 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.460
 cut off the slices so I have one 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.440
 problem you ever crashed it 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.620
 about one and a half hours in the 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.520
 fridge the orange slices can 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:08.110
 her now in valleys at will galin 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:13.000
 and the orange sauce goes her whole then 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:15.250
 just about it and you already have 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 a very simple but noticed 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.770
 it's been here and since tuesday 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.900
 means with the heart shape it would open 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.169
 Any case could fit well with it 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:32.229
 Completing high quality menu for example 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:35.650
 yes times cost wonderful combination as 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.090
 you can find sugar and spices you can 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.130
 I still vary a bit what the 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.280
 length and in the sauce to 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.310
 example why karl also partly in 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.860
 I think so many thanks for this 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.780
 great ingredients suggestion and lanes still 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.240
 Other suggestions then write me 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.960
 as always had divided into the 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.400
 Comments 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.940
 and then see what's going on well 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.940
 to the next act
