00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
temperatures and that causes a lot of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.010 
temperatures and that causes a lot of
health<00:00:58.890> problems<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.030> cold<00:01:00.390> press<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.750> really

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

gradually drizzle it in there until it's
gone<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:37.990> might<00:04:38.169> take<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:38.710> know<00:04:38.800> about<00:04:38.979> three

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
gone it might take you know about three

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.530 
gone it might take you know about three
minutes<00:04:39.430> or<00:04:39.700> something<00:04:39.850> like<00:04:40.120> that<00:04:40.300> for<00:04:40.450> you

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
minutes or something like that for you

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.290 
minutes or something like that for you
to<00:04:40.600> do<00:04:40.720> it<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:40.870> don't<00:04:41.020> know<00:04:41.200> it<00:04:41.740> just<00:04:42.060> depends<00:04:43.060> I

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
to do it I don't know it just depends I

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.960 
to do it I don't know it just depends I
do<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:44.050> until<00:04:44.919> it's<00:04:45.070> gone<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.430> I<00:04:45.490> try<00:04:45.640> to<00:04:45.669> do<00:04:45.850> it

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
do it until it's gone and I try to do it

00:04:45.970 --> 00:05:51.960 
do it until it's gone and I try to do it
kind<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.210> slow<00:04:46.560> but<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:47.890> here<00:04:48.040> we<00:04:48.130> go

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:06:36.700 

you<00:05:52.480> can<00:05:52.630> hear<00:05:52.810> it<00:05:52.900> and<00:05:53.650> done

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:45.620 

it<00:06:37.710> should<00:06:38.010> be<00:06:38.160> done<00:06:41.780> actually<00:06:42.780> not<00:06:42.960> quite<00:06:44.630> let

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
it should be done actually not quite let

00:06:45.630 --> 00:07:37.260 
it should be done actually not quite let
me<00:06:45.720> stir<00:06:46.050> it<00:06:46.200> up<00:06:46.350> just<00:06:46.530> a<00:06:46.710> little<00:06:46.740> bit

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.270 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.080 

there<00:07:38.270> you<00:07:38.389> go<00:07:38.590> and<00:07:39.590> just<00:07:40.009> pour<00:07:40.250> it<00:07:40.400> off<00:07:40.550> it'll

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.090 
there you go and just pour it off it'll

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.270 
there you go and just pour it off it'll
thicken<00:07:41.449> up<00:07:41.660> once<00:07:41.930> it<00:07:42.110> cools<00:07:42.350> you<00:07:42.770> know<00:07:43.070> once

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280
