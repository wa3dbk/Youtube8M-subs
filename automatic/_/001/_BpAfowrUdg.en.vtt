00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 our kitchen chat and it's so 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.690
 delicious when I can do it on 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.410
 beginning of the week because it is a moment that 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.870
 we talk is that eye in the eye is 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.429
 that moment of the people I wanted 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.369
 talk about the following you 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.359
 realize that sometimes many people 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.980
 slim the pounds she wanted what 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.740
 He wanted to but they were like that. 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.590
 sad plates that thai does not know 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.860
 glad not happy with that done 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.450
 with what happened that I'm 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.410
 thinking stayed for andreoli observed such 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.000
 and then I get the following impression about 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.850
 this matter I want to share with you 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.960
 when you somehow get violent 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.809
 to do something because the change 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 whatever the change of life of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.329
 Lifestyle 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.890
 We are very conscious and mature. 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.950
 enough to ward off those thoughts 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.740
 children's fairy tale and fairy tales 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.869
 and you have to be very conscious knowing 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.590
 that any change you've made 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.670
 printing your life will imply in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.000
 good times and bad times in 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 moments of ease in moments of 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.520
 difficulty and you're going to have to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.130
 willing to dribble those bad moments 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.689
 when they show up because they will 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.750
 a moment of change is 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.220
 so we have to be sure 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 aware of what we are 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.710
 wanting to do it when you do something 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.659
 thing you print a change in your 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:58.170
 life for fad what the other did and gave 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.310
 Okay, so you start eating cabbage. 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.509
 roast it with that but pull 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.509
 not like what know if you like 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.379
 salad of broccoli or you like 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.409
 gold conflict 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:19.430
 so when you do something that 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:23.810
 Has a stamp of someone else you do not 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:28.420
 puts your top to your liking 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:32.680
 its routine although modified but its 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.450
 what causes a sage violence 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.409
 which caused a malaise 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.989
 so you're going to make you go but you know 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:47.180
 dragging stone 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:49.599
 either something suffered and change is 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.299
 attitude food 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:56.599
 any change has to be she has to 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:01.400
 I came with a load of joy from 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:04.909
 possibility of renewal happiness 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.760
 She has to do this burden with me. 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:11.030
 I fell today but tomorrow from the back over 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.829
 I get my way my way c 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.980
 the same way but I can change the 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.989
 things my way with my face but 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.410
 I change that I know that change 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.109
 the change in my body the change in my 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.510
 food habits depends on this 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.299
 I have to face this proposal more 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.940
 I'm going to give my top my seasoning my 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.829
 rhythm 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:42.379
 so I realize that these people who 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:44.750
 lose weight on the other's income because 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.750
 it's not their beach 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.220
 Suddenly I like to dance. 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.040
 not like to run I know like 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:00.230
 do other things I like to do 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.949
 a contemplating meditation I do not like 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.530
 keep punching in the bag 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:10.340
 so you have to get what you want 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.930
 likes to do what will bring you 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.199
 pleasure 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.280
 together with the change the same thing in the 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.940
 food 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.639
 ah I do not like sweet potatoes ok 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.759
 Something else in place 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.219
 whole - wheat pasta rice one 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.520
 carbohydrate you like there I do not 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:33.370
 full taste will also stop marked 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.389
 which is the intermediate between white and 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.210
 integral 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.550
 He does not like my whole taste. 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.800
 mazinho as white in a little street 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.449
 better for us for our proposal 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.430
 current 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.159
 so you'll find out inside. 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:52.139
 What you like is what's best 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:55.930
 for you to lose weight so it will bring you 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.240
 joy will bring you contentment will 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.969
 Bringing you satisfaction will bring pride. 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.689
 to be doing that 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:09.400
 so if anyone speaks our church like this 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:13.449
 10 kilos or daughter seems damned if 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.969
 were ten pounds in the vein works 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.240
 one day at a time in my own way 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:25.659
 and so were the Skillus but it seems to 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:30.069
 You imagine, man, and you understand. 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:33.939
 That's where you do the things that come to see you. 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:41.439
 for you but having the awareness that the 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:45.520
 change requires of us a posture know 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:49.240
 without dreaming without having to eat 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.879
 Brigadier today the little fairy will not clean 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.089
 and this is not going to happen as 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:57.939
 Today such Brig last roll up the sleeve 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:01.089
 and goes after the loss 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:03.939
 eating right walking doing 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:07.810
 what you like and energize 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:08.680
 of good thing knowing that you can is by 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.080
 there 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:17.310
 That's where we have to be mature. 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.080
 to know what change is uncomfortable 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.270
 has high moments has moments of 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.550
 low but you can face 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:30.729
 It's good one day at a time, always logical. 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.430
 I want to kiss everyone 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.520

 luzia who lives in bh her with her husband 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:03.319
 she has a name that is difficult to pronounce 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.500
 So I will not risk but she knows that 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:10.630
 I 'm talking to her, you were cute 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:13.250
