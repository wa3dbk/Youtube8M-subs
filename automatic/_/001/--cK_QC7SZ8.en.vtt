and we thought it would be so fun to

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.600 
and we thought it would be so fun to
share<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.590> each<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.219> us<00:00:50.340> with

share a little bit of each of us with

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.049 
share a little bit of each of us with
you<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.289> each<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.590> these<00:00:52.710> pages<00:00:53.039> sort<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
you and so each of these pages sort of

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
you and so each of these pages sort of
represent<00:00:54.539> our<00:00:54.719> own<00:00:54.930> individual<00:00:55.500> styles<00:00:56.039> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
represent our own individual styles and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.400 
represent our own individual styles and
of<00:00:56.760> course<00:00:57.090> they<00:00:57.360> were<00:00:57.420> made<00:00:57.719> using<00:00:57.989> Lindy

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
