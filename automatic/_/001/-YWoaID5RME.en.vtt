00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.950
 we have an overview of such a case sockets 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.330
 can call it differently for iphone 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.000
 4 &amp; 4s 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.020
 this socket also serves 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.080
 extra battery 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.680
 emergency battery capacity 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.939
 this cover is 1900 milliamps 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.710
 Ie this a bit but and considerable to 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.420
 charge up your phone completely 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.730
 It would be quite enough for even 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.180
 recharging several times 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.090
 enters the case colors are different 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.030
 . there is black purple blue yellow 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.710
 red various for every taste and color 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.219
 inserted on such a beautiful 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 boxes stylized too under the box 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.570
 for iPhones and codes all 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.640
 minimalist case usb cable 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.699
 small instruction manual 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.489
 English but I think you can understand 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.110
 Now we all the more tell how 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.610
 use this case pre 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.549
 need of course charge there is a connector for 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.350
 usb cable cable usually it can 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.990
 even connect the plug 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.580
 from iphone charging any adapter 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.369
 fit basically connect 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.860
 leave for a few hours 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.590
 the more the better back there 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.390
 backlight indicator which determines 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.159
 how much do you have 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.990
 how much is your charge 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.970
 case 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.080
 how much leaves 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.710
 Generally there are different capacities of such 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.700
 covers it is 1900 milliampere 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.460
 2000 3000 3 500 and in my opinion it is 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.150
 max 3 500 times try 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.820
 insert the phone here and see how 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.820
 does it all work to dress as simple 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:06.170
 maybe the ring will get in the way 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.590
 magnetic nozzle phishay narrow but not all 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.800
 normally the phone itself is not much 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.190
 became thicker which gives a very big plus 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.090
 this cover because it looks in the hands 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.780
 at least beautiful and everything is very 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.459
 clearly and competently made to touch everything 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.500
 also very nicely done this 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.820
 rubberized plastic meaning it doesn't 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:37.670
 slips and out of the hands also here 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.860
 there are small connectors for speakers 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.660
 so that when you talk that is and 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.930
 the speakers closes so will be heard 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.930
 sound 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.980
 if you see with us now 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.080
 so much charge left this is 42 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.510
 percent 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.780
 turn on the batteries automatically 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.140
 Charging itself turns on as you can see 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.850
 the charge will not be so fast 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.450
 but in principle if you are very much 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.770
 need phone can turn on 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.750
 wait two or three minutes 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.780
 somewhere by two to three percent retirement and 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.240
 just 10 minutes will be enough 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.490
 to charge your phone for five on 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.500
 ten percent if you leave on 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.160
 half an hour you can safely then enjoy 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.620
 phone somewhere 30 40 percent you 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.530
 typed in principle all I wanted 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.180
 tell about this case 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.500
 as you see all the connectors too 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.970
 such a case in our store is one and a half 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.350
 thousands with a capacity of 1900 milliamps an hour than 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.090
 more capacity the more cost 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.300
 accordingly, if there is any 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.670
 questions please contact if something is not clear 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.380
