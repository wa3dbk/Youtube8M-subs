00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
actually allows you to even eat more

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.010 
actually allows you to even eat more
carbs<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.270> if<00:03:02.270> you<00:03:02.360> do<00:03:02.480> cardio<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.990> can

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
carbs and if you do cardio you can

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.040 
carbs and if you do cardio you can
always<00:03:03.290> eat<00:03:03.830> even<00:03:03.980> more<00:03:04.160> carbs<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.300> that's

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
always eat even more carbs and that's
