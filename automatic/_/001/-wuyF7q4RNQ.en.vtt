00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:14.349
 This was 3 because the paint was dry 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.349
 I think that I want to strutting Buryo to create using the solvent 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.510
 me 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.680
 me 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.500
 I will use the year stick 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:30.810
 In such a place where the paint has been peeled off 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.810
 I think that I want to go clean in the union 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.450
 Now that wiping is complete , I would like to apply a matte spray 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.380
 Also 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.990
 this 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.990
 If you look at Kukeiza well 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.600
 In decals 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.460
 There are several places to express 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.900
 Say or where you say 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.830
 It is overwintering 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:09.350
 It seems to go with this first 9 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.020
 This red part of the foot This red part is 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.570
 Because it is decals a 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.000
 Even better 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.460
 Such a place 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.060
 This too 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.330
 You do not go and not put a decal with the feeling that blocks the Somehow hole is decal 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.330
 But 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.380
 Then in the lower part 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.380
 this 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.980
 It is this part of the bones, and I think that I want to put a white part here with decals etc. 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.340
 I will 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.950
 I 'm digging according to the design but 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.060
 Because it is decals 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.360
 Because I feel like going pursuers put it I I'll be able to gap 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.360
 today 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.800
 I do n't think I can understand that I can go through it 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.800
 I can not do this 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.800
 There are a lot of people who can fight properly 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.009
 It's like Halt, it looks like this 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.550
 Before here 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:19.870
 I think this white part 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:23.180
 Also because it is not needed Yappa course 3'll do in the key but I'm stuck because Ri 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.659
 Since the white statement of the base is present I bracts and out 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.410
 I would like to finish with painting if possible 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:33.740
 Oh dear 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.280
 I can not take care of that but people who get wet 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:42.120
 I think it is better to apply medicine 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.120
 Next is this part , this hole in this park 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.099
 I feel like I 'm closing up from the club 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:55.939
 Well in the deep black 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.939
 It will be pasted in such a way as to close this hole with 10,000 nano professional decals 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.459
 Irregularities taking to Fu 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.459
 The 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.700
 I'm sorry I made a mistake 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.849
 I was there 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.720
 It's not like closing up this hole after assembly, so it goes in here 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.370
 But 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.050
 We will feel that we put in through in this 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.650
 Spring is this path here 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:27.780
 There is this prosperous place but 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.700
 It might be a little hard to see Kedomo at the Well like this ledge here. 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.010
 It is feeling to put it on 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.010
 I was surprised to think that leisure place hole closes saw underneath 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.110
 The remaining decals were also beautifully attached 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.980
 I was able to stick to decent or decent clumsy even I 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.770
 so 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.380
 Well then 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:56.520
 The person who said that it is in this first part of this I heard and said is here 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:59.049
 I did not cover it so I put this on later 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:06.129
 It is a mechanism that comes out from inside 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:11.210
 In Kedomo true that I made in the form it is written in the design diagram of stick after which it covered 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:16.130
 In the case of me , that weather will be colored later . 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:19.400
 If this comes in, the sponge may not reach you and the color may not paint 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:26.270
 Then put it on this lower side first and then 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:28.990
 We are in the recipe that put this after the stalemate color because feta ring master 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.070
 Well already 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.190
 I think this white part is part of the part of this historical part 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.370
 This white part is 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:43.200
 It will be stuck here decal 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.400
 Even though is a little hard lest fine or Ikehara no 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.400
 Even I who is necessary is all right 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:54.910
 Went'll keep once I got in this 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.480
 Now that there is an Elecar, it is from now 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.880
 this 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.880
 Because it is so cute while it burns, I 'm getting stuck while I 'm upgrading 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.390
 Clear tick 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.390
 I am
