of the microscope is going to face away

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.229 
of the microscope is going to face away
from<00:00:42.510> me<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.200> work<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.399> I'm<00:00:44.489> gonna<00:00:44.700> turn<00:00:44.969> my

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
from me as I work so I'm gonna turn my

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.529 
from me as I work so I'm gonna turn my
microscope<00:00:45.750> around<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.860> way<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:48.329> way

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
microscope around this way and that way

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.479 
microscope around this way and that way
I<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> stage<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
I can really see the stage and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.150 
I can really see the stage and
manipulate<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> slide<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> stage<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
manipulate the slide on the stage as I

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.510 
manipulate the slide on the stage as I
need<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:54.170> my<00:00:55.170> next<00:00:55.410> step<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.829> unwrap<00:00:56.340> my

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
need to my next step is to unwrap my

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.950 
need to my next step is to unwrap my
cord

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.070 

you<00:01:03.559> don't<00:01:03.710> have<00:01:03.829> to<00:01:03.920> unwrap<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:04.339> all<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.580> way

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
you don't have to unwrap it all the way

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.810 
you don't have to unwrap it all the way
and<00:01:06.080> I'm<00:01:06.200> gonna<00:01:06.320> plug<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:06.799> in<00:01:07.070> on<00:01:07.310> the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
and I'm gonna plug this in on the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.040 
and I'm gonna plug this in on the
opposite<00:01:08.420> side<00:01:08.659> of<00:01:08.690> my<00:01:08.960> lab<00:01:09.140> station<00:01:11.020> so<00:01:12.020> that

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
opposite side of my lab station so that

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.020 
opposite side of my lab station so that
the<00:01:12.260> cord<00:01:12.560> isn't<00:01:12.800> hanging<00:01:13.310> down<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.760> we<00:01:13.850> don't

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
the cord isn't hanging down and we don't

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.999

gonna do is make sure that my fine focus

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.190 
gonna do is make sure that my fine focus
knob<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:55.390> adjusted<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:56.720> that<00:01:56.750> it's<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.140> the

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
middle of the fine focus range so I'm

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.980 
middle of the fine focus range so I'm
gonna<00:02:00.200> have<00:02:00.819> you<00:02:01.819> zoom<00:02:02.060> in<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.420> look<00:02:02.450> right

here
and<00:02:08.239> what<00:02:08.420> I<00:02:08.450> can<00:02:08.690> see<00:02:08.989> is<00:02:09.320> that<00:02:09.380> my<00:02:09.739> fine<00:02:10.009> focus

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
and what I can see is that my fine focus

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.550 
and what I can see is that my fine focus
is<00:02:10.640> near<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.030> bottom<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.630> its<00:02:11.750> range<00:02:12.049> because

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
is near the bottom of its range because

the white mark on the beige area is not

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.860 
the white mark on the beige area is not
is<00:02:18.010> not<00:02:19.010> centered<00:02:19.519> between<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.000> two<00:02:20.269> marks<00:02:20.630> on

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
is not centered between the two marks on

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.830 
is not centered between the two marks on
the<00:02:21.530> black<00:02:21.739> area<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.820> I'm<00:02:22.940> gonna<00:02:23.150> rotate<00:02:23.390> this

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
the black area so I'm gonna rotate this

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.770 
the black area so I'm gonna rotate this
up<00:02:24.049> a<00:02:25.450> little<00:02:26.450> bit<00:02:26.829> so<00:02:27.829> that<00:02:27.860> my<00:02:28.100> fine<00:02:28.370> focus<00:02:28.670> is

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.600 

centered

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
centered

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.090 
centered
I<00:02:34.720> don't<00:02:35.720> know<00:02:35.780> if<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:35.990> can<00:02:36.140> see<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.980> the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
I don't know if you can see that so the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.380 
I don't know if you can see that so the
next<00:02:40.250> thing<00:02:40.430> I'm<00:02:40.520> gonna<00:02:40.670> do<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:43.000> turn<00:02:44.000> my<00:02:44.180> light

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
next thing I'm gonna do is turn my light

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.800 
next thing I'm gonna do is turn my light
on<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:45.350> I'm<00:02:45.950> going<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.340> make<00:02:47.120> sure<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.630> my

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
on and I'm going to make sure that my

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.210 
on and I'm going to make sure that my
scanning<00:02:48.500> objective<00:02:49.310> lens<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.330> selected<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
scanning objective lens is selected the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.640 
scanning objective lens is selected the
red<00:02:52.550> lens<00:02:52.910> on<00:02:53.210> these<00:02:53.360> microscopes<00:02:54.020> that's<00:02:54.440> the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
red lens on these microscopes that's the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.670 
red lens on these microscopes that's the
shortest<00:02:55.130> objective<00:02:55.700> lens<00:02:56.410> that's<00:02:57.410> the

shortest objective lens that's the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.360 
shortest objective lens that's the
scanning<00:02:58.040> objective<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:01.010> next<00:03:01.190> thing<00:03:01.310> I'm

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
scanning objective the next thing I'm

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.890 
scanning objective the next thing I'm
gonna<00:03:01.520> do<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:01.970> make<00:03:02.150> sure<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.360> my<00:03:02.600> light

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
gonna do is make sure that my light

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.670 
gonna do is make sure that my light
adjustment<00:03:03.500> is<00:03:03.650> appropriate<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:05.060> I'm<00:03:05.300> gonna

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
adjustment is appropriate so I'm gonna

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.580 
adjustment is appropriate so I'm gonna
dial<00:03:06.680> my<00:03:06.950> diaphragm<00:03:07.990> this<00:03:08.990> is<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.290> diaphragm

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
dial my diaphragm this is the diaphragm

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.030 
dial my diaphragm this is the diaphragm
disc<00:03:10.130> right<00:03:10.310> here<00:03:10.370> I'm<00:03:11.330> gonna<00:03:11.600> dial<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:12.110> up<00:03:12.350> to

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
disc right here I'm gonna dial it up to

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.100 
disc right here I'm gonna dial it up to
the<00:03:13.160> number<00:03:13.520> three<00:03:13.850> setting<00:03:14.300> which<00:03:14.810> is<00:03:14.840> the

the number three setting which is the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.670 
the number three setting which is the
medium<00:03:15.560> light<00:03:15.830> setting<00:03:17.020> you<00:03:18.020> might<00:03:18.230> need<00:03:18.410> more

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
medium light setting you might need more

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.729 
medium light setting you might need more
light<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.250> really<00:03:19.610> sick<00:03:20.150> specimens<00:03:20.780> or<00:03:21.110> high

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
light for really sick specimens or high

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.210 
light for really sick specimens or high
power<00:03:22.870> resolution<00:03:23.870> or<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.320> might<00:03:24.650> need<00:03:24.800> low

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
power resolution or you might need low

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.860 
power resolution or you might need low
light<00:03:25.550> lower<00:03:26.209> light<00:03:26.540> for<00:03:27.140> thin<00:03:27.890> specimens<00:03:28.580> and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
light lower light for thin specimens and

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.890 
light lower light for thin specimens and
lower<00:03:29.870> magnification<00:03:31.209> my<00:03:32.209> next<00:03:32.480> step<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.750> to

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
lower magnification my next step is to

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.010 
lower magnification my next step is to
get<00:03:33.020> my<00:03:33.170> specimen

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.290 

this<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:36.710> a<00:03:36.740> prepared<00:03:37.160> slide<00:03:37.550> of<00:03:37.760> an<00:03:37.850> LOD<00:03:38.270> a

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
this is a prepared slide of an LOD a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.690 
this is a prepared slide of an LOD a
leaf<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.840> what<00:03:39.560> I'm<00:03:39.650> going<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.860> try<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.100> do<00:03:40.370> is

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
leaf and what I'm going to try to do is

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.060 
leaf and what I'm going to try to do is
Center<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.960> specimen<00:03:42.110> in<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:42.800> stage<00:03:43.670> opening

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
Center the specimen in the stage opening

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.330 
Center the specimen in the stage opening
so<00:03:46.070> I'm<00:03:46.250> gonna<00:03:46.400> place<00:03:46.790> this<00:03:47.090> slide<00:03:48.190> under<00:03:49.190> my

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
so I'm gonna place this slide under my

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.530 
so I'm gonna place this slide under my
slide<00:03:49.610> clips<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:51.580> I'm<00:03:52.580> gonna<00:03:52.730> try<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.090> see

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
slide clips and I'm gonna try to see

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.870 
slide clips and I'm gonna try to see
that<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.170> light<00:03:54.620> is<00:03:54.860> actually<00:03:54.890> shining

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
that the light is actually shining

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.300 
that the light is actually shining
through<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.210> specimen<00:03:56.960> and<00:03:57.110> I<00:03:57.650> can<00:03:57.860> see<00:03:58.100> that

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
through the specimen and I can see that

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.430 
through the specimen and I can see that
the<00:03:58.430> specimen<00:03:58.850> is<00:03:59.150> somewhere<00:03:59.900> near<00:04:00.200> the

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
the specimen is somewhere near the

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.400 
the specimen is somewhere near the
center<00:04:00.740> of<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:00.950> stage<00:04:01.160> opening<00:04:04.810> my<00:04:05.810> next<00:04:06.170> step

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
center of the stage opening my next step

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.670 
center of the stage opening my next step
is<00:04:06.710> to<00:04:07.130> raise<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:08.060> stage<00:04:08.420> all<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:08.990> way<00:04:09.830> up<00:04:11.680> now

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
is to raise the stage all the way up now

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.230 
is to raise the stage all the way up now
we're<00:04:12.830> only<00:04:13.010> going<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.370> do<00:04:13.550> this<00:04:13.730> if<00:04:13.940> we<00:04:14.060> have

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
we're only going to do this if we have

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.830 
we're only going to do this if we have
scanning<00:04:14.720> power<00:04:14.900> selected<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:16.480> with<00:04:17.480> this

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
scanning power selected and with this

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.030 
scanning power selected and with this
raised<00:04:18.320> all<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.890> way<00:04:19.010> up<00:04:19.870> pretty<00:04:20.870> close<00:04:21.170> to

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
raised all the way up pretty close to

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.250 
raised all the way up pretty close to
the<00:04:22.160> scanning<00:04:22.460> power<00:04:22.760> objective<00:04:23.000> lens<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.900> know

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
the scanning power objective lens I know

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.620 
the scanning power objective lens I know
I'm<00:04:24.590> pretty<00:04:24.860> close<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.610> being<00:04:25.640> in<00:04:26.000> focus<00:04:26.450> so

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
I'm pretty close to being in focus so

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.500 
I'm pretty close to being in focus so
now<00:04:27.440> what<00:04:27.590> I'm<00:04:27.680> gonna<00:04:27.770> do<00:04:28.160> is<00:04:28.850> look<00:04:29.180> into<00:04:29.390> the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
now what I'm gonna do is look into the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.960 
now what I'm gonna do is look into the
microscope<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:30.260> it's<00:04:30.920> not<00:04:31.130> quite<00:04:31.430> in<00:04:31.460> focus

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
microscope and it's not quite in focus

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.240 
microscope and it's not quite in focus
it<00:04:32.150> looks<00:04:32.420> a<00:04:32.540> little<00:04:32.690> fuzzy<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.980> I'm<00:04:34.100> gonna

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
it looks a little fuzzy so I'm gonna

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.240 
it looks a little fuzzy so I'm gonna
rotate<00:04:34.550> this<00:04:35.030> back<00:04:35.660> down<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.110> little<00:04:36.500> bit<00:04:36.740> with

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
rotate this back down a little bit with

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.820 
rotate this back down a little bit with
the<00:04:37.400> coarse<00:04:37.700> adjustment<00:04:37.880> knob<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:39.440> that<00:04:39.680> my

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
the coarse adjustment knob so that my

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.990 
the coarse adjustment knob so that my
specimen<00:04:40.430> starts<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.210> come<00:04:41.420> into<00:04:41.600> sharp<00:04:42.140> clear

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
specimen starts to come into sharp clear

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.680 
specimen starts to come into sharp clear
focus

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
focus

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.900 
focus
the<00:04:46.200> next<00:04:46.590> thing<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:46.860> want<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.160> do<00:04:47.370> in<00:04:47.670> some

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
the next thing I want to do in some

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.280 
the next thing I want to do in some
cases<00:04:48.360> is<00:04:48.480> to<00:04:48.600> look<00:04:48.750> at<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:48.960> higher

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
cases is to look at a higher

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.070 
cases is to look at a higher
magnification<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.910> do<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.390> we're<00:04:51.870> going<00:04:52.020> to

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
magnification to do that we're going to

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.390 
magnification to do that we're going to
select<00:04:52.320> another<00:04:53.010> objective<00:04:53.460> lens<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:56.070> thing

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
select another objective lens the thing

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.310 
select another objective lens the thing
to<00:04:56.610> realize<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:57.360> that<00:04:57.530> if<00:04:58.530> it's<00:04:58.860> in<00:04:59.070> focus<00:04:59.280> in

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
to realize is that if it's in focus in

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.470 
to realize is that if it's in focus in
scanning<00:05:01.320> power<00:05:01.620> it's<00:05:02.340> gonna<00:05:02.550> be<00:05:02.790> close<00:05:03.210> to

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
scanning power it's gonna be close to

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:10.790 
scanning power it's gonna be close to
focus<00:05:03.930> with<00:05:04.740> our<00:05:06.560> low<00:05:07.560> power<00:05:09.290> the<00:05:10.290> microscope

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
focus with our low power the microscope

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.710 
focus with our low power the microscope
is<00:05:10.980> constructed<00:05:11.670> so<00:05:11.910> that<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.180> objective

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
is constructed so that the objective

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.680 
is constructed so that the objective
lens<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:14.030> at<00:05:15.030> different<00:05:15.420> varying<00:05:16.410> distances

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
lens is at different varying distances

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.860 
lens is at different varying distances
being<00:05:18.690> in<00:05:18.870> focus<00:05:19.260> means<00:05:19.530> being<00:05:19.920> at<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.400> right

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
being in focus means being at the right

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.200 
being in focus means being at the right
distance<00:05:21.870> from<00:05:22.620> your<00:05:22.770> specimen<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:24.000> I'm<00:05:24.060> gonna

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
distance from your specimen so I'm gonna

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.330 
distance from your specimen so I'm gonna
go<00:05:24.330> back<00:05:24.540> in<00:05:24.750> here<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.350> at<00:05:25.590> this<00:05:25.740> point<00:05:25.980> all<00:05:26.250> I

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
go back in here and at this point all I

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.330 
go back in here and at this point all I
should<00:05:26.760> really<00:05:27.060> need<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.420> do<00:05:27.600> is<00:05:27.870> adjust<00:05:28.340> with

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
should really need to do is adjust with

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.600 
should really need to do is adjust with
the<00:05:29.490> fine<00:05:29.730> focus<00:05:30.060> knob<00:05:30.450> if<00:05:30.980> I<00:05:31.980> want<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.310> magnify

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
the fine focus knob if I want to magnify

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.960 
the fine focus knob if I want to magnify
even<00:05:33.120> more<00:05:33.830> realize<00:05:34.830> when<00:05:35.070> you<00:05:35.190> magnify<00:05:35.370> more

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
even more realize when you magnify more

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.840 
even more realize when you magnify more
what<00:05:36.330> I'm<00:05:36.450> gonna<00:05:36.630> do<00:05:36.900> is<00:05:37.340> look<00:05:38.340> to<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.580> side

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
what I'm gonna do is look to the side

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.940 
what I'm gonna do is look to the side
make<00:05:39.390> sure<00:05:39.420> that<00:05:40.080> my<00:05:40.260> lens<00:05:40.500> isn't<00:05:40.710> gonna

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
make sure that my lens isn't gonna

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.030 
make sure that my lens isn't gonna
strike<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:42.210> slide<00:05:42.540> and<00:05:42.960> it's<00:05:43.380> close<00:05:43.710> it's

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
strike the slide and it's close it's

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.740 
strike the slide and it's close it's
gonna<00:05:44.250> be<00:05:44.430> close<00:05:44.700> at<00:05:44.940> high<00:05:45.180> power<00:05:45.830> and<00:05:47.600> all<00:05:48.600> I'm

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
gonna be close at high power and all I'm

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.930 
gonna be close at high power and all I'm
gonna<00:05:48.840> need<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.200> do<00:05:49.320> at<00:05:49.440> this<00:05:49.470> point

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.930 

is<00:05:53.630> it<00:05:53.870> just<00:05:54.140> the<00:05:54.380> fine<00:05:54.620> focused<00:05:55.100> just<00:05:55.370> a

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
is it just the fine focused just a

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.170 
is it just the fine focused just a
little<00:05:56.210> bit<00:05:56.980> if<00:05:57.980> you<00:05:58.040> need<00:05:58.250> to<00:05:58.490> at<00:05:58.880> higher

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
little bit if you need to at higher

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.880 
little bit if you need to at higher
power<00:05:59.510> you<00:05:59.630> might<00:05:59.990> want<00:06:00.260> to<00:06:00.350> dial<00:06:00.560> up<00:06:00.740> the

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
power you might want to dial up the

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.330 
power you might want to dial up the
diaphragm<00:06:01.370> to<00:06:01.550> a<00:06:01.580> higher<00:06:01.850> light<00:06:02.150> setting<00:06:03.340> so

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
diaphragm to a higher light setting so

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.240 
diaphragm to a higher light setting so
I'm<00:06:04.400> going<00:06:04.520> to<00:06:04.550> go<00:06:04.670> from<00:06:04.880> 3<00:06:06.550> to<00:06:07.550> 4<00:06:07.790> here<00:06:08.210> and<00:06:09.250> now

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
I'm going to go from 3 to 4 here and now

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.090 
I'm going to go from 3 to 4 here and now
at<00:06:10.400> higher<00:06:10.610> power<00:06:11.320> that<00:06:12.320> looks<00:06:12.620> a<00:06:12.710> little<00:06:12.860> bit

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
at higher power that looks a little bit

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.290 
at higher power that looks a little bit
better<00:06:15.550> so<00:06:16.550> that's<00:06:16.760> those<00:06:17.090> are<00:06:17.150> the

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
better so that's those are the

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.090 
better so that's those are the
procedures<00:06:17.750> to<00:06:17.900> follow<00:06:18.050> to<00:06:18.320> get<00:06:18.650> into<00:06:18.920> good

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
procedures to follow to get into good

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.520 
procedures to follow to get into good
clear<00:06:19.430> sharp<00:06:19.670> focus<00:06:20.150> when<00:06:21.110> we're<00:06:21.260> at<00:06:21.350> high

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
clear sharp focus when we're at high

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.710 
clear sharp focus when we're at high
power<00:06:21.800> realized<00:06:22.490> that<00:06:22.700> we<00:06:22.790> see<00:06:23.000> more<00:06:23.300> detail

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
power realized that we see more detail

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.060 
power realized that we see more detail
but<00:06:24.650> a<00:06:24.680> smaller<00:06:25.160> field<00:06:25.580> of<00:06:25.760> view<00:06:26.950> when<00:06:27.950> I'm

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
but a smaller field of view when I'm

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.040 
but a smaller field of view when I'm
done<00:06:28.310> using<00:06:28.700> my<00:06:28.820> microscope<00:06:29.390> what<00:06:29.630> I<00:06:29.660> want<00:06:29.930> to

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
done using my microscope what I want to

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.270 
done using my microscope what I want to
do<00:06:30.230> is<00:06:30.530> lower<00:06:31.310> my<00:06:31.580> stage<00:06:31.850> all<00:06:32.180> the<00:06:32.240> way<00:06:33.280> switch

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
do is lower my stage all the way switch

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.610 
do is lower my stage all the way switch
back<00:06:34.550> to<00:06:34.580> scanning<00:06:35.180> power<00:06:35.420> and<00:06:35.840> then<00:06:36.320> I<00:06:36.350> have

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
back to scanning power and then I have

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.200 
back to scanning power and then I have
plenty<00:06:36.860> of<00:06:37.010> clearance<00:06:37.310> to<00:06:37.520> reach<00:06:37.790> in<00:06:38.000> there

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
plenty of clearance to reach in there
