00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
but how does the diaphragm move there's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.590 
but how does the diaphragm move there's
no<00:01:27.689> motor<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.790> now<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.150> remove<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
more I put a link to Discovery Channel's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.039 
more I put a link to Discovery Channel's
how<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.640> made<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.060> description<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
how it's made in the description that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.789 
how it's made in the description that
well<00:01:46.350> explains<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.340> parts<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> driver

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
well explains all the parts to a driver

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.410 
well explains all the parts to a driver
so<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> two<00:01:50.130> parts<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.549> great<00:01:50.729> importance<00:01:51.270> are

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so the two parts of great importance are

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.840 
so the two parts of great importance are
these<00:01:51.570> first<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> magnet<00:01:53.159> now<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
these first we have a magnet now the

depending on the headphone model and

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.469 
depending on the headphone model and
that's<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:58.170> great<00:01:58.469> importance

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
that's not a really great importance

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.760 
that's not a really great importance
secondly<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.840> what's<00:02:01.049> called<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.439> voice

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
secondly we have what's called a voice

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.340 
secondly we have what's called a voice
coil<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.729> usually<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.329> threaded<00:02:03.810> copper<00:02:04.140> wire

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
coil it's usually a threaded copper wire

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.709 
coil it's usually a threaded copper wire
that's<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> he's<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.280> diaphragm<00:02:05.700> now<00:02:06.450> when

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
that's it he's to the diaphragm now when

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.270 
that's it he's to the diaphragm now when
you<00:02:06.810> play<00:02:07.049> music<00:02:07.290> through<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:07.770> headphones

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
you play music through your headphones

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.369 
you play music through your headphones
say<00:02:08.550> through<00:02:08.940> your<00:02:09.119> iPhone<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:10.200> are

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
say through your iPhone you are

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.320 
say through your iPhone you are
outputting<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:11.250> certain<00:02:11.670> amount<00:02:11.910> of

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
headphone jack all the way to your ears

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.980 
headphone jack all the way to your ears
through<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.100> cable<00:02:17.460> is<00:02:17.580> running<00:02:18.270> electricity

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
through the cable is running electricity

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.740 
through the cable is running electricity
back<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.410> forth<00:02:19.650> now<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.880> current<00:02:21.480> goes

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.720 
back and forth now that current goes
directly<00:02:22.440> into<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.860> concentrated<00:02:23.520> voice

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.000 
directly into this concentrated voice
coil<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.300> as<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> result<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.500> creates<00:02:25.860> an

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
coil and as a result it creates an

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.190 
coil and as a result it creates an
electromagnetic<00:02:26.640> field<00:02:27.030> now<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.600> don't<00:02:27.750> know

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
electromagnetic field now I don't know

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.690 
electromagnetic field now I don't know
if<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.410> remember<00:02:28.740> from<00:02:28.860> high<00:02:29.040> school<00:02:29.310> physics

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
if you remember from high school physics

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.610 
if you remember from high school physics
class<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.420> electromagnetic<00:02:31.230> fields<00:02:31.530> are

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
class but electromagnetic fields are

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.500 
class but electromagnetic fields are
cool<00:02:31.830> because<00:02:32.070> they're<00:02:32.400> only<00:02:32.580> polarized<00:02:33.270> for

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
cool because they're only polarized for

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.540 
cool because they're only polarized for
charge<00:02:33.810> when<00:02:34.470> electricity<00:02:34.860> runs<00:02:35.250> through

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
charge when electricity runs through

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.690 
charge when electricity runs through
them<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.840> varying<00:02:37.380> current<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.430> audio

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
them so a varying current of the audio

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.120 
them so a varying current of the audio
signal<00:02:38.970> causes<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.990> voice<00:02:40.170> coil<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.770> move<00:02:40.920> up

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
signal causes the voice coil to move up

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.240 
signal causes the voice coil to move up
and<00:02:41.490> down<00:02:41.910> alongside<00:02:42.600> or<00:02:43.170> rather<00:02:43.350> inside<00:02:44.010> the

to<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.620> diaphragm<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.400> pulls<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.000> diaphragm

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
to the diaphragm it pulls the diaphragm

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.750 
to the diaphragm it pulls the diaphragm
back<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.930> forth<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.800> diaphragm<00:02:50.250> pushes<00:02:50.490> the

back and forth the diaphragm pushes the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.580 
back and forth the diaphragm pushes the
air<00:02:50.880> back<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.330> forth<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:52.140> creates

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
air back and forth and that creates

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.790 
air back and forth and that creates
sound<00:02:52.830> waves<00:02:53.100> which<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.550> how<00:02:53.850> we<00:02:53.910> hear<00:02:54.800> cool

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
sound waves which is how we hear cool

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.890
