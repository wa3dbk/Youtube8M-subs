back<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> 1970s<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.280> they<00:00:44.280> were<00:00:44.399> trying

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
back in the 1970s and they were trying

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.270 
back in the 1970s and they were trying
to<00:00:44.760> produce<00:00:44.910> dietary<00:00:45.690> obesity<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.680> rats<00:00:47.039> so

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
to produce dietary obesity and rats so

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.000 
to produce dietary obesity and rats so
they<00:00:47.399> could<00:00:47.550> study<00:00:47.789> obesity<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.559> at<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> time

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
they could study obesity so at the time

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.189 
they could study obesity so at the time
they<00:00:50.309> were<00:00:50.370> they<00:00:51.270> were<00:00:51.329> trying<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> develop<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
they were they were trying to develop a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.160 
they were they were trying to develop a
reliable<00:00:52.500> model<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.059> grad<00:00:54.660> students

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
reliable model so that grad students

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.930 
reliable model so that grad students
didn't<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.280> wait<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> year<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
didn't have to you know wait a year to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.209 
didn't have to you know wait a year to
get<00:00:57.210> fat<00:00:57.420> rats<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:57.960> wanted<00:00:58.199> fat<00:00:58.410> rats<00:00:58.800> quick

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
get fat rats they wanted fat rats quick

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
get fat rats they wanted fat rats quick
and<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.850> wanted<00:01:00.149> him<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.570> really<00:01:00.600> fat

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and they wanted him really really fat

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.979 
and they wanted him really really fat
and<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:02.039> how<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.760> well<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.840> can

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and so how do you do that well you can

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.530 
and so how do you do that well you can
feed<00:01:04.199> him<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.559> high<00:01:04.710> fat<00:01:04.949> diet<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.670> will<00:01:05.909> cause

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
feed him a high fat diet that will cause

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.500 
feed him a high fat diet that will cause
them<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> gain<00:01:07.049> fat<00:01:07.490> but<00:01:08.490> school<00:01:09.000> fani<00:01:09.210> had

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
them to gain fat but school fani had

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.649 
them to gain fat but school fani had
this<00:01:09.720> kind<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.170> novel<00:01:10.500> idea<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.210> as<00:01:12.210> far<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
this kind of novel idea that as far as I

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.149 
this kind of novel idea that as far as I
know<00:01:12.720> no<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.110> had<00:01:13.380> ever<00:01:13.500> tried<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.010> before

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
know no one had ever tried this before

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.109 
know no one had ever tried this before
him<00:01:14.610> he<00:01:15.600> went<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> grocery<00:01:17.040> store<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> he

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
bought all kinds of human junk food he

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.219 
bought all kinds of human junk food he
bought<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.450> stuff<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.990> eat

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
bought the kind of stuff that we eat

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.920 
bought the kind of stuff that we eat
every<00:01:22.439> single<00:01:22.650> day<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:24.210> he<00:01:24.299> found<00:01:24.540> is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
every single day and what he found is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.630 
every single day and what he found is
that<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.439> rats<00:01:25.740> those<00:01:26.159> foods<00:01:26.400> are

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
that in rats those foods are

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.490 
that in rats those foods are
exceptionally<00:01:27.630> fattening<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:30.420> fat<00:01:31.200> gain

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
exceptionally fattening so the fat gain

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
exceptionally fattening so the fat gain
that<00:01:31.650> those<00:01:31.829> rats<00:01:32.100> experienced<00:01:32.880> completely

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
that those rats experienced completely

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.520 
that those rats experienced completely
outpaced<00:01:34.549> anything<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.420> could<00:01:36.630> provoke

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
outpaced anything that you could provoke

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.340

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
by any other type of diet by far I mean

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.440 
by any other type of diet by far I mean
you<00:01:40.500> could<00:01:40.680> put<00:01:40.920> regular<00:01:41.549> healthy<00:01:41.939> rat<00:01:42.119> chow

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
you could put regular healthy rat chow

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.440 
you could put regular healthy rat chow
you<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.439> regular<00:01:43.820> healthy<00:01:44.820> rat<00:01:45.000> chow<00:01:45.240> it's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
you know regular healthy rat chow it's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.569 
you know regular healthy rat chow it's
mostly<00:01:46.049> corn<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.560> soybeans<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.280> they're

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
mostly corn and soybeans they they're

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.539 
mostly corn and soybeans they they're
pretty<00:01:47.850> healthy<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> stuff<00:01:49.280> it's<00:01:50.280> good

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
pretty healthy on the stuff it's good

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.889 
pretty healthy on the stuff it's good
for<00:01:50.759> them<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.119> put<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.509> their<00:01:51.659> cage

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
for them you can put it in their cage

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.109 
for them you can put it in their cage
and<00:01:52.229> they<00:01:52.710> will<00:01:52.860> completely<00:01:53.280> ignore<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.970> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and they will completely ignore it and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.139 
and they will completely ignore it and
instead<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.229> will<00:01:55.380> eat<00:01:55.590> chips<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.729> cookies

know it's not good for us so we might

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.370 
put you know a gun to your head you
would<00:05:21.870> need<00:05:22.110> it

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
would need it

would need it
but<00:05:23.930> that<00:05:24.930> doesn't<00:05:25.260> mean<00:05:25.410> that<00:05:25.620> it's<00:05:25.800> easy<00:05:26.070> to

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
but that doesn't mean that it's easy to

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.940 
but that doesn't mean that it's easy to

control those impulses especially if

you're depleted if your impulse control

works all day you've been making big
decisions<00:05:36.540> all<00:05:36.990> day<00:05:37.020> you're<00:05:37.410> stressed<00:05:37.740> out

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
decisions all day you're stressed out

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.790 
decisions all day you're stressed out
you<00:05:38.130> haven't<00:05:38.400> slept<00:05:38.640> enough<00:05:39.500> you're<00:05:40.500> going<00:05:40.680> to

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
you haven't slept enough you're going to

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.410 
you haven't slept enough you're going to
have<00:05:40.920> a<00:05:40.950> higher<00:05:41.190> level<00:05:41.220> of<00:05:41.670> impulsivity

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
have a higher level of impulsivity

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.960 
have a higher level of impulsivity
and<00:05:42.690> it's<00:05:43.620> gonna<00:05:43.770> be<00:05:43.950> more<00:05:44.190> difficult<00:05:44.250> for<00:05:44.880> you

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
and it's gonna be more difficult for you

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.510 
and it's gonna be more difficult for you
to<00:05:45.000> make<00:05:45.240> constructive<00:05:45.570> choices<00:05:46.410> in<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:47.310> face

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
to make constructive choices in the face

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.170 
to make constructive choices in the face
of<00:05:47.550> these<00:05:47.910> very<00:05:48.240> very<00:05:48.990> compelling<00:05:49.410> foods<00:05:49.800> and

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
of these very very compelling foods and

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.820 
of these very very compelling foods and
so<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.210> think<00:05:51.450> from<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:51.930> dietary<00:05:52.590> perspective

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
so I think from a dietary perspective

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.210 
so I think from a dietary perspective
it's<00:05:53.520> very<00:05:53.730> important<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.720> cook<00:05:55.650> for<00:05:55.860> yourself

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
it's very important to cook for yourself

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.020 
it's very important to cook for yourself
make<00:05:56.700> foods<00:05:57.000> from<00:05:57.330> simple<00:05:59.030> single

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
make foods from simple single

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.830 
make foods from simple single
ingredients<00:06:00.660> if<00:06:01.190> you're<00:06:02.190> able<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.490> I<00:06:02.670> think

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
ingredients if you're able to I think

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.510 
ingredients if you're able to I think
restaurants<00:06:03.840> tend<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.380> be<00:06:04.530> a<00:06:04.560> real<00:06:04.830> pitfall

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
restaurants tend to be a real pitfall

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.050 
restaurants tend to be a real pitfall
you<00:06:05.850> don't<00:06:06.030> realize<00:06:07.760> exactly<00:06:08.760> what<00:06:08.910> you're

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
you don't realize exactly what you're

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.100 
you don't realize exactly what you're
eating<00:06:09.240> when<00:06:09.510> you<00:06:09.600> walk<00:06:09.780> into<00:06:09.960> a<00:06:10.080> restaurant

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
eating when you walk into a restaurant

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.110 
eating when you walk into a restaurant
avoiding<00:06:13.110> processed<00:06:13.350> food<00:06:13.830> but<00:06:14.790> I<00:06:14.820> think

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
avoiding processed food but I think

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.190 
avoiding processed food but I think
another<00:06:15.330> thing<00:06:15.420> that's<00:06:15.690> really<00:06:15.840> really

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
another thing that's really really

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.980 
another thing that's really really
important<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.160> doesn't<00:06:18.000> always<00:06:18.210> necessarily

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
important and doesn't always necessarily

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.900 
important and doesn't always necessarily
make<00:06:19.620> it<00:06:19.650> to<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:19.950> top<00:06:20.130> of<00:06:20.280> the<00:06:20.340> pile<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.790> these

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
make it to the top of the pile and these

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.780 
make it to the top of the pile and these
types<00:06:21.300> of<00:06:21.450> discussions<00:06:22.020> is<00:06:22.670> controlling<00:06:23.670> your

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
types of discussions is controlling your

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.420 
types of discussions is controlling your
food<00:06:24.000> environment<00:06:24.830> because<00:06:25.830> I<00:06:25.860> think<00:06:26.190> that<00:06:26.400> a

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
food environment because I think that a

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.450 
food environment because I think that a
lot<00:06:26.790> of<00:06:26.910> people<00:06:27.240> have<00:06:28.200> some<00:06:28.530> idea<00:06:28.560> about<00:06:29.250> how

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
lot of people have some idea about how

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.000 
lot of people have some idea about how

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
to eat healthy now if they may not be
