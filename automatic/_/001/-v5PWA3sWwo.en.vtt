weather side just has some logo on it

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:51.660 
weather side just has some logo on it
and<00:03:44.030> right<00:03:44.269> here<00:03:48.160> is<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.430> battery<00:03:50.120> back

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
and right here is the battery back

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.160 
and right here is the battery back
without<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:53.000> little<00:03:53.239> key<00:03:53.480> thing<00:03:53.780> is<00:03:53.810> for<00:03:54.079> it

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
without the little key thing is for it

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.000 
without the little key thing is for it
to<00:03:54.260> stand<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:59.870> little<00:04:00.230> key<00:04:00.410> right<00:04:00.590> here<00:04:00.620> to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
to stand this little key right here to

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:10.420 
to stand this little key right here to
know<00:04:01.040> what<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.340> was<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.819> key<00:04:06.639> this<00:04:09.430> probably

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
know what it was is a key this probably

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:20.220 
know what it was is a key this probably
goes<00:04:10.900> in<00:04:13.000> in<00:04:14.380> here<00:04:15.380> probably<00:04:15.650> for<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.639> stand

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:28.550 

I<00:04:24.030> would<00:04:25.030> guess<00:04:25.300> that's<00:04:25.570> how<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.720> goes<00:04:25.870> or

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
I would guess that's how it goes or

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.890 
I would guess that's how it goes or
we're<00:04:29.560> stand<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.700> can't<00:04:31.120> see<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.360> very<00:04:31.570> good

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.230 

but<00:04:34.900> for<00:04:35.140> a<00:04:35.170> stand<00:04:38.280> cuz<00:04:39.280> without<00:04:39.460> it<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.060> we'll

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
but for a stand cuz without it and we'll

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:52.770 
but for a stand cuz without it and we'll
stay<00:04:40.570> up<00:04:50.550> I'm<00:04:51.550> guessing<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.030> goes<00:04:52.360> like<00:04:52.390> that

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
stay up I'm guessing that goes like that

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.570 
stay up I'm guessing that goes like that
and<00:04:53.050> just<00:04:53.110> put<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.590> battery<00:04:53.950> in<00:04:54.070> see<00:04:54.460> if

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
and just put the battery in see if

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:05.070 
and just put the battery in see if
there's<00:04:54.850> any<00:04:55.000> power<00:05:03.300> then<00:05:04.300> put<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.780> cover

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
there's any power then put the cover

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:21.220 
there's any power then put the cover
back<00:05:05.200> on<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:12.480> power

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.470 

there<00:05:21.890> we<00:05:22.010> go<00:05:22.220> call<00:05:23.090> power<00:05:23.360> I<00:05:24.970> guess<00:05:25.970> that's<00:05:26.180> in

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
there we go call power I guess that's in

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.610 
there we go call power I guess that's in
discovery<00:05:27.380> mode<00:05:27.410> right<00:05:27.770> there<00:05:29.500> thanks<00:05:30.500> for
