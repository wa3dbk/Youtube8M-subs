00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.580 

there<00:00:09.000> are<00:00:09.179> several<00:00:09.510> factors<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:10.260> have<00:00:10.440> to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
there are several factors you have to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.310 
there are several factors you have to
keep<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:10.920> mind<00:00:11.130> when<00:00:11.340> aiming<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.700> skill-shot

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
keep in mind when aiming a skill-shot

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.720 
keep in mind when aiming a skill-shot
firstly<00:00:13.320> there's<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.710> projectile<00:00:14.160> speed<00:00:14.490> and

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
firstly there's a projectile speed and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.029 
firstly there's a projectile speed and
woods<00:00:15.049> different<00:00:16.049> skill<00:00:16.260> shots<00:00:16.529> travel<00:00:16.920> at

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
woods different skill shots travel at

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.920 
woods different skill shots travel at
different<00:00:17.070> speeds<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:18.359> wider<00:00:18.630> hit

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
different speeds and have wider hit

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.620 
different speeds and have wider hit
boxes<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.560> then<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.789> projectile<00:00:21.300> range

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
boxes and then this projectile range

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.080 
boxes and then this projectile range
some<00:00:22.590> skill<00:00:22.890> shots<00:00:23.100> go<00:00:23.250> further<00:00:23.519> than<00:00:23.699> others

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
some skill shots go further than others

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.759 
some skill shots go further than others
and<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.359> means<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.350> launch<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> from

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and that means you can launch it from

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.130 
and that means you can launch it from
further<00:00:25.980> away<00:00:26.359> however<00:00:27.359> today<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.900> will<00:00:28.019> be

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
further away however today we will be

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.099 
further away however today we will be
comparing<00:00:28.470> skill<00:00:28.830> shots<00:00:29.070> aimed<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:29.580> target

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
comparing skill shots aimed at target

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.479 
comparing skill shots aimed at target
750<00:00:31.109> range<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.439> way<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.920> maintain<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.250> fair

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
750 range a way to maintain a fair

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.060 
750 range a way to maintain a fair
comparison<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.410> then<00:00:34.410> there's<00:00:34.590> champion

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
comparison and then there's champion

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.310 
comparison and then there's champion
width<00:00:35.309> otherwise<00:00:35.850> known<00:00:36.120> as<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.300> hitbox<00:00:36.480> this

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
is how wide or fat a champion is larger

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
is how wide or fat a champion is larger
the<00:00:40.230> hitbox<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.950> bigger<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.309> collision<00:00:41.700> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the hitbox the bigger the collision it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.940 
the hitbox the bigger the collision it
takes<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.120> ranges<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> then<00:00:43.680> there's<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
takes and ranges and then there's the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.740

have<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.149> dog<00:00:48.329> usko<00:00:48.750> shop<00:00:49.640> there<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.789> also<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
have to dog usko shop there are also a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.510 
have to dog usko shop there are also a
couple<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.539> user<00:00:51.750> dependent<00:00:52.260> factors<00:00:52.649> firstly

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
couple of user dependent factors firstly

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490 
couple of user dependent factors firstly
there's<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> ping<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.270> latency<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.289> higher

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
there's the ping or latency the higher

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.590 
there's the ping or latency the higher
your<00:00:55.739> ping<00:00:56.039> later<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:57.090> actions<00:00:57.480> are

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
your ping later your actions are

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
your ping later your actions are
registered<00:00:58.109> by<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.289> game<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> ping<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.520> 100

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
registered by the game so a ping of 100

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
registered by the game so a ping of 100
milliseconds<00:01:00.449> means<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> move<00:01:01.199> command

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
milliseconds means that a move command

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.039 
milliseconds means that a move command
is<00:01:01.890> only<00:01:02.430> registered<00:01:02.969> 100<00:01:03.600> milliseconds

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
is only registered 100 milliseconds

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
is only registered 100 milliseconds
later<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.739> game<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> then<00:01:05.729> there's<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
later in the game and then there's a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.060 
later in the game and then there's a
reaction<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.659> which<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.260> how<00:01:07.530> quickly<00:01:07.770> you

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
a step into the unknown here I'm going

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.130 
a step into the unknown here I'm going
to<00:01:53.399> assume<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.970> cast<00:01:54.210> animation<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.780> 200

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to assume a cast animation of 200

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.109 
to assume a cast animation of 200

milliseconds for old skills which is a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.940 
milliseconds for old skills which is a
somewhat<00:01:57.600> slower<00:01:57.930> cast<00:01:58.290> animation<00:01:58.799> and

somewhat slower cast animation and

somewhat slower cast animation and
that's<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.759> stay<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.149> safe<00:02:00.329> side

can tell that projectile speed is

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:38.159 
can tell that projectile speed is

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
extremely important but we all know that
