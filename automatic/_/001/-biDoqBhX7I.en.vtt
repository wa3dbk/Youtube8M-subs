this is dr. Kevin Kirk and I'm going to
make<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.529> candy<00:00:07.529> cane<00:00:07.970> now<00:00:08.970> instead<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
make a candy cane now instead of the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.299 
make a candy cane now instead of the
standard<00:00:09.750> primitives<00:00:10.410> I'm<00:00:10.710> going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.099> go<00:00:11.250> to

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
standard primitives I'm going to go to

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.330 
standard primitives I'm going to go to
extended<00:00:12.240> primitives<00:00:12.769> and<00:00:13.769> I'll<00:00:13.950> just<00:00:14.130> jump

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
extended primitives and I'll just jump

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.340 
extended primitives and I'll just jump
in<00:00:14.490> here<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.940> hit<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> G<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.900> get<00:00:16.080> rid<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
in here I hit the G to get rid of the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.700 
in here I hit the G to get rid of the
grid<00:00:16.529> for<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.270> make<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> capsule<00:00:18.869> I'm<00:00:19.529> gonna

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
grid for now I make a capsule I'm gonna

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.439 
grid for now I make a capsule I'm gonna
drag<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:21.170> well<00:00:22.170> WEP<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.369> fairly<00:00:23.609> tall<00:00:23.880> candy

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
drag that well WEP so fairly tall candy

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
drag that well WEP so fairly tall candy
cane<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.869> go<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.170> selection<00:00:25.560> when<00:00:26.519> I'm<00:00:26.640> done

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
cane here go to selection when I'm done

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.580 
cane here go to selection when I'm done
with<00:00:26.939> that

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
with that

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.650 
with that
that's<00:00:28.590> don't<00:00:28.800> modify<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.269> I'm<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that's don't modify it so I'm going to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.269 
that's don't modify it so I'm going to
change<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> number<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.260> height<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.740> segments

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
change the number of height the segments

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.310 
change the number of height the segments
and<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> threes<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.450> force<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.170> can

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and the a threes that force so you can

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.770 
and the a threes that force so you can
see<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> sections<00:00:34.980> are<00:00:35.450> this<00:00:36.450> doesn't<00:00:36.750> even

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
see the sections are this doesn't even

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.040 
see the sections are this doesn't even
look<00:00:36.899> tall<00:00:37.230> enough<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.860> yet<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.550> I'll

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
look tall enough to be yet I think I'll

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.160 
look tall enough to be yet I think I'll
zoom<00:00:40.050> out<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.230> bit<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.739> bring<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.460> fight<00:00:45.170> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
zoom out a bit and bring a fight that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.360 
zoom out a bit and bring a fight that
looks<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.440> bit<00:00:46.469> better<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.010> I'll<00:00:47.100> play<00:00:47.250> with

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
looks a bit better so I'll play with

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.369 
looks a bit better so I'll play with
that<00:00:47.520> now<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.300> want<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> break<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> segments

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that now I want to break up the segments

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.470 
that now I want to break up the segments
so<00:00:49.980> zoom<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> bit<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.940> want<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> bring<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
so zoom in a bit and I want to bring the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.069 
so zoom in a bit and I want to bring the
segments<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> height<00:00:52.469> segments<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> bring

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
segments of the height segments so bring

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.189 
segments of the height segments so bring
that<00:00:55.170> way<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.879> quite<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> bit<00:00:57.199> that's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that way up there quite a bit that's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.069 
that way up there quite a bit that's
gonna<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.530> important<00:00:59.390> it's<00:01:00.390> quite<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> lot

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
gonna be important it's quite a lot

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
gonna be important it's quite a lot
that's<00:01:01.530> gonna<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.800> important<00:01:02.250> when<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.579> bend

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
that's gonna be important when we bend

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.710 
that's gonna be important when we bend
this<00:01:03.090> thing<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:04.619> twist<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> thing<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:06.119> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
this thing and twist this thing so that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.429 
this thing and twist this thing so that
looks<00:01:06.930> about<00:01:07.020> right

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
looks about right

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.660 
looks about right
it<00:01:07.590> doesn't<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.189> number<00:01:08.369> just

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it doesn't have to be that number just

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.450 
it doesn't have to be that number just
anywhere<00:01:08.939> around<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.950> this<00:01:10.950> part<00:01:11.280> is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
anywhere around there and this part is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.120 
anywhere around there and this part is
done<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.939> capsule<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.510> done<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.740> start<00:01:14.010> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
done this capsule is done so we start to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.130 
done this capsule is done so we start to
shape<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.729> first<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.509> color<00:01:15.900> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
shape it but first I'm going to color it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.160 
shape it but first I'm going to color it
so<00:01:16.950> I'll<00:01:17.009> jump<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> top<00:01:18.360> view<00:01:18.570> get

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so I'll jump in up to the top view get

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.980 
so I'll jump in up to the top view get
rid<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> grid<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.920> don't<00:01:20.700> need<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.780> as

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
rid of the grid I don't need it I can as

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.520 
rid of the grid I don't need it I can as
either<00:01:22.229> zoom<00:01:22.470> into<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.540> let's<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.080> want

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
either zoom into it and let's see I want

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.350 
either zoom into it and let's see I want
to<00:01:26.299> grab<00:01:27.560> every<00:01:28.560> other<00:01:28.680> part<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.490> let's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
to grab every other part of that let's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.719 
to grab every other part of that let's
jump<00:01:30.540> into<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.100> freeform<00:01:32.100> selection<00:01:32.549> tool

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
jump into the freeform selection tool

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.370 
jump into the freeform selection tool
here<00:01:32.810> now<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:33.840> kind<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.579> grab<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
here now just kind of grab it like so

here now just kind of grab it like so
well<00:01:37.380> first<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.100> make<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> an

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
well first you have to make it an

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.719 
well first you have to make it an
editable<00:01:38.820> polygon<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.360> course<00:01:40.700> make<00:01:41.700> sure

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
editable polygon of course make sure

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.389 
editable polygon of course make sure
you're<00:01:41.970> grabbing<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.329> polygons<00:01:42.829> and<00:01:43.829> grab<00:01:44.189> in

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you're grabbing the polygons and grab in

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.920 
you're grabbing the polygons and grab in
somewhere<00:01:44.869> hold<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.590> control<00:01:47.009> or<00:01:47.930> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
somewhere hold down the control or the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.510 
somewhere hold down the control or the
shift<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.560> set<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> Maya<00:01:50.220> sweet

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
shift of it set up for the Maya sweet

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.170 
shift of it set up for the Maya sweet
you<00:01:51.479> know<00:01:51.509> hold<00:01:51.840> down<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> ctrl

angle<00:04:10.439> up<00:04:10.680> SunTrust<00:04:11.400> here<00:04:11.549> whichever

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
angle up SunTrust here whichever

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.390 
angle up SunTrust here whichever
direction<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.420> want<00:04:12.629> to<00:04:12.799> and<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:14.250> looks

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
direction you want to and that looks

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.979 
direction you want to and that looks
pretty<00:04:14.609> good<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:15.030> me<00:04:15.060> if<00:04:15.569> I<00:04:15.659> did<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.900> eighth

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
pretty good to me if I did the eighth

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.479 
pretty good to me if I did the eighth
reason<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.410> force<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.799> see<00:04:17.070> how<00:04:17.310> these

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
reason to force you to see how these

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.879 
reason to force you to see how these
segments<00:04:17.910> are<00:04:18.030> starting<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.449> kind<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.350> spin

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
segments are starting to kind of spin

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.409 
segments are starting to kind of spin
around<00:04:20.009> and<00:04:20.639> that's<00:04:20.850> why<00:04:21.000> we<00:04:21.090> have<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.389> many

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
around and that's why we have so many

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.379 
around and that's why we have so many
segments<00:04:22.019> so<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.039> looks<00:04:23.190> nice<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:24.360> think

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
segments so that looks nice and I think

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.050 
segments so that looks nice and I think
I'll<00:04:24.630> stop<00:04:24.900> there<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:26.340> that's<00:04:26.669> great

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
I'll stop there so that's great

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.749 
I'll stop there so that's great
another<00:04:28.020> thing<00:04:28.289> that<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.500> want<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.830> do<00:04:29.009> and<00:04:29.639> I

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
another thing that I want to do and I

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.779 
another thing that I want to do and I
think<00:04:29.880> I'll<00:04:30.030> go<00:04:30.150> into<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:31.160> top<00:04:32.160> or<00:04:32.340> side<00:04:32.550> view

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
think I'll go into the top or side view

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.850 
think I'll go into the top or side view
for<00:04:32.940> this<00:04:33.229> get<00:04:34.229> rid<00:04:34.289> of<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.470> grid

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
for this get rid of the grid

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.360 
for this get rid of the grid
I<00:04:36.050> want<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.139> bend<00:04:37.410> this<00:04:37.860> thing

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
I want to bend this thing

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.890 
I want to bend this thing
what's<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.699> candy<00:04:39.000> cane<00:04:39.150> with<00:04:39.330> I'm<00:04:39.479> bending<00:04:39.810> it

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
what's a candy cane with I'm bending it

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.140 
what's a candy cane with I'm bending it
so<00:04:40.229> let's<00:04:41.070> try<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.340> bend<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:43.789> drop<00:04:44.789> a<00:04:44.820> bend

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
so let's try to bend it drop a bend

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.189 
so let's try to bend it drop a bend
modifier<00:04:45.449> on<00:04:46.020> top<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.880> then<00:04:48.389> sounds<00:04:48.870> easy<00:04:49.020> it

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
modifier on top and then sounds easy it

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.230 
modifier on top and then sounds easy it
can<00:04:49.289> be<00:04:49.349> a<00:04:49.440> little<00:04:49.680> tricky<00:04:50.000> here's<00:04:51.000> what<00:04:51.150> we're

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
can be a little tricky here's what we're

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.600 
can be a little tricky here's what we're
gonna<00:04:51.300> do<00:04:51.539> I'm<00:04:51.630> gonna<00:04:51.750> open<00:04:51.870> this<00:04:52.110> up<00:04:52.610> first

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
gonna do I'm gonna open this up first

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.080 
gonna do I'm gonna open this up first
I'm<00:04:53.849> gonna<00:04:54.000> bend<00:04:54.389> the<00:04:54.870> regular<00:04:55.139> base<00:04:55.320> angle<00:04:55.710> oh

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
I'm gonna bend the regular base angle oh

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.129 
I'm gonna bend the regular base angle oh
it's<00:04:57.090> bending<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:57.479> different<00:04:57.720> way<00:04:57.840> that's

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
it's bending in a different way that's

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.230 
it's bending in a different way that's
fine<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:59.340> can<00:04:59.370> change<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.759> direction<00:04:59.880> out

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
fine you can change the direction out

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.010 
fine you can change the direction out
four<00:05:00.570> hundred<00:05:00.599> ninety<00:05:01.080> degrees<00:05:01.349> that's<00:05:01.590> fine

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
four hundred ninety degrees that's fine

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.159 
four hundred ninety degrees that's fine
okay

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
okay

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.820 
okay
so<00:05:04.740> I<00:05:04.770> bend<00:05:05.039> it<00:05:05.099> out<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:07.020> here's<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.470> thing<00:05:07.560> I

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
so I bend it out and here's the thing I

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.730 
so I bend it out and here's the thing I
bring<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.099> gizmo<00:05:08.520> up<00:05:09.320> this<00:05:10.320> is<00:05:10.440> just<00:05:10.620> the

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
bring the gizmo up this is just the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.540 
bring the gizmo up this is just the
gizmo<00:05:11.039> and<00:05:11.070> bring<00:05:11.370> that<00:05:11.490> straight<00:05:11.880> up<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:13.550> I

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
gizmo and bring that straight up and I

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.230 
gizmo and bring that straight up and I
will<00:05:14.760> do<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.229> limit<00:05:16.229> on<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.800> effect<00:05:17.090> such<00:05:18.090> an

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
will do it limit on the effect such an

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.060 
will do it limit on the effect such an
upper<00:05:18.570> limit<00:05:18.780> effect<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:22.500> bring<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.800> gizmo

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
upper limit effect and bring the gizmo

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.589 
upper limit effect and bring the gizmo
up<00:05:23.220> so<00:05:23.490> now<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.639> can<00:05:23.789> start<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:24.030> bend<00:05:24.270> this<00:05:24.389> here

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
up so now I can start to bend this here

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.070 
up so now I can start to bend this here
as<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.620> can<00:05:25.740> see<00:05:25.860> it's<00:05:25.979> starting<00:05:26.190> to<00:05:26.280> bend<00:05:26.460> out

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
as you can see it's starting to bend out

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.870 
as you can see it's starting to bend out
so<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.110> can<00:05:28.289> increase<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.860> angle<00:05:29.250> you<00:05:29.760> can

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
so I can increase the angle you can

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.149 
so I can increase the angle you can
curve<00:05:30.120> it<00:05:30.240> all<00:05:30.960> this<00:05:31.139> is<00:05:31.199> just<00:05:31.530> preference

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
curve it all this is just preference

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.710 
curve it all this is just preference
something<00:05:32.880> like<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.180> looks<00:05:33.389> like<00:05:33.479> a<00:05:33.510> really

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
something like that looks like a really

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.629 
something like that looks like a really
good<00:05:33.930> candy<00:05:34.199> cane<00:05:34.349> I<00:05:34.590> can<00:05:35.250> bring<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.490> gift

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
good candy cane I can bring the gift

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.960 
good candy cane I can bring the gift
move<00:05:35.820> two<00:05:35.940> down<00:05:36.090> kind<00:05:36.570> of<00:05:36.630> rule<00:05:36.900> that<00:05:37.289> shape<00:05:37.970> so

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
move two down kind of rule that shape so

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.939 
move two down kind of rule that shape so
I<00:05:39.030> can<00:05:39.180> make<00:05:39.330> it<00:05:39.360> as<00:05:39.539> sharp<00:05:39.810> or<00:05:39.960> as<00:05:40.080> easy<00:05:40.680> as<00:05:40.860> I

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
I can make it as sharp or as easy as I

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.960 
I can make it as sharp or as easy as I
want<00:05:41.130> and<00:05:41.880> then<00:05:42.060> by<00:05:42.180> controlling<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.630> angle

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
want and then by controlling the angle

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.170 
want and then by controlling the angle
hmm

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
hmm

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.189 
hmm
thinking<00:05:45.570> what<00:05:45.690> that<00:05:45.780> gives<00:05:45.870> men<00:05:46.050> down<00:05:46.169> a

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
thinking what that gives men down a

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.439 
thinking what that gives men down a
little<00:05:46.380> bit<00:05:46.530> I<00:05:46.740> can<00:05:47.310> make<00:05:47.520> this<00:05:47.639> look<00:05:47.820> any<00:05:48.330> way

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
little bit I can make this look any way

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.600 
little bit I can make this look any way
I<00:05:48.479> want<00:05:48.720> that<00:05:49.380> looks<00:05:49.560> pretty<00:05:49.949> good

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
I want that looks pretty good

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.629 
I want that looks pretty good
maybe<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.360> bit<00:05:51.479> of<00:05:51.570> a<00:05:51.630> tighter<00:05:51.840> curve<00:05:52.159> and<00:05:53.159> yeah

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
maybe a bit of a tighter curve and yeah

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.939 
maybe a bit of a tighter curve and yeah
that's<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.300> good<00:05:54.419> candy<00:05:54.720> cane<00:05:54.870> side<00:05:55.650> this<00:05:55.800> whole

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
that's a good candy cane side this whole

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.240 
that's a good candy cane side this whole
thing<00:05:56.130> it's<00:05:56.759> completely<00:05:57.180> done<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:57.780> click<00:05:58.080> off

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
thing it's completely done and click off

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.089 
thing it's completely done and click off
I'll<00:05:59.250> go<00:05:59.340> back<00:05:59.460> into<00:05:59.669> my<00:05:59.789> perspective<00:06:00.270> here

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
I'll go back into my perspective here

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:03.480 
I'll go back into my perspective here
take<00:06:02.099> a<00:06:02.190> look

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
take a look
