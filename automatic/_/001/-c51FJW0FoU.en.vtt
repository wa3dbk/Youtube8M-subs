00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
really thick so obviously this would be

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.500

basically just like a tartan kind of

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.230 
basically just like a tartan kind of
like<00:04:49.720> over<00:04:50.260> like<00:04:50.860> you<00:04:51.130> know<00:04:51.160> like<00:04:51.400> shirt<00:04:51.700> so

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
like over like you know like shirt so

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.430 
like over like you know like shirt so
you<00:04:52.270> can<00:04:52.450> either<00:04:52.540> wear<00:04:52.750> this<00:04:52.900> like<00:04:53.139> wrapped

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
you can either wear this like wrapped

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.590 
you can either wear this like wrapped
around<00:04:53.590> your<00:04:53.770> waist<00:04:54.040> or<00:04:54.669> you<00:04:55.150> can<00:04:55.300> wear<00:04:55.450> it

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
around your waist or you can wear it

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.360 
around your waist or you can wear it
just<00:04:55.630> like<00:04:56.110> loose<00:04:56.410> on<00:04:56.650> top<00:04:56.860> of<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.040> top<00:04:57.220> you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
just like loose on top of the top you

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.610 
just like loose on top of the top you
can<00:04:57.490> button<00:04:57.700> it<00:04:57.880> up<00:04:57.970> and<00:04:58.150> just<00:04:58.300> wear<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:58.450> alone
