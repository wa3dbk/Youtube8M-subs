pilot<00:02:03.240> holes<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.659> screws<00:02:04.549> screws<00:02:05.549> aren't

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
pilot holes for the screws screws aren't

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.260 
pilot holes for the screws screws aren't
super<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.570> they<00:02:06.719> gave<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.070> you<00:02:08.460> can

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
super that they gave with it but you can

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.720 
super that they gave with it but you can
see<00:02:09.360> they're<00:02:09.509> not<00:02:09.660> too<00:02:09.869> bad<00:02:10.050> size<00:02:10.550> go<00:02:11.550> ahead

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
see they're not too bad size go ahead

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.430 
see they're not too bad size go ahead
and<00:02:11.849> run<00:02:12.239> all<00:02:12.360> six<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.750> them<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:12.989> there<00:02:13.170> make

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and run all six of them in there make

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.240 
and run all six of them in there make
sure<00:02:13.470> that's<00:02:13.830> nice<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.069> tight<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> wall

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
sure that's nice and tight in the wall

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.150

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
16-inch steel rod all I did was heat it

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.990 
16-inch steel rod all I did was heat it
up<00:03:31.650> real<00:03:32.650> hot<00:03:32.830> with<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> torch<00:03:33.340> been<00:03:33.970> a

90-degree angle into it and then

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.430 
90-degree angle into it and then
threaded<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.820> bottom<00:03:37.120> part<00:03:37.360> hopefully<00:03:38.320> that

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
threaded the bottom part hopefully that

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.660 
threaded the bottom part hopefully that

will focus in on that a little bit
thread<00:03:40.450> at<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.600> bottom<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:40.989> rod<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:41.650> that

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
thread at the bottom of the rod so that

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.259 
thread at the bottom of the rod so that
I<00:03:42.040> can<00:03:42.400> stick<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.880> into<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:44.320> hole<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:45.060> make<00:03:46.060> a

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
I can stick it into the hole and make a

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.590 
I can stick it into the hole and make a
hanging<00:03:46.930> pivoting<00:03:47.489> pistol<00:03:48.489> mount<00:03:48.700> so

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
hanging pivoting pistol mount so

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.479 
hanging pivoting pistol mount so
hopefully<00:03:50.350> that'll<00:03:50.680> save<00:03:50.980> me<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.190> bunch<00:03:51.400> of

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
hopefully that'll save me a bunch of

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.370 
hopefully that'll save me a bunch of
space<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.030> size<00:03:52.269> you<00:03:52.600> see<00:03:52.810> it's<00:03:52.959> not<00:03:53.019> quite

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
space and size you see it's not quite

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.289 
space and size you see it's not quite
done<00:03:53.560> yet<00:03:53.620> I'm<00:03:54.519> going<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.730> put<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:54.910> little<00:03:55.090> bit

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
done yet I'm going to put a little bit

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.240 
done yet I'm going to put a little bit
of<00:03:55.360> heat<00:03:55.959> shrink<00:03:56.260> tubing<00:03:56.320> on<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.769> end<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.160> that

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
of heat shrink tubing on the end of that

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.380 
of heat shrink tubing on the end of that
to<00:03:57.430> protect<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.850> barrel<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.360> gun

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
amount of space so this hopefully going

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.420 
amount of space so this hopefully going
to<00:04:56.570> work<00:04:56.690> out<00:04:56.840> pretty<00:04:56.990> good<00:04:57.230> all<00:04:57.980> right<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:58.400> as
