reason why people don't eat leaks is

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.620 
reason why people don't eat leaks is
because<00:00:22.439> they<00:00:22.800> are<00:00:22.949> kind<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.550> hard<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.000> clean

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
because they are kind of hard to clean

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.500 
because they are kind of hard to clean
basically<00:00:25.590> what<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.920> do<00:00:26.099> these<00:00:26.580> are<00:00:26.820> leaks<00:00:27.119> by

basically what you do these are leaks by
the<00:00:27.570> way<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.109> don't<00:00:28.230> know<00:00:28.380> what<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> leak<00:00:28.830> is

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the way you don't know what a leak is

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.919 
the way you don't know what a leak is
and<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.090> get<00:00:30.179> them<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.390> most<00:00:30.689> grocery

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.250 
and you can get them at most grocery
stores<00:00:31.349> cut<00:00:32.279> off<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.820> top<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.630> leak<00:00:33.840> first

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.780 
stores cut off the top of the leak first
off<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.860> these<00:00:35.040> guys<00:00:35.309> are<00:00:35.370> absolutely

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
course and then just let the leeks cook

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.630

in this pot until they become tender and
this<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:46.000> what<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.330> leaks<00:03:46.540> will<00:03:46.720> look<00:03:46.870> like

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
this is what the leaks will look like

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.380 
this is what the leaks will look like
after<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.620> cook<00:03:47.920> them<00:03:48.130> in<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.580> pan<00:03:48.880> for<00:03:49.330> about

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
potato and I'm just by microwave this

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.600 
potato and I'm just by microwave this
for<00:03:55.810> three<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.770> a<00:03:56.830> half<00:03:56.890> minutes<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.550> a

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
for three and a half minutes in a

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.270 
for three and a half minutes in a
microwave<00:03:58.110> after<00:03:59.110> I<00:03:59.140> peeled<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.770> of<00:03:59.980> course

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
microwave after I peeled it of course

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.550 
microwave after I peeled it of course
and<00:04:00.550> then<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.060> want<00:04:01.240> to<00:04:01.300> take<00:04:01.450> my<00:04:01.600> chickpeas<00:04:02.200> and

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
and then I want to take my chickpeas and

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.330 
and then I want to take my chickpeas and
dump<00:04:03.280> them<00:04:03.550> also<00:04:04.300> into<00:04:05.020> the<00:04:05.140> pan<00:04:05.350> then<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:06.160> want

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
dump them also into the pan then I want

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.170 
dump them also into the pan then I want
to<00:04:06.400> stir<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:06.880> up<00:04:08.250> again<00:04:09.250> we're<00:04:09.520> blending<00:04:09.850> all

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
to stir this up again we're blending all

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.260 
to stir this up again we're blending all
this<00:04:10.420> so<00:04:10.900> we<00:04:11.140> don't<00:04:11.290> need<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:12.120> worry<00:04:13.120> about

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
this so we don't need to worry about

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.480 
this so we don't need to worry about
chopping<00:04:13.959> things<00:04:14.200> up<00:04:14.560> or<00:04:14.890> anything<00:04:14.980> like<00:04:15.280> that

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
chopping things up or anything like that

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
then this mixture after you've stirred

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.880 
then this mixture after you've stirred
this<00:04:18.220> up<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.640> let<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:18.850> cook<00:04:19.450> here<00:04:19.720> for<00:04:20.049> about<00:04:20.530> a

consistency I wish you could taste this

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.320 
consistency I wish you could taste this
I<00:05:48.590> know<00:05:49.590> it<00:05:49.800> looks<00:05:49.949> like<00:05:50.460> creamed<00:05:50.759> spinach<00:05:50.789> or

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
I know it looks like creamed spinach or

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.510 
I know it looks like creamed spinach or
something<00:05:51.720> it<00:05:51.870> is<00:05:52.050> absolutely<00:05:52.919> to<00:05:53.310> die<00:05:53.340> for

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
something it is absolutely to die for

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.839 
something it is absolutely to die for
and<00:05:54.030> this<00:05:54.449> was<00:05:54.660> a<00:05:54.690> key<00:05:54.960> staple<00:05:55.590> in<00:05:55.770> my<00:05:56.160> diet<00:05:56.190> in
