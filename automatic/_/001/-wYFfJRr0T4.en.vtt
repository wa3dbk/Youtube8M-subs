00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
speed limit let's just say when you

going to make it run we're just going to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.390 
going to make it run we're just going to
put<00:02:25.200> fuel<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.590> cylinders<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:25.980> need<00:02:26.250> it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
put fuel in the cylinders that need it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.610 
put fuel in the cylinders that need it
to<00:02:26.880> keep<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.150> car<00:02:27.360> going<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.200> at<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
to keep the car going and then it at the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.230 
to keep the car going and then it at the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
and you need more torque you've got it

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.400 
and you need more torque you've got it
instantaneously<00:02:33.270> you've<00:02:33.510> got<00:02:33.660> all<00:02:33.810> four<00:02:34.050> 70

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.930 
instantaneously you've got all four 70
right<00:02:34.560> there<00:02:34.620> for<00:02:34.950> you

the brakes are rumbo brakes we've been

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.550 
the brakes are rumbo brakes we've been
using<00:02:42.270> them<00:02:42.510> brembo<00:02:42.930> for<00:02:43.140> quite<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.320> few<00:02:43.380> years

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.860 
using them brembo for quite a few years
and<00:02:43.890> they're<00:02:44.160> fantastic<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.030> we've<00:02:45.180> actually

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
and they're fantastic and we've actually

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.230 
and they're fantastic and we've actually
improved<00:02:46.800> them<00:02:47.010> even<00:02:47.220> further<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.760> year<00:02:47.820> we

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
improved them even further this year we

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.140 
improved them even further this year we
developed<00:02:49.080> them<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.290> 2005<00:02:49.950> for<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.280> srt8<00:02:50.700> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
developed them in 2005 for the srt8 and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.590 
developed them in 2005 for the srt8 and
we<00:02:51.960> took<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.740> leap<00:02:53.280> forward<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.450> this

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
we took a leap forward this with this

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.870 
we took a leap forward this with this
new<00:02:54.810> model<00:02:55.130> one<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.280> complaints<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.850> we

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
lift off the pedal like a normal sedan

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.229 
lift off the pedal like a normal sedan
light<00:03:43.280> it's<00:03:43.489> going<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.700> hold<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:44.000> year

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
light it's going to hold the year

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.369 
light it's going to hold the year
because<00:03:44.390> it<00:03:44.540> thinks<00:03:44.690> you're<00:03:44.930> on<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.110> track

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
because it thinks you're on the track

and<00:03:45.650> it's<00:03:45.860> waiting<00:03:46.129> for<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.340> next<00:03:46.459> corner<00:03:46.790> I

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
and it's waiting for the next corner I

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.619 
and it's waiting for the next corner I
think<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.519> customer<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.000> going<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.269> really

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
think the customer is going to really

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.160 
think the customer is going to really
really<00:03:51.140> significantly<00:03:52.129> see<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.609> difference

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
really significantly see that difference

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.210 
really significantly see that difference
