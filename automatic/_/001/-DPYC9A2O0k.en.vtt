00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.580 
up half down and then I just braid it
around<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.909> perimeter<00:01:16.149> and<00:01:16.840> then<00:01:17.259> in<00:01:17.409> the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
around the perimeter and then in the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.160 
around the perimeter and then in the
middle<00:01:17.920> like<00:01:18.369> I<00:01:18.700> just<00:01:19.149> braided<00:01:19.659> it<00:01:19.780> any<00:01:19.960> kind

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
middle like I just braided it any kind

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.469 
middle like I just braided it any kind
of<00:01:20.320> way<00:01:20.380> because<00:01:20.649> I<00:01:20.770> really<00:01:21.100> can't<00:01:21.430> braid<00:01:21.729> but

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
of way because I really can't braid but

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.480 
of way because I really can't braid but
I<00:01:22.539> really<00:01:23.020> tried<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.380> do<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.740> perimeter<00:01:24.310> braid

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
I really tried to do the perimeter braid

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.469 
I really tried to do the perimeter braid
like<00:01:24.820> really<00:01:25.090> high<00:01:25.270> so<00:01:26.460> it'll<00:01:27.460> be<00:01:27.579> snug<00:01:27.969> on<00:01:28.390> my

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479
