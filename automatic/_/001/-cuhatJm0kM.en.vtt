00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
different place in the house to start it

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
just to switch it up and to not like not

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.750 
just to switch it up and to not like not
make<00:00:52.930> yourself<00:00:53.230> bored<00:00:53.559> from<00:00:54.190> like<00:00:54.430> always

you<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.750> most<00:01:04.930> so<00:01:05.320> once<00:01:05.500> I'm<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:05.770> my<00:01:05.890> studying

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
you the most so once I'm in my studying

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.980 
you the most so once I'm in my studying
area<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.580> will<00:01:06.820> normally<00:01:07.240> put<00:01:07.390> some<00:01:07.540> music<00:01:07.659> on

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
and I turn the a/c kind of low so it's

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.910 
and I turn the a/c kind of low so it's
like<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.920> little<00:01:12.280> bit<00:01:12.430> cold<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:13.120> then<00:01:13.750> I<00:01:14.500> will

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
like a little bit cold and then I will

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.770

get into studying for each person there
are<00:01:16.810> different<00:01:17.080> factors<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.560> influence

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
are different factors that influence

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.270 
kind of plan out my time for the day so
for<00:02:05.030> example<00:02:05.450> if<00:02:05.630> math<00:02:05.870> I<00:02:06.260> know<00:02:06.650> will<00:02:07.040> take

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
for example if math I know will take

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.160 
for example if math I know will take
like<00:02:07.550> two<00:02:08.479> hours

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
like two hours

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.210 
like two hours
I'll<00:02:09.430> set<00:02:10.430> a<00:02:10.610> time<00:02:10.970> frame<00:02:11.420> for<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.380> then<00:02:12.920> I

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
I'll set a time frame for it and then I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.010 
I'll set a time frame for it and then I
will<00:02:13.430> like<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.240> so<00:02:14.510> like<00:02:14.690> two<00:02:14.840> hours

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.180 
will like a just it so like two hours
from<00:02:15.170> math<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.860> one<00:02:16.100> hour<00:02:16.250> for<00:02:16.490> England

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
from math like one hour for England

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.850 
from math like one hour for England
and<00:02:18.780> based<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.080> schedule<00:02:20.320> we'll<00:02:20.680> start

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
and based on that schedule we'll start

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.370 
and based on that schedule we'll start
tithing<00:02:21.220> myself<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.000> method<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.600> timing
