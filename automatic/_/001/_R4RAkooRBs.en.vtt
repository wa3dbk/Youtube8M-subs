00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
your golem golems of course have been in

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.790 
your golem golems of course have been in
Minecraft<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> long<00:00:52.140> time<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.710> are

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
nowhere near as tall as a Titan but they

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.750 
nowhere near as tall as a Titan but they
served<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> same<00:00:55.800> purpose<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.579> game

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
served at the same purpose in this game

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.400 
served at the same purpose in this game
they<00:00:56.940> basically<00:00:57.210> turned<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.600> into<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.780> tank<00:00:58.109> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
they basically turned you into a tank I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.959 
they basically turned you into a tank I
can<00:00:58.949> take<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> lot<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.460> damage<00:00:59.640> though

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
can take a lot of damage though

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.880 
can take a lot of damage though
everything<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.690> game<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.620> mod<00:01:01.859> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
everything in this game for this mod I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.349 
everything in this game for this mod I
should<00:01:02.100> say<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.489> take<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> lot<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.059> damage

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
should say can take a lot of damage

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.820 
should say can take a lot of damage

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
it's just a golem and here I die and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.830 
it's just a golem and here I die and
when<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.280> die<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.490> get<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.000> death<00:01:24.570> cam

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
when you die you get this death cam

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.030 
when you die you get this death cam
where<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.200> move<00:01:25.290> around<00:01:25.500> freely<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
where you can move around freely and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.399 
where you can move around freely and
watch<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.490> action<00:01:26.990> kind<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.049> their<00:01:28.140> way<00:01:28.259> of

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
watch the action kind of their way of

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.330 
watch the action kind of their way of
emblem<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.950> guess<00:01:29.400> implementing<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.970> kill<00:01:30.180> cam

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
emblem I guess implementing a kill cam

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.590 
emblem I guess implementing a kill cam
and<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.030> plays<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> lot<00:01:33.450> more

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and as you can see this plays a lot more

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
and as you can see this plays a lot more
like<00:01:33.750> even<00:01:34.049> though<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.320> meant<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> be

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
like even though it's meant to be

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.460 
like even though it's meant to be
titanfall<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.390> plays<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.900> feels<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.229> lot<00:01:37.409> more

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
titanfall it plays it feels a lot more

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
titanfall it plays it feels a lot more
like<00:01:37.650> quake<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.610> everyone<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.210> bunny

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
like quake because everyone is bunny

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.120 
like quake because everyone is bunny
hopping<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:40.170> over<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> place<00:01:40.740> because

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
hopping all over the place because

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
hopping all over the place because
that's<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> most<00:01:41.579> effective<00:01:42.060> method<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
that's the most effective method to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.310 
that's the most effective method to
survive<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.680> mod<00:01:44.479> because<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.229> can

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
survive in this mod because as you can

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.990 
survive in this mod because as you can
see<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.009> run<00:01:47.189> out<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.399> ammo<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> takes

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
see when you run out of ammo it takes

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.160 
see when you run out of ammo it takes
quite<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> while<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.540> reload<00:01:48.899> and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
quite a while to reload and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.990 
quite a while to reload and
bunny-hopping<00:01:49.740> makes<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> hard<00:01:50.759> target

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
bunny-hopping makes you a hard target

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
because the Minecraft game engine is

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.609 
because the Minecraft game engine is
made<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.909> Java<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.170> made

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
made on Java and it's not really made

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.999

for<00:01:55.920> shooters<00:01:56.840> hit<00:01:57.840> detection<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.469> pretty

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
for shooters hit detection is pretty

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.819 
for shooters hit detection is pretty
poor<00:01:59.340> almost<00:02:00.270> 90<00:02:00.659> percent<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> time

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
poor almost 90 percent of the time

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.370 
poor almost 90 percent of the time
actually<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.810> cuz<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.079> don't<00:02:04.259> have

to<00:03:46.250> be<00:03:46.340> honest<00:03:46.610> this<00:03:47.570> isn't<00:03:47.780> something<00:03:48.080> I

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
to be honest this isn't something I

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.020

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
it's quite fun for a couple matches but

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.050 
it's quite fun for a couple matches but
then<00:05:56.620> you're<00:05:56.770> like<00:05:56.860> yeah<00:05:57.100> but<00:05:57.730> I<00:05:57.820> think<00:05:58.000> I'd

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
then you're like yeah but I think I'd

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.790 
then you're like yeah but I think I'd
rather<00:05:58.150> play<00:05:58.360> titanfall<00:05:58.870> rather<00:05:59.470> than<00:05:59.620> this

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
rather play titanfall rather than this

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.510 
rather play titanfall rather than this
unless<00:06:00.280> you're<00:06:00.460> just<00:06:00.580> really<00:06:01.000> into<00:06:01.240> Minecraft

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
unless you're just really into Minecraft

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.610 
unless you're just really into Minecraft

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
then go all bin by means go all ahead

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.250 
then go all bin by means go all ahead
and<00:06:05.740> play<00:06:05.890> this<00:06:06.070> non-stop<00:06:06.760> but<00:06:07.120> I<00:06:07.330> think<00:06:08.170> I'm

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
and play this non-stop but I think I'm

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.890 
and play this non-stop but I think I'm
done<00:06:08.410> with<00:06:08.590> it<00:06:08.620> to<00:06:09.010> be<00:06:09.040> honest<00:06:09.400> I<00:06:09.640> might<00:06:10.510> try<00:06:10.840> it

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
done with it to be honest I might try it

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.360 
done with it to be honest I might try it
