00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
double-checked and triple-checked

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.299 
double-checked and triple-checked
everything<00:00:49.269> and<00:00:50.050> couldn't<00:00:50.530> figure<00:00:50.859> it<00:00:51.159> out

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
everything and couldn't figure it out

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.180 
everything and couldn't figure it out
and<00:00:51.639> I<00:00:51.729> just<00:00:51.999> took<00:00:52.149> my<00:00:52.210> pump<00:00:52.659> off<00:00:52.870> again<00:00:53.319> and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
and I just took my pump off again and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.949 
and I just took my pump off again and
this<00:00:55.089> is<00:00:55.149> what<00:00:55.539> I<00:00:55.600> found<00:00:56.339> this<00:00:57.339> bolt<00:00:57.789> is<00:00:58.030> tight

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:58.959 
this is what I found this bolt is tight

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:06.980 
this is what I found this bolt is tight
all<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.469> way<00:01:00.569> but<00:01:01.569> my<00:01:02.289> anode<00:01:02.769> is<00:01:03.069> warm<00:01:04.649> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
all the way but my anode is warm and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.800 
all the way but my anode is warm and
there<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.289> my<00:01:08.710> rattle<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.390> have<00:01:10.570> been

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
there is my rattle and I have been

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.050 
there is my rattle and I have been
chasing<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.619> chasing<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:12.399> chasing<00:01:12.430> this

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
chasing and chasing and chasing this

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.760 
chasing and chasing and chasing this
rattle<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.869> couldn't<00:01:14.200> figure<00:01:14.409> it<00:01:14.590> out<00:01:14.710> I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
rattle and couldn't figure it out I

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.440 
rattle and couldn't figure it out I
thought<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.250> was<00:01:15.369> bearings<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.180> they're<00:01:16.299> all

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
thought it was bearings and they're all

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.700 
thought it was bearings and they're all
new<00:01:16.750> and<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.729> is<00:01:18.939> it<00:01:19.180> so<00:01:19.899> I'm<00:01:20.109> kind<00:01:20.439> of<00:01:20.530> happy

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
new and this is it so I'm kind of happy

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.959 
new and this is it so I'm kind of happy
that<00:01:21.039> I<00:01:21.070> found<00:01:21.340> it<00:01:21.640> just<00:01:23.609> wished<00:01:24.609> I<00:01:24.789> would<00:01:24.939> have

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
that I found it just wished I would have

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.060 
that I found it just wished I would have
found<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.479> lot<00:01:25.689> sooner<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.840> what<00:01:29.320> I<00:01:29.350> did<00:01:29.500> I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
found it a lot sooner so what I did I

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.849 
found it a lot sooner so what I did I
couldn't<00:01:30.340> see<00:01:31.000> do<00:01:31.869> shop<00:01:32.380> didn't<00:01:32.710> have

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
marine and I found this anode right here

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.779 
marine and I found this anode right here
and<00:01:39.960> these<00:01:40.960> are<00:01:41.229> made<00:01:41.409> for<00:01:41.829> I<00:01:42.250> think<00:01:42.609> they're

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
and these are made for I think they're

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.489 
and these are made for I think they're
for<00:01:42.969> Johnson<00:01:43.659> outboards<00:01:45.719> so<00:01:46.719> what<00:01:47.170> I'm<00:01:47.259> going

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
for Johnson outboards so what I'm going

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.739 
for Johnson outboards so what I'm going
to<00:01:47.619> do<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:48.189> take<00:01:48.460> this<00:01:48.640> bolt<00:01:48.999> out<00:01:49.210> I'm<00:01:49.570> gonna

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
to do is take this bolt out I'm gonna

to do is take this bolt out I'm gonna
drill<00:01:50.109> it<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.380> tap<00:01:50.649> it<00:01:50.920> since<00:01:51.219> there's<00:01:51.520> really

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
drill it and tap it since there's really

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.179 
drill it and tap it since there's really
nothing<00:01:52.689> you<00:01:52.719> can<00:01:52.840> hurt<00:01:53.229> in<00:01:53.409> there<00:01:53.619> with<00:01:53.859> by

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
nothing you can hurt in there with by

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.090 
nothing you can hurt in there with by
drilling<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.030> tapping<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:55.859> so<00:01:56.859> I'm<00:01:56.950> going

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
drilling it and tapping it so I'm going

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.950 
drilling it and tapping it so I'm going
to<00:01:57.189> use<00:01:57.369> this<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:58.920> these<00:01:59.920> are<00:02:00.749> two<00:02:01.749> dollars

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
to use this and these are two dollars

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.889 
to use this and these are two dollars
and<00:02:02.259> 50<00:02:02.499> cents<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.159> it's<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.210> lot<00:02:04.420> more<00:02:04.569> meat<00:02:04.869> on

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
and 50 cents and it's a lot more meat on

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.120 
and 50 cents and it's a lot more meat on
there<00:02:05.289> than<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.950> stock<00:02:06.249> anode<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:07.830> no<00:02:08.830> moving

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
there than the stock anode and no moving

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.870 
there than the stock anode and no moving
parts<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.900> what<00:02:11.050> I'm<00:02:11.140> going<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.380> go<00:02:11.500> to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
parts so this is what I'm going to go to

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.100 
parts so this is what I'm going to go to
so<00:02:12.880> if<00:02:13.120> anyone's<00:02:13.510> chasing

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
so if anyone's chasing

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.730 
so if anyone's chasing
rattle<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.740> can't<00:02:14.980> figure<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.490> out<00:02:16.740> check

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
rattle and can't figure it out check

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.570 
rattle and can't figure it out check
this<00:02:18.090> could<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.300> that
