00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.320 
what I'm about to show you is one of my
favorite<00:00:31.480> new<00:00:31.780> apps<00:00:32.140> for<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:32.920> iPhone<00:00:33.550> as<00:00:34.270> a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
favorite new apps for the iPhone as a

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.480 
favorite new apps for the iPhone as a
matter<00:00:34.540> of<00:00:34.630> fact<00:00:34.690> it's<00:00:35.200> only<00:00:35.800> for<00:00:35.980> the<00:00:36.010> iPhone

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
matter of fact it's only for the iPhone

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.910 
matter of fact it's only for the iPhone
because<00:00:37.000> it<00:00:37.150> takes<00:00:37.420> advantage<00:00:37.630> of<00:00:38.260> the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
because it takes advantage of the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.310 
because it takes advantage of the
iphones<00:00:39.340> built-in<00:00:39.820> camera<00:00:40.360> so<00:00:40.660> unfortunately

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
iphones built-in camera so unfortunately

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.780 
iphones built-in camera so unfortunately
this<00:00:41.530> app<00:00:41.770> doesn't<00:00:42.100> work<00:00:42.309> with<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.550> touch

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
this app doesn't work with the touch

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.490 
this app doesn't work with the touch
because<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.570> touch<00:00:43.720> doesn't<00:00:43.930> have<00:00:44.170> a<00:00:44.230> camera

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
because the touch doesn't have a camera

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.430 
because the touch doesn't have a camera
yet<00:00:45.059> now<00:00:46.059> also<00:00:46.330> there's<00:00:46.930> something<00:00:47.200> else<00:00:47.290> I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
yet now also there's something else I

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.900 
yet now also there's something else I
want<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.650> point<00:00:47.800> out<00:00:47.980> is<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:48.430> takes

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
want to point out is that it takes

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.090 
want to point out is that it takes
advantage<00:00:49.180> not<00:00:49.870> only<00:00:49.930> of<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.320> iphone<00:00:50.739> but<00:00:51.010> of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
advantage not only of the iphone but of

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.130 
advantage not only of the iphone but of
the<00:00:51.190> iphone<00:00:51.580> 3gs<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:52.450> built<00:00:53.350> in<00:00:53.730> macro<00:00:54.730> feature

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the iphone 3gs is built in macro feature

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.840 
the iphone 3gs is built in macro feature
so<00:00:56.140> it's<00:00:56.320> even<00:00:56.470> you<00:00:57.190> know<00:00:57.250> it's<00:00:57.490> even<00:00:57.700> more

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
so it's even you know it's even more

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.610 
so it's even you know it's even more
complicated<00:00:58.060> than<00:00:58.570> just<00:00:58.630> needing<00:00:59.079> an<00:00:59.200> iphone

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
complicated than just needing an iphone

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.060 
complicated than just needing an iphone
now<00:01:00.280> if<00:01:00.400> you<00:01:00.550> have<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.760> iphone<00:01:01.420> 3g<00:01:01.989> or<00:01:02.320> the

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
now if you have a iphone 3g or the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.550 
now if you have a iphone 3g or the
original<00:01:03.250> iphone<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.330> app<00:01:04.449> will<00:01:04.750> work<00:01:04.809> but

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
original iphone the app will work but

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.240 
original iphone the app will work but
you<00:01:05.770> will<00:01:06.070> need<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.790> separate<00:01:07.890> macro<00:01:08.890> lens

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
you will need a separate macro lens

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.630 
you will need a separate macro lens
attachment<00:01:09.910> for<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.720> back<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:11.140> your<00:01:11.229> camera

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
attachment for the back of your camera

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.550
