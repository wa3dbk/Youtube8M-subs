00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
hi guys just some crab here and I'm back

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.429 
hi guys just some crab here and I'm back
with<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:14.809> oxen<00:00:15.170> farm<00:00:15.380> again<00:00:15.530> as<00:00:15.890> of<00:00:16.760> update

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
with the oxen farm again as of update

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.739 
with the oxen farm again as of update
13.7<00:00:18.439> they<00:00:18.980> changed<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.909> original<00:00:20.449> file

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:20.749 
13.7 they changed the original file

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:26.079 
13.7 they changed the original file
every<00:00:21.019> one<00:00:21.169> year<00:00:21.380> which<00:00:21.560> was<00:00:23.140> who<00:00:24.140> was<00:00:25.089> Saturn

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:26.089 
every one year which was who was Saturn

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.470 
every one year which was who was Saturn
and<00:00:26.480> then<00:00:26.869> kappa<00:00:27.349> and<00:00:28.009> it<00:00:28.249> was<00:00:28.339> kept<00:00:28.550> up<00:00:28.730> but

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
and then kappa and it was kept up but

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.860 
and then kappa and it was kept up but
anyway<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.970> that<00:00:31.970> doesn't<00:00:32.210> work<00:00:32.300> anymore<00:00:32.570> it's

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
anyway so that doesn't work anymore it's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.849 
anyway so that doesn't work anymore it's
now<00:00:33.050> grineer<00:00:33.620> oxygen<00:00:34.520> 61<00:00:34.820> there<00:00:35.680> don't<00:00:36.680> try

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
now grineer oxygen 61 there don't try

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.729 
now grineer oxygen 61 there don't try
anyway<00:00:37.129> this<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:37.760> new<00:00:38.030> one<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:38.559> go<00:00:39.559> there

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
anyway this is a new one and go there

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.490 
anyway this is a new one and go there
and<00:00:39.890> do<00:00:39.980> this<00:00:40.129> because<00:00:40.660> this<00:00:41.660> yelled<00:00:42.170> about

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
and do this because this yelled about

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.410 
and do this because this yelled about
the<00:00:42.620> same<00:00:42.769> at<00:00:42.890> Vox<00:00:43.100> hear<00:00:43.280> me<00:00:43.489> to<00:00:43.550> run<00:00:43.789> between

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
the same at Vox hear me to run between

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.709 
the same at Vox hear me to run between
20<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.079> 50<00:00:45.620> you<00:00:46.129> can<00:00:46.280> expect<00:00:46.699> with<00:00:47.329> boosters

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
20 to 50 you can expect with boosters

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.619 
20 to 50 you can expect with boosters
obviously<00:00:48.019> considerably<00:00:48.469> more<00:00:48.670> so<00:00:49.670> you<00:00:50.269> need

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
obviously considerably more so you need

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.889 
obviously considerably more so you need
to<00:00:50.780> go<00:00:50.929> to<00:00:50.960> Europa<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.899> then<00:00:53.899> go<00:00:54.109> to<00:00:54.140> val<00:00:54.920> is

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
to go to Europa and then go to val is

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.880 
to go to Europa and then go to val is
yeah<00:00:56.899> it's<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.559> mobile<00:00:57.859> defense<00:00:58.010> corpus<00:01:01.449> so

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
yeah it's a mobile defense corpus so

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.310 
yeah it's a mobile defense corpus so
unlike<00:01:03.940> different<00:01:04.940> lon<00:01:05.030> capa<00:01:05.269> that<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.110> had

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
unlike different lon capa that you had

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.260 
unlike different lon capa that you had
to<00:01:06.740> mobile<00:01:07.070> defense<00:01:07.190> positions<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.060> then<00:01:08.180> you

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
to mobile defense positions and then you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.990 
to mobile defense positions and then you
had<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:09.430> centerpiece<00:01:10.430> that<00:01:10.640> you<00:01:10.790> had<00:01:10.880> to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
had the centerpiece that you had to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.460 
had the centerpiece that you had to
protect<00:01:11.270> there's<00:01:11.510> only<00:01:11.630> two<00:01:11.870> position

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
protect there's only two position

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.930 
protect there's only two position
positions<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.160> have<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.370> protect<00:01:13.580> this<00:01:13.730> time

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
positions you have to protect this time

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.770 
positions you have to protect this time
so<00:01:14.240> it's<00:01:14.600> actually<00:01:15.160> all<00:01:16.160> easier<00:01:16.580> I<00:01:16.850> recommend

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
so it's actually all easier I recommend

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.890 
so it's actually all easier I recommend
going<00:01:17.930> in<00:01:18.200> with<00:01:18.440> frost<00:01:19.070> or<00:01:19.550> nova<00:01:20.390> because<00:01:20.660> of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
going in with frost or nova because of

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.370 
going in with frost or nova because of
their<00:01:21.110> abilities<00:01:22.070> frost<00:01:23.020> ability<00:01:24.020> which<00:01:24.200> is

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
their abilities frost ability which is

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.830 
their abilities frost ability which is
snow<00:01:25.130> globe<00:01:25.340> slows<00:01:25.850> down<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.270> enemies<00:01:26.570> and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
snow globe slows down the enemies and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.930 
snow globe slows down the enemies and
Nova's<00:01:27.800> molecular<00:01:28.490> prime<00:01:29.830> just<00:01:30.830> um<00:01:31.190> it<00:01:31.670> slows

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
Nova's molecular prime just um it slows

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.880 
Nova's molecular prime just um it slows
them<00:01:32.120> down<00:01:32.150> as<00:01:32.450> well<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.260> makes<00:01:33.410> easier<00:01:33.680> you

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
them down as well so it makes easier you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.280 
them down as well so it makes easier you
can<00:01:34.010> actually<00:01:34.130> hit<00:01:34.370> them

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.950 

and<00:01:38.950> I'm<00:01:39.700> being<00:01:40.090> shipping<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.570> running<00:01:40.810> off

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
and I'm being shipping and running off

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:50.040 
and I'm being shipping and running off
without<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.920> bar<00:01:45.100> defense<00:01:46.920> terminal<00:01:47.920> thing<00:01:49.050> 12

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
without my bar defense terminal thing 12

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.380 
without my bar defense terminal thing 12
sorry<00:01:51.040> guys

frost crime just use their forum you can

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.380 
frost crime just use their forum you can
get<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:03.100> obviously<00:02:04.100> nekros<00:02:04.850> is<00:02:05.000> helpful

because you can loot their bodies again

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.449 
because you can loot their bodies again
it's<00:02:10.459> not<00:02:10.520> really<00:02:10.640> much<00:02:10.789> else<00:02:10.850> for<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:12.459> just

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.430 
it's not really much else for you just
use<00:02:13.730> whatever<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.060> find<00:02:14.150> smooth<00:02:14.750> best<00:02:15.020> try<00:02:15.380> to

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
use whatever you find smooth best try to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.590 
use whatever you find smooth best try to
use<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.980> weapon<00:02:16.040> that's<00:02:16.490> automatic<00:02:17.270> like<00:02:17.450> I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
use a weapon that's automatic like I

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.650 
use a weapon that's automatic like I
have<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.900> soma<00:02:19.209> because<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.360> gives<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.630> a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
have the soma because it gives you a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.730 
have the soma because it gives you a
better<00:02:20.810> chance<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.140> actually<00:02:21.230> hitting<00:02:21.500> them

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
better chance of actually hitting them

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.830 
better chance of actually hitting them
say<00:02:21.950> if<00:02:22.070> you've<00:02:22.190> got<00:02:22.310> like<00:02:22.489> progress<00:02:23.360> or<00:02:23.780> a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
say if you've got like progress or a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.960 
say if you've got like progress or a
Penta<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.860> might<00:02:25.070> be<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.250> bit<00:02:25.459> harder<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.790> hit

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
Penta it might be a bit harder to hit

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.100 
Penta it might be a bit harder to hit
them<00:02:26.180> because<00:02:26.390> you're<00:02:26.480> only<00:02:26.569> show<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:26.840> once

you're new to the whole walk same thing
the<00:02:33.860> oxygen<00:02:34.430> brought<00:02:34.580> some<00:02:34.730> boxing<00:02:35.090> drones

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
the oxygen brought some boxing drones

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
said thrust or frost prime is because it

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.860 
said thrust or frost prime is because it
acts<00:04:09.469> as<00:04:09.680> a<00:04:09.709> both<00:04:10.239> slowdown<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.540> enemy<00:04:11.750> and

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
acts as a both slowdown of the enemy and

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.069 
acts as a both slowdown of the enemy and
it<00:04:11.989> comes<00:04:12.139> to<00:04:12.230> protect<00:04:12.590> that<00:04:12.829> because<00:04:14.079> it's

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
it comes to protect that because it's

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.479 
it comes to protect that because it's
just<00:04:15.200> horrible<00:04:15.560> doing<00:04:15.980> all<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.160> work<00:04:16.280> and
