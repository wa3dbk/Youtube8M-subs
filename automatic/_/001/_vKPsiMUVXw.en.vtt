00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.870
 I had a little bit of a childhood 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.870
 we were three children one of each sex 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:23.160
 which has always struck us a lot 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.160
 at my father's place it was his hands 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.370
 like all the children of the world have played 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.370
 cache 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.230
 except that for me the problem is not 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.000
 that we did not find myself is that we do not 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.190
 do not look for me I spent days 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.800
 whole in cupboards to say that and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:01:01.380
 I him because I counted up to x 13 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.630
 May after I had a schooling 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.710
 chaotic but it was not my fault 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.540
 it was simply because 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.160
 I was too emotional too emotional 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.360
 I was too attached to each class I 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.530
 could not get rid of me and also 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.210
 not to lie because you also 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.800
 because at school I find myself with a 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.210
 little perspective if there are young people really 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.710
 do not take example on me I speak 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.759
 for me but frankly I think that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 sometimes we are not interested 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.280
 teaches us things that are not 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.470
 very interesting I'm that's what 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.700
 if there are sublime things by 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.540
 example if I tell you tonight here 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.560
 square root of 25 tells you 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.560
 5 ok and then 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.690
 it's already got you out of this thing 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.190
 everything is already said when coming out of a 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.619
 fortunately we knew her 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.619
 this root we were in the sea 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.940
 you have already left an apartment that you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.980
 visited by telling the real estate agent 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:03.660
 listen we like it but we find it 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:05.160
 a little isosceles is waiting since 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.280
 that you're out of school ok you got 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.280
 already reused in your life a compass 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:25.150
 the compass come out all your fights me 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.560
 I never told my wife to her darling 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.560
 on the fight we have guests 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.370
 and in addition the exercises look with 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.870
 you start you life when you're kid 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.050
 of opinion it starts with exercises 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.730
 which is called problems but the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.930
 problem that's how you learn 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.930
 basic education 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.840
 profit go into the mouth go 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.210
 take out the notebooks we will start the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.580
 problems 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.390
 the word is going home at home 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.150
 his father tells him what did you do 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.080
 today at school didier well and you 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.460
 dad at work problems and in 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.800
 my son was what the problem 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:12.350
 then it's great as a bath 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:17.170
 filling up to 4 liters of water all 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:21.820
 the 47 seconds every 47 seconds 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.250
 if I start filling my bathtub to 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.270
 7:12 p.m. 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.780
 knowing that there is a hole in my 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.110
 bathtub will let out 7 liters 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.850
 of water every 9 seconds 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.770
 an interruption of filling of my 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.820
 bath at 20:16 that I resume at 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.830
 8:19 p.m. 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.540
 knowing that during the four 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.610
 last minutes of filling I 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.760
 tried to plug the hole with half 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.990
 by my finger what time 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.200
 would I have 29 10 liters of water in the 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.570
 bath 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.100

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.100
