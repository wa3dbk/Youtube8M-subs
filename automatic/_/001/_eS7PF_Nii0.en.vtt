00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
against the Chicago Bulls I was really

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.740 
against the Chicago Bulls I was really
hoping<00:01:46.099> that<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.340> Charlotte<00:01:46.789> Hornets<00:01:47.149> made

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
hoping that the Charlotte Hornets made

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.290 
hoping that the Charlotte Hornets made
it<00:01:47.929> to<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.140> NBA<00:01:48.319> Finals<00:01:48.610> because<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:49.700> told<00:01:50.030> you

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
it to the NBA Finals because I told you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.210 
it to the NBA Finals because I told you
in<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.690> season<00:01:51.110> they<00:01:51.229> were<00:01:51.289> number<00:01:51.649> one<00:01:52.039> in

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
in the season they were number one in

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.639 
in the season they were number one in
the<00:01:52.310> East<00:01:52.550> but<00:01:53.239> I<00:01:53.330> guess<00:01:53.569> Chicago<00:01:54.140> took<00:01:54.410> care

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
the East but I guess Chicago took care

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.800 
the East but I guess Chicago took care
of<00:01:54.679> them<00:01:54.950> sooner<00:01:55.399> or<00:01:55.429> later<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:55.970> now<00:01:56.539> we're

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
of them sooner or later and now we're

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.380 
of them sooner or later and now we're
going<00:01:57.050> up<00:01:57.259> against<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.770> Bulls<00:01:58.039> in<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.970> NBA

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
going up against the Bulls in the NBA
