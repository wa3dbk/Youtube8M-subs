with<00:00:18.510> just<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:18.960> hand

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
with just one hand

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.009 
with just one hand
but<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> end<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:22.369> his<00:00:23.369> review<00:00:24.330> he<00:00:24.570> showed<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.810 
but at the end of his review he showed a
knife<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.830> catalog<00:00:27.050> that<00:00:28.050> was<00:00:28.820> you

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
knife in the catalog that was you

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.060 
knife in the catalog that was you
thought<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.330> bit<00:00:30.689> better<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.019> EDC<00:00:31.410> caring<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
thought a bit better for EDC caring and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.360 
thought a bit better for EDC caring and
I<00:00:32.130> happen<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> agree<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.920> was<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
I happen to agree and that was the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.819 
I happen to agree and that was the
American<00:00:36.149> mini<00:00:36.899> lawman<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.410> think<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.710> just

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
American mini lawman I think it's just

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
can't just flip it open super easily at

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289 
can't just flip it open super easily at
first<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.680> can't<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.610> takes<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.909> little<00:01:51.030> bit<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
first you can't it takes a little bit a

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.940 
first you can't it takes a little bit a
little<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.229> wrist<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> little<00:01:52.799> bit<00:01:52.890> of

little bit of wrist and a little bit of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.530 
little bit of wrist and a little bit of
practice<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> where<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.390> it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
practice to get to where you can do it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.999 
practice to get to where you can do it
every<00:01:55.320> single<00:01:55.500> time<00:01:56.270> but<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.420> least<00:01:57.829> for<00:01:58.829> me

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
every single time but at least for me

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.749 
every single time but at least for me
that's<00:01:59.369> not<00:01:59.579> really<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.570> deal<00:02:01.049> breaker<00:02:01.759> lean

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that's not really a deal breaker lean

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.429 
that's not really a deal breaker lean
against<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> fact<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.689> use<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.020> knife<00:02:04.259> a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
against the fact is I use this knife a

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.690 
against the fact is I use this knife a
lot<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.040> work
