00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.770
 uah 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.729
 hello there, the team lost 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:15.169
 last time I had the opportunity 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.069
 tell you well in my favorite with children 

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:20.489
 childhood which is really great 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.869
 stood the test of time and today 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.309
 we have hands made by cartoon 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:27.710
 one of my favorite guys 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.019
 jeep worm 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.009
 all this love the original dilogy 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.010
 on the net everyone's awesome graphics 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.710
 offer something new 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.440
 absurd humor and totally 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.479
 crazy locations 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:42.049
 funny and strange original 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:45.760
 frightening many people for the first time vendetta game 

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.389
 in childhood I exclaimed, we play 

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:51.249
 cartoon so create real 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.419
 the cartoon was quite logical 

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.559
 reaction but i will take on such courage 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.920
 notice that there is a big difference between 

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:01.809
 two clear and superhero triple not 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.699
 possessing Kokoity history and full 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.130
 cartoon series 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.520
 used by such glaring 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.510
 original things like 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.590
 weakly 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.540
 and something else called plot 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.500
 and now please catch and mine 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.289
 word 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.279
 in order to feel more on my body 

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.499
 emotions about this cartoons 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.240
 do you understand 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.119
 i have no idea 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.180
 that both total volume is happening absolutely 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.530
 but I watched Monty Python 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.420
 urban primates even show 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.150
 Viktor Serafimovich I analyzed the plot 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.420
 half liter mouse and did not notice anything 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.580
 unusual in perfect hairstyle 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.020
 forever him rolls so i so as 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.920
 said saw some shit but 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.130
 after that it will be for pc let's just 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.480
 take a look at the very beginning of the first series 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.260
 and early 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.210
 494 I see nothing decent 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.790
 in fact 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.790
 now not only from the press 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.380
 according to the script it confirms as it should 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.649
 lead fm 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.569
 attic jirim on the planet is extraordinary 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.339
 high tick professor some flaws 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.489
 heads which coexist by the way with 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.249
 monkey dialogue professors who 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.849
 try to convince our heroes by rubbing 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.169
 robe pool feet 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.449
 ha for generating static 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:33.219
 electricity more i exist i think i 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.809
 who am i why are we here driver 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.139
 stop them please it 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.159
 endless death death pits 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.049
 I'll probably go quietly 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.419
 let's try to figure it out 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.789
 any work has some 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.229
 structures even more so if we say a in 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:51.529
 TV shows they should have a clear system 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.849
 of all the episodes every series of hima she was 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.029
 group stupid advice every episode 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.419
 hunters began strings and only 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.559
 then a layer of inter what that series 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.649
 has a through history in which 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.099
 one series equals one story and so 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.610
 Further 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.120
 no attic gin 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.799
 to logic 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.290
 it can not be explained in one 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.689
 moment we have a story suddenly on 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.729
 interrupted incomprehensibly from where would 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.309
 only a joke that turns into Kerch 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:20.949
 and all of this in a fundamental way 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.659
 changes the whole story and none of this 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.540
 makes no sense 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.170
 another series here is endless meetings in 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.620
 the third hero begins to threaten 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.980
 narrator and impose his own 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.720
 the story 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.630
 about this cartoon can happen 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.940
 absolutely anything and in the majority 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.250
 cases they are not expected that you are 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.410
 don't even try to assume that 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.140
 will be further because it's just 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.880
 useless and we still give out poverty 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.840
 unimaginable 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.780
 for a long time nearest jim worm that i 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.670
 I can imagine it probably 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.190
 anya mashki only on many optimization 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.420
 have meetings she become euro often break 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.310
 solid wall though slightly annoying 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.030
 childish image wound 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.980
 sound effects the story is basically 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.870
 simple seems to have owns also fights 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.510
 with them 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.569
 however the ways in which the stories go 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.860
 be extremely unexpected medicine 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.030
 villains have the whole set that we saw in 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.579
 games 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.039
 evil code nonsense psycho boran professor 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.870
 monkey heads fish pop queen whistle 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.780
 ass this dude who 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.639
 got us on the first level the second 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.300
 parts of the game but others 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.879
 if up to this point you still haven't 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.050
 understand the essence of this cartoon 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.740
 and no wonder i didn't understand myself though 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.680
 looked it all this is definitely one 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.479
 of the craziest and unexplainable broadcasts 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:42.660
 media culture 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.860
 probably it is good and the cartoon itself 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.380
 quite fun however do some 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.650
 specific conclusions followed 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.370
 impossible in principle 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.500
 next time we take a look at something 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.180
 more modern 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.320
 something very popular with younger ones 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.210
 generations something 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.350
 but what I have not the slightest 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.350
 representation 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.469
