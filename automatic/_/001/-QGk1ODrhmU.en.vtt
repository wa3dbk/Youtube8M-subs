like<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:04.940> guess<00:03:05.630> it's<00:03:05.810> like<00:03:05.870> dust<00:03:06.170> on<00:03:06.320> the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
like I guess it's like dust on the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.500 
like I guess it's like dust on the
inside<00:03:06.800> because<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.100> really<00:03:07.220> hard<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.640> wipe

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
inside because it's really hard to wipe

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.300 
inside because it's really hard to wipe
it<00:03:08.720> off<00:03:08.780> but<00:03:08.960> as<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.140> can<00:03:09.260> see<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.470> says<00:03:09.590> Batman

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
it off but as you can see it says Batman

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.940 
it off but as you can see it says Batman
the<00:03:10.430> Animated<00:03:10.460> Series<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.480> as<00:03:12.470> always<00:03:12.680> we've

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
the Animated Series and as always we've

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.440 
the Animated Series and as always we've
got<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.070> lenticular<00:03:13.430> background<00:03:14.090> right<00:03:14.270> there

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
got a lenticular background right there

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.570 
got a lenticular background right there
and<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:15.080> looks<00:03:15.290> very<00:03:15.560> much<00:03:15.710> like<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.370> from

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
and it looks very much like it is from

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.860 
and it looks very much like it is from
the<00:03:16.670> animated<00:03:17.060> series<00:03:17.210> which<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.630> fantastic

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
the animated series which is fantastic

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.110 
the animated series which is fantastic
the<00:03:18.350> actual<00:03:18.650> art<00:03:18.860> style<00:03:19.190> back<00:03:19.370> there<00:03:19.610> so<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.060> do

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
the actual art style back there so I do

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.850 
the actual art style back there so I do
like<00:03:20.360> that<00:03:20.390> quite<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.930> bit<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.230> then<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.680> love

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
they've even created the light that's

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.650 
they've even created the light that's
coming<00:03:24.950> off<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.640> lamppost<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.210> that<00:03:26.360> is<00:03:26.450> very

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
coming off the lamppost so that is very

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.450 
coming off the lamppost so that is very
cool<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.170> look<00:03:27.590> look<00:03:27.770> at<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:27.980> details<00:03:28.340> for

example back there you can see the same
type<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.040> effect<00:03:31.250> done<00:03:31.760> here<00:03:32.060> right<00:03:32.090> but<00:03:32.870> when

type of effect done here right but when
you<00:03:33.140> look<00:03:33.290> in<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.500> lenticular<00:03:33.770> design

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
you look in the lenticular design

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.620 
you look in the lenticular design
there's<00:03:34.460> a<00:03:34.520> lamppost<00:03:34.970> there<00:03:35.240> so<00:03:35.420> that<00:03:35.540> was

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
so as you can see from the top-down view

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.690 
so as you can see from the top-down view
very<00:03:42.290> cool<00:03:42.560> looking<00:03:42.890> as<00:03:42.980> well<00:03:43.100> well<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.550> could

gonna<00:03:46.250> try<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.490> wipe<00:03:46.760> this<00:03:46.970> off<00:03:47.180> as<00:03:47.330> much<00:03:47.480> as<00:03:47.540> I

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
gonna try to wipe this off as much as I

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.210 
gonna try to wipe this off as much as I
possibly<00:03:48.110> can<00:03:48.320> I've<00:03:48.530> wiped<00:03:48.740> it<00:03:48.950> off<00:03:49.040> like

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
possibly can I've wiped it off like

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.970 
possibly can I've wiped it off like
three<00:03:49.430> times<00:03:49.700> before<00:03:49.970> we<00:03:50.210> even<00:03:50.330> began<00:03:50.890> but<00:03:51.890> as

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
three times before we even began but as

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.710 
three times before we even began but as
you<00:03:52.100> can<00:03:52.220> see<00:03:52.280> it's<00:03:52.550> it's<00:03:52.880> just<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.360> bit<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.630> a

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
you can see it's it's just a bit of a

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.630 
you can see it's it's just a bit of a
dust<00:03:54.050> attractor<00:03:54.560> which<00:03:54.680> is<00:03:54.830> why<00:03:54.950> I'm<00:03:55.400> trying

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
dust attractor which is why I'm trying

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.090 
dust attractor which is why I'm trying
to<00:03:55.820> keep<00:03:55.910> these<00:03:56.150> in<00:03:56.360> box<00:03:57.020> so<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.470> they<00:03:57.860> stay

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
to keep these in box so that they stay

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.920 
to keep these in box so that they stay
nice<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.610> pristine<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.270> look<00:03:59.450> really<00:03:59.780> cool

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
nice and pristine and look really cool

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.210 
nice and pristine and look really cool
especially<00:04:00.590> because<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.800> know<00:04:00.860> I'm<00:04:01.010> not<00:04:01.040> gonna

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
especially because I know I'm not gonna

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.920 
especially because I know I'm not gonna
be<00:04:01.340> like<00:04:01.490> driving<00:04:02.030> them<00:04:02.330> around<00:04:02.540> or<00:04:02.750> anything

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
be like driving them around or anything

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.180 
be like driving them around or anything
I'm<00:04:03.110> not<00:04:03.260> one<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:03.470> those<00:04:03.590> collectors<00:04:04.070> that

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
I'm not one of those collectors that

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.370 
I'm not one of those collectors that
keeps<00:04:04.430> everything<00:04:04.730> in<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:04.970> box<00:04:05.150> in<00:04:05.330> fact<00:04:05.540> 99%

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
keeps everything in the box in fact 99%

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.960 
keeps everything in the box in fact 99%
of<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.500> time<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.740> open<00:04:07.040> stuff<00:04:07.280> it's<00:04:07.640> just<00:04:07.730> that

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
of the time I open stuff it's just that

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.460 
of the time I open stuff it's just that
in<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:08.210> scenario<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:08.840> think<00:04:08.960> it's<00:04:09.290> much

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
in this scenario I think it's much

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.290 
in this scenario I think it's much
better<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.890> just<00:04:09.920> keep<00:04:10.100> it<00:04:10.370> in<00:04:10.550> package<00:04:10.970> but

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
better to just keep it in package but

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.780 
better to just keep it in package but
you<00:04:11.450> can<00:04:12.080> see<00:04:12.170> a<00:04:12.200> very<00:04:12.410> very<00:04:12.640> appropriate<00:04:13.640> look

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
you can see a very very appropriate look

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.370 
you can see a very very appropriate look
we<00:04:14.030> got<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.240> little<00:04:14.390> turbine<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.110> back

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
we got the little turbine in the back

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.170 
we got the little turbine in the back
there<00:04:15.620> which<00:04:15.800> is<00:04:15.920> lovely<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.489> then<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:16.910> front

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
there which is lovely and then the front

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.940 
there which is lovely and then the front
grille<00:04:17.450> here<00:04:17.720> actually<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.530> front<00:04:18.680> grille

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
grille here actually the front grille

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.289 
grille here actually the front grille
could<00:04:19.220> have<00:04:19.310> been<00:04:19.430> done<00:04:19.609> maybe<00:04:19.850> a<00:04:19.940> little<00:04:20.120> bit

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
could have been done maybe a little bit

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.600 
could have been done maybe a little bit
of<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.959> different<00:04:21.290> paint<00:04:21.500> as<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:22.310> can<00:04:22.460> see

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
of a different paint as you can see

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.890 
of a different paint as you can see
right<00:04:22.760> here<00:04:22.820> for<00:04:23.120> example<00:04:23.450> on<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.600> actual

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
right here for example on the actual

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.630 
right here for example on the actual
painting<00:04:24.320> they<00:04:24.650> have<00:04:24.770> some<00:04:24.950> different

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
painting they have some different

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.750 
painting they have some different
designs<00:04:25.760> for<00:04:26.090> this

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
designs for this

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.310 
designs for this
and<00:04:26.910> then<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.210> grill<00:04:27.450> itself<00:04:27.750> is<00:04:27.930> also<00:04:28.290> a

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
and then the grill itself is also a

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.660 
and then the grill itself is also a
little<00:04:28.470> bit<00:04:28.560> different<00:04:28.980> but<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.400> guess<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.640> just

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
little bit different but I guess I just

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.280 
little bit different but I guess I just
wanted<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.150> kind<00:04:30.300> of<00:04:30.390> bring<00:04:30.570> out<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.930> details

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
wanted to kind of bring out the details

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.720 
wanted to kind of bring out the details
in<00:04:31.440> some<00:04:31.680> way<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:32.280> would<00:04:32.400> have<00:04:32.430> been<00:04:32.580> nice

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
in some way it would have been nice

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.070 
in some way it would have been nice
though<00:04:32.940> if<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.180> little<00:04:33.300> turbines<00:04:33.810> on<00:04:33.990> the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
though if the little turbines on the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.230 
though if the little turbines on the
side<00:04:34.260> here<00:04:34.440> maybe<00:04:34.650> had<00:04:34.860> some<00:04:35.070> little<00:04:35.610> bit<00:04:35.820> more

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
side here maybe had some little bit more

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.580 
side here maybe had some little bit more
color<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.660> them<00:04:36.990> I<00:04:37.020> think<00:04:37.200> that<00:04:37.380> would<00:04:37.500> have

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
color to them I think that would have

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.710 
color to them I think that would have
brought<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:38.250> design<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.880> life<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.270> little<00:04:39.570> bit

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
brought the design to life a little bit

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.630 
brought the design to life a little bit
better<00:04:39.930> but<00:04:40.290> nonetheless<00:04:40.490> there<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.550> guys

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
better but nonetheless there you guys

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
they're doing a tumbler I think I've

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.930 
they're doing a tumbler I think I've
seen<00:05:09.780> I<00:05:09.960> saw<00:05:10.230> that<00:05:10.380> one<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.830> online<00:05:11.130> not<00:05:11.640> since

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
seen I saw that one and online not since

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.300 
seen I saw that one and online not since
in<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.630> actual<00:05:12.930> store<00:05:13.200> which<00:05:13.410> is<00:05:13.590> why<00:05:14.160> I'm

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
in the actual store which is why I'm

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.890 
in the actual store which is why I'm
probably<00:05:14.490> not<00:05:14.730> gonna<00:05:14.940> pick<00:05:15.180> up<00:05:15.270> that<00:05:15.330> one<00:05:15.660> but

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
if I saw it in stores I probably would

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.030 
if I saw it in stores I probably would
pick<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:18.210> up<00:05:18.330> and<00:05:18.480> then<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.320> next<00:05:19.350> Batmobile
