through talking to African Christians

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:24.649 
through talking to African Christians
for<00:05:17.909> example<00:05:19.560> there's<00:05:20.560> a<00:05:20.650> line<00:05:20.949> in<00:05:21.460> some<00:05:23.610> 126

those who go out weeping carrying the
seed<00:05:28.599> for<00:05:29.110> sowing<00:05:29.879> will<00:05:30.879> return<00:05:31.360> with<00:05:31.749> shouts

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
of joy shouldering their sheaves I

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.769 
of joy shouldering their sheaves I
didn't<00:05:36.819> really<00:05:37.419> understand<00:05:39.150> for<00:05:40.150> many<00:05:40.330> years

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
didn't really understand for many years

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:46.019 
didn't really understand for many years
why<00:05:41.770> someone<00:05:42.610> would<00:05:42.969> go<00:05:43.180> out<00:05:44.039> weeping<00:05:45.039> to<00:05:45.819> sow

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
why someone would go out weeping to sow

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.469 
why someone would go out weeping to sow
the<00:05:46.240> seed<00:05:46.449> in<00:05:46.629> the<00:05:46.659> field<00:05:47.819> until<00:05:48.819> I<00:05:49.120> began

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
the seed in the field until I began

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.100 
the seed in the field until I began
working<00:05:50.110> with<00:05:50.469> African<00:05:50.680> Christians<00:05:51.839> who<00:05:52.839> have

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
working with African Christians who have

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.629 
working with African Christians who have
to<00:05:53.319> make<00:05:53.469> a<00:05:53.499> choice<00:05:53.830> between<00:05:55.560> eating<00:05:56.639> the

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
to make a choice between eating the

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.899 
to make a choice between eating the
grain<00:05:58.389> now<00:05:59.199> giving<00:06:00.129> it<00:06:00.249> to<00:06:00.400> their<00:06:00.580> hungry

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:00.909 
grain now giving it to their hungry

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:05.219 
grain now giving it to their hungry
children<00:06:01.479> or<00:06:02.969> planting<00:06:03.969> it<00:06:04.089> in<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.360> field<00:06:04.599> so

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
children or planting it in the field so

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.110 
children or planting it in the field so
there'll<00:06:05.409> be<00:06:05.469> something<00:06:05.770> to<00:06:06.069> eat<00:06:06.249> next<00:06:06.759> year

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
there'll be something to eat next year

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.510 
there'll be something to eat next year
and<00:06:07.330> so<00:06:07.689> those<00:06:07.870> kinds<00:06:08.529> of<00:06:08.650> elemental

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
and so those kinds of elemental

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.040 
and so those kinds of elemental
questions<00:06:10.479> need<00:06:11.469> to<00:06:11.860> be<00:06:12.240> part<00:06:13.240> of<00:06:13.449> what<00:06:13.839> we

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
questions need to be part of what we

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.580 
questions need to be part of what we
bring<00:06:14.469> to<00:06:14.710> Scripture

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.920 

perhaps<00:06:19.370> what<00:06:19.730> the<00:06:19.940> Bible<00:06:20.360> does<00:06:21.970> best<00:06:22.970> is

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
perhaps what the Bible does best is

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.450 
perhaps what the Bible does best is
surprise<00:06:24.530> us<00:06:24.940> and<00:06:26.260> sort<00:06:27.260> of<00:06:27.290> blow<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:27.919> ceiling

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
surprise us and sort of blow the ceiling

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.170 
surprise us and sort of blow the ceiling
off<00:06:29.050> reality<00:06:30.050> as<00:06:30.380> we<00:06:30.830> have<00:06:31.040> come<00:06:31.310> to<00:06:31.820> think<00:06:32.030> of

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
off reality as we have come to think of

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.710 
off reality as we have come to think of
it<00:06:32.470> the<00:06:33.470> Bible<00:06:33.860> is<00:06:33.980> always<00:06:34.190> pushing<00:06:34.970> against

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
it the Bible is always pushing against

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.129 
it the Bible is always pushing against
and<00:06:35.930> sometimes<00:06:36.460> exploding<00:06:37.460> what<00:06:38.300> we<00:06:38.630> think<00:06:38.960> of

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
and sometimes exploding what we think of

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.409 
and sometimes exploding what we think of
as<00:06:39.380> the<00:06:40.370> limits<00:06:40.820> of<00:06:41.120> our<00:06:41.630> experience<00:06:42.620> and

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
as the limits of our experience and

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.680 
as the limits of our experience and
telling<00:06:44.419> us<00:06:44.600> that<00:06:45.320> there<00:06:45.620> is<00:06:46.010> much<00:06:46.880> more<00:06:47.300> that

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
telling us that there is much more that

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.770 
telling us that there is much more that
is<00:06:47.930> possible<00:06:48.560> if<00:06:49.220> we'll<00:06:49.669> only<00:06:49.970> open<00:06:50.480> our<00:06:50.630> eyes

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
is possible if we'll only open our eyes

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.610 
is possible if we'll only open our eyes
and<00:06:50.870> our<00:06:51.290> hearts<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:53.330> meet<00:06:53.690> that<00:06:53.930> possibility

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.790 

the<00:06:57.130> word<00:06:57.310> of<00:06:57.490> the<00:06:57.580> Lord
