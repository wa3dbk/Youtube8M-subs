00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.459 
another video and today I printed a Xbox
one<00:00:08.360> faceplate<00:00:09.360> for<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.719> controller<00:00:10.139> and

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
one faceplate for the controller and

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.860 
one faceplate for the controller and
this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.280> actually<00:00:11.610> an<00:00:11.730> glow<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.630> dark

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
this is actually an glow in the dark

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.710 
this is actually an glow in the dark
green<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:14.450> I'm<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:15.660> curious<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.410> see<00:00:16.710> how<00:00:17.160> it

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
green so I'm just curious to see how it

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.439 
green so I'm just curious to see how it
how<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.750> fits<00:00:19.109> how<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.470> looks<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.670> first<00:00:21.210> step

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
how it fits how it looks so first step

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.120 
how it fits how it looks so first step
is<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.990> get<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.289> off<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.710> build<00:00:22.890> plate

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
is to get it off the build plate

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.870 
is to get it off the build plate
obviously<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.890> let<00:00:26.010> me<00:00:26.070> go<00:00:26.189> grab<00:00:26.369> my<00:00:26.430> scraper

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
obviously so let me go grab my scraper

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.830 
obviously so let me go grab my scraper
quick<00:00:28.880> it's<00:00:29.880> funny<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.150> bring<00:00:30.330> over<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.720> these

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
quick it's funny I bring over all these

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:42.889 
quick it's funny I bring over all these
tools<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.800> forget<00:00:32.730> my<00:00:32.820> scraper<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:42.600> set<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
tools and I forget my scraper it set the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.959 
tools and I forget my scraper it set the
plate<00:00:43.140> aside<00:00:43.440> set<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.980> aside<00:00:44.129> now<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.789> just

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
plate aside set that aside now it's just

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.110 
plate aside set that aside now it's just
a<00:00:45.420> matter<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:46.430> cleaning<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.670> up<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
a matter of cleaning this up and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.150 
a matter of cleaning this up and
actually<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.170> printed<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.190> point<00:00:50.579> two

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
actually I printed this on point two

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.510 
actually I printed this on point two
millimeters<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> 200<00:00:55.050> microns<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.920> it's

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
millimeters so 200 microns and it's

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
millimeters so 200 microns and it's
actually<00:00:56.940> still<00:00:57.000> pretty<00:00:57.329> smooth<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.350> I

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
actually still pretty smooth like if I

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.790 
actually still pretty smooth like if I
printed<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.920> at<00:00:59.100> 100<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.820> would<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.649> twice<00:01:01.649> as

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
printed this at 100 it would be twice as

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.500 
printed this at 100 it would be twice as
smooth<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.270> let's<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.719> peel<00:01:04.500> this

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
smooth I think so let's just peel this

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.200 
smooth I think so let's just peel this
pill<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.810> off<00:01:07.049> hopefully<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.560> comes<00:01:07.650> off

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
pill all this off hopefully it comes off

00:01:08.210 --> 00:02:12.089 
pill all this off hopefully it comes off
relatively<00:01:09.210> easy<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.290> quick

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.670 

let<00:02:13.099> me<00:02:13.159> go<00:02:13.280> get<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.640> controller<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.680> we'll

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
let me go get the controller and we'll

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.539 
let me go get the controller and we'll
see<00:02:15.980> if<00:02:16.129> it<00:02:16.250> fits

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.569 

okay<00:02:19.549> so<00:02:20.230> laying<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.409> right<00:02:21.439> over<00:02:21.980> everything

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
okay so laying it right over everything

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.890 
okay so laying it right over everything
seems<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.120> line<00:02:23.390> up<00:02:25.299> obviously<00:02:26.299> because<00:02:26.629> it's

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
seems to line up obviously because it's

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.619 
seems to line up obviously because it's
the<00:02:27.530> same<00:02:27.739> size<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:28.370> not<00:02:28.519> going<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.730> be<00:02:29.299> flush

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
the same size it's not going to be flush

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.210 
the same size it's not going to be flush
with<00:02:29.659> it

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
with it

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.589 
with it
so<00:02:32.590> what<00:02:33.590> I'm<00:02:33.680> gonna<00:02:33.799> do<00:02:34.069> is<00:02:34.329> I'm<00:02:35.329> just<00:02:35.510> gonna

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
run the screws through here so it's not

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.929 
run the screws through here so it's not
gonna<00:02:37.819> be<00:02:38.000> as<00:02:38.120> tight<00:02:38.450> when<00:02:38.720> it's<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.140> there<00:02:39.939> wow

that that's a really nice job so I'm
gonna<00:02:45.859> run<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.129> screws<00:02:46.340> through<00:02:46.549> here<00:02:46.760> make

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
gonna run the screws through here make

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.300 
gonna run the screws through here make
sure<00:02:47.290> threads<00:02:48.290> okay<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:48.920> then<00:02:49.010> I'm<00:02:49.129> gonna

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
sure threads okay and then I'm gonna

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.629 
sure threads okay and then I'm gonna
stick<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.609> on<00:02:50.739> all<00:02:51.739> right<00:02:51.859> so<00:02:52.129> now<00:02:52.370> it's<00:02:52.549> the

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
stick it on all right so now it's the

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.640 
stick it on all right so now it's the
moment<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:52.970> truth<00:02:53.239> where<00:02:53.629> we're<00:02:53.810> gonna<00:02:53.959> put

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
moment of truth where we're gonna put

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.220 
moment of truth where we're gonna put
this<00:02:54.799> on<00:02:55.069> to<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.639> controller<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.389> hopefully

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
this on to the controller and hopefully

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:10.140 
this on to the controller and hopefully
it<00:02:57.409> fits

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.400 

so<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.270> looks<00:03:11.450> like<00:03:11.540> we're<00:03:11.810> just<00:03:11.840> gonna<00:03:12.110> have

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
so it looks like we're just gonna have

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.110 
so it looks like we're just gonna have
to<00:03:15.100> make<00:03:16.100> these<00:03:16.250> holes<00:03:16.490> just<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.790> little<00:03:17.030> bit

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
to make these holes just a little bit

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.860 
to make these holes just a little bit
bigger

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.509 

alright<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.769> coolest<00:03:23.040> feature<00:03:23.250> about

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
alright so the coolest feature about

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.729 
alright so the coolest feature about
this<00:03:23.790> controller<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.870> does<00:03:25.140> glow<00:03:25.620> in

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
this controller is that it does glow in

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.699 
this controller is that it does glow in
the<00:03:25.830> dark<00:03:26.069> so<00:03:26.970> just<00:03:27.750> gonna<00:03:27.930> let<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.379> sit<00:03:28.500> here
