 hello everyone is steven is 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.040
 today a great news 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.330
 since I am very happy about you 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.389
 announce that the untethered jailbreak 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.920
 ios 7 is finally available 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.750
 so we've been waiting for him all since 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.910
 several months he is finally here 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.189
 compatible with all devices and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.050
 all versions of ios is a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.130
 jailbreak of untethered type it means 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.619
 it's just a jailbreak 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 complete you will have cydia installed on 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.250
 your iphone ipod touch and ipad and you 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 will not need any software or 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.690
 any tools to restart it 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.850
 will work perfectly and for a bone 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.969
 7.0 7.0.1 7.0 points 2 7 points 0 points 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.320
 3 and 7 points 0.4 for the moment so 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.180
 as usual I propose a 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.719
 very simple method to achieve this 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.039
 jailbreak 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.510
 all you have to do is 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.890
 click on the link found in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.690
 the description of the video to be 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.430
 redirected to my website and to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.989
 the full tutorial where you can 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.300
 especially download the software of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.160
 escape jailbreak once you 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.809
 have downloaded it for windows or for 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.339
 mac you plug your iphone your 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.220
 ipod touch or your ipad to your 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.689
 computer with usb dock cable 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.619
 escape recognizes it if you have a 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.119
 security code 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.280
 wanting to lift then you can click 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.509
 on jailbreak so we only have one button to 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.590
 click that's why I told you 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.960
 in the beginning of the video it's really 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.950
 extremely simple then you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.869
 wait while the jailbreak 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.460
 start I remind you that it 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.470
 works for any iphone 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.960
 any ipod touch and any 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.630
 what ipod seals is so for ipod 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.680
 fifth generation touch for iphone 4 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.810
 4s 5 5 c is the fifth last and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.500
 also for all ipad so ipad's 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.570
 second generation ipad 3 4 and ipad r 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.710
 a site for the ipad mini first and 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.110
 second generation 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.520
 so to get back to the jailbreak at 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.869
 after a while escape will you 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.210
 say that you can unlock your 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.409
 device and on the second page you 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.350
 see a new icon 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.700
 this one justice '' escape 7 so everything 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.710
 what you have to do is supported 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.810
 just a little bit above for 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.070
 able to pursue the escape jailbreak 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.170
 realizes that you have made the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 Handling and restarting your device 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.680
 it was the only manipulation you had 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.080
 to do now you just need 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.860
 just wait your iphone is going 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.210
 restart several times and after 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.560
 a little while you will see this 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.410
 screen that appears with the logo 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.820
 of escape and the software that loads the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.620
 jailbreak on your device 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.180
 so you do not disconnect and especially not 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.580
 your iphone or ipod touch or 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.020
 your ipad escape him you can 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.920
 leave when he displays you as in 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.200
 this moment gives 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.240
 you can close the little software and 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.800
 then the jailbreak is over you 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.170
 can unlock your iphone your 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.400
 ipod touch or your ipad and now 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.530
 you see we now have cydia 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.209
 just here so that's all good it's 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.370
 finished the jailbreak went very well 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.200
 past cydia works you can 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.060
 unplug your iphone your ipod touch 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.410
 or your ipad from your computer and 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.000
 wait while the packages get 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.100
 charge then that if there is restarts 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.989
 then once it's done you 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.880
 unlock your device you can 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.810
 return to cydia is the first 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.880
 thing you're going to have to do 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.430
 select your user type 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.320
 so I'm going to pick this one you 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.150
 make the docks and then cydia charge 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.830
 for a few seconds and you 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.900
 land on the home page it's 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.520
 all good your jailbreak is over 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.709
 cydia is very well installed and 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.540
 perfectly functional so there is 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.220
 maybe one or two little bugs and the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.530
 ios's first jailbreak is it will 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.150
 corrected later and especially thought about 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.560
 watch the description of the video I 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.850
 have you put the link to the video that 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.980
 gives you all the cydia tweaks that 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.660
 are compatible with this jailbreak so 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.890
 enjoy all this tell me what 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.780
