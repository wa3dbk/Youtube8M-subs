00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.410
 and 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.490
 The first thing we have to do to 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.310
 start a manual single-phase compressor 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.410
 is to locate the terminals here we have 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.490
 this plate that I can disassemble and as 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.150
 You see indicates to us that it is the common lr run or 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.949
 work and that start or start these are 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.760
 the terminals that indicate the compressor as 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.760
 Are you connected 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.480
 we can also measure it with him or subway 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.140
 in the terminals we go to the common and the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.120
 work and you will see in it or meter that we 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.970
 measured 1817 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.680
 this is the work winding 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.550
 and the boot between common 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.520
 and start 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:18.000
 you can see that it measures us 2.6 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.550
 / start 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.100
 start and work as is the union of 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.160
 the two coils will not be exactly the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.930
 double but approximately as you can 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.900
 watch 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.110
 4 or so the work winding is a 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.360
 little measured less measured less but the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.190
 winding is bigger it measures less because 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.930
 Thread is fatter holds the amperage 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.450
 for once the 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.299
 compressor hold the line the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.280
 boot is finer and although it measures more 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:53.320
 I could not stand the tension and it would burn 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.390
 well now let's give you direct line 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.940
 to the engine with a plug that I have 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.140
 protected 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.860
 and we will give direct tension 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.860
 to the common 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.800
 and direct attention 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.950
 to work 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.930
 here I have drawn a bridge so that 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.830
 then between common and this line you 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.560
 we will give the starting blow to the start 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.560
 the boot will be just a touch 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.650
 it will be this pop 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.110
 that this is what the relay of 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.720
 boot you'll see now I'll put the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.300
 ammeter at the moment of giving 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.840
 current without starting the ammeter 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.550
 will shoot 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.890
 that's what makes the coil 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.379
 magnetic contact us and in the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.100
 when it starts, it will stop consuming 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.310
 in an elevated way this will be 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.410
 3 is now already I pluck nothing going 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.370
 to see the ammeter the blow of 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.370
 current that generates 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.160
 here 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.330
 or you can see this boot system 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.090
 so manual is a bit dangerous is better 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.570
 that you use the gadgets that in the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.340
 forum they are riding and it is safer 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.100
 I have the protected line but as 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.250
 You see these sparks because they increase a lot 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.780
 the consumption realize that we have 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.760
 I was lucky to have a compressor 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.700
 single-phase three horses is pretty 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.140
 big and it's a scroll we've ripped off 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.140
 also directly 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.150
