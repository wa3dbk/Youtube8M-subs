00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 I am good esteban lÃ³pez and today I am going to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.350
 prepare some chin ribs 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.780
 then the ingredients that are going to 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.960
 inter for the little ribs are the sugar 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.480
 brown the chicken broth and the cage for 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.390
 to be able to make the sauce and the little ribs 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.949
 I 'm going to marinate them right now 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.350
 I think I'm going to make it a mashed potatoes 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.410
 with potatoes and butter 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.849
 unpublished'm going to appeal to some tomatoes 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.130
 the Neapolitan I'm going to do in the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.960
 oven 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.759
 now what we are going to do is the sauce 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.759
 then let's take the 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.890
 and let's put the flame 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.719
 and now now I 'm going to take the sugar 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.360
 one thirty because what characterizes 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.129
 the barbie you are that it is in sweet but not 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.930
 it's so suffocating so that's why I do not 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.540
 I have done so many but I did not give him a 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.330
 bit 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.100
 next step to make my mash 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.950
 wait for the potatoes here I'm 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.440
 ending 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.050
 now let's wash the beds that 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.810
 first done the potatoes because what 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.430
 I want is to cover all the water 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.560
 Now let's put the legs to boil 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 now I 'm going to open the holes to the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.130
 rib to be able to cast my species 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.159
 of mixed herbs 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.590
 now I'm finishing 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.520
 of the holes in the ribs with 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.520
 mixed herbs 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.030
 and such 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.280
 the last thing I have left of the sauce 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.000
 tomato 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.000
 and I 'm going to throw 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.940
 Fabricio 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.750
 I'm going to take out the chips because they're already 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.580
 ready but 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.880
 now let's put our 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.880
 tissues 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:07.030
 at 250 degrees for 25 minutes and every ten 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.350
 minutes we repeat the process of throwing 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.430
 the sauces 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.020
 and ready now up potatoes and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.710
 milk the butter that is what gives 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.740
 the creaminess you need 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.460
 so one trick that I learned was that the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.240
 milk flavor 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.650
 and that gives it a creamy consistency and 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.750
 now I'm going to make these tomatoes then 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.260
 let's remove the top part that 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.260
 we do not want it 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.090
 then we are going to split it into rodas and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.090
 we discard in oregano 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.300
 and I want the oregano to give him all the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.300
 flavor you need 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.680
 I already put everything on top of the sheet and now 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.610
 let's take out the little ribs that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.610
 they are at their point 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.629
 let's play 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.459
 now I'm going to put the tomatoes in the 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.409
 tray not too stuck because I was 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.040
 can melt is that if you can hit me 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.040
 the flag 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.470
 Now what I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.660
 put them 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.710
 around three minutes what I want 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.710
 it's nothing but melting 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.069
 ready already with the ready preparation let's go 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.069
 to implant 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.090
 and these 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.620
 now 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.620
 we put the meat 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.080
 and finally 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.620
 we put the tomato 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.620
 i 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.730
 ready and that's how it is 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.299
 cristian to share with family 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.299
 so what does he talk
