00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.399 
you spray it on is that a word I don't
know<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.490> anyway<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> primarily<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
know but anyway this is primarily the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.389 
know but anyway this is primarily the
santan<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.850> marsh<00:01:54.240> grass<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.159> it<00:01:56.159> looked

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
santan and the marsh grass and it looked

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.020 
santan and the marsh grass and it looked
really<00:01:56.460> good

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
really good

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.730 
really good
almost<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.450> sunlight<00:01:57.719> streaming<00:01:58.350> through

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
almost like sunlight streaming through

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.380 
almost like sunlight streaming through
leaves<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.490> you're<00:01:59.640> getting<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.939> shadows

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
leaves and you're getting the shadows

leaves and you're getting the shadows
that<00:02:00.630> shadowing<00:02:01.140> effect<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.189> wanted<00:02:02.490> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that shadowing effect but I wanted to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.249 
that shadowing effect but I wanted to
get<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:02.909> bit<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.210> color<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:04.049> went

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
get a little bit more color so we went

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.469 
get a little bit more color so we went
ahead<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.530> did<00:02:05.130> black<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.729> brown<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
