 what temperatures are available 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.089
 I had 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.240
 ever 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.550
 presented this gag pension system monitor

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.349
 the canton 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.960
 with the mouse graphics card temperature and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.949
 the temperature in the taz computer case 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.420
 the protests temperature and time 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 but not so nice split I show you especially alternatives 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.390
 while there are under and u 10 points 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.140
 4 we open about our appointment once 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.310
 the opportunity with rare 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.360
 like this 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.020
 our current temperature 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.020
 To let ads 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.130
 now 46 degrees 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.680
 critical temperature 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.640
 80 degrees 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.300
 that should not be installed with you yet 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.640

 talk to me instructions 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.300
 how will that install 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.800
 you need to 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.740
 sensor 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.540
 that is Ubuntu 10 4 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.670
 already as I see it 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.130
 one can also be against censorship and projecting 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.140
 great chunk among blues favorite not 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.510
 if you do not have a go south 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.070
 Abbot you are with me 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.229
 Sobol he sign appetite - goes to the valley Eleni - Sensors 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
 Reinstall the package 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.390
 tmn 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.850
 is there a second option 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.230
 the winter coats 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.290
 and with 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.260
 Work

 RCB do the towers and son and so on pace 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:13.919
 to let that be a little more accurate 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.129
 that will be 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.129
 Second updated 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.269
 Vincent OAS two actually only one static values ​​is spent once 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.699
 this defense hinders itself here but constantly 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.179
 with updated 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:33.999
 you do not need to install it, and so on 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.999
 that is almost always at hand 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:39.790
 or man 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.549
 installs itself 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.969
 Füle 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.339
 the panel 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.339
 for our panel above 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:54.589
 Klein's tablet that means computer temperatures so count computers 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.529
 this package Universe included 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.229
 Emma clicks on it will be installed 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.109
 Rangnick already installed it 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.590
 and then you can right-click big pendulum 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.590
 Add 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.630
 and then has Concord 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.630
 Computer temperature monitors 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.639
 she can do this 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.639
 Add 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.219
 then you have up here 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.829
 such a small symbol 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.999
 what are the temperatures? 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.039
 cha-am indicates 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.259
 Of course, this is still a bit of fun to have the monument 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.259
 I do not like that so much 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:50.009
 April instead 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.479
 to buy that like him 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.009
 they have Haas 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.019
 filed 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.369
 Installed 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.339
 is in the package Universe 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.339
 You can install the gruff ones 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.289
 or via Stremmel 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:10.899
 Sobol he sign captain - the psychiatric services Angel 

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:12.109
 spaces 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.489
 Sensors - Tray 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.029
 I already have it 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.389
 Rami installed 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.659
 after the installation of this are now once again the calculator new 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.809
 start 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:29.069
 then you have the opportunity to add to the pause again 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.419
 and to punish 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.409
 Then Dennhardt gets higher 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.409
 Sensor monitoring 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.319
 Hartmeier sensor monitor 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.349
 Add 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.360
 Skeptics close 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:04.270
 And to see you once the graphics card temperature here 58 degrees 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.759
 already pretty warm 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.520
 CPU temperatures 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.520
 &amp; a stuss Russia curled and culture 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:14.139
 you go there very nice 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.139
 and that one also has setting options 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.919
 the different sensors 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.819
 Wagner also HDD HDD temperature 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.139
 you can turn it on 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:34.970
 and then I see mine up here too 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.620
 Hard disk temperatures 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.909
 43 degrees 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:40.979
 the EHC in 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.610
 as the graphics card temperatures rise from Scholven that is so 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.909
 Dragon's blood is there 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.759
 RZB gives 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:50.930
 CPU 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.909
 and CPU temperatures 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.559
 then there are still different lives meaningless thin clients 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:59.749
 and I guess the gearbox 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:03.189
 Dudu should do 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:04.999
 the prototype 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:07.999
 Computer itself and then I have a very nice top 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.809
 these temperatures 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:13.800
 I hope to have helped here 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.680
 remain means 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.639
 sincerely
