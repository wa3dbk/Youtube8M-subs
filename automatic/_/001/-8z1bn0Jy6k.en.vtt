why<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.890> rice<00:02:11.100> always<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.900> flood<00:02:13.200> I

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
why is the rice always have in a flood I

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.480 
why is the rice always have in a flood I
don't<00:02:14.880> know<00:02:15.000> why<00:02:15.210> but<00:02:15.710> from<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.860> Asian<00:02:17.190> time

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
don't know why but from the Asian time

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.420 
don't know why but from the Asian time
we<00:02:17.850> try<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.240> introduce<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.320> water<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
we try to introduce the water to the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.810 
we try to introduce the water to the
rice<00:02:20.580> field<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.590> when<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:22.770> input<00:02:23.100> with<00:02:23.520> some

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
rice field and when we input with some

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.770 
rice field and when we input with some
rice<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.080> water<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.880> easy<00:02:27.240> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
rice out of the water is is easy to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.830 
rice out of the water is is easy to
control<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.680> week<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.250> they<00:02:30.090> control<00:02:30.630> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
control the week and they control the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.160 
control the week and they control the
growth<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.470> life<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:32.600> think<00:02:33.600> that's<00:02:33.960> why

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
growth of the life I think that's why

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.430 
growth of the life I think that's why
they<00:02:34.650> introduced<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.310> water<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.630> we<00:02:37.290> now

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
they introduced to water so we now

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.790 
they introduced to water so we now
people<00:02:37.920> they<00:02:38.250> said<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:39.570> rice<00:02:39.990> contributed

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
people they said the rice contributed

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.900 
people they said the rice contributed
and<00:02:41.010> conjugation<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.180> easiest<00:02:42.990> one<00:02:43.260> to

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
and conjugation is the easiest one to

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.960 
and conjugation is the easiest one to
the<00:02:44.910> making<00:02:45.390> predict<00:02:46.140> produced<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.730> rice

this<00:05:41.729> is<00:05:41.790> just<00:05:42.090> kind<00:05:42.330> of<00:05:42.389> expand<00:05:42.750> exports

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
this is just kind of expand exports

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.830 
this is just kind of expand exports
pyramids<00:05:43.970> also<00:05:44.970> this<00:05:45.090> is<00:05:45.210> all<00:05:45.330> experimental

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
pyramids also this is all experimental

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
around the green wise Tennyson the

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.610 
around the green wise Tennyson the
survey<00:05:53.379> advice<00:05:53.710> from<00:05:54.189> a<00:05:54.729> blood<00:05:55.509> red<00:05:55.809> rice<00:05:56.080> is

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
survey advice from a blood red rice is

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.549 
survey advice from a blood red rice is
for<00:05:57.009> the<00:05:57.610> recognition<00:05:57.939> of<00:05:58.509> some<00:05:59.199> donor

00:05:59.549 --> 00:05:59.559 
for the recognition of some donor

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.070 
for the recognition of some donor
experiments<00:06:00.249> all<00:06:00.909> the<00:06:01.120> red<00:06:01.330> rice<00:06:01.539> you<00:06:01.960> can

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
experiments all the red rice you can

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.760 
experiments all the red rice you can
recognize<00:06:02.379> it

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
recognize it

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.100 
recognize it
then<00:06:02.979> usually<00:06:03.219> they<00:06:03.699> just<00:06:03.939> discard<00:06:04.779> the<00:06:04.900> red

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
then usually they just discard the red

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.929 
then usually they just discard the red
rice<00:06:05.379> to<00:06:06.069> to<00:06:06.759> make<00:06:06.999> some<00:06:07.300> you<00:06:07.419> know<00:06:07.569> division

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:08.939 
rice to to make some you know division

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.489 
rice to to make some you know division
sounds<00:06:09.939> right<00:06:10.120> now<00:06:10.330> so<00:06:11.169> that<00:06:11.349> right<00:06:11.439> there

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:11.499 
sounds right now so that right there

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:14.820 
sounds right now so that right there
looks<00:06:11.650> like<00:06:11.830> soybeans<00:06:13.169> they<00:06:14.169> have<00:06:14.289> corn<00:06:14.650> right

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
looks like soybeans they have corn right

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.099 
looks like soybeans they have corn right
