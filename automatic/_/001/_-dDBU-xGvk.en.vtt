I<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.239> put<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> bottom<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.809> phone<00:00:54.989> into

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
I just put the bottom of the phone into

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.770 
I just put the bottom of the phone into
start<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.910> locks<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.120> at<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> top<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.690> you've

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
start with locks on at the top so you've

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.840 
start with locks on at the top so you've
got<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> good<00:00:58.140> fit<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.609> that's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
got a good fit as you can see that's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.549 
got a good fit as you can see that's
just<00:00:59.969> rised<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.780> around<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.140> edge<00:01:01.260> there

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
just rised up all around the edge there

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.009 
just rised up all around the edge there
so<00:01:02.460> you've<00:01:02.609> got<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> protection<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.930> you

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
so you've got a bit of protection if you

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.560 
so you've got a bit of protection if you
if<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.710> put<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> phone<00:01:05.159> down<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.580> way<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
if you put the phone down that way the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.260 
if you put the phone down that way the
the<00:01:07.170> back<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> case<00:01:07.920> actually<00:01:08.369> exposes

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the back of the case actually exposes

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.179 
the back of the case actually exposes
the<00:01:09.390> back<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> phone<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:11.100> an

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the back of the phone it's not really an

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.920 
the back of the phone it's not really an

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
issue because again he is raised up a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.359 
issue because again he is raised up a
few<00:01:13.110> millimeters<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:13.950> you're<00:01:14.040> putting<00:01:14.159> the

a big thick heavy phone so on and all

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.740 
a big thick heavy phone so on and all
you<00:02:24.650> get<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:24.970> fairly<00:02:25.970> decent<00:02:26.390> drop<00:02:26.540> protection

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
for the screen itself and I think the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.270 
for the screen itself and I think the
design<00:02:32.390> itself<00:02:32.750> overall<00:02:33.410> looks<00:02:33.830> really<00:02:34.160> good
