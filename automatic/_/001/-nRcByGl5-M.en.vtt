00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.489

 Together you help me, so to speak 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.510
 you help me incredibly 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.980
 while my videos just always times 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.930
 again to cut more individually or 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.239
 just to customize something 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.129
 try something new 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.460
 I promised you that today 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.840
 I'm currently in Berlin on Monday 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.010
 So if you see this video I have 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.510
 you promised that he would have one 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.310
 wedding table will give josef here 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.799
 is in front and it is super easy 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.000
 It is cheap and it works fast 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.560
 yes and if you want to know how it is 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.119
 works then it starts now everything 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.900
 what we need for these studios 11 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.740
 is a glass jar which you can do that 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.180
 you choose 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:36.030
 we need spray glue then need 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.979
 we have some tesafilm and glitter in gold 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.890
 either here like me rose gold or 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.619
 need normal golden yellow gold as well 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.570
 We then have a document and a 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.270
 bowl so that we have the glitter afterwards 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.659
 you can catch it then you need 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.009
 tesafilm and it sticks to the film then 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.060
 best we leave here 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.140
 beautiful streak-free now you have to 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.220
 Look that the theme as well as 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:11.399
 possible just around it 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:11.399
 sticks so that we in the end no depth 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.940
 I've got that edge now 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.500
 now we have this once 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.600
 it's not as if rum thing wrong 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.920
 Bad if you take smaller glasses 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.880
 that's a lot easier 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.800
 then you can just do the complete 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.810
 to make glass but I think that's nice 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.940
 that now only has its stripes here 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.470
 So that's the next one so now 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.130
 I have glued top and bottom edge 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.130
 remember 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.570
 You have to keep your glass nice and clean 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.190
 Best of all , drive woman along 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.620
 There is alcohol in my glass cleaner 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.990
 if you have that then you have 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.820
 your document you have yours 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:56.250
 Spray glue and then just stick it 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:58.690
 glass nicely evenly everywhere 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.920
 then you put your bowl underneath and 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.510
 Just leave that a little bit for now 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.960
 dry you are in your hand 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.340
 So here you are doing the whole thing 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.910
 the acute glitter and tilts the glitter 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.450
 as even as possible over the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.450
 Glue 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.069
 nice and even everywhere 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.719
 pass over 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.060
 since the shell is under it you can 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.480
 quiet a bit more wasteful 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.879
 his 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.400
 These are super beautiful wind lights 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.319
 afterwards for the wedding table because it 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.599
 just looks incredibly classy 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:41.610
 It is very important that you glass the beautiful 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:45.300
 with both hands takes turns with it 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.980
 the whole peter nicely derogatory like that and 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.280
 if the whole is then dried then 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.070
 you are looking for your tesa stripes and 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.390
 pulls him off very slowly while falling 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.390
 as you can see a little bit of dust and 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.580
 so if you do because you have just one 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.600
 bit with your finger or was that 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.600
 clean the edges 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.000
 then you have really nice here 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.940
 glass for your wedding we will 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.940
 just a teaspoon 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.630
 then if you still simple glasses 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.240
 around it, the candlelight is also from 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.310
 outside of it, then you really have 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.170
 a beautiful wedding deco the elegant 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.240
 looks very noble by the glitter 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.020
 but take care that you are sensible 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.020
 select colors 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.320
 I did not promise you too much 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.880
 it's really a simple 'do 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.420
 yourself what you just do yourself 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.220
 can 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.540
 I think you have similar variants 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.560
 or similar variants already determined 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.470
 seen somewhere 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.420
 I chose red red gold for myself 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.100
 decided because I just one 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.200
 a little more noble and dreamy find 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.670
 and as I said quite important 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.260
 around it a few simple glasses 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.520
 who might not have a glitter with it 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.170
 the grid from the outside again so 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.240
 gets a little candlelight and still 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.650
 a little bit more sparkles me 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.480
 Thank you for turning it on 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.500
 and if you liked this video 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.090

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.610

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.880
 Once again prince bastian tata and 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.100
 Since he was just filmed a movie 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.720
 the wedding theme is me 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.270
 So she was the catch the rogue 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.270
 that is one recognizes that I think so too
