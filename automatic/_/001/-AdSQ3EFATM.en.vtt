00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
in ninety percent three there can be

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.300 
in ninety percent three there can be
only<00:01:25.110> two<00:01:25.500> reasons<00:01:25.740> 90<00:01:26.730> percent<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.510> a<00:01:27.750> door

straight from the tank all the time into
the<00:02:00.090> carburetor<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.920> will<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:03.180> will

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390

you will clean over there you need to
put<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.140> valve<00:02:55.500> back<00:02:55.830> make<00:02:56.100> sure<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.730> is

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
put a valve back make sure that this is

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.550 
put a valve back make sure that this is
the<00:02:57.060> way<00:02:57.270> how<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.570> valve<00:02:57.900> should<00:02:58.140> be<00:02:58.320> fitted

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
the way how the valve should be fitted

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.350 
the way how the valve should be fitted
back<00:02:58.860> do<00:02:59.640> not<00:02:59.820> fit<00:03:00.330> that<00:03:00.510> far<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:00.930> upside<00:03:01.380> down

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
back do not fit that far up upside down

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.840 
back do not fit that far up upside down
so<00:03:03.360> we<00:03:03.630> can<00:03:03.810> fit<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.110> valve<00:03:04.470> back<00:03:04.950> into<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
so we can fit the valve back into the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.809 
so we can fit the valve back into the
hole

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:45.650 

put<00:03:10.819> a<00:03:10.849> filter<00:03:11.209> in<00:03:12.370> here

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.790 

right<00:03:46.230> now<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:47.360> put<00:03:48.360> everything<00:03:48.660> back<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.560> the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
right now and put everything back so the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.240 
right now and put everything back so the
float<00:03:51.140> gasket<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:53.090> cover<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.680> 90%

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
float gasket and cover of it and the 90%

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.600 
float gasket and cover of it and the 90%
that's<00:03:57.000> gonna<00:03:57.300> help<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.990> you<00:03:58.860> won't<00:03:59.100> get<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
that's gonna help and you won't get a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.590 
that's gonna help and you won't get a
leak<00:04:00.270> from<00:04:00.510> overflow<00:04:01.080> holes<00:04:01.380> anymore

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
leak from overflow holes anymore

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.970 
leak from overflow holes anymore
so<00:04:03.600> if<00:04:04.110> this<00:04:04.680> does<00:04:05.040> not<00:04:05.070> help<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:05.970> means<00:04:06.450> that

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
so if this does not help it means that

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.710 
so if this does not help it means that
the<00:04:07.980> float<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:09.240> badly<00:04:09.570> regulated<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:11.720> it

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
the float it's badly regulated and it

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.960 
the float it's badly regulated and it
does<00:04:13.260> not<00:04:13.710> cool<00:04:14.100> it's<00:04:14.250> getting<00:04:14.670> too<00:04:14.850> much

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
does not cool it's getting too much

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.560 
does not cool it's getting too much
petrol<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.720> carburetor<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:17.130> we<00:04:17.340> can

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
petrol to the carburetor so we can

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.600 
petrol to the carburetor so we can
adduced<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.840> here<00:04:19.110> by<00:04:19.260> twisting<00:04:19.890> that<00:04:20.190> little

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
adduced it here by twisting that little

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.390 
adduced it here by twisting that little
bit<00:04:20.760> up<00:04:20.970> as<00:04:21.390> well<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:21.870> now<00:04:22.770> which<00:04:23.010> mean<00:04:23.220> the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
bit up as well and now which mean the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.320 
bit up as well and now which mean the
float<00:04:23.640> will<00:04:23.940> close<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.570> petrol<00:04:25.020> much<00:04:25.740> quicker

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
float will close the petrol much quicker

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.450 
float will close the petrol much quicker
so<00:04:27.330> there<00:04:27.690> will<00:04:27.780> be<00:04:27.840> less<00:04:28.740> petrol<00:04:29.280> in<00:04:29.430> the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
so there will be less petrol in the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.840 
so there will be less petrol in the
carburetor<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:31.140> won't<00:04:31.410> overflow<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:32.220> would

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
carburetor and it won't overflow I would

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.130 
carburetor and it won't overflow I would
not<00:04:33.090> recommend<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:34.250> adduce<00:04:35.250> this<00:04:36.140> yourself

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
not recommend to adduce this yourself

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.650 
not recommend to adduce this yourself
always<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:38.430> first<00:04:38.610> thing<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:39.120> have<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.330> check

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
always the first thing you have to check

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.690 
always the first thing you have to check
is<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.110> little<00:04:40.380> valve<00:04:40.650> there<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.220> clean<00:04:41.550> over

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
is the little valve there and clean over

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.810 
is the little valve there and clean over
there<00:04:42.030> that<00:04:42.270> will<00:04:42.420> help<00:04:42.660> 90<00:04:43.170> percent<00:04:43.590> all<00:04:44.280> the

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
there that will help 90 percent all the

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.560 
there that will help 90 percent all the
cases<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:45.800> just<00:04:46.800> do<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.490> already<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:48.150> remove

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
cases so just do it already to remove

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.440 
cases so just do it already to remove
the<00:04:48.810> valve<00:04:49.050> clean<00:04:49.740> inside<00:04:50.250> one<00:04:50.490> inside<00:04:51.060> the

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
the valve clean inside one inside the

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.870 
the valve clean inside one inside the
little<00:04:51.600> hole<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.200> put<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.100> word<00:04:53.370> back<00:04:53.640> and

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
little hole and put the word back and

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.690 
little hole and put the word back and
you<00:04:54.000> will<00:04:54.120> find<00:04:54.420> out<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.780> will<00:04:54.930> stop<00:04:55.230> blinking

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
you will find out it will stop blinking

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.430 
you will find out it will stop blinking
so<00:04:56.700> now<00:04:56.940> we<00:04:57.000> can<00:04:57.270> fit<00:04:57.480> everything<00:04:57.780> back<00:05:00.440> the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
so now we can fit everything back the

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.660 
so now we can fit everything back the
little<00:05:01.740> gasket<00:05:03.410> make<00:05:04.410> sure<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.830> gasket<00:05:05.040> fits

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
little gasket make sure the gasket fits

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.600 
little gasket make sure the gasket fits
well<00:05:05.910> otherwise<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.600> will<00:05:06.720> get<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:06.960> leak

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
well otherwise you will get a leak

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:16.420 
well otherwise you will get a leak
thrown<00:05:08.660> somewhere<00:05:09.660> here<00:05:10.050> so<00:05:10.880> now<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:14.340> top

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
thrown somewhere here so now the top

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:36.490 
thrown somewhere here so now the top
we<00:05:17.430> need<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.639> feed<00:05:17.850> a<00:05:17.940> little<00:05:18.270> comeback

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.930 

and<00:05:38.020> this<00:05:39.020> will<00:05:39.230> fix<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.650> problem<00:05:40.070> so<00:05:40.250> it's

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
and this will fix the problem so it's

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.290 
and this will fix the problem so it's
only<00:05:41.120> few<00:05:42.080> mins<00:05:42.290> to<00:05:42.560> do<00:05:42.710> it<00:05:42.860> it's<00:05:43.640> very<00:05:43.700> easy<00:05:43.940> so

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
only few mins to do it it's very easy so

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.330 
only few mins to do it it's very easy so
if<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:44.780> ever<00:05:44.990> get<00:05:45.230> a<00:05:45.290> link<00:05:45.560> from<00:05:45.740> overflow

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
if you ever get a link from overflow

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.540 
if you ever get a link from overflow
cause<00:05:46.690> that's<00:05:47.690> the<00:05:47.840> way<00:05:48.020> how<00:05:49.010> we'll<00:05:49.190> fix<00:05:49.430> that

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
cause that's the way how we'll fix that

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.950 
cause that's the way how we'll fix that
