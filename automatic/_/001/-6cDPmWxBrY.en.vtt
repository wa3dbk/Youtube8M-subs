 in this decision 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.699
 the pastas of the world but I think so 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.579

 the capital 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.770
 Hello 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.240

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.260
 while really 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.409
 persists 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.409
 [Applause] 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:08.690

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.479

 [Music] 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.770
 for something 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.970

 all passengers were slightly 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.790

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.830
 draft 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.949
