00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.940
 like big scala 2 back to the channel 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.070
 youtube as stan all here in that 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.260
 ladies and gentlemen live bringing them a 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.059
 call of duty black ops 2 as 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.119
 they are looking at the screen 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.949
 nuclear very good the truth and then for 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.770
 be honest with all of you was 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.240
 looking at my files that I have saved 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.980
 on the computer what they were 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.460
 white all the nuclear of black ops 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.010
 2 and I started to see the games not in the 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.640
 game style mode in the flow of the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.460
 what a beautiful game that stake 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.739
 truth is a 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.920
 it's pretty fun to look at how it's going 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.470
 nothing like looking here seems that everything 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.420
 it's pretty fast it seems that I move 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.210
 quite fast and the speed is not accelerated 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.620
 nothing is starting is normal and is 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.930
 it's not going like I was playing and how it 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.550
 recorded and all that roll but well how 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.110
 are watching I'm using line in 94 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.899
 favorite with muffler and charger 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.180
 fast, there's no, you know how the gusts 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.080
 of help do not support as we can 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.700
 call and I remember but the truth with 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.060
 looking at my files that I already have 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.160
 saved there I realize and I get 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.619
 the reality of the loop create the great 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.679
 game that was black apps 2 not for me 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.140
 because I know we all have opinions 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.300
 different for all of us 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.910
 the game works differently and the way 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.580
 to play it and the nonsense that the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.240
 each game does not 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.620
 we all come differently and not some 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.020
 we understand the game faster than others 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.670
 some of us do better, some others do not and 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.860
 this game the truth for me was 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.070
 fascinating this game the truth was what 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.750
 with which I started the channel and the truth 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 I have enough games saved 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.330
 still nuclear games of more than 100 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.580
 and I'm going to bring them to the channel because it's 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.730
 quite fun to look at these of these 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.890
 items is not different different type 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.670
 I do not know how to explain it and the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.290
 true when looking at these items this is 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.110
 I lost engravings that I have because they gave me 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.540
 I want to play away from you but I 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.250
 I wanted to play black cabs 2 yes 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.010
 but I no longer have the game was the bad 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.030
 I sold it but I'm going to buy it 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.590
 I definitely see it can buy and 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.250
 I'm going to take a few games try 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.630
 nuclear war yes to why then because 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.700
 yes no more the truth and the games are 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.550
 because we're going to be stuck in a 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.190
 only game I know of caudor ingush is a 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.110
 great game for me because I'm going 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.690
 very good in this double nuclear game 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.800
 you know the new double game who if 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.280
 all that 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.470
 to whom here that over there but 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.760
 honestly it's definitely not so 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.820
 fun to look at call of duty goes no 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.850
 it's more fun to look than white 2 and 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.130
 honestly that's the way it is, that's how it is 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.110
 reality and what are we going to do but not 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.850
 Well, they'll be looking at games 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.200
 of white 2 more nuclear has some 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.430
 games of more than 100 very good 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.860
 that I'm going to be bringing like this from time to time 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.060
 when it does not stop to break the rhythm I 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.660
 I know that many of you have asked me 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.700
 also that they do not like what ghost is 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.620
 and they wanted to look if they ask me 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.200
 or if I wanted to go back to blackout bears and 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.320
 roy here they understand it but well 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.870
 How are you looking at me? Well, my style of 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.600
 play not that I got answered and I did not 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.940
 it seemed that the one I armed myself from the sea 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.040
 walfred 2 not that he was not invincible I do not know 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.050
 because it was my connection and I know the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.730
 I play that half completely and 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.320
 Well, what they are seeing in 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.170
 no screen and what are you going to be watching 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.970
 from time to time when when then I 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.820
 bored myself to bring a little bit of 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.770
 coast to the canal so I hope you like it 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.430
 this party and these comments and 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.189
 random 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.780
 I'm not going to make it clear, I'm not going to try 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.689
 to teach how to play the game but I'm going 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.329
 to bring two and there comes the nuclear one and not 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.799
 here as soon as it goes nuclear it kills me like that 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.280
