players<00:00:48.769> my<00:00:49.769> first<00:00:50.129> step<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.030> think<00:00:51.269> about

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
players my first step was to think about

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.380 
players my first step was to think about
how<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> existing<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:52.980> works<00:00:53.609> and<00:00:53.910> what

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
how the existing you I works and what

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.910 
how the existing you I works and what
kinds<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.750> tasks<00:00:54.989> people<00:00:55.410> are<00:00:55.679> generally

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
trying to accomplish while using it and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
trying to accomplish while using it and
doing<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.309> started<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> focus<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.660> how

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
doing this I started to focus on how

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.410 
doing this I started to focus on how
people<00:01:01.289> use<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.190> incredible<00:01:02.789> tools<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.390> are

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
people use the incredible tools that are

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960 
people use the incredible tools that are
built<00:01:03.749> into<00:01:03.870> starcraft<00:01:04.350> 2<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.309> improve<00:01:05.700> their

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
built into starcraft 2 to improve their

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.990 
built into starcraft 2 to improve their
gameplay<00:01:06.420> over<00:01:06.720> time<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.230> I<00:01:08.100> continue<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> work

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
gameplay over time as I continue to work

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.450 
gameplay over time as I continue to work
through<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.540> process<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.259> start<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> notice<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
through this process I start to notice a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.550 
through this process I start to notice a
few<00:01:11.670> small<00:01:12.030> things<00:01:12.060> could<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.750> make<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
few small things could really make it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
few small things could really make it
easier<00:01:14.009> for<00:01:14.549> users<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.909> analyze<00:01:15.509> their<00:01:15.720> past

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
easier for users to analyze their past

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
easier for users to analyze their past
matches<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.250> would<00:01:17.400> allow<00:01:17.640> them<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
matches and that would allow them to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.020 
matches and that would allow them to
more<00:01:18.329> efficiently<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.200> effectively<00:01:20.030> access

analyze explore how these areas of the
interface<00:02:02.880> work<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.420> started<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.289> see<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> common

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
interface work I started to see a common

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.560 
interface work I started to see a common
theme<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.670> helped<00:02:06.060> me<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.359> better

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
theme that helped me to better

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.440 
theme that helped me to better
understand<00:02:07.350> how<00:02:07.590> players<00:02:08.220> were<00:02:08.789> using<00:02:09.300> these

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
understand how players were using these

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.580 
understand how players were using these
tools<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.920> was<00:02:11.610> nothing<00:02:12.090> short<00:02:12.300> of

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
tools and this was nothing short of

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.470 
tools and this was nothing short of
groundbreaking

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.140 

the<00:02:17.480> premise<00:02:17.930> put<00:02:18.260> simply<00:02:18.739> is<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:19.579> user's

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
the premise put simply is that a user's

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.500 
the premise put simply is that a user's
match<00:02:20.480> history<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.260> replay<00:02:22.040> files<00:02:22.400> are<00:02:22.790> both

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
match history and replay files are both

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.069 
match history and replay files are both
used<00:02:24.109> to<00:02:24.409> tell<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.950> same<00:02:25.159> story<00:02:25.900> once<00:02:26.900> I

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
used to tell the same story once I

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.679 
used to tell the same story once I
understood<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.859> I<00:02:28.099> realize<00:02:28.939> that<00:02:28.969> those<00:02:29.329> two

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
understood this I realize that those two

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.750 
understood this I realize that those two
portions<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.469> interface<00:02:30.859> need<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.609> be

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
portions of the interface need to be

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.759 
portions of the interface need to be
tightly<00:02:32.090> integrated<00:02:32.750> together<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.620> ensure

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
tightly integrated together to ensure

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.920 
tightly integrated together to ensure
that<00:02:34.280> users<00:02:34.549> can<00:02:34.819> truly<00:02:35.299> tell<00:02:35.540> what<00:02:35.840> is

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
that users can truly tell what is

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.050 
that users can truly tell what is
happening<00:02:36.409> over<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.829> course<00:02:37.189> of<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.579> game<00:02:37.609> and

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
happening over the course of a game and

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.420 
happening over the course of a game and
all<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:39.109> my<00:02:39.170> design<00:02:39.650> developments<00:02:40.159> from<00:02:40.219> that

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
all of my design developments from that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.670 
all of my design developments from that
point<00:02:40.700> forward<00:02:40.760> we're<00:02:41.510> based<00:02:41.840> around<00:02:42.139> this

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
point forward we're based around this

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.879 
point forward we're based around this
single<00:02:43.189> idea<00:02:43.719> to<00:02:44.719> bring<00:02:44.930> about<00:02:45.079> this<00:02:45.469> level<00:02:45.799> of

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
single idea to bring about this level of

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.250 
single idea to bring about this level of
cross<00:02:46.189> integration<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:47.000> started<00:02:47.720> by<00:02:47.840> adding

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
cross integration I started by adding

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.530 
cross integration I started by adding
the<00:02:48.290> ability<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.829> directly<00:02:49.280> launch<00:02:49.730> replay

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
the ability to directly launch replay

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.800 
the ability to directly launch replay
files<00:02:50.840> from<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.680> game<00:02:51.889> summary<00:02:52.250> screen

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
files from the game summary screen

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.839 
files from the game summary screen
meaning<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:53.989> users<00:02:54.439> no<00:02:54.829> longer<00:02:54.859> have<00:02:55.549> to

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
meaning that users no longer have to

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.149 
meaning that users no longer have to
look<00:02:56.150> at<00:02:56.359> a<00:02:56.419> match<00:02:56.720> history<00:02:56.989> item<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.739> then

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
look at a match history item and then

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.550 
look at a match history item and then
search<00:02:58.519> for<00:02:58.790> its<00:02:59.209> corresponding<00:02:59.569> replay<00:03:00.260> file

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
search for its corresponding replay file

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.979 
search for its corresponding replay file
I<00:03:00.939> additionally<00:03:01.939> added<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.389> new<00:03:02.659> production

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
I additionally added a new production

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.349 
I additionally added a new production
