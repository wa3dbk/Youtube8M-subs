detect what kind of trap it is little

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.600 
detect what kind of trap it is little
symbol<00:01:15.259> appears<00:01:15.590> over<00:01:15.799> it<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.280> then<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:16.430> just

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
symbol appears over it and then you just

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.670 
symbol appears over it and then you just
match<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.240> with<00:01:17.479> two<00:01:17.689> three<00:01:17.990> or<00:01:18.080> four<00:01:18.110> so

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
match that with two three or four so

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.359 
match that with two three or four so
this<00:01:18.860> is<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:20.409> caltrops<00:01:21.409> line<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.070> what's<00:01:22.189> their

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
this is a caltrops line and what's their

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.090 
this is a caltrops line and what's their
green<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.790> can<00:01:22.939> move<00:01:23.090> over<00:01:23.479> them<00:01:23.799> now<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:24.860> got

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
green you can move over them now you got

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.800 
green you can move over them now you got
to<00:01:25.220> beat<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.490> boss<00:01:25.700> using<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.570> same
