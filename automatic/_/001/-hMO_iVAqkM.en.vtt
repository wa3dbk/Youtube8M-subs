00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.410
 what is this thing that mega man friend 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.419
 with this metal story that show 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.119
 already flower 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.449
 Of course it's the dictator's lord, I'm 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.650
 going crazy I 'm listening to voices 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.750
 This is a mercenary. 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.850
 now all done by the same guys who 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.680
 scott pilgrim did not play 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.930
 perceive the similarities by looking at the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.299
 animation of fathers who are fuck just for 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.940
 See this side scrolling game xuri 

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:48.780
 cooperative where his mission is to shoot 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.729
 all the world 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.369
 I think you can play online and 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.110
 offline with up to four players at this 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:57.180
 hence my mother playing 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.339
 if you do not know while the ox 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.019
 but with a screen it is lowercase type 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.390
 playing offline multiplayer and 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.400
 Reproductive have won 2 the screen is 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.880
 so it looked like a game of I understand of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.880
 s 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.920
 then play online you want to present 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.920
 You for my new friend Tim. 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:21.200
 now this game actually makes a mix 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.820
 millions of games 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.009
 the short sync communicator is 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.319
 identical to the metal game codec that 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.799
 You talk a lot of people, it's up to you. 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:32.840
 what a helicopter to remember 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.789
 very thin nor the graphics seem 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.429
 lot with scott pilgrim recorded in 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.200
 Icelandic mechanics is identical to the 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.280
 monster rancher then I explain better 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.140
 this is your base or lobby or 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.729
 to seal with the children today call in 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.590
 day and you can customize your 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.110
 equipment choose the next 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.119
 missions and start an online match one 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.310
 Sometimes there are few people playing. 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.929
 this game in online mode and you always 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.189
 will end up playing with a gringo from 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.920
 the other side of the world with the 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.349
 thereby causing very slight 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.829
 this was a ring and I'm going to make a new one 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:08.959
 friend and I present to you my 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:13.209
 new friend in this guy 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.209
 but our enemies know him as'm 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.460
 in a tank in law and now I'm going to talk 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.960
 of missions 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.270
 there is a great variety of them 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.340
 some is only to arrive at the end of the phase and 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:33.800
 come back to others you have to kill one 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.500
 a number of specific enemies and 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.710
 even have house missions look only those 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:47.450
 cute animals but do not take 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:51.050
 forgive motorcycle audience a certain sadness 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:55.930
 I remember my childhood or so many 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.930
 deaths of children 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.100
 Let's set up a break here. 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.620
 ride your gun the way you do 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.690
 want to place piece by piece and changing 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.210
 something looks kind a private 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.490
 it is not clear that each has its own 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.140
 potential you can ride sniper 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.840
 only a strong shot or a machine gun 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.470
 that lets you run faster or with 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.420
 a ginga that takes more and leaves slow or 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.370
 at least for me the more she takes 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.170
 better then in this game you have to 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.390
 deliver your weapon and mechanics 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.250
 loading just like the game 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.260
 gears of war if you hit the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.090
 wrong time you take your gun now 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.730
 hit on time you recharge 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.150
 cute ogu er 6 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.940
 created by the light European company that 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.890
 you step on the game came the euro of course 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.480
 that I'm going to use the medicine, then I will 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.830
 a mission to kill the first boss 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.930
 you have to find the bastard 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.340
 walking by the scenery arrives are marked 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.200
 by map skulls 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.940
 but then he is not always in the 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.310
 same place so it's good to play for 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.350
 four players so you can go each 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.370
 one in a single direction that is equal to 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.060
 errant 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.190
 I do not know if this advanced or semi phase 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.599
 the weak looks so much shooting and I have 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.050
 what a great face 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.720
 a few hours later and we arrived at the chef 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.550
 fox rouge die battles with 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.320
 bosses are closed environments remembering 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.030
 very much the boss of the mega man until 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.600
 after a while since you can escape from 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.250
 you 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.750
 We need to find another point. 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.090
 that the boss could be on the map to 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:31.060
 yes kill it very common thing of the games 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:33.070
 monster blanket broken hear this song is the 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.080
 double fighting with the boss at ppp where 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.900
 I do not know where it is and I hope it 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.630
 can be good of you died this fact 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.580
 led the net a passing ball failure 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.650
 the missions with success you return to 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.720
 base with materials if you have collected 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.340
 killing the boss of the enemies things 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.440
 materials you create new weapons and 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.450
 equipment identifies 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.490
 showing this mechanics very 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.320
 interesting, but at least in the 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.540
 My opinion is a bit of a nuisance. 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.669
 the game has to be 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.950
 repeating the same various lessons and 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.660
 several times just to get that one 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.310
 item you needed but the check did not 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.110
 I noticed a knife 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.330
 I do not know, I think the game could be good. 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.100
 more simple being that feeling of 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.229
 I play the old one that is only you enter the 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.660
 past phase and already popular next mission 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.310
 the game is getting more complex 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.620
 thing this game did not need for 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.140
 be good but that's me not even play 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.060
 ceases to be good only because it is complex 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.620
 full game of discussed more than 500 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.630
 grenades and even a communicator that you 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.820
 You can ask that becks to pick up more 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.580
 I do not know if I am the 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:38.500
 even today the grenades that are crazy 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.610
 even in this game sugar only medium and 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.280
 long 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.139
 you did not warn me 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.490
 O 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:53.219
 on the plate now the songs are in 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:55.139
 park tom jobim frank case the ru o em 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:57.150
 words are a type of music give me 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.550
 want to play this game again about 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.960
 I saw them themselves and that is why this 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.930
 game gets the grade 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.389
 the graphic zoom charming sprite super 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.289
 well designed and well animated music 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.150
 bottom 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.129
 kneeling and needs the only thing that 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.830
 Weigh it in that game for me, that's what I said. 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.930
 before too complex it would be too much 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.810
 something that is not and could be better if 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.120
 try - in my simple game you do not 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.949
 Can you just catch him? 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.199
 to enjoy you need to occupy your 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.879
 weapons to save the armor and get some 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.069
 so new skills need to stay 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.750
 repeating the missions several times because 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.370
 It can be tiring for a lot of people. 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.469
 including me 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.810
 are too many variables not to be 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:39.210
 A totally negative point I preferred 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.009
 that something simpler even that is 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.139
 only my humble opinion I still love 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.779
 this game so safe comments me 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.729
 cursing am there said he was going to play you 

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:50.610
 You need real terms 25 in his pocket and 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:52.949
 buy it on steam or on ps 41 the price 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.430
 also salty yes but you know the 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:55.979
 steam 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.900
 every day a game in promotion myself 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.599
 I paid the 10 stack in this game one 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.539
 crazy holiday promotion there was worth every 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:05.370
 penny on so good to hunt mercenaries 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:08.389
 I am the Lord, and until the next time. 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.389
 saw you take care 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.690
 It was peaceful, it was dilda.
