the<00:00:24.449> gears<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> big<00:00:25.320> issue<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:26.010> only

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the gears is not a big issue as we only

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.700 
the gears is not a big issue as we only
have<00:00:26.369> two<00:00:26.580> parameters<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.420> work<00:00:27.630> with<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.560> the

in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> front<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.219> have<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> tension

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
in the front here we have the tension

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.610 
in the front here we have the tension
bolt<00:00:33.270> where<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.780> adjust<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.200> tension<00:00:34.380> of

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
bolt where we can adjust the tension of

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.880 
bolt where we can adjust the tension of
the<00:00:34.680> derailleur<00:00:35.280> cables<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.600> other<00:00:37.590> hand

we<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.520> two<00:00:38.700> limitation<00:00:39.329> screws<00:00:39.660> where

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
we have the two limitation screws where

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
we have the two limitation screws where
we<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.290> set<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> limits<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> derailleurs

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
we can set the limits of the derailleurs

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.560 
we can set the limits of the derailleurs
motion<00:00:42.210> radius<00:00:43.760> one<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> most<00:00:45.180> common

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
motion radius one of the most common

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.540 
motion radius one of the most common
problems<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> rattling<00:00:46.860> sound<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> back

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
problems is a rattling sound at the back

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
problems is a rattling sound at the back
because<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.059> derailleur<00:00:48.420> refuses<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> pass

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
because the derailleur refuses to pass

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
because the derailleur refuses to pass
the<00:00:49.559> chain<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> next<00:00:50.309> sprocket<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.910> the

the chain up to the next sprocket on the
cassette<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.980> shift<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
cassette you see here I shift but the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.580 
cassette you see here I shift but the
chain<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.300> not<00:00:54.510> willing<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.899> move<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
next sprocket to solve this problem we

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.549 
next sprocket to solve this problem we
need<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.730> refer<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> tension<00:01:00.629> bolt<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
need to refer to the tension bolt on the

need to refer to the tension bolt on the
shifters<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:03.059> case<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.539> need<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
shifters in this case we need to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.870 
shifters in this case we need to
increase<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.650> tension<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> rear

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
increase the tension on the rear

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.020 
increase the tension on the rear
derailleur<00:01:06.119> cable<00:01:06.960> two<00:01:07.920> clicks<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.850> be

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
derailleur cable two clicks can be

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.679 
derailleur cable two clicks can be
enough<00:01:10.189> now<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.610> rear<00:01:11.820> derailleur<00:01:12.000> moves<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
enough now the rear derailleur moves a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.179 
enough now the rear derailleur moves a
little<00:01:12.780> more<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> next<00:01:13.650> sprocket<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
little more to the next sprocket and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.999 
little more to the next sprocket and
causes<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> chain<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.360> climb<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.810> perfectly

derailleur cable there are other
parameters<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.390> need<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.780> take<00:01:27.990> into

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
parameters that we need to take into

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.670 
parameters that we need to take into
account<00:01:29.090> these<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.869> limit<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> movement

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
account these are to limit the movement

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.600 
account these are to limit the movement

radius of front and rear derailleur we

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.460 
radius of front and rear derailleur we
can<00:01:35.790> see<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> upper<00:01:36.900> gears<00:01:37.170> are<00:01:37.409> not
