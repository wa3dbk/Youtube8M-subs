this one cover I took it off and look
what<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.220> found<00:00:17.600> this<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.050> gasket<00:00:19.619> actually

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
what I found this is the gasket actually

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.230 
what I found this is the gasket actually
there<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> gasket

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
there is a gasket

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.009 
there is a gasket
that<00:00:22.640> because<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.910> gasket<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.539> oil<00:00:24.689> will

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
that because of that gasket the oil will

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.740 
that because of that gasket the oil will
leak<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.920> gasket<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.519> dry<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.210> was<00:00:27.480> broken

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
leak this gasket is dry and was broken

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.970 
leak this gasket is dry and was broken
in<00:00:28.050> couple<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> places<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:29.789> he's<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.980> holding

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
in couple of places and he's not holding

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.709 
in couple of places and he's not holding
the<00:00:32.340> oil<00:00:32.520> anymore<00:00:33.079> and<00:00:34.130> what<00:00:35.130> happened<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.719> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the oil anymore and what happened is the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.040 
the oil anymore and what happened is the
oil<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.140> circulates<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.129> pressure<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.120> start

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
oil is circulates in pressure and start

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.069 
oil is circulates in pressure and start
to<00:00:40.200> leak<00:00:40.350> from<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> sides<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.870> get<00:00:43.010> to<00:00:45.079> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
to leak from the sides and get to the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.569 
to leak from the sides and get to the
outside<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> gasket<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.690> leaks<00:00:48.690> out

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
outside of the gasket and leaks out

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.880 
outside of the gasket and leaks out
that's<00:00:50.579> why<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.210> signs<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.899> oil<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
that's why we see signs of oil on the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.410 
that's why we see signs of oil on the
sides<00:00:53.190> that's<00:00:53.640> where<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.360> come

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

that's<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.159> caused<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.430> leak<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.080> got

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that's what caused the leak so you got

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.969 
that's what caused the leak so you got
it<00:01:17.090> now<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.299> I'm<00:01:18.360> gonna<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.890> to

the leuco so if you can see one of the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.670 
the leuco so if you can see one of the
valves<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:24.829> discolored<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.870> need<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.350> inspect

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
aluminum on the heads make sure that

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.590 
aluminum on the heads make sure that
there<00:03:42.049> are<00:03:42.170> hundred<00:03:43.160> percents<00:03:43.579> leveled<00:03:43.970> and

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
exciting I'm glad I got to the source of

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.080 
exciting I'm glad I got to the source of
the<00:05:10.330> problem<00:05:10.780> now<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.710> can<00:05:12.039> do<00:05:12.159> that<00:05:12.190> too<00:05:12.490> and

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
the problem now you can do that too and

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.920 
the problem now you can do that too and
I<00:05:14.020> don't<00:05:14.440> know<00:05:14.710> what<00:05:14.979> the<00:05:15.279> the<00:05:15.690> blocks<00:05:16.690> and

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
I don't know what the the blocks and

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.809 
I don't know what the the blocks and
everything<00:05:17.289> talking<00:05:17.680> about<00:05:17.949> replacing<00:05:18.580> the

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
everything talking about replacing the

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.300 
everything talking about replacing the
oil<00:05:18.849> cooler<00:05:19.690> I<00:05:19.870> don't<00:05:20.289> think<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.800> oil<00:05:20.949> cooler

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
oil cooler I don't think the oil cooler

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.740 
oil cooler I don't think the oil cooler
need<00:05:21.520> to<00:05:21.610> be<00:05:21.729> replaced<00:05:22.090> this<00:05:22.240> is<00:05:22.330> basically

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
need to be replaced this is basically

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.879 
need to be replaced this is basically
the<00:05:22.870> oil<00:05:22.900> cooler<00:05:23.259> by<00:05:23.439> the<00:05:23.500> way

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
the oil cooler by the way

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.510 
the oil cooler by the way
oil<00:05:24.639> flows<00:05:24.969> in<00:05:25.180> here<00:05:25.539> and<00:05:25.840> since<00:05:26.349> it's<00:05:26.500> got<00:05:26.650> you

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
oil flows in here and since it's got you

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.719 
oil flows in here and since it's got you
see<00:05:27.729> it'll<00:05:27.940> kind<00:05:28.090> of<00:05:28.150> like<00:05:28.300> your<00:05:28.479> radiator<00:05:29.729> oil

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
see it'll kind of like your radiator oil

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.779 
see it'll kind of like your radiator oil
runs<00:05:31.060> inside<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:32.199> gets<00:05:33.039> cooled<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.580> then<00:05:33.699> it

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
runs inside and gets cooled and then it

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.959 
runs inside and gets cooled and then it
keeps<00:05:33.969> on<00:05:34.150> circulating<00:05:35.310> when<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.520> gasket

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
keeps on circulating when the gasket

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.610 
keeps on circulating when the gasket
here<00:05:37.180> dries<00:05:37.479> out<00:05:37.860> start<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:39.039> lose<00:05:40.199> feel<00:05:41.199> the

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
here dries out start to lose feel the

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.409 
here dries out start to lose feel the
oil<00:05:41.770> start<00:05:42.099> to<00:05:42.219> leak<00:05:42.370> out<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.789> only<00:05:43.060> way<00:05:43.360> to

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
oil start to leak out the only way to

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.909 
oil start to leak out the only way to
fix<00:05:43.750> it<00:05:43.960> is<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.139> take<00:05:44.409> the<00:05:44.529> heads<00:05:44.680> out

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
fix it is to take the heads out

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.950 
fix it is to take the heads out
unfortunately<00:05:45.789> there's<00:05:46.029> no<00:05:46.210> other<00:05:46.330> way<00:05:46.569> if

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
unfortunately there's no other way if

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.240 
unfortunately there's no other way if
there<00:05:47.229> was<00:05:47.379> any<00:05:47.620> other<00:05:47.680> way<00:05:47.830> I<00:05:47.949> would<00:05:48.159> have

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
there was any other way I would have

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.800 
there was any other way I would have
done<00:05:48.430> this<00:05:48.580> but<00:05:48.849> I<00:05:49.029> can't<00:05:49.300> see<00:05:49.449> any<00:05:49.629> other<00:05:49.779> way

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
done this but I can't see any other way

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.950 
done this but I can't see any other way
to<00:05:49.960> do<00:05:50.169> that<00:05:50.490> okay<00:05:51.490> that's<00:05:51.759> it<00:05:51.940> that's<00:05:52.240> it<00:05:52.750> for
