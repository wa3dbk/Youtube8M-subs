the clay down nice and smooth you can

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.860 
the clay down nice and smooth you can
use<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.420> side<00:02:20.690> as<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> roller<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:23.360> use<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.720> to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
use the side as a roller and use it to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.690 
use the side as a roller and use it to
shape<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.900> then<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.410> one<00:02:27.709> has<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.220> larger

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
shape and then this one has a larger

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.720 
shape and then this one has a larger
rounded<00:02:29.239> end<00:02:29.830> for<00:02:30.830> they<00:02:31.010> make<00:02:31.220> nice<00:02:31.459> eye

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
rounded end for they make nice eye

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.800 
rounded end for they make nice eye
sockets<00:02:32.420> like<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.790> then<00:02:34.970> it's<00:02:35.150> also<00:02:35.360> got
