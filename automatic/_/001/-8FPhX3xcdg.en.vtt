for<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> new<00:01:40.320> Dino<00:01:40.560> navionics<00:01:41.250> d2<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.420> an

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
for the new Dino navionics d2 this is an

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.990 
for the new Dino navionics d2 this is an
amazing<00:01:42.750> device<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.649> extends<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> d1<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
amazing device and it extends the d1 it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600 
amazing device and it extends the d1 it
adds<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> attitude<00:01:46.520> indication<00:01:47.520> of

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
adds you know the attitude indication of

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.310 
adds you know the attitude indication of
pitch<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.850> bank<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> sends<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.899> data<00:01:48.960> by

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
pitch and bank but it sends that data by

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.980

Wi-Fi<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.520> wing<00:01:50.759> x<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.720> integrate

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
Wi-Fi to wing x so we can integrate

there with a synthetic vision and the
attitude<00:01:53.970> indicator<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:55.259> now<00:01:55.380> also<00:01:55.560> support

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
attitude indicator we now also support

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.380 
attitude indicator we now also support
the<00:01:56.250> Guardian<00:01:56.610> avionics<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> can

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
features to our Jeppesen FD app which is

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.180 
features to our Jeppesen FD app which is
I<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.760> are<00:02:26.849> mainly<00:02:27.180> for<00:02:27.450> IFR<00:02:27.810> pilots<00:02:28.170> one<00:02:29.099> of

I for are mainly for IFR pilots one of
the<00:02:29.250> things<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.610> we've<00:02:29.730> added<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> range

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the things that we've added is a range

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.199 
the things that we've added is a range
ring<00:02:30.690> now<00:02:30.870> into<00:02:31.290> our<00:02:32.030> application<00:02:33.030> which

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
ring now into our application which

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.030 
ring now into our application which
allows<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.959> posits<00:02:34.290> now<00:02:34.379> to<00:02:34.440> see<00:02:34.769> their

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
allows that posits now to see their

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.520 
allows that posits now to see their
their<00:02:35.510> application<00:02:36.510> where<00:02:36.629> they<00:02:36.720> can<00:02:36.870> range

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
their application where they can range

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
their application where they can range
out<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:37.980> actually<00:02:38.099> adjust<00:02:38.549> every<00:02:38.819> single

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
out and actually adjust every single

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.059 
out and actually adjust every single
time<00:02:39.239> for<00:02:39.569> like<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> different<00:02:40.170> ranges<00:02:41.010> that

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
time for like the different ranges that

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.009 
time for like the different ranges that
they're<00:02:41.310> going<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.700> will<00:02:41.819> go<00:02:42.000> out<00:02:42.150> from<00:02:42.390> you

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
they're going to will go out from you

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.750 
they're going to will go out from you
know<00:02:43.110> whatever<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.680> range<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.099> set<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.579> it

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
know whatever the range is set and it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.880 
know whatever the range is set and it
will<00:02:44.879> adjust<00:02:45.150> accordingly<00:02:46.019> when<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.379> zoom<00:02:46.650> in

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
will adjust accordingly when you zoom in

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.350 
will adjust accordingly when you zoom in
the<00:02:47.190> nice<00:02:47.340> thing<00:02:47.370> too<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:47.819> if<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.180> off

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
the nice thing too is like if you off

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.970 
the nice thing too is like if you off
center<00:02:48.629> it<00:02:48.690> off<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.049> GPS<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.680> tells<00:02:49.890> you

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
center it off of the GPS it tells you

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.199 
center it off of the GPS it tells you
how<00:02:50.129> far<00:02:50.340> away<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.579> are<00:02:50.700> from<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.030> position

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
how far away you are from that position

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.599 
how far away you are from that position
another<00:02:52.200> thing<00:02:52.349> that<00:02:52.379> we've<00:02:52.560> also<00:02:52.739> added<00:02:53.190> into

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
another thing that we've also added into

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.789 
another thing that we've also added into
our<00:02:53.700> JEP<00:02:53.910> FD<00:02:54.239> application<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.410> ability<00:02:55.530> to

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
our JEP FD application is the ability to

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.460 
our JEP FD application is the ability to
save<00:02:56.040> flights<00:02:56.370> now<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.750> one<00:02:58.019> thing<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.290> nice

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
save flights now the one thing is nice

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.500 
save flights now the one thing is nice
the<00:02:58.799> we've<00:02:59.370> always<00:02:59.519> been<00:02:59.700> requested<00:03:00.209> by<00:03:00.239> putz

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
the we've always been requested by putz

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.150 
the we've always been requested by putz
is<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.170> be<00:03:01.230> able<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.410> save<00:03:01.560> flight<00:03:01.829> so<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.040> can

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
is to be able to save flight so you can

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.710 
is to be able to save flight so you can
actually<00:03:02.280> easily<00:03:02.670> load<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.879> flight<00:03:03.150> plan<00:03:03.420> and

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
actually easily load a flight plan and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.119 
actually easily load a flight plan and
the<00:03:03.989> reason<00:03:04.200> why<00:03:04.260> we're<00:03:04.440> calling<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.769> flight

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
the reason why we're calling a flight

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.280 
the reason why we're calling a flight
because<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.329> can<00:03:06.450> actually<00:03:06.569> load<00:03:06.900> charts

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
because you can actually load charts

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.780 
because you can actually load charts
with<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.920> selected<00:03:08.280> charts<00:03:08.609> that<00:03:08.640> you

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
with it so the selected charts that you

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.970 
with it so the selected charts that you
had<00:03:08.910> actually<00:03:09.239> previously<00:03:10.140> used<00:03:10.440> would<00:03:10.829> also

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
had actually previously used would also

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.520 
had actually previously used would also
populate<00:03:11.579> with<00:03:11.609> that<00:03:11.910> flight<00:03:12.319> so<00:03:13.319> we<00:03:13.440> don't

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
populate with that flight so we don't

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.930 
populate with that flight so we don't
calling<00:03:13.980> them<00:03:14.069> routes<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:14.549> we<00:03:14.640> call<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:14.849> on

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
calling them routes but we call it on
