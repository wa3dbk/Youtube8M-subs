lot<00:00:28.860> of<00:00:28.890> people<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.430> major<00:00:29.610> scale<00:00:30.000> which

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
lot of people know the major scale which

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:37.119 
lot of people know the major scale which
is<00:00:31.140> an<00:00:31.590> example<00:00:31.890> too<00:00:32.220> and<00:00:32.489> sounds<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:32.910> this

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.759 

now<00:00:38.129> compare<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.820> happy<00:00:39.570> major<00:00:40.050> scale<00:00:40.410> sound

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
now compare that happy major scale sound

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.729 
now compare that happy major scale sound
to<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> minor<00:00:41.609> scale<00:00:41.910> which<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:43.109> example<00:00:43.559> 1

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
to the minor scale which is in example 1

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.579 
to the minor scale which is in example 1
and<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.010> sounds<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.370> this

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.569 

let's<00:00:52.589> take<00:00:52.769> another<00:00:52.859> look<00:00:53.070> at<00:00:53.250> those<00:00:53.370> two

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
let's take another look at those two

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.540 
let's take another look at those two
scales<00:00:53.850> side<00:00:54.120> by<00:00:54.269> side<00:00:55.100> here's<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> C<00:00:56.399> major

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
scales side by side here's the C major

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:10.850 
scales side by side here's the C major
scale<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> C<00:01:03.539> minor<00:01:03.750> scale

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.900 

so<00:01:11.860> it's<00:01:12.070> just<00:01:12.160> a<00:01:12.280> simple<00:01:12.520> three<00:01:12.760> note

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
so it's just a simple three note

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.550 
so it's just a simple three note
difference<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.660> minor<00:01:13.840> scale<00:01:14.020> expresses

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
difference the minor scale expresses

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.720 
difference the minor scale expresses
something<00:01:14.860> totally<00:01:15.130> different<00:01:15.550> than<00:01:15.700> the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
something totally different than the

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.090 
something totally different than the
major<00:01:15.970> scale<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.660> more<00:01:16.840> sadder<00:01:17.290> melancholy

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
major scale the more sadder melancholy

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.880 
major scale the more sadder melancholy
side<00:01:18.400> of<00:01:18.610> music<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:20.290> really<00:01:20.500> get<00:01:20.620> a<00:01:20.650> feel<00:01:20.860> for

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
side of music to really get a feel for

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.680 
side of music to really get a feel for
that<00:01:21.220> there's<00:01:21.790> no<00:01:21.910> better<00:01:22.090> way<00:01:22.240> than<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.450> place

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
that there's no better way than to place

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.410 
that there's no better way than to place
it<00:01:22.870> inside<00:01:23.080> an<00:01:23.620> actual<00:01:23.800> melody<00:01:24.420> examples

here's<00:01:29.020> example<00:01:29.440> three<00:01:29.710> based<00:01:30.130> on<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.460> major

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
here's example three based on the major

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
here's example three based on the major
scale

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:11.050 

and<00:01:50.500> here's<00:01:50.740> example<00:01:51.190> 4<00:01:51.430> based<00:01:51.910> on<00:01:52.120> C<00:01:52.390> minor

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.970 

so<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> notes<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.569> minor<00:02:12.750> scale<00:02:13.080> once

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
so the notes of the minor scale once

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.280 
so the notes of the minor scale once
understood<00:02:14.489> can<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.880> used<00:02:15.480> together<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:16.020> form

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
understood can be used together to form

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.790 
understood can be used together to form
chords<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.250> minor<00:02:17.430> key<00:02:18.050> example<00:02:19.050> 5<00:02:19.260> explores

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
chords of a minor key example 5 explores

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.199 
chords of a minor key example 5 explores
those<00:02:19.980> relationships<00:02:20.550> in<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.760> key<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:20.970> a

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
those relationships in the key of a

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.040 
those relationships in the key of a
minor<00:02:21.739> with<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.830> following<00:02:23.190> triads

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
based on the first step of the scale is

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.979 
based on the first step of the scale is
a<00:02:26.370> minor<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:30.030> second<00:02:30.360> step<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.720> scale

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
a minor on the second step of the scale

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:38.570 
a minor on the second step of the scale
is<00:02:31.170> B<00:02:31.530> diminished<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:36.860> many<00:02:37.860> musicians<00:02:38.160> when

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
is B diminished and many musicians when

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.030 
is B diminished and many musicians when
they<00:02:38.700> play<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.540> minor<00:02:39.750> key<00:02:40.019> will<00:02:40.349> instead<00:02:40.920> of

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
they play in a minor key will instead of

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.860 
they play in a minor key will instead of
B<00:02:41.400> diminished<00:02:41.819> which<00:02:41.970> has<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> very<00:02:42.360> sort<00:02:42.750> of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
B diminished which has a very sort of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.900 
B diminished which has a very sort of
strange<00:02:43.230> unstable<00:02:43.920> sound<00:02:44.160> they'll

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
strange unstable sound they'll

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.580 
strange unstable sound they'll
substitute<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.660> chord<00:02:45.959> with<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> B<00:02:46.350> minor

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
substitute that chord with a B minor

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.650 
substitute that chord with a B minor
which<00:02:46.830> sounds<00:02:47.069> more<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:50.390> then<00:02:51.390> C<00:02:51.810> major

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.780 

d<00:02:55.660> minor<00:02:55.960> E<00:02:58.260> minor

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.140 

F<00:03:02.510> major

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.420 

and<00:03:05.330> G<00:03:06.230> major

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:25.809 

so<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.550> order<00:03:11.819> those<00:03:12.180> chords<00:03:12.540> sound<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:12.930> this

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.100 

so<00:03:26.819> even<00:03:27.030> just<00:03:27.150> playing<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.569> chords<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:27.870> order

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
so even just playing the chords in order

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.809 
so even just playing the chords in order
you<00:03:28.319> can<00:03:28.530> actually<00:03:28.830> hear<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.400> way<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
you can actually hear the way that the

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.580 
you can actually hear the way that the
scale<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.090> climbing<00:03:30.660> through<00:03:30.959> each<00:03:31.170> note<00:03:31.560> of

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
scale is climbing through each note of

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.089 
scale is climbing through each note of
each<00:03:31.860> triad<00:03:33.019> examples<00:03:34.019> six<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.590> seven<00:03:34.890> show

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
each triad examples six and seven show

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.710 
each triad examples six and seven show
how<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.340> chords<00:03:35.790> from<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:36.060> minor<00:03:36.269> key<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.690> be

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
how the chords from a minor key can be

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.580 
how the chords from a minor key can be
used<00:03:36.840> together<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.680> form<00:03:37.950> simple<00:03:38.400> songs

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
used together to form simple songs

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.190 
used together to form simple songs
example<00:03:40.590> six<00:03:40.860> stays<00:03:41.069> in<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.310> key<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.760> minor

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
example six stays in the key of a minor

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.410 
example six stays in the key of a minor
with<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:44.130> minor<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.180> first<00:03:45.450> step<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.780> scale

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
with a minor the first step of the scale

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.250 
with a minor the first step of the scale
G<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.930> seventh<00:03:49.290> step<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.709> scale<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:51.260> F

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
G the seventh step of the scale and F

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.430 
G the seventh step of the scale and F
the<00:03:52.830> sixth<00:03:53.220> step<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.849> scale<00:03:54.319> here's<00:03:55.319> how

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
the sixth step of the scale here's how

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:19.259 
the sixth step of the scale here's how
that<00:03:55.500> example<00:03:55.980> sounds

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.520 

example<00:04:20.269> seven<00:04:20.600> actually<00:04:21.140> is<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.500> same

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
example seven actually is the same

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.920 
example seven actually is the same
progression<00:04:21.980> only<00:04:22.910> in<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.180> key<00:04:23.360> of<00:04:23.390> E<00:04:23.780> minor

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
progression only in the key of E minor

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.780 
progression only in the key of E minor
so<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:25.010> first<00:04:25.280> step<00:04:25.820> of<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.030> scale<00:04:26.300> E<00:04:27.790> minor

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
so the first step of the scale E minor

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.659 
so the first step of the scale E minor
the<00:04:29.660> seventh<00:04:30.020> step<00:04:30.200> of<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.440> scale<00:04:30.650> D<00:04:30.980> major

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
the seventh step of the scale D major

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.820 
the seventh step of the scale D major
and<00:04:32.819> the<00:04:33.330> sixth<00:04:33.629> step<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.139> scale<00:04:34.409> c-major

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
and the sixth step of the scale c-major

00:04:36.830 --> 00:05:04.130 
and the sixth step of the scale c-major
all<00:04:37.830> together<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.430> sounds<00:04:38.460> like<00:04:38.729> this

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.480 

so<00:05:05.140> to<00:05:05.200> bring<00:05:05.470> together<00:05:05.650> all<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.250> elements

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
so to bring together all of the elements

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.850 
so to bring together all of the elements
from<00:05:06.640> this<00:05:06.790> lesson<00:05:07.000> we've<00:05:07.420> prepared<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.380> song

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
from this lesson we've prepared a song

from this lesson we've prepared a song
in<00:05:09.010> a<00:05:09.070> minor<00:05:09.190> key<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.390> a<00:05:10.420> know<00:05:10.600> Carolyn

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
in a minor key this is a know Carolyn

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.550 
in a minor key this is a know Carolyn
tune

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
tune

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.030 
tune
it's<00:05:11.950> called<00:05:12.250> Carolyn's<00:05:12.760> welcome<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:14.350> I'm

it's called Carolyn's welcome and I'm

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.230 
it's called Carolyn's welcome and I'm

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
going to be playing the melody on my

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.270 
going to be playing the melody on my
guitar<00:05:16.540> but<00:05:17.080> if<00:05:17.320> you<00:05:17.680> have<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:17.980> music<00:05:18.130> in

guitar but if you have the music in

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.560 
guitar but if you have the music in
front<00:05:18.460> of<00:05:18.520> you<00:05:18.580> at<00:05:18.670> home<00:05:18.730> it<00:05:19.090> might<00:05:19.330> be<00:05:19.420> a<00:05:19.450> good

front of you at home it might be a good
idea<00:05:19.660> to<00:05:19.870> follow<00:05:20.020> along<00:05:20.320> with<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.680> chord

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
idea to follow along with the chord

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.700 
idea to follow along with the chord
charts<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:22.150> you<00:05:22.330> can<00:05:22.510> see<00:05:23.140> how<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.320> chords

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
charts and you can see how the chords

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.290 
charts and you can see how the chords
work<00:05:23.890> this<00:05:24.070> is<00:05:24.220> also<00:05:24.370> in<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.640> key<00:05:24.820> of<00:05:24.940> a<00:05:25.090> minor

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
work this is also in the key of a minor

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.440 
work this is also in the key of a minor
so<00:05:25.600> you<00:05:25.690> can<00:05:25.840> use<00:05:25.960> those<00:05:26.110> same<00:05:27.300> charts<00:05:28.300> as<00:05:28.420> a

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
so you can use those same charts as a

00:05:28.450 --> 00:06:27.530 
so you can use those same charts as a
reference

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:37.380 

you
