00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
the Super Rhino and put him on that

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.850 
the Super Rhino and put him on that
floor<00:02:17.540> now<00:02:17.720> that's<00:02:17.930> dangerous<00:02:18.140> because<00:02:18.739> as

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
floor now that's dangerous because as

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.780 
floor now that's dangerous because as
you<00:02:18.980> consistency

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
you consistency

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.120 
you consistency
I<00:02:19.820> knocked<00:02:20.480> part<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.930> tower<00:02:21.110> over<00:02:21.530> seem<00:02:22.010> to

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
I knocked part of the tower over seem to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.520 
I knocked part of the tower over seem to
be<00:02:22.220> very<00:02:22.430> cautious<00:02:22.850> when<00:02:23.810> putting<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.230> Super

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
be very cautious when putting the Super

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.620 
be very cautious when putting the Super
Rhino<00:02:24.739> on<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.040> floor<00:02:25.280> once<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> super<00:02:26.450> right

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
Rhino on the floor once the super right

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.539 
Rhino on the floor once the super right
on<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.900> on<00:02:27.019> then<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.769> can<00:02:27.950> finish<00:02:28.190> if<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
on is on then you can finish if the

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.979 
on is on then you can finish if the
Super<00:02:28.820> Rhino<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.150> already<00:02:29.420> in<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> building

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
Super Rhino is already in the building

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.420 
Super Rhino is already in the building
then<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.650> have<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.180> basically<00:02:33.010> move<00:02:34.010> him<00:02:34.250> from

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
then you have to basically move him from

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.660 
then you have to basically move him from
wherever<00:02:34.820> he<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.680> like<00:02:36.920> for<00:02:37.160> example<00:02:37.190> if<00:02:37.610> I

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
wherever he is so like for example if I

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.699 
wherever he is so like for example if I
play<00:02:37.880> another<00:02:37.970> super<00:02:38.540> wild<00:02:38.870> card<00:02:39.049> here<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
play another super wild card here the

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.470 
play another super wild card here the
next<00:02:40.040> person<00:02:40.340> has<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.640> take<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.910> Super<00:02:41.239> Rhino

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
next person has to take the Super Rhino

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.960 
next person has to take the Super Rhino
from<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:42.019> spot<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:42.620> they<00:02:43.310> have<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.670> place

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
from this spot and they have to place

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.020 
from this spot and they have to place
him<00:02:44.239> on<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:45.079> spot<00:02:45.350> here<00:02:45.650> which<00:02:46.640> makes<00:02:46.880> the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
him on this spot here which makes the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.180 
him on this spot here which makes the
tower<00:02:47.180> fall<00:02:47.540> now<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.410> game<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.769> over<00:02:48.920> when

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
tower fall now the game is over when

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.500 
tower fall now the game is over when
someone<00:02:49.459> gets<00:02:49.549> rid<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.820> all<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.120> cards<00:02:50.390> in

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
their hand and like I said there's

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.220 
their hand and like I said there's
different<00:02:52.670> cards<00:02:53.450> most<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:53.810> them<00:02:53.930> are<00:02:54.019> super

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
different cards most of them are super

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.900 
different cards most of them are super
rhinos<00:02:54.680> there's<00:02:54.890> some<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.370> these<00:02:55.430> cards<00:02:55.790> or

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.940 
rhinos there's some of these cards or
double<00:02:56.180> 4s<00:02:56.450> when<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.660> play<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:57.680> can<00:02:57.829> put

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
double 4s when you play that you can put

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.110 
double 4s when you play that you can put
another<00:02:58.160> four<00:02:58.430> right<00:02:58.579> on<00:02:58.670> top<00:02:58.820> of<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.030> you

another four right on top of it you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.030 
another four right on top of it you
basically<00:02:59.239> get<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.660> play<00:02:59.870> two<00:02:59.930> fours<00:03:00.410> some

everybody wins all together and so

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.790 
everybody wins all together and so
that's<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.840> game<00:03:23.990> that<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.320> tower<00:03:24.530> can

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
that's the game that the tower can

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.310 
that's the game that the tower can
actually<00:03:25.130> get<00:03:25.250> pretty<00:03:25.490> high<00:03:25.910> as<00:03:26.210> you<00:03:26.960> can<00:03:27.080> see

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
actually get pretty high as you can see

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.260 
actually get pretty high as you can see
I'm<00:03:27.620> not<00:03:27.920> very<00:03:28.130> good<00:03:28.220> at<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.640> but<00:03:28.790> other<00:03:28.940> people

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
I'm not very good at it but other people

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.850 
I'm not very good at it but other people
might<00:03:29.390> be<00:03:29.570> better<00:03:29.720> as<00:03:29.960> you're<00:03:30.680> building

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
might be better as you're building

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.230 
might be better as you're building
higher<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.430> higher<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:31.820> that's<00:03:32.030> how<00:03:32.180> you

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
higher and higher and that's how you

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.320 
higher and higher and that's how you
play<00:03:32.510> super<00:03:33.500> rhino<00:03:33.700> all<00:03:34.700> right<00:03:34.850> guys<00:03:35.030> what<00:03:35.270> do

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
you think of this game I thought it was

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.300 
you think of this game I thought it was
a<00:03:38.270> fun<00:03:38.510> game<00:03:38.540> not<00:03:39.290> very<00:03:39.500> difficult<00:03:39.770> for<00:03:40.160> me

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
a fun game not very difficult for me

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.330 
a fun game not very difficult for me
unless<00:03:40.610> if<00:03:40.820> there's<00:03:41.750> tons<00:03:42.050> of<00:03:42.200> wind<00:03:42.770> in<00:03:43.160> the

unless if there's tons of wind in the
room<00:03:43.520> and<00:03:44.480> if<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.840> start<00:03:44.990> on<00:03:45.140> one<00:03:45.350> card<00:03:45.590> it's

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
room and if you start on one card it's

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.040 
room and if you start on one card it's
really<00:03:46.040> difficult<00:03:46.220> but<00:03:46.580> -<00:03:46.850> you're<00:03:47.720> fine

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
really difficult but - you're fine

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.440 
really difficult but - you're fine
moving<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:48.920> Rhino<00:03:49.100> isn't<00:03:49.460> that<00:03:49.790> hard<00:03:50.030> and

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
moving the Rhino isn't that hard and

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.960 
moving the Rhino isn't that hard and
less<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.930> it's<00:03:51.740> really<00:03:52.100> complicated<00:03:52.550> the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
less of it it's really complicated the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.140 
less of it it's really complicated the
cards<00:03:53.330> well<00:03:53.750> it<00:03:53.810> can<00:03:54.050> be<00:03:54.200> hard<00:03:54.550> yeah<00:03:55.550> but

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
cards well it can be hard yeah but

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.090 
cards well it can be hard yeah but
you're<00:03:56.300> right<00:03:56.420> if<00:03:56.600> you<00:03:56.690> start<00:03:56.930> with<00:03:57.080> one<00:03:57.350> thing

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
you're right if you start with one thing

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.190 
you're right if you start with one thing
on<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.370> bottom<00:03:58.670> level<00:03:58.880> that's<00:03:59.600> much<00:03:59.959> more

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
on the bottom level that's much more

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.260 
on the bottom level that's much more
difficult<00:04:00.260> than<00:04:00.800> two<00:04:01.100> he<00:04:01.550> goes<00:04:01.700> put<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.000> fan<00:04:02.240> on

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
difficult than two he goes put a fan on

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.720 
difficult than two he goes put a fan on
in<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.570> room<00:04:02.720> like<00:04:02.840> she<00:04:03.050> said<00:04:03.610> what<00:04:04.610> do<00:04:04.670> you

an<00:04:57.770> extra<00:04:58.040> card<00:04:58.280> seems<00:04:58.550> way<00:04:58.850> more<00:04:58.880> powerful

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570

than<00:04:59.750> the<00:05:00.020> others<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.560> thought<00:05:01.280> if<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.940> get<00:05:02.120> a

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.680 
than the others I thought if you get a
couple<00:05:02.540> of<00:05:02.570> those<00:05:02.720> in<00:05:02.960> your<00:05:03.080> hands<00:05:03.470> well<00:05:04.690> yes
