one of the other all right but we tweet
so<00:03:09.470> much<00:03:09.739> like<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:10.790> could<00:03:10.970> write<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.180> novel

with<00:03:11.989> our<00:03:12.170> tweets<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.130> think<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.400> this

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
with our tweets so I think that this

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.250 
with our tweets so I think that this
video<00:03:14.110> has<00:03:15.110> been<00:03:15.140> pretty<00:03:16.100> pretty<00:03:16.850> stupid<00:03:17.360> so

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.080 
video has been pretty pretty stupid so
