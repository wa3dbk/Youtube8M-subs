 since its introduction lada priora 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.230
 constantly improved appeared 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.860
 new options evolved technology 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.250
 however it's time for quality 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.250
 jump 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.510
 albeit in the framework of the same body 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.390
 Meet the restyled priora with 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.629
 recognizable silhouette and brand new 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.629
 salon 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.520
 one of the most important issues that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.470
 ask many buyers choosing 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.260
 car even on average price 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.600
 segment how plastic is trimmed 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.480
 interior so now in prior 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.420
 used innovative type material 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.090
 soft bow lovers expensive electronics 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.860
 he is familiar with the phone cases and other 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.930
 gadgets 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 soft bow is plastic that looks like 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.390
 how soft automotive skin is good 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.940
 however, he has increased 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.890
 Scratch resistance specifically for 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.560
 new material was developed and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.450
 original drawing embossing taiga you 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.119
 see for yourself how much 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.600
 As a result, the car interior has changed 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.160
 and of course it's hard not to notice 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.729
 7-inch multimedia touchscreen 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.310
 systems 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.880
 here everything corresponds to the highest 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.039
 level in its class is not only yusb 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.550
 port but also wireless protocol 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.950
 bluetooth 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.050
 however, it should be noted that this option 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.660
 as the maintenance of the course 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.310
 Stability and additional side 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.920
 airbags 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.170
 and here new headlights with running lights and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.780
 rear LED lights come in 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.630
 standard complete with new 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.869
 reinforced door bumpers 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.810
 and improved noise insulation sit down at 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.750
 steering wheel and adjust the driver's seat 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.660
 the seat got a more developed side 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.480
 support as well as new more reliable 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.930
 mechanism for adjustments to the right of 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.430
 the driver is located armrest 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.430
 special ergonomic shape 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.160
 Well, it's time to go to dynamic 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.160
 dough 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.740
 we start the engine and get under way 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.410
 thanks to completely recycled 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.840
 the intake system of the moment shelf expanded into 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.360
 low speed side 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.820
 conditions provides a confident start 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.650
 suddenly sharp turns steering 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.190
 control 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.820
 the fact is that the deluxe version is installed 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.760
 electromechanical amplifier and 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.880
 shortened steering rack with gear 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.120
 number 3 1 instead of four and confidently 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.460
 take the most difficult turns 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.590
 Stability system allows 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.330
 Well, for those who speed 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.640
 prefers to maneuver 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.380
 measured and comfortable designed 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.810
 cruise control system 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.120
 enough with the steering column 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.460
 switch to set the required 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.300
 speed and you can take your foot off the pedal 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.810
 gas 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.720
 irreplaceable option on long journeys yet 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.730
 I want to note that very soon should 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.580
 a manual box will appear 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.040
 shift cable-operated 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.450
 and also as relevant an option as 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.450
 preheater 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.120
 but AvtoVAZ engineer are not going to 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.460
 stop there 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.830
 some versions new lada priora 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.790
 will get more and 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.640
 robotic switch box 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.040
 programs agree that all these 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.500
 innovations significantly increase 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.280
 the pleasure of owning it 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.280
 by car
