you mind either way you get elemental
gems<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.570> water<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.960> mental<00:00:40.290> gem

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
gems so this is the water a mental gem

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.100 
gems so this is the water a mental gem
fire<00:00:41.969> elemental<00:00:42.780> gem<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.840> green

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
fire elemental gem and then the green

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
lastly is the ice elemental gem there we

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
lastly is the ice elemental gem there we
are<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.680> you've<00:01:02.010> got<00:01:02.039> four<00:01:02.430> different<00:01:02.730> types

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879

are so you've got four different types
of<00:01:03.059> gems<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.379> different

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
of gems and with this for different

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.219 
of gems and with this for different
types<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.040> gems<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:06.210> made<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.869> different

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
types of gems you can made for different

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.370 
types of gems you can made for different
sets<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.830> tools<00:01:08.040> except<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> home<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:10.049> you
