00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
was really lonely and there was a

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.700 
was really lonely and there was a
replica<00:00:24.460> of<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.820> town<00:00:25.060> in<00:00:25.570> a<00:00:25.930> snow<00:00:26.200> globe<00:00:26.350> and

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
replica of the town in a snow globe and

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.279 
replica of the town in a snow globe and
every<00:00:27.400> day<00:00:27.550> I<00:00:27.820> would<00:00:28.300> wake<00:00:28.660> up<00:00:28.690> to<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.050> snow

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
every day I would wake up to the snow

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.580 
every day I would wake up to the snow
globe<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:29.920> just<00:00:30.220> imagine<00:00:31.079> the<00:00:32.079> world<00:00:32.349> that

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
globe and just imagine the world that

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.910 
globe and just imagine the world that
exists<00:00:33.100> on<00:00:33.370> this<00:00:33.610> little<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:35.320> wasn't<00:00:35.649> very

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
exists on this little what wasn't very

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.680 
exists on this little what wasn't very
small<00:00:36.489> it<00:00:36.579> was<00:00:36.610> a<00:00:36.850> massive<00:00:37.420> snow<00:00:37.660> globe<00:00:37.930> but<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
small it was a massive snow globe but it

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.770 
small it was a massive snow globe but it
really<00:00:40.960> intrigued<00:00:41.350> my<00:00:41.560> imagination<00:00:42.340> and<00:00:42.780> I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
really intrigued my imagination and I

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.300 
really intrigued my imagination and I
wanted<00:00:44.290> to<00:00:44.730> capture<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:46.720> feelings<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.620> the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
wanted to capture the feelings and the

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.000 
wanted to capture the feelings and the
emotions<00:00:48.610> that<00:00:49.390> I<00:00:49.710> imagined<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:50.920> the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
emotions that I imagined in the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.979 
emotions that I imagined in the
relationships<00:00:51.730> that<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:51.970> imagined<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.660> was

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
relationships that I imagined that was

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.760 
relationships that I imagined that was
in<00:00:53.140> this<00:00:53.260> small<00:00:53.590> little<00:00:53.770> microcosm<00:00:54.520> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
in this small little microcosm and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.760 
in this small little microcosm and
Wonderland<00:00:56.770> was<00:00:56.980> really<00:00:57.370> about<00:00:58.469> creating<00:00:59.469> a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
Wonderland was really about creating a

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.829 
Wonderland was really about creating a
small<00:01:00.550> world<00:01:01.360> that<00:01:02.940> purely<00:01:03.940> existed<00:01:04.509> on<00:01:04.659> its

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
small world that purely existed on its

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.350 
small world that purely existed on its
own<00:01:05.049> and<00:01:05.379> it's<00:01:05.979> it's<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.490> plant<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:07.030> reason<00:01:07.270> why

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
own and it's it's a plant the reason why

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.880 
own and it's it's a plant the reason why
I<00:01:07.420> called<00:01:07.689> it<00:01:07.810> Wonderland<00:01:08.229> was<00:01:08.409> it's<00:01:08.649> a<00:01:08.710> play

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
I called it Wonderland was it's a play

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.190 
I called it Wonderland was it's a play
on<00:01:08.920> words<00:01:09.069> a<00:01:09.520> winter<00:01:09.850> wonderland<00:01:10.179> and<00:01:10.600> that's

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
on words a winter wonderland and that's

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.309 
on words a winter wonderland and that's
why<00:01:11.499> in<00:01:12.189> the<00:01:12.520> middle<00:01:12.700> of<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.969> ballet<00:01:13.319> snow

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:14.319 
why in the middle of the ballet snow

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.819 
why in the middle of the ballet snow
fall<00:01:14.560> happens<00:01:15.329> not<00:01:16.329> only<00:01:16.389> is<00:01:16.929> it<00:01:16.959> beautiful<00:01:17.409> to

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
fall happens not only is it beautiful to

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.239 
fall happens not only is it beautiful to
watch<00:01:17.950> it<00:01:18.789> was<00:01:18.999> really<00:01:19.299> about<00:01:19.389> the<00:01:19.959> the<00:01:20.770> idea

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
watch it was really about the the idea

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:22.980 
watch it was really about the the idea
of<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.609> winter<00:01:21.909> wonderland<00:01:22.509> with<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.719> snow

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
of the winter wonderland with the snow

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.980 
of the winter wonderland with the snow
globe<00:01:23.020> but<00:01:24.009> it<00:01:24.279> I<00:01:24.579> was<00:01:24.999> also<00:01:25.240> just<00:01:25.450> really

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
globe but it I was also just really

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.520 
globe but it I was also just really
intrigued<00:01:26.200> by<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.529> patterns<00:01:26.950> that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
intrigued by the patterns that

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.469 
intrigued by the patterns that
on<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.950> floor<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.760> I<00:01:28.850> used<00:01:29.119> some<00:01:29.299> of<00:01:29.420> the

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
on the floor and I used some of the

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.560 
on the floor and I used some of the
pieces<00:01:29.720> of<00:01:29.990> elements<00:01:30.440> of<00:01:30.560> my<00:01:31.299> choreography<00:01:32.299> to

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
pieces of elements of my choreography to

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.600 
pieces of elements of my choreography to
enhance<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.799> patterning<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.869> chose<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:37.159> I

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
enhance the patterning I chose to I I

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.359 
enhance the patterning I chose to I I
wanted<00:01:38.119> to<00:01:38.210> match<00:01:38.360> Philip<00:01:39.080> Glass<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:40.130> string

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
wanted to match Philip Glass the string

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.590 
wanted to match Philip Glass the string
quartet<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.290> also<00:01:42.490> metamorphosis<00:01:43.490> for<00:01:44.149> this

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
quartet and also metamorphosis for this

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.420 
quartet and also metamorphosis for this
idea<00:01:45.080> because<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:45.470> thought<00:01:45.740> it<00:01:45.830> was<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> perfect

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
idea because I thought it was a perfect

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.690 
idea because I thought it was a perfect
sort<00:01:46.670> of<00:01:46.729> match<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:47.300> was<00:01:47.960> minimal<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.490> can

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
sort of match it was minimal and you can

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.999 
sort of match it was minimal and you can
really<00:01:49.970> paint<00:01:50.240> whatever<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.350> wanted<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.680> but

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
really paint whatever you wanted to but

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.830 
really paint whatever you wanted to but
at<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.280> same<00:01:52.460> time<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:52.940> created<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.420> great

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
at the same time it created a great

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.340 
at the same time it created a great
feeling<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:55.369> really<00:01:55.820> inspired<00:01:56.299> me<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.869> create

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
feeling it really inspired me to create

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.410 
feeling it really inspired me to create
dance<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.430> think<00:01:58.640> that's<00:01:58.820> one<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.210> most

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
dance and I think that's one of the most

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.090 
dance and I think that's one of the most
important<00:01:59.899> things<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.380> choreographer

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
important things that a choreographer

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.190 
important things that a choreographer
can<00:02:01.280> do<00:02:01.490> when<00:02:02.179> they<00:02:02.270> select<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.720> piece<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:02.929> music

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
can do when they select a piece of music

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.460 
can do when they select a piece of music
is<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.490> select<00:02:05.030> music<00:02:05.300> that<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.929> think<00:02:06.200> would

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
is to select music that you think would

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.820 
is to select music that you think would
inspire<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.490> inspire<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.420> audience<00:02:08.649> but<00:02:09.649> at

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
inspire you inspire the audience but at

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.830 
inspire you inspire the audience but at
the<00:02:09.920> same<00:02:10.070> time<00:02:10.399> if<00:02:10.850> they<00:02:11.180> weren't<00:02:11.390> quite<00:02:11.690> as

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
the same time if they weren't quite as

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.320 
the same time if they weren't quite as
amused<00:02:12.650> by<00:02:12.920> your<00:02:13.250> choreography<00:02:13.970> they<00:02:14.150> can

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
amused by your choreography they can

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.390 
amused by your choreography they can
close<00:02:14.510> their<00:02:14.720> eyes<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.230> enjoy<00:02:15.500> beautiful
