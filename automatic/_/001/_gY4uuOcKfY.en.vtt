 presented and this yellow container 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.930
 a certain sense 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.369
 that will be my responsibility andy holzer 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.369

 that we have changed here now 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.210
 he already has a bit of it 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.620
 History, first, the first 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.329
 presentation they were internal 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.969
 presentation at the car park and ducati 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.829
 Terrain where you said Brender Ducati 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.320
 this is a completely new world country 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.090
 shy deer completely new brand new 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.160
 brand and we want accordingly 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.600
 express everything is possible here 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.670
 and of course you have one too 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.820
 This yellow color is shown away from red 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.190
 that one internally one has on the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.039
 in the park area of ​​ducati you have 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.730
 own world built with artificial turf with 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.350
 beach with with beach with sand and there 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.689
 get this yellow container where to the first 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.100
 times the employees have been introduced 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.810
 One then has to learn later on two 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.350
 one has then continued on the www 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.909
 in misano you think there were 60,000 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.159
 65,000 Ducati and since you first 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.990
 first look at the map shown in 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.720
 One has to get involved with these containers 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.460
 was handy for the first small one 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.860
 secret presentation especially for the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.780
 ducatisti around the company's destination board and 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.729
 as far as I know she is good 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.220
 arrived and she pretty much so today 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.950
 Well arrived to the scrambler as well 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.229
 she is with us now is one of 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.420
 four versions that's right that was 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.950
 the big surprise of this secret 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.539
 have really been able to keep a secret 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.789
 until today press conference 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.110
 Of course, one knew about everything 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.969
 a sprayer we have that too 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.829
 but the communication is forcing a little bit 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.750
 nobody knew that four sprayers 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.920
 come and they have here today 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.840
 is presented four namely 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.250
 different motorcycles 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.860
 we have four different ones 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.079
 alignments we have the hot icon 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.000
 inherit enduro that stands here 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.119
 then we have the classic is over there 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.709
 and then have five more lotter and vom 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.150
 but they are all the same 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.549
 what are they powered by 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.530
 they are doubtful of the air-cooled 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.690
 many of the legendary engine of ducati 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.220
 driven as he does not die 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.599
 air-cooled engine at ducati 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.760
 even if it is always difficult 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.709
 due to the legal provision 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.180
 that noise and what exhaust gas is concerned despite 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.160
 meanwhile a bit difficult or 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.959
 hard with the air-cooled engines 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.950
 but they work, we have it 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.549
 managed and we have here now 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.930
 practically an 803 cubic in size 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.610
 air-cooled two valves 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.739
 we think it's just the right one 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.319
 Motor is for this unique bike 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.560
 how much pain 75 ps 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.840
 the weight is sensational but we 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.079
 are here at dry around 180 kilo 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.670
 So this motorcycle is just gone 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.480
 think of these normal higher 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.100
 faster 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.600
 the motorcycles also have the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.010
 not do claus fun and the need 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.730
 We continue the creation 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.709
 tradition 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.389
 but this is really the whole thing 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.930
 reduce again to motorcycle riding 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.700
 trip 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.470
 maybe you have seen the video too 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.930
 where we used to be motorcycle riding 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.109
 just go up and where they are fun at 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.290
 bathing on the beach or anywhere else 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.060
 play football whatever we are in 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.500
 Austria and Germany less at 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.890
 beach here in germany already but 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.750
 we 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.080
 but I already notice the four 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.270
 Models are similar in any case 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.250
 One thing the sitting position seems 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.530
 totally impossible to be 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.510
 handlebar is set very high at all 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.180
 that means you really sit on it 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.160
 seems to be supermotos anyway 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.500
 a lot to have done that one way 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.480
 just how she sits on it and and 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.970
 Just have fun on the motorcycle can from 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.680
 the best is clearly nothing 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.600
 but not overwhelmed 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.239
 boring is because it is too weak more 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.430
 to the ghosts then at the price 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.730
 the big question is the big one 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:01.230
 Price question a motto of this motorcycle 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.060
 So next to maximum is synonymous 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.760
 It is said to be accessible to everyone 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.100
 be achievable and that's for sure 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.739
 special that we as ducati 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.450
 premium brand here in motorcycle have that 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.200
 that is very cheap 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.850
 it starts with the version at 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.980
 8390 euro thinks that it really is one 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.750
 class and class we have to get started 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.520
 Germany is also saying that 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.510
 but still in Austria under 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.860
 Be 10,000 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.500
 So I think it probably will 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.330
 under 10,000 no unfortunately currently the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.040
 Austrian price work but it 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.050
 is still very attractive price it 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.150
 is already a lot more under 10,000 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.880
 for such a thing I think would be now 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.860
 not necessarily overpaid to me 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.810
 Guess times granted a lot of success with the 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.550
 ducati scrambler and have many here 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.510
 thanks for the interview and like and 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.510
 all the best
