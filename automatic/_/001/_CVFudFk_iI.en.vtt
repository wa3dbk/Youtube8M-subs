00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.040
 my name is lorena 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.940
 I started about nineteen years ago 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.590
 had a track engine and then decided 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.320
 change because it was very dangerous to the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.550
 Cross my sister and I started 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.020
 accompany my dad rather and from there 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.000
 they started racing on TV 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.769
 began to draw more attention than the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.269
 motocross that was jumping and that was 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.690
 competition so many leave because 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.309
 at the same time although more intense 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.350
 I was the first woman to run 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 various skills like the hard fund 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.280
 that is done in Valle de Bravo I ran the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.489
 first 24 hours in hard that was in the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.219
 marquesa in 2011 I was runner-up 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 the southern zone and national champion and 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.880
 right now I'm good I'm like 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.880
 selected for the Latin American 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.630
 the principle is difficult first of all 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.610
 from that to the parents of the pilots 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.770
 or the pilots will come and make fun of 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.440
 suddenly in action to your orders though 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.630
 we are thrown that we collect everything so 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.310
 as half insulting I played with 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.290
 children that if it jumps we go if instead 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.659
 to jump as right of the 220 go and 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.520
 they hit me in the air and they threw me all 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:46.140
 they were realizing that I 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.140
 I got up and followed the race and I was 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.610
 of high performance then it's not like 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.200
 that the one that you go and puts you a routine without 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.330
 nothing else but the study my sport 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.490
 puts me exercises that are appropriate 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.620
 towards the bike and the terrain that I drive 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.090
 as always it is like irregular all the 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.290
 time I'm moving all to it seems that 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.910
 they do not take us accelerating but the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.040
 moving legs and this abdomen 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.190
 arms that up to the neck that's all 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.190
 do not 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.340
 these knees that are special for 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.230
 that you do not get double knees 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.760
 reverse are mechanical kneepads have 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.310
 there's like a cap system on it's 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.200
 so when anything does not bend 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.960
 upside down these booths are also 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.819
 special because they are more fat and 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.900
 so they do not break with the boots 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.700
 With everyone 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.560
 every time is special and has how are you 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.689
 skin things because the escape sometimes 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.030
 you can burn then with this you see 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.450
 as protection and has as super wide 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.209
 they are superior to the fabric because 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.310
 with the scraped motorcycle falls so you can 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.549
 break is so that it does not break and the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.290
 drops that are very important 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:58.319
 so as not to break something 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.140
 and it is the most important town that thing 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.520
 which is for the neck 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.620
 so you do not go soler that good 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.010
 this there are two types ones that go up 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.959
 of liniers and west that goes down 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.720
 I have two shoulder operations I have 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.540
 an operation of the right knee 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.490
 I have like broken fingers once like that 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.209
 I fell I was as unconscious as 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.209
 more than half an hour 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.580
 in the USA then I always like 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.650
 goals I will arrive since it is as it was 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.480
 of the world championship is the highest 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.850
 level and there are as well as huge categories 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.480
 of women and there are products then it is 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.280
 what I want to do 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.320
 last year I was running the 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.570
 national and all that and I left in April to 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.280
 train with the girls of the USA those of the 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.020
 pro category like those in the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.120
 first 'top ten' 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.220
 there is very good then wife like you 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.200
 it is very pleasant beyond and trains aÃ­to 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.360
 where then this year I had the the 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.820
 national this is fine in the 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.800
 Latin American and if you can start 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.110
 run in the usa for the next one and get there 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.030
 stronger and you can a world start 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.220
 next year then better and out there 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.940
 I also have the desire to run 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.940
 the low thousand
