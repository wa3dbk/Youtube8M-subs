00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.420
 fifty 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.580
 but 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.860
 driver December 5 my public steps 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.950
 important of this capital 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.190
 many years ago 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.880
 President of the Republic Adolfo LÃ³pez 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.990
 mateos put a seed in command issues 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.850
 Mexicans 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.040
 to present the museum 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.860
 and we found a mind 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.010
 an incredible support from the doctor mancera 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.160
 who is a fanatic and asia 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.460
 and he told us that he was willing to 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.810
 put the girl class that we have 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.810
 the obligation to do 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.409
 is an example for one of the new 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.890
 values for what you have to have a 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.890
 career 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.560
 doctor mancera 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.540
 because let's say 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.060
 the man of the people 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:00.750
 this ability that can be done 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.880
 people come when they are flattened 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.560
 way for actor and adela 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.560
 actually this tournament 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.800
 it is the dream that becomes reality 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.760
 community 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.760
 d 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.100
 the support for it is called 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.030
 all good 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.030
 by then 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.940
 ah 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.530
 and all because the people 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.780
 when there is no more 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.300
 they all left home their dream of 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.780
 can be 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.250
 of losing your skills 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.250
 we want to see the extremes 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.830
 We speak 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.830
 branson 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.520
 with this 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.069
 is the same tournament is going to take place 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.560
 It starts in 5 months to 4 July to 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.610
 December 5 the intention is that it 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.840
 closing on the socket with the grand final 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.519
 doing the amateur fights already in the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.130
 tomorrow in professional fights in the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.840
 late a great commitment to sport 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.840
 boxing it seems to me that in the city of 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.000
 Mexico has to position itself strong and 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.370
 especially that was shown above looks 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.890
 all the gyms are changing 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.980
 towards the box and the activity aside 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.690
 it is therefore far from the population 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.590
 because it is very expensive then what 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.260
 we want to do something with a lot of access 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.640
 for the people how many participants what 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.950
 categories we know you will see 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.540
 eliminatory by delegation bone that 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.209
 it comes in large 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.519
 in the amateur part there will be this 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.489
 obviously eliminatory that they 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.609
 organized for 3 or 4 days before by 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.920
 the volume of boxers then from there 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:15.040
 we have to deliver a champion 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.560
 each division male and female so that 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.940
 be delivered to the final draft so 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.130
 important is that there is this kind of 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.630
 very important initiatives very 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.810
 important as I tell you to be able to 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.030
 help the kids power that after 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.860
 the kids dedicate themselves to the school that 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.810
 it's the first thing but after they have 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.289
 another option that is sport and apart 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.060
 if they get in and they are responsible and they are 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.680
 dedicated because it will not be 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.070
 world champions and get to give it a 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.500
 tremendous turn to your family a turn for 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.870
 they too that would be formidable 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.180
 grow as people and grow I believe 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.979
 that at a good level a universe 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.840
 economic also good because the sport 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.180
 if you do well and responsibilities 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.820
 dedicated you out in the results 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.229
 for day 5 idol or chilango idol 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.229
 we will find it who are
