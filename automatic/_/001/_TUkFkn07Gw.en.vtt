00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 the best equipment at the most juicy prices from 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.430
 largest seller 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.430
 apple in ukraine apple center 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.720
 hello with you egor today i would like 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.460
 tell about not the most obvious 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 innovations as-7 which are not immediately 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.020
 striking and can stay 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.820
 undetected even after enough 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.790
 prolonged use of new 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.820
 mobile os from apple and so one of 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.110
 new features and weight 7 is 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.670
 Auto-update applications I think a lot 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.170
 mobile users up to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.150
 function will like 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.610
 but personally, I'd rather do it 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.920
 manually as before we go 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.469
 settings select itunes and appstore and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.329
 disable automatic loading cars 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.030
 updates are also sometimes very 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.980
 By the way, find out what applications are 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.840
 eat some traffic at all 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.820
 block access to the network in all 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
 there was also such an opportunity for this 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.840
 go to the settings and select cellular 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.390
 data here we see all of our 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.220
 applications and how much traffic they had 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.810
 used if necessary with 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.750
 ease overlap their opportunity 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.460
 swim network also scroll through the bottom and 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.350
 here we can see how much 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.740
 megabytes consume some 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.240
 AS-7 system services 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.520
 unpleasant news for me in ios 7 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.170
 turned out to be missing in the spotlight which 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.850
 we are so used that sometimes 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.790
 habit through it run the application 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.130
 which are on the front page but 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.560
 as it turned out the day probably rub 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.930
 using an ac-7 spotlight is nowhere 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.939
 gone just moved now for his 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.490
 start you just do svayp 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.740
 the screen from top to bottom is also a small track 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.780
 appeared application clock go 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.790
 own application tab world 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.250
 the clock is now enough to tap on 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.170
 clock image and digital display 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.630
 will change to analog 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.640
 Well, respectively, I do not know back 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.340
 I personally do not care how they look but 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.380
 I think someone can be useful to many 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.540
 complained that in ios 6 the closing process 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.039
 applications took much less time 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.289
 than in the new ios 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.030
 I do not know it seems to me that in the seven it 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.890
 it is done somewhat faster 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.510
 you have the ability to close several 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.860
 applications with one swipe for this 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.830
 just catching a few apps 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.780
 few fingers and close them not 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.970
 everyone had a taste for adding 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.130
 photo in contacts in the tab 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.600
 I personally like very much and 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.550
 it seems so much easier 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.200
 navigate the list because 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.870
 eye clings not only text but also 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.110
 images but if this is you 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.150
 innovation had not to taste 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.000
 go to the phone settings and disable 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.400
 Contact photo in my favorites 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.360
 look it turns out some kind of gunel but 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.720
 see for yourself finally in 2013 and 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.819
 semi quietly in ios 7 finally added 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.970
 innovative feature blacklist and 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.319
 so now in order to block 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.720
 go to the contact card 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.570
 and tap to block the subscriber 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.310
 I never liked that I could 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.410
 not everyone can see the time 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.269
 sent or received message 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.600
 and sometimes it was really critical 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.609
 luckily in with 7 apple gracefully decided and 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.829
 this problem is now enough to go to 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.500
 message and pull the curtain message 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.930
 from left to right 7 apple hair also 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.850
 somewhat improved the standard 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.950
 wallpaper now they're moving a little 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.140
 depending on the position of the device in 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.150
 space is also among other things 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.799
 the opportunity to put a panoramic 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.870
 battles that will move after 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.120
 the device I was often asked a question in 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.810
 lichku how to do it and therefore decided 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.870
 to show 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.109
 go to the brightness settings wallpaper choose 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.450
 wallpaper and this is important my panorama folder and 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.720
 already from here we choose what is done in advance 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.610
 photos but 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.130
 the look looks like this whole thing very much 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.950
 not bad among other things apple 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.590
 has prepared a serious competitor Viber 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.900
 namely audio freestyle calls 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.910
 to call the subscriber through 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.160
 fisting is enough to enter the card 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.070
 contact and tap on the handset icon 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.860
 You will not be opposite the line either. 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.740
 can do it directly from the messages 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.530
 tapping on contracts and and choosing from time 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.510
 also apple added a wish list and on 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.670
 ios devices now if you want 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.070
 buy some application but consider 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.720
 that the price is unreasonably high and you can 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.150
 add his wish list 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.880
 and from time to time there look in 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.040
 the price will not be reduced in my opinion this 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.050
 very convenient and practical despite 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.030
 abundance of the application that executes those 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.030
 use standard functions 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.919
 means rss for me personally somehow nicer 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.410
 something that also fell finalized 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.840
 standard compass app despite 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.700
 on poor design compass got new 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.340
 in my opinion a very useful feature 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.260
 function level is enough to put 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.180
 iphone on some surface you with 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.669
 easy to identify or robot she 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.919
 installed on a circle located in 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.830
 the middle of the screen is that it is in my opinion 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:03.040
 very convenient to this all subscribe 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.200
 put the likes on the channel 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.030
 vkontakte group follow me in 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.760
 twitter leave comments and 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:14.370

 I missed to see you soon yet
