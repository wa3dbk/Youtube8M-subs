00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
loyal under the rear of it and I'm not

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.100 
loyal under the rear of it and I'm not
sure<00:00:06.540> if<00:00:07.319> it's<00:00:07.880> motor<00:00:08.880> oil<00:00:09.150> or<00:00:09.420> hydraulic

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
sure if it's motor oil or hydraulic

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.610 
sure if it's motor oil or hydraulic
fluid

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
fluid

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.890 
fluid
I<00:00:10.650> checked<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.790> oil<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.210> machine<00:00:12.599> from

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
I checked the oil of the machine from

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.790 
I checked the oil of the machine from
the<00:00:12.990> engine<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.799> fine<00:00:15.080> so<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.230> could<00:00:16.410> be<00:00:16.440> some

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
the engine it's fine so it could be some

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.790 
the engine it's fine so it could be some
oil<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.609> spilt<00:00:17.970> over<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.690> other<00:00:19.260> side<00:00:19.590> of

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
oil that I spilt over the other side of

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.580 
oil that I spilt over the other side of
the<00:00:19.920> engine<00:00:20.130> over<00:00:20.609> here

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
the engine over here

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.300 
the engine over here
when<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.619> was<00:00:23.600> filling<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.949> kind

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
when I was filling it up that just kind

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.179 
when I was filling it up that just kind
of<00:00:26.340> making<00:00:26.519> its<00:00:26.849> way<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:27.359> here<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:28.189> other

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
of making its way out here or other

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.940 
of making its way out here or other
possibility<00:00:30.949> could<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.099> related<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:33.950> I

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
possibility could be related to this I

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.590 
possibility could be related to this I
hadn't<00:00:35.610> used<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> thing<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.210> three

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
hadn't used the thing in about three

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.040 
hadn't used the thing in about three
weeks

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
weeks

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.549 
weeks
and<00:00:38.030> my<00:00:39.030> last<00:00:39.300> checking<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> oil<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.350> about

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and my last checking the oil is about

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.540 
and my last checking the oil is about
here<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.629> it's<00:00:42.629> right<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.550> however

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
here and now it's right here however

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
here and now it's right here however
it's<00:00:45.090> probably<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.780> loss<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.770> or

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it's probably the loss of about one or

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
it's probably the loss of about one or
two<00:00:46.950> gallons<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.579> fluid<00:00:47.899> out<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
two gallons of fluid out of the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.990 
two gallons of fluid out of the
hydraulic<00:00:49.680> tank<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.899> it's<00:00:52.579> you<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
hydraulic tank there and it's you know I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.760 
hydraulic tank there and it's you know I
could<00:00:54.270> see<00:00:54.480> maybe<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.879> could<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.770> quarter

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
could see maybe that could be a quarter

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.380 
could see maybe that could be a quarter
of<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.890> gallon<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.280> fluid<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> ground<00:01:00.120> there

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
of a gallon of fluid on the ground there

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.340 
of a gallon of fluid on the ground there
but<00:01:01.079> definitely<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.640> two<00:01:02.670> gallons<00:01:03.350> so

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
but definitely not one or two gallons so

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.890 
but definitely not one or two gallons so
what<00:01:05.309> sounds<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.790> may<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.180> happened<00:01:06.360> is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
what sounds like may have happened is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.260 
what sounds like may have happened is
one<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> drive<00:01:08.130> motor<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.610> leaking<00:01:09.030> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
one of the drive motor is leaking and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.330 
one of the drive motor is leaking and
it's<00:01:09.780> all<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.290> into<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> chain<00:01:10.860> case<00:01:11.869> so

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
it's all going into the chain case so

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.020 
it's all going into the chain case so
I'm<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.549> take<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.119> garage<00:01:16.009> and

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
I'm going to take you to the garage and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.100 
I'm going to take you to the garage and
then<00:01:18.650> leave<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> cab<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.150> tilt<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.869> boom

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
then leave the cab up and tilt the boom

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.560 
then leave the cab up and tilt the boom
up<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.409> lock<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.420> work

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
up and lock it and then just get to work

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.440 
up and lock it and then just get to work
on<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.840> I'm<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.070> start<00:01:26.670> off<00:01:26.850> by<00:01:26.880> moving<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
on it I'm going to start off by moving a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.810 
on it I'm going to start off by moving a
bolt<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:29.780> around<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:32.430> goes<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
bolt I think is around here that goes to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.969 
bolt I think is around here that goes to
the<00:01:33.060> chain<00:01:33.270> case<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.619> bunch<00:01:34.860> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the chain case and if I get a bunch of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.590 
the chain case and if I get a bunch of
fluid<00:01:35.130> coming<00:01:35.400> out<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.790> there<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.299> over

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
fluid coming out of there then it's over

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530 
fluid coming out of there then it's over
full<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.740> will<00:01:37.979> explain<00:01:38.610> where<00:01:39.270> all

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
full and that will explain where all

00:01:39.540 --> 00:02:52.130 
full and that will explain where all
this<00:01:40.470> hydraulic<00:01:40.920> fluid<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> be

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.960 

all<00:02:53.140> right<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.590> know<00:02:53.860> Jesus<00:02:54.220> locking<00:02:54.670> forth

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
all right so I know Jesus locking forth

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.339 
all right so I know Jesus locking forth
I<00:02:55.120> kinda<00:02:55.360> had<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.510> figure<00:02:55.750> out<00:02:55.930> how<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.110> works

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
I kinda had to figure out how it works

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.910 
I kinda had to figure out how it works
but<00:02:57.010> um<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.720> think<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> lock<00:02:59.470> anyway<00:02:59.860> it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
but um I think this is a lock anyway it

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.839 
but um I think this is a lock anyway it
sure<00:03:00.129> looks<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.430> it

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
sure looks like it

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.910 
sure looks like it
it<00:03:01.420> normally<00:03:01.810> goes<00:03:01.840> up<00:03:02.170> here<00:03:02.379> with<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.650> pin

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
it normally goes up here with this pin

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.089 
it normally goes up here with this pin
running<00:03:03.220> through<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.489> hole<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:05.010> when<00:03:06.010> you

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
running through this hole and when you

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.490 
running through this hole and when you
bring<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.310> down<00:03:06.459> here<00:03:06.970> see<00:03:07.930> how<00:03:08.140> much<00:03:08.260> height

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
bring it down here see how much height

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.380 
bring it down here see how much height
up<00:03:08.739> there<00:03:08.950> when<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.310> bring<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.610> down<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:10.090> pull

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
up there when you bring it down you pull

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.600 
up there when you bring it down you pull
it<00:03:10.510> out<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.920> spring<00:03:12.190> pulls<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.580> back

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
it out and the spring pulls it back

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.190 
it out and the spring pulls it back
against<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.269> cylinder<00:03:13.660> here<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:13.900> then<00:03:14.080> I

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
against the cylinder here and then I

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.449 
against the cylinder here and then I
guess<00:03:14.349> I<00:03:14.530> just<00:03:14.560> put<00:03:14.860> this<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.130> here<00:03:15.160> because

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
guess I just put this in here because

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.330 
guess I just put this in here because
you<00:03:15.940> know<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.510> would<00:03:16.660> hold<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.019> if<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.349> popped

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
you know that would hold it if it popped

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.690 
you know that would hold it if it popped

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
under here just for support temporarily

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.500 
under here just for support temporarily
is<00:03:33.130> especially<00:03:33.459> without<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.030> bucket<00:03:34.390> on

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
is especially without the bucket on

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.960 
is especially without the bucket on
there<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.110> machine<00:03:36.040> can<00:03:36.220> get<00:03:36.340> kind<00:03:36.579> of<00:03:36.640> tippy

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
there the machine can get kind of tippy

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.240 
there the machine can get kind of tippy
but<00:03:37.690> on<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.200> garage<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.650> all<00:03:38.799> cleaned<00:03:39.040> up<00:03:39.190> now

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
but on the garage is all cleaned up now

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.729 
but on the garage is all cleaned up now
so<00:03:39.989> should<00:03:40.989> these<00:03:41.140> have<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.319> good<00:03:41.530> place<00:03:41.709> to

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
so should these have a good place to

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.240 
so should these have a good place to
work<00:03:42.040> on<00:03:42.190> here<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:44.349> here's<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.860> front<00:03:45.099> of<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
work on here so here's the front of the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.630 
work on here so here's the front of the
machine<00:03:45.579> and<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:47.560> have<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.010> feeling<00:03:48.400> this<00:03:48.459> is

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
machine and I have a feeling this is

00:03:48.640 --> 00:04:14.030 
machine and I have a feeling this is
little<00:03:48.910> plugs<00:03:49.180> everybody<00:03:49.660> talks<00:03:49.930> about<00:03:50.079> here

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.520 

and<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.670> looks<00:04:15.880> like<00:04:16.739> yeah<00:04:17.739> it'll<00:04:18.190> just<00:04:18.370> be<00:04:18.549> a

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
and it looks like yeah it'll just be a

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.960 
and it looks like yeah it'll just be a
half-inch<00:04:20.530> socket<00:04:21.070> wrench<00:04:21.400> will<00:04:21.579> go<00:04:21.700> in<00:04:21.820> there

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
half-inch socket wrench will go in there

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.850 
half-inch socket wrench will go in there
so<00:04:22.210> maybe<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.570> wrench<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.050> I'll<00:04:23.229> pull<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.680> out

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
so maybe the wrench and I'll pull it out

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.560 
so maybe the wrench and I'll pull it out
and<00:04:24.070> probably<00:04:24.910> watch<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.180> whole<00:04:25.300> bunch<00:04:25.479> of

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
and probably watch a whole bunch of

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.350 
and probably watch a whole bunch of
fluid<00:04:25.750> I'm<00:04:26.110> pulling<00:04:26.410> out<00:04:26.500> of<00:04:26.560> there<00:04:27.360> alright

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
fluid I'm pulling out of there alright

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.420 
fluid I'm pulling out of there alright

so<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.460> mean<00:05:07.880> looking<00:05:08.270> at<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.450> thing<00:05:08.660> here<00:05:08.990> dis

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
so I mean looking at the thing here dis

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.790 
so I mean looking at the thing here dis
from<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:14.690> know<00:05:14.810> what<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.050> can<00:05:15.320> tell<00:05:15.500> I<00:05:15.560> don't

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
from you know what I can tell I don't

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.220 
from you know what I can tell I don't
see<00:05:16.190> much<00:05:16.460> in<00:05:17.110> terms<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.380> a<00:05:18.470> week<00:05:20.080> it's<00:05:21.080> a

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
see much in terms of a week it's a

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:28.480 
see much in terms of a week it's a
little<00:05:21.530> damp<00:05:21.770> back<00:05:22.130> over<00:05:22.490> here<00:05:22.850> I<00:05:27.190> don't<00:05:28.190> know

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
little damp back over here I don't know

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.040 
little damp back over here I don't know
if<00:05:28.580> that<00:05:28.760> could<00:05:28.940> be<00:05:29.090> one<00:05:29.270> of<00:05:29.390> these<00:05:29.540> fittings

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
if that could be one of these fittings

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.550 
if that could be one of these fittings
I'd<00:05:30.830> assume<00:05:31.340> this<00:05:31.580> is<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:32.320> hydraulic<00:05:33.320> pump

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
I'd assume this is the hydraulic pump

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.950 
I'd assume this is the hydraulic pump
right<00:05:33.800> here<00:05:36.010> but<00:05:37.010> now<00:05:37.760> this<00:05:38.060> everything<00:05:38.780> looks

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
right here but now this everything looks

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.230 
right here but now this everything looks
pretty<00:05:39.140> dry<00:05:39.520> now<00:05:40.520> this<00:05:40.790> one<00:05:41.000> here<00:05:41.210> is<00:05:41.270> wet<00:05:43.180> so<00:05:44.180> I

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
pretty dry now this one here is wet so I

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.140 
pretty dry now this one here is wet so I
wonder<00:05:44.600> if<00:05:44.630> maybe<00:05:44.960> this<00:05:45.290> filter<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.940> filter

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
wonder if maybe this filter the filter

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.760 
wonder if maybe this filter the filter
out<00:05:47.450> what<00:05:47.479> that<00:05:47.960> thing<00:05:48.169> is<00:05:48.200> are<00:05:48.530> water

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
out what that thing is are water

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.000 
out what that thing is are water
separate<00:05:49.280> or<00:05:49.430> something

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
separate or something

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.680 
separate or something
if<00:05:52.010> this<00:05:52.310> hose<00:05:52.550> is<00:05:52.580> that<00:05:52.970> you<00:05:53.150> may<00:05:53.300> because

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
if this hose is that you may because

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.749 
if this hose is that you may because
that<00:05:53.930> looks

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.399 

yeah<00:05:57.759> see<00:05:57.970> that's<00:05:58.180> got<00:05:58.389> food<00:05:58.690> on<00:05:58.870> your<00:05:59.020> side<00:05:59.379> of

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
yeah see that's got food on your side of

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.840 
yeah see that's got food on your side of
it

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.810 

hmm
