00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.650
 chemical point com 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 today we show you 100 g of gallium 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.150
 melted that will be poured into this b 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.150
 al glass 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:53.199
 ok now just the time to pour and there 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:56.769
 get back up here we are again 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:00.309
 we have finished storing the melted gallium 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.640
 which has now solidified into the new 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.799
 glass way a date that was previously in 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.409
 plastic containers with which 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.890
 had arrived we chose from 12 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:16.060
 grams of melted rennet and a gram e 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.990
 half at the bottom already ready for 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 to be sold 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.520
 so in total we have 100 1.60 grams 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.030
 if we want to put it this way the rooster 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.159
 yet at 99 99 percent we look 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.180
 we know its metallic feature 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.220
 its brightness because it is the rooster is a 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.040
 speaks for all purposes 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.590
 instead we go to see what we 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.909
 we still have a lot of difficulty 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.850
 that is created the pellets of roosters that is the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.700
 gallium spheres here they are a lot 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.820
 as bright as petroleum 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.780
 obviously, however, they can be dissolved 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:05.789
 in hand for simple heating 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.090
 obviously you always have to use 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.950
 always use quanta from the staff of 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.540
