 and I 'm going to use this time 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.450
 gross 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.150
 to be able to raise about let's 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.740
 use our iron for clothes 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.729
 there are plates to melt but the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.020
 clothe does not serve Belgians well printed 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.640
 silicone guns 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.090
 let's take our foami sheet 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.230
 let's fold it in half and let's 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.239
 mark our heart 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.400
 from the edge in the middle which is what 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.790
 is folded there will start our 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.790
 heart 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.410
 and also the terminal once it's 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.590
 there we are going to cut them 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.569
 [Music] 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.180
 since it is clipped we will use 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.769
 this as a mold that our foami 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.390
 that is in the feeling of it 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.709
 size 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.510
 remember that we are going to use it sideways 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.709
 had sent down to be 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.709
 mark correctly 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.730
 I arrived are cut our two 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.190
 hearts 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.290
 let's take our base which is a 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.280
 sirloin can be anything a 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.590
 board a wood 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.720
 and we are going to put of its form we are going to 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.280
 use our iron and let's 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.350
 take advantage of the foam and having 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.810
 careful not to repeat it we have to 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.510
 put an average temperature that is 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.270
 hot and that the vomit gives a way 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.800
 circular and with our water we are going to 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:50.659
 help him to a barÃ§a that by that way 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:50.659
 [Music] 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.400
 as our form heats up it 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.200
 becomes more manageable then with a 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.060
 pot let's start spinning 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:08.830
 if I make deeper 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.830
 [Music] 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.239
 and we are going to do exactly the same with 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.639
 our two hearts 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.750
 our two hearts or blocked go 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.750
 to stay with day 2 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:31.190
 and they are leaving their hands fed 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.140
 inside by the shore without you 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.590
 I confessed so they do not stain our 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.590
 folic 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.629
 since we finished pasting our one 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.430
 in your heart we are going to leave a space 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.219
 which is where they are going to introduce 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.699
 our bags and with our with 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:52.399
 our black let's put a little bit 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.610
 and as far from both sides as 

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:56.689
 you can see there are some accounts on the outside 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.550
 then with the scissors we are going to 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.720
 cut them out and give them the shape of 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.190
 heart so you do not notice 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.760
 [Music] 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.720

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.180
 our heart that I body inside 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.120
 and then we can introduce our 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.820
 candy or they can commit sponge or 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.250
 known as stuffing to put it by 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.230
 from twitter as a pad so that 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.310
 get bulky and we can give away the 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.490
 children we can write 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.110

 [Music] 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.610
 and also the smallest hearts and 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.710
 we can create a tree in cables 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.530
 little ducks give them as pendants or 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.080
 keychains 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.080
 [Applause]

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.230
