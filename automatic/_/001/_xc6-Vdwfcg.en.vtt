00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
performance for your tackle is making

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.039 
performance for your tackle is making
sure<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.740> use<00:00:10.830> fresh<00:00:11.400> line<00:00:11.840> absolutely<00:00:12.840> Steve

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049

sure you use fresh line absolutely Steve
and<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.320> think<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.980> key<00:00:14.219> mistakes<00:00:14.969> that

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
and I think one of the key mistakes that

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.730 
and I think one of the key mistakes that
most<00:00:15.269> people<00:00:15.570> make<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.870> not<00:00:15.900> putting<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> line

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
most people make is not putting the line

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.500 
most people make is not putting the line
on<00:00:16.949> correctly<00:00:17.369> which<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.850> turn<00:00:18.029> into<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.330> real

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
on correctly which can turn into a real

Jim<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.740> use<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.460> start<00:00:32.730> by<00:00:32.820> running<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
Jim and I use we start by running the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.330 
Jim and I use we start by running the
tag<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.630> through<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> bottom<00:00:34.320> guide<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.010> then

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
tag in through the bottom guide and then

tag in through the bottom guide and then
we<00:00:35.430> go<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> arbor<00:00:36.000> knot<00:00:36.120> yes<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.870> I've

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
we go to the arbor knot yes and I've

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.780 
we go to the arbor knot yes and I've
already<00:00:37.079> tired<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.530> tag<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:38.040> which<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.460> a

already tired a tag in which is just a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.630 
already tired a tag in which is just a
simple<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.780> slip<00:00:40.200> knot<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> end<00:00:40.800> overhand

you know a lot of anglers like to stick
that<00:01:00.570> screwdriver<00:01:00.930> through<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> middle<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that screwdriver through the middle and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.460 
that screwdriver through the middle and
then<00:01:02.250> pull<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.699> line<00:01:02.879> off<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.539> that's<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.199> big

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
then pull the line off here that's a big

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.080 
then pull the line off here that's a big

off the face of the spool so that the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030 
off the face of the spool so that the
rotation<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> spool<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.650> spinning

rotation of the spool on the spinning

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.880 
rotation of the spool on the spinning
reel<00:01:14.189> actually<00:01:15.030> matches<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.540> coils<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.439> they

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
reel actually matches the coils as they

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.370 
reel actually matches the coils as they
fall<00:01:17.130> off<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.670> spool<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.270> what<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.140> does

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
fall off of the spool and what that does

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
fall off of the spool and what that does
if<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.860> watch<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.850> there's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
if you watch you can see there's

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.840 
if you watch you can see there's
actually<00:01:21.990> loops<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.740> come<00:01:23.009> off<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
actually loops that come off and the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.550 
actually loops that come off and the
loops<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.240> come<00:01:24.450> off<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> reel<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
loops they come off go on the reel the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
loops they come off go on the reel the
same<00:01:25.799> way<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.310> helps<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> avoid<00:01:26.909> line<00:01:27.240> twists

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
same way it helps you avoid line twists

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.660 
same way it helps you avoid line twists
you'll<00:01:28.619> notice<00:01:28.950> too<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.369> using

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you'll notice too that I'm using

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.179 
you'll notice too that I'm using
pressure<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.420> my<00:01:30.540> hand<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.920> put<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
pressure for my hand up here to put the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.270 
pressure for my hand up here to put the
line<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.790> very<00:01:33.479> tight<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.829> you're<00:01:34.979> running

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
line on very tight and if you're running
