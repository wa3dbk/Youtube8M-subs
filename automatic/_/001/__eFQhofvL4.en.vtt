00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.199 
in the living room or whether you're
playing<00:01:54.810> alone<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.759> something

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
playing alone so I think that something

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:58.580 
playing alone so I think that something
for<00:01:57.390> everyone<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.110> excited<00:01:58.200> about

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
for everyone to get really excited about

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
for everyone to get really excited about
for<00:01:59.340> me<00:01:59.459> I<00:01:59.489> think<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.909> first<00:02:00.179> thing<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
for me I think the first thing that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.789 
for me I think the first thing that
attracted<00:02:00.810> me<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.079> gamepad<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.649> about

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
attracted me with the gamepad it's about

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.770 
attracted me with the gamepad it's about
learning<00:02:02.039> a<00:02:02.189> new<00:02:02.310> skill<00:02:02.459> and<00:02:03.270> that's<00:02:03.539> what

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
learning a new skill and that's what
