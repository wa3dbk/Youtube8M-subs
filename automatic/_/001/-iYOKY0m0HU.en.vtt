to work now I'm going to show you how to

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.180 
to work now I'm going to show you how to
draw<00:00:38.449> a<00:00:38.480> transition<00:00:39.019> you<00:00:39.679> remember<00:00:39.980> in<00:00:40.069> school

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
draw a transition you remember in school

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.739 
draw a transition you remember in school
when<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:40.550> pulled<00:00:40.819> out<00:00:40.909> that<00:00:41.120> compass<00:00:41.510> and

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:41.749 
when you pulled out that compass and

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:43.660 
when you pulled out that compass and
played<00:00:42.319> around<00:00:42.499> with<00:00:42.620> on<00:00:42.859> paper<00:00:43.039> we're<00:00:43.640> going

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
played around with on paper we're going

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.419 
played around with on paper we're going
to<00:00:43.850> do<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:43.969> seven<00:00:44.390> foot<00:00:44.600> six<00:00:45.019> inch<00:00:45.289> version<00:00:46.159> of<00:00:46.309> a

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
to do a seven foot six inch version of a

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.090 
to do a seven foot six inch version of a
compass<00:00:47.409> this<00:00:48.409> is<00:00:48.530> what<00:00:48.649> we're<00:00:48.739> going<00:00:48.859> to<00:00:48.920> use

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
compass this is what we're going to use

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.649 
compass this is what we're going to use
to<00:00:49.219> create<00:00:49.429> our<00:00:49.519> transition<00:00:50.149> this<00:00:50.420> piece

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
to create our transition this piece

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.989 
to create our transition this piece
right<00:00:50.870> here<00:00:50.929> is<00:00:51.289> going<00:00:52.249> to<00:00:52.370> actually<00:00:52.519> be<00:00:52.729> the

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
right here is going to actually be the

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.259 
right here is going to actually be the
transition<00:00:53.629> when<00:00:54.559> we<00:00:54.679> take<00:00:54.889> it<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.129> four<00:00:55.429> if

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
transition when we take it to four if

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.149 
transition when we take it to four if
that's<00:00:56.989> where<00:00:57.170> your<00:00:57.379> ramp<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.889> going<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.069> be

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
that's where your ramp is going to be

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.219 
that's where your ramp is going to be
built<00:00:58.339> at<00:00:58.489> four<00:00:58.699> foot<00:00:58.969> that's<00:00:59.719> your<00:00:59.929> stopping

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
built at four foot that's your stopping

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.379 
built at four foot that's your stopping
point<00:01:00.499> we're<00:01:01.429> going<00:01:01.609> to<00:01:01.670> have<00:01:01.789> to<00:01:01.879> go<00:01:01.969> to<00:01:02.030> six

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:02.389 
point we're going to have to go to six

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:04.869 
point we're going to have to go to six
so<00:01:02.809> we're<00:01:02.959> using<00:01:03.139> a<00:01:03.260> scrap<00:01:03.589> piece<00:01:03.829> up<00:01:04.129> here<00:01:04.159> so

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
so we're using a scrap piece up here so

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.819 
so we're using a scrap piece up here so
we<00:01:04.940> can<00:01:05.089> add<00:01:05.360> two<00:01:05.690> foot<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.350> make<00:01:06.530> our<00:01:06.680> two

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
we can add two foot and make our two

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.700 
we can add two foot and make our two
foot<00:01:07.009> extension<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:08.750> piece<00:01:09.020> right<00:01:09.229> here<00:01:09.289> is

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
foot extension this piece right here is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.550 
foot extension this piece right here is
where<00:01:10.520> our<00:01:10.549> 2x4<00:01:11.240> is<00:01:11.360> mounted<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.020> we<00:01:12.469> can

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
where our 2x4 is mounted so we can

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.260 
where our 2x4 is mounted so we can
create<00:01:12.770> our<00:01:12.950> compass<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:13.759> now<00:01:13.909> we're<00:01:14.060> going<00:01:14.180> to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
create our compass so now we're going to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.490 
create our compass so now we're going to
put<00:01:14.390> all<00:01:14.509> this<00:01:14.630> stuff<00:01:14.689> together<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.259> I'm

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
put all this stuff together and I'm

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.600 
put all this stuff together and I'm
going<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:15.680> show<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:15.920> where<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.130> put<00:01:16.310> your<00:01:16.399> arm

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
going to show you where to put your arm

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.429 
going to show you where to put your arm
so<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:16.880> can<00:01:16.969> swing<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.719> create<00:01:18.380> your

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
so you can swing it and create your

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.580 
so you can swing it and create your
transition<00:01:22.750> this<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:23.899> where<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.140> transition

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
transition this is where the transition

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.920 
transition this is where the transition
is<00:01:24.680> going<00:01:24.799> to<00:01:24.859> meet<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.009> flat<00:01:25.310> bottom

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
is going to meet the flat bottom

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.639 
is going to meet the flat bottom
eventually<00:01:26.930> we're<00:01:27.020> going<00:01:27.109> to<00:01:27.170> measure<00:01:27.350> up

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
eventually we're going to measure up

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.920 
eventually we're going to measure up
seven<00:01:28.159> foot<00:01:28.369> six<00:01:28.640> inches<00:01:28.969> that's<00:01:29.630> what<00:01:29.810> we're

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
seven foot six inches that's what we're

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.389 
seven foot six inches that's what we're
going<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:30.079> put<00:01:30.229> our<00:01:30.380> screw<00:01:35.799> so<00:01:36.799> right<00:01:36.950> now<00:01:37.100> I'm

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
going to put our screw so right now I'm

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.399 
going to put our screw so right now I'm
marking<00:01:37.909> out<00:01:38.030> my<00:01:38.179> number<00:01:38.240> for<00:01:38.750> my<00:01:38.869> height<00:01:39.170> of

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
marking out my number for my height of

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.069 
marking out my number for my height of
the<00:01:39.469> marm<00:01:39.649> ramp<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:41.149> want<00:01:41.299> a<00:01:41.329> full<00:01:41.539> two<00:01:41.750> inches

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
the marm ramp you want a full two inches

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.709 
the marm ramp you want a full two inches
under<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:43.009> actual<00:01:43.280> six<00:01:43.609> foot<00:01:43.880> because<00:01:44.600> you

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
under the actual six foot because you

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.260 
under the actual six foot because you
have<00:01:44.810> coping<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.469> plywood<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.820> deck<00:01:47.030> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:50.950 
has to go on so now basically we've
created<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.700> square<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.329> that's<00:01:50.630> going<00:01:50.899> to

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
created a square and that's going to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.749 
created a square and that's going to
give<00:01:51.109> us<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.439> points<00:01:51.740> we<00:01:51.859> need<00:01:52.039> to<00:01:52.399> swing<00:01:52.640> our

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
give us the points we need to swing our

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.389 
give us the points we need to swing our
compass<00:01:53.320> all<00:01:54.320> right<00:01:54.469> right<00:01:54.979> now<00:01:55.130> what<00:01:55.310> I'm

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
compass all right right now what I'm

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.039 
compass all right right now what I'm
doing<00:01:55.429> is<00:01:55.789> I'm<00:01:55.909> popping<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.329> line<00:01:56.570> for<00:01:56.929> my

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
doing is I'm popping a line for my

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.230 
doing is I'm popping a line for my
transition<00:01:57.590> number<00:01:58.340> which<00:01:58.579> is<00:01:58.759> seven<00:01:59.060> foot

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
transition number which is seven foot

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.809 
transition number which is seven foot
six<00:01:59.270> inches<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:00.649> this<00:02:00.770> 2x4<00:02:01.189> is<00:02:01.520> going<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.729> be

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
six inches so this 2x4 is going to be

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.700 
six inches so this 2x4 is going to be
our<00:02:01.939> compass<00:02:02.299> arm<00:02:02.479> we're<00:02:03.170> going<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.350> mark<00:02:03.619> it

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
our compass arm we're going to mark it

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.889 
our compass arm we're going to mark it
seven<00:02:04.130> foot<00:02:04.310> six<00:02:04.340> inches<00:02:04.939> and<00:02:05.179> that's<00:02:05.630> where<00:02:05.869> I

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
seven foot six inches and that's where I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.139 
seven foot six inches and that's where I
put<00:02:06.109> my<00:02:06.289> screw<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.189> I<00:02:07.219> can<00:02:07.399> swing<00:02:07.700> my<00:02:07.729> arm<00:02:08.030> and

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
put my screw so I can swing my arm and

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.210 
put my screw so I can swing my arm and
make<00:02:08.300> our

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
make our

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.010 
make our
now<00:02:10.220> we're<00:02:10.340> going<00:02:10.430> to<00:02:10.490> put<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.789> on<00:02:10.880> our<00:02:11.020> giant

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
now we're going to put it on our giant

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.900 
now we're going to put it on our giant
piece<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.290> paper<00:02:12.440> here<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:12.860> figure<00:02:13.610> out<00:02:13.640> where

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
piece of paper here and figure out where

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.180 
piece of paper here and figure out where
we're<00:02:14.000> going<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.180> swing<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.070> where

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
we're going to swing it so this is where

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.250 
we're going to swing it so this is where
our<00:02:16.220> preparation<00:02:16.910> pays<00:02:17.150> off<00:02:17.390> we're<00:02:18.050> going<00:02:18.170> to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
our preparation pays off we're going to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.320 
our preparation pays off we're going to
take<00:02:18.350> our<00:02:18.500> pencil<00:02:18.740> put<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.730> against<00:02:19.910> our<00:02:20.030> swing

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
take our pencil put it against our swing

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:30.370 
take our pencil put it against our swing
arm<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.750> draw<00:02:21.290> our<00:02:21.410> transition<00:02:29.140> now<00:02:30.140> if

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
arm and draw our transition now if

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.750 
arm and draw our transition now if
you're<00:02:30.500> just<00:02:30.680> doing<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.980> 4-foot<00:02:31.310> quarter<00:02:31.610> pipe

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
you're just doing a 4-foot quarter pipe

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.090 
you're just doing a 4-foot quarter pipe
you<00:02:32.000> can<00:02:32.030> stop<00:02:32.420> right<00:02:32.600> here<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.680> since<00:02:33.860> we're

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
you can stop right here so since we're

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.560 
you can stop right here so since we're
going<00:02:34.220> six<00:02:34.610> feet<00:02:34.850> we're<00:02:35.180> going<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.360> go<00:02:35.480> up

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
going six feet we're going to go up

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:44.160 
going six feet we're going to go up
another<00:02:35.810> two<00:02:36.080> feet<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.709> top<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.950> our<00:02:37.130> ramp

we're<00:02:55.010> going<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.190> cut<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.459> off<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:57.320> can<00:02:57.530> move

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
we're going to cut it off you can move

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.640 
we're going to cut it off you can move
your<00:02:57.860> ramp<00:02:58.100> without<00:02:58.280> breaking<00:02:58.910> all<00:02:59.030> this<00:02:59.209> off

we've measured it out and we want to put

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.970 
we've measured it out and we want to put
our<00:03:02.120> stud<00:03:02.390> on<00:03:02.600> an<00:03:02.780> 80<00:03:02.989> inch<00:03:03.200> mark<00:03:03.500> which<00:03:03.709> is<00:03:03.860> our

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
square come out like that we're going to

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.530 
square come out like that we're going to
cut<00:03:26.360> this<00:03:26.570> out<00:03:26.810> drag<00:03:27.799> this<00:03:28.010> piece<00:03:28.280> on<00:03:28.519> trace<00:03:29.299> it

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
cut this out drag this piece on trace it

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.979 
cut this out drag this piece on trace it
cut<00:03:30.530> them<00:03:30.620> both<00:03:30.799> out<00:03:31.120> put<00:03:32.120> our<00:03:32.239> studs<00:03:32.510> on<00:03:32.720> and

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
cut them both out put our studs on and

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.190 
cut them both out put our studs on and
attach<00:03:33.380> our<00:03:33.680> top<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.100> our<00:03:34.190> bottom<00:03:35.200> we've

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
attach our top to our bottom we've

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.600 
attach our top to our bottom we've
traced<00:03:36.440> out<00:03:36.620> our<00:03:36.739> notch<00:03:36.890> now<00:03:37.340> I'm<00:03:37.430> going<00:03:37.549> to

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
traced out our notch now I'm going to

00:03:37.610 --> 00:04:00.070 
traced out our notch now I'm going to
cut<00:03:37.700> it<00:03:37.790> up

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.050 

so<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.170> need<00:04:01.320> two<00:04:01.590> templates<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.730> make<00:04:02.850> one

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
so you need two templates to make one

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.210 
so you need two templates to make one
transition<00:04:03.510> if<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.290> do<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:04.500> right<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:05.040> can

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
transition if you do it right you can

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:26.780 
transition if you do it right you can
get<00:04:05.310> two<00:04:05.520> out<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.700> one<00:04:05.940> sheet<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.240> plywood

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.490 

that's<00:04:27.790> template<00:04:28.120> too<00:04:28.330> now<00:04:29.050> we<00:04:29.110> need<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.350> cut

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
that's template too now we need to cut

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.080
