00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.380 
I hit back when I was in fear actually
on<00:03:27.290> this<00:03:27.440> map<00:03:27.680> too<00:03:27.950> but<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.490> was<00:03:28.610> split<00:03:28.970> that's

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
on this map too but it was split that's

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.510 
on this map too but it was split that's
the<00:03:29.870> reason<00:03:30.230> why<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.410> don't<00:03:30.680> count<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.040> as<00:03:31.220> I

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
the reason why I don't count it as I

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.660 
the reason why I don't count it as I
guess<00:03:32.240> the<00:03:33.230> clip<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.710> want<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.980> actual<00:03:34.340> clean

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
guess the clip I want the actual clean

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.030 
guess the clip I want the actual clean
clip<00:03:35.120> so<00:03:35.330> it<00:03:35.450> looks<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:35.870> crazy<00:03:36.170> looking<00:03:36.740> like<00:03:36.890> I

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
clip so it looks so crazy looking like I

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.250 
clip so it looks so crazy looking like I

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
where you kind of hit a streak before

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.360 
where you kind of hit a streak before

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:55.810 
and then out of nowhere it's just like
