00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
with them and I guess that's it all

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.709 
with them and I guess that's it all
right<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.230> eating<00:03:14.530> part<00:03:14.709> now<00:03:15.719> basically

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:16.719 
right so the eating part now basically

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:19.670 
right so the eating part now basically
you<00:03:17.139> take<00:03:17.319> out<00:03:17.500> your<00:03:17.620> pan<00:03:17.859> like<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.419> you<00:03:19.419> know

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
you take out your pan like that you know

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.390 
you take out your pan like that you know
open<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.769> up<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:22.569> and<00:03:23.379> it's<00:03:23.680> pretty<00:03:23.979> hot

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
open it up this and it's pretty hot

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.080 
open it up this and it's pretty hot
right<00:03:24.609> now<00:03:25.560> take<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.739> out<00:03:26.859> let's<00:03:27.310> start<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:27.909> the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
right now take it out let's start on the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.390 
right now take it out let's start on the
I<00:03:28.329> guess<00:03:29.049> it's<00:03:29.229> the<00:03:29.349> seal<00:03:30.359> like<00:03:31.359> that<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:32.400> take

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
I guess it's the seal like that and take

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.649 
I guess it's the seal like that and take
your<00:03:34.500> plan<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:36.159> you<00:03:36.280> run<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.609> into<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:37.209> that's

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
your plan and you run it into the that's

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.330 
your plan and you run it into the that's
the<00:03:37.900> juice<00:03:38.139> by<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.409> way<00:03:38.620> that's<00:03:38.799> left<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.189> that

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
the juice by the way that's left in that

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.360 
the juice by the way that's left in that
in<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.239> pot<00:03:40.449> and<00:03:40.629> then<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.439> are<00:03:41.799> ready<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.340> eat

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370
