hooked<00:01:08.729> onto<00:01:08.940> there<00:01:09.979> that's<00:01:10.979> all<00:01:11.130> there<00:01:11.280> was

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
hooked onto there that's all there was

hooked onto there that's all there was
here's<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> roll<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.530> Czech<00:01:13.740> wire<00:01:13.979> looks

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
here's what a roll of Czech wire looks

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.170 
here's what a roll of Czech wire looks
like<00:01:16.130> if<00:01:17.630> I'm<00:01:18.630> guessing<00:01:19.110> there's<00:01:19.290> about<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
like if I'm guessing there's about a

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.270 
like if I'm guessing there's about a
eighth<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.510> a<00:01:21.600> mile<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.110> wire<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:22.890> give

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
eighth of a mile of wire on there give

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.899 
eighth of a mile of wire on there give
or<00:01:23.400> take

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
or take

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.410 
or take
there's<00:01:24.690> different<00:01:25.229> sizes<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:27.240> would

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
there's different sizes and that would

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.830 
there's different sizes and that would
fit<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.900> planner<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:31.770> unroll<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.720> when<00:01:33.720> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
fit on the planner to unroll it when you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.530 
fit on the planner to unroll it when you
start<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.830> then<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.159> roll<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.060> you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
start and then to roll it back up you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.170 
start and then to roll it back up you
put<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.799> there<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.549> planner<00:01:39.000> will

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
put it on there and the planner will

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.710 
put it on there and the planner will
roll<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:41.240> here's<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.450> planner

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
roll it up for you here's the planner

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.800 
roll it up for you here's the planner
that<00:01:43.080> we<00:01:43.170> used<00:01:43.500> at<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.790> show<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.330> plan<00:01:45.570> it's

that we used at the show to plan it's

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.350 
that we used at the show to plan it's

think in the late 40s early 50s it's a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.630

first time through the field and then

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.030 
first time through the field and then
you<00:02:28.400> can<00:02:28.580> use<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.910> same<00:02:29.290> same<00:02:30.290> mechanism<00:02:30.950> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
you can use the same same mechanism the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.530 
you can use the same same mechanism the
rolls<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.459> back<00:02:31.640> up<00:02:31.850> when<00:02:32.030> you've<00:02:32.209> done<00:02:32.360> with

rolls to back up when you've done with

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.010 
rolls to back up when you've done with
the<00:02:32.660> field<00:02:33.910> here's<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.209> check<00:02:35.780> wire

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
the field here's the check wire

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.430 
the field here's the check wire
mechanism<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.989> wire<00:02:39.230> comes<00:02:40.190> through<00:02:40.700> here

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
mechanism the wire comes through here

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.199 
mechanism the wire comes through here
and<00:02:42.440> through<00:02:42.860> there<00:02:43.130> under<00:02:43.520> those<00:02:43.670> rollers

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
and through there under those rollers

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.350 
and through there under those rollers
this<00:02:44.780> gets<00:02:45.050> folded<00:02:45.320> up<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:47.270> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
this gets folded up like this so the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.860 
this gets folded up like this so the
wire<00:02:47.570> goes<00:02:47.840> right<00:02:48.080> here<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:49.820> this<00:02:50.150> goes

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
wire goes right here and this goes

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.860 
wire goes right here and this goes
through<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.290> fork<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.280> here's<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.540> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
through this fork and here's the the

mechanism that you'll see there's wire
going<00:02:57.860> through<00:02:58.130> pulls<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.610> out<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.110> opens<00:03:00.110> and

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
going through pulls it out and opens and

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:29.850 
going through pulls it out and opens and
causes<00:03:00.739> it<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:00.920> trip

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.390 

here's<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:31.120> yellow<00:03:32.120> corn<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:33.830> can<00:03:34.010> see<00:03:34.220> if

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
here's a yellow corn you can see if

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.120 
here's a yellow corn you can see if
there's<00:03:34.700> probably<00:03:35.090> four<00:03:35.480> or<00:03:35.510> five<00:03:35.890> seeds<00:03:36.890> at

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
there's probably four or five seeds at

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.050 
there's probably four or five seeds at
least<00:03:37.400> in<00:03:37.760> each<00:03:38.630> one<00:03:39.280> there<00:03:40.280> it's<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.850> little

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
least in each one there it's a little

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.640 
least in each one there it's a little
thick<00:03:41.330> but<00:03:42.550> but<00:03:43.550> you<00:03:43.820> can<00:03:43.970> see<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.390> rows<00:03:45.050> we've

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
thick but but you can see the rows we've

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.360 
thick but but you can see the rows we've
elevated<00:03:45.950> them<00:03:47.050> this<00:03:48.050> we<00:03:48.410> planted<00:03:48.830> them<00:03:48.920> east

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
elevated them this we planted them east

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.580 
elevated them this we planted them east
and<00:03:49.610> west<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.120> I'm<00:03:50.270> looking<00:03:50.660> south<00:03:50.990> right<00:03:51.320> now

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
and west and I'm looking south right now

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.910 
and west and I'm looking south right now
so<00:03:52.130> this<00:03:52.370> would<00:03:52.640> been<00:03:52.850> part<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.300> checking

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
so this would been part of the checking

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.890 
so this would been part of the checking
you'll<00:03:54.920> see<00:03:55.100> in<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.340> color<00:03:55.550> baton<00:03:55.970> they<00:03:56.690> would

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
you'll see in the color baton they would

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.100 
you'll see in the color baton they would
go<00:03:57.050> both<00:03:57.290> ways<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.880> it's<00:03:59.360> actually<00:03:59.840> cleaned

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
go both ways and it's actually cleaned

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.520 
go both ways and it's actually cleaned
the<00:04:00.200> field<00:04:00.410> up<00:04:00.620> really<00:04:00.980> good<00:04:01.160> did<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.850> good<00:04:02.000> job

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
the field up really good did a good job

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:18.190 
the field up really good did a good job
for<00:04:03.530> no<00:04:03.980> herbicide

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.320 

now<00:04:19.200> this<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.800> way<00:04:20.310> we<00:04:20.490> planted<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.000> east

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
now this is the way we planted it east

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.910 
now this is the way we planted it east
and<00:04:21.570> west<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.080> you<00:04:22.140> can<00:04:22.260> see<00:04:22.410> how<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.620> rows

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
and west and you can see how the rows

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
and west and you can see how the rows
that<00:04:23.250> line<00:04:24.240> up<00:04:24.420> pretty<00:04:24.570> good<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:25.080> they<00:04:25.940> they

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
that line up pretty good and they they

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.810 
that line up pretty good and they they
actually<00:04:27.090> line<00:04:27.540> up<00:04:27.570> this<00:04:27.900> way<00:04:27.960> too<00:04:28.790> not<00:04:29.790> that

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
actually line up this way too not that

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.230 
actually line up this way too not that
weak<00:04:30.150> elevate<00:04:30.540> that<00:04:30.570> way<00:04:30.930> but<00:04:31.790> they<00:04:32.790> line<00:04:33.030> up

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
weak elevate that way but they line up

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.210 
weak elevate that way but they line up
just<00:04:33.390> because<00:04:33.750> everything's<00:04:34.200> square<00:04:34.530> 40<00:04:35.070> inch

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
just because everything's square 40 inch

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:43.670 
just because everything's square 40 inch
centers<00:04:35.640> 40<00:04:36.240> wide<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:36.780> 40<00:04:37.080> across<00:04:42.680> there's

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
centers 40 wide and 40 across there's

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.860 
centers 40 wide and 40 across there's
the<00:04:43.890> sprockets<00:04:44.490> for<00:04:44.730> for<00:04:45.420> setting<00:04:45.750> the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
the sprockets for for setting the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.820 
the sprockets for for setting the
different<00:04:46.280> spacing<00:04:47.280> here<00:04:47.610> on<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:49.140> population

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
different spacing here on the population

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.090 
different spacing here on the population
of<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.040> corn<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:51.320> here's<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.380> shift<00:04:52.710> mechanism

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
of the corn and here's a shift mechanism

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.230 
of the corn and here's a shift mechanism
here<00:04:54.440> two<00:04:55.440> three<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:55.950> four<00:04:56.190> we<00:04:56.670> had<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:57.000> set<00:04:57.180> on

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
here two three and four we had it set on

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.860 
here two three and four we had it set on
four<00:04:57.660> it's<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.680> little<00:04:58.980> thick<00:04:59.220> but<00:04:59.580> it<00:05:00.570> worked

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
four it's a little thick but it worked

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.110 
four it's a little thick but it worked
for<00:05:00.990> our<00:05:01.350> demonstration<00:05:01.590> at<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.220> show<00:05:02.900> Aloise

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
for our demonstration at the show Aloise

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.240 
for our demonstration at the show Aloise
that<00:05:06.120> that's<00:05:06.540> you<00:05:06.930> drop<00:05:07.170> so<00:05:07.350> many<00:05:07.530> kernels<00:05:07.770> in

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
that that's you drop so many kernels in

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.910 
that that's you drop so many kernels in
a<00:05:08.400> hill<00:05:08.690> and<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:10.080> think<00:05:10.320> we<00:05:10.470> were<00:05:10.620> dropping

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
a hill and I think we were dropping

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.900 
a hill and I think we were dropping
actually<00:05:11.490> around<00:05:11.730> six<00:05:12.270> per<00:05:12.690> hill<00:05:13.610> like<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:14.670> said

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
actually around six per hill like I said

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.850 
actually around six per hill like I said
that's<00:05:15.060> a<00:05:15.210> little<00:05:15.450> thick<00:05:15.660> but<00:05:15.690> for<00:05:16.530> what<00:05:16.710> we

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
that's a little thick but for what we

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.360 
that's a little thick but for what we
were<00:05:17.010> doing<00:05:17.280> it<00:05:17.430> was<00:05:17.520> fine<00:05:20.780> take<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:22.070> seed<00:05:23.070> box

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
were doing it was fine take the seed box

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.180 
were doing it was fine take the seed box
off<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:25.020> underneath<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:27.780> seed<00:05:28.080> drops<00:05:28.890> down

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
off and underneath the seed drops down

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.070 
off and underneath the seed drops down
this<00:05:29.520> tube<00:05:29.880> if<00:05:30.480> you<00:05:30.690> can<00:05:30.870> see<00:05:31.080> that<00:05:31.550> and

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
this tube if you can see that and

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.910 
this tube if you can see that and
there's<00:05:34.080> a<00:05:34.170> valve<00:05:34.530> here's<00:05:35.130> a<00:05:35.220> valve<00:05:36.620> maybe<00:05:37.620> see

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
there's a valve here's a valve maybe see

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.870 
there's a valve here's a valve maybe see
it<00:05:38.040> opening<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.730> closing<00:05:40.280> there's<00:05:41.280> a<00:05:41.430> valve

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
it opening and closing there's a valve

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.050 
it opening and closing there's a valve
on<00:05:42.060> top<00:05:42.390> there's<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:43.020> and<00:05:43.740> a<00:05:44.430> valve<00:05:44.700> on<00:05:44.910> the

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
on top there's a and a valve on the

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.680 
on top there's a and a valve on the
bottom<00:05:45.510> that<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.650> corn<00:05:47.060> this<00:05:48.060> catches<00:05:48.420> the

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
bottom that the corn this catches the

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.040 
bottom that the corn this catches the
corn<00:05:48.990> here<00:05:49.530> from<00:05:49.980> the<00:05:50.130> box<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:50.840> when<00:05:51.840> this

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
corn here from the box and when this

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.150 
corn here from the box and when this
trips<00:05:53.450> this<00:05:54.450> valve<00:05:54.870> drops<00:05:55.470> it<00:05:55.650> down<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:56.040> the

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
trips this valve drops it down to the

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.730 
trips this valve drops it down to the
valve<00:05:56.370> down<00:05:56.700> here<00:05:57.150> down<00:05:57.930> at<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.200> bottom<00:05:58.380> and

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
valve down here down at the bottom and

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.980 
valve down here down at the bottom and
the<00:05:59.580> one<00:05:59.730> at<00:05:59.880> the<00:05:59.940> bottom<00:06:00.210> is<00:06:00.390> the<00:06:00.660> one<00:06:00.690> that

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
the one at the bottom is the one that

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.470 
the one at the bottom is the one that
actually<00:06:01.170> plants<00:06:01.860> it<00:06:01.980> it<00:06:02.880> just<00:06:03.090> drops<00:06:03.360> the

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
actually plants it it just drops the

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.950 
actually plants it it just drops the
corn<00:06:03.780> about<00:06:03.990> two<00:06:04.200> inches<00:06:04.530> into<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:04.860> ground
