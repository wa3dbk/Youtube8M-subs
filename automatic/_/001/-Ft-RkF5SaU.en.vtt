on running on my stormtrooper right now
so<00:00:15.360> looking<00:00:16.350> pretty<00:00:16.619> good<00:00:17.779> camera<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
so looking pretty good camera on the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.779 
so looking pretty good camera on the
Lumia<00:00:19.500> 900<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.539> 1.3<00:00:21.539> megapixel<00:00:22.109> camera<00:00:22.529> I'm

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
Lumia 900 is a 1.3 megapixel camera I'm

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.460 
Lumia 900 is a 1.3 megapixel camera I'm
not<00:00:23.789> sure<00:00:23.939> about<00:00:23.970> what<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> aperture<00:00:24.900> any

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
not sure about what the aperture any

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.140 
not sure about what the aperture any
another<00:00:25.830> special<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.310> know<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> its<00:00:26.760> 1.3

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
another special I know that its 1.3

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.259 
another special I know that its 1.3
megapixels<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:29.519> quality<00:00:29.880> seems<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.210> be

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
megapixels the quality seems to be

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
megapixels the quality seems to be
pretty<00:00:30.420> good<00:00:30.660> i<00:00:30.840> think<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.199> video<00:00:31.380> quality<00:00:31.650> is

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
pretty good i think the video quality is

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.549 
pretty good i think the video quality is
480<00:00:32.489> there<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.390> no<00:00:33.540> settings<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.140> change<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
480 there are no settings to change the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.560 
480 there are no settings to change the
quality<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:34.980> you're<00:00:35.130> stuck<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.520> whatever<00:00:36.390> it

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
quality so you're stuck with whatever it

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.520 
quality so you're stuck with whatever it
is<00:00:36.630> that's<00:00:36.809> running<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.320> looks<00:00:37.469> pretty

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
is that's running but it looks pretty

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.470 
is that's running but it looks pretty
good<00:00:37.800> could<00:00:38.280> even<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.520> 720<00:00:39.090> from<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:39.390> I'm

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
good could even be 720 from what I'm

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
good could even be 720 from what I'm
seeing<00:00:39.750> playback<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.010> screen<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.280> now

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
seeing playback on the screen right now

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.619 
seeing playback on the screen right now
but<00:00:41.879> we'll<00:00:42.660> find<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:42.930> once<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:44.040> uploaded

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
but we'll find out once it's uploaded

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.630 
but we'll find out once it's uploaded
anyways<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> suburbs

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
anyways so this is just what the suburbs

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.400 
anyways so this is just what the suburbs
of<00:00:47.820> Chicago<00:00:48.239> look<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:49.969> pretty<00:00:50.969> decent<00:00:51.410> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
of Chicago look like pretty decent the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.560 
of Chicago look like pretty decent the
front-facing<00:00:52.680> camera<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> 900<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.969> quite

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
front-facing camera on the 900 is quite

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.170 
front-facing camera on the 900 is quite
nice<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:55.469> quite<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> bit<00:00:56.640> much

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
nice I like it a bit quite a bit much

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.910 
nice I like it a bit quite a bit much
better<00:00:57.480> than<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.930> last<00:00:57.960> poem<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.680> used

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
better than the last poem that I used

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.099 
better than the last poem that I used
which<00:00:59.100> was<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> n9<00:00:59.789> front<00:01:00.329> facing<00:01:00.600> camera<00:01:00.899> was

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
which was the n9 front facing camera was

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.870 
which was the n9 front facing camera was
just<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:02.010> was<00:01:02.430> scary<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.979> it<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.100> super

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
just I was scary the it was super

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.190 
just I was scary the it was super
pixelated<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.689> could<00:01:06.869> barely<00:01:07.080> see

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
pixelated and you could barely see

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.890 
pixelated and you could barely see
anything<00:01:08.119> but<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.150> other<00:01:09.330> phone<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.780> I've

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
anything but the other phone that I've

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
anything but the other phone that I've
used<00:01:09.930> Reese<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.280> last<00:01:11.460> poem<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
used Reese that I you the last poem that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.010 
used Reese that I you the last poem that
i<00:01:11.850> actually<00:01:11.970> used<00:01:12.330> where<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> front-facing

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
i actually used where the front-facing

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.590 
i actually used where the front-facing
camera<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:13.619> maybe<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> HTC<00:01:14.369> One<00:01:14.520> X<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
camera was maybe the HTC One X and that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.450 
camera was maybe the HTC One X and that
had<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> very<00:01:16.320> nice<00:01:16.500> fun<00:01:16.860> facing<00:01:17.130> camera<00:01:17.430> i

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
had a very nice fun facing camera i

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.420 
had a very nice fun facing camera i
believe<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:17.880> 720p<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:20.189> quite<00:01:20.280> an

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
believe it was 720p so that's quite an

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.039 
believe it was 720p so that's quite an
accomplishment<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> front-facing<00:01:21.630> camera

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
accomplishment for a front-facing camera

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.130 
accomplishment for a front-facing camera
anyways<00:01:23.040> um<00:01:23.250> i'm<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.630> sure<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.990> phone

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
anyways um i'm not sure if the phone

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.300 
anyways um i'm not sure if the phone
suppose<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.470> held<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.710> landscape<00:01:26.100> or

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
suppose to be held in landscape or

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.420 
suppose to be held in landscape or
portrait<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:27.330> holding<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:28.430> landscape

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
portrait but I'm holding it in landscape

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.640 
portrait but I'm holding it in landscape
mode<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:30.119> then<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.689> get<00:01:30.810> playback<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
mode because then you get playback in a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.260 
mode because then you get playback in a
wider<00:01:31.860> screen<00:01:32.130> instead<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.900> narrow<00:01:33.900> slit

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
wider screen instead of a narrow slit

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.510 
wider screen instead of a narrow slit
the<00:01:36.270> quality<00:01:36.720> seems<00:01:36.930> pretty<00:01:37.229> decent<00:01:37.680> um<00:01:37.979> I

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the quality seems pretty decent um I

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.980 
the quality seems pretty decent um I
like<00:01:39.000> quite<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> lot<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:41.329> um<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.420> was<00:01:42.750> quite

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
impressed with it the first time I saw

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.340 
impressed with it the first time I saw
it<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.909> still<00:01:44.970> AM<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> front<00:01:46.200> facing

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
camera you know you can tell how far

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.270 
camera you know you can tell how far
they've<00:01:48.360> come<00:01:48.500> compared<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:50.040> used<00:01:50.189> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
they've come compared to what we used to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.899 
they've come compared to what we used to
get<00:01:50.430> from<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.939> made<00:01:51.570> my<00:01:51.750> n73<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.530> example<00:01:52.950> which

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
get from I made my n73 for example which

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.109 
get from I made my n73 for example which
I<00:01:54.299> only<00:01:54.570> use<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> mirror<00:01:55.320> maybe<00:01:55.500> sometimes

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
I only use as a mirror maybe sometimes

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.899 
I only use as a mirror maybe sometimes
so<00:01:57.119> anyways<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.860> about<00:01:58.920> 1pm<00:01:59.520> right<00:01:59.790> now
