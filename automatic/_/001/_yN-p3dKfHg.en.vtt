going to give you my general thoughts
who<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:15.990> think<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.470> good<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:16.800> how<00:00:17.190> influences

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
who I think it's good on how influences

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.090 
who I think it's good on how influences
the<00:00:18.060> jungle<00:00:18.539> meta<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.080> give<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.680> little<00:00:19.890> bit

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
the jungle meta and give it a little bit

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.010 
the jungle meta and give it a little bit
of<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> breakdown<00:00:20.670> first<00:00:21.330> things<00:00:21.510> first<00:00:21.600> let's

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
of a breakdown first things first let's

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.920 
of a breakdown first things first let's
take<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.350> look<00:00:22.619> at<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.980> item<00:00:23.460> itself<00:00:23.930> firstly

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
take a look at the item itself firstly

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.720 
take a look at the item itself firstly
it's<00:00:25.050> item<00:00:25.289> path<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.740> great<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.400> junglers

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
it's item path is great for junglers

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.339 
it's item path is great for junglers
because<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.300> build<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.630> out<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.810> lots<00:00:28.170> of

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
because you can build it out of lots of

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.980 
because you can build it out of lots of
small<00:00:28.830> pieces<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.640> work<00:00:30.090> your<00:00:30.269> way<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> it

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
small pieces and work your way up to it

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.389 
small pieces and work your way up to it
the<00:00:31.289> reason<00:00:31.500> why<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.920> quite<00:00:32.160> appealing

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the reason why this is quite appealing

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.250 
the reason why this is quite appealing
for<00:00:32.640> junglers<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.149> because<00:00:33.450> they<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.780> access

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
for junglers is because they have access

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.010 
for junglers is because they have access
to<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> limited<00:00:34.860> income<00:00:35.540> often<00:00:36.540> not<00:00:36.690> being<00:00:36.899> able

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
to a limited income often not being able

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.110 
to a limited income often not being able
to<00:00:37.230> save<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:37.890> those<00:00:37.950> huge<00:00:38.399> items<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
to save up for those huge items and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
to save up for those huge items and
shelling<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.629> massive<00:00:40.020> amounts<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.379> cash<00:00:40.770> at

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
shelling out massive amounts of cash at

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220 
shelling out massive amounts of cash at
one<00:00:41.280> time<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.120> stats<00:00:42.360> themselves<00:00:42.780> are<00:00:42.930> great

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
one time the stats themselves are great

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.779 
one time the stats themselves are great
for<00:00:43.440> bruises<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.040> sets<00:00:44.250> them<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.489> pretty

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
for bruises and it sets them up pretty

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.790 
for bruises and it sets them up pretty
nicely<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> mid<00:00:45.899> game<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> good

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
nicely for the mid game with a good

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.580 
nicely for the mid game with a good
chunk<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.250> HP<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.030> damage<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.809> armor<00:00:49.350> shred

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
chunk of HP and damage the armor shred

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.229 
chunk of HP and damage the armor shred
also<00:00:49.860> sets<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.340> quite<00:00:50.550> nicely<00:00:50.579> for<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
also sets them out quite nicely for the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.630 
also sets them out quite nicely for the
late<00:00:51.480> game<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:52.020> well<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.739> twenty<00:00:53.010> percent<00:00:53.190> CDR

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

late game as well the twenty percent CDR
is<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:54.329> good<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.840> well<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> ten

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
is really good as well with the ten

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.319 
is really good as well with the ten
percent<00:00:55.860> from<00:00:55.980> runes<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.430> masteries<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.090> if

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
percent from runes and masteries and if

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you choose to go worryin charmant then

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
you choose to go worryin charmant then
when<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> buy<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.789> black<00:01:00.030> cleaver<00:01:00.359> you'll

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
when you buy that black cleaver you'll

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.439 
when you buy that black cleaver you'll
be<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.109> CDR<00:01:01.649> cap<00:01:01.949> pretty<00:01:02.460> early<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.390> my

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
be at the CDR cap pretty early on in my

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210 
be at the CDR cap pretty early on in my
personal<00:01:03.660> opinion<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.290> think<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.710> twenty

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
personal opinion I think this twenty

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.399 
personal opinion I think this twenty
percent<00:01:05.519> CD<00:01:05.820> i<00:01:05.909> was<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> little<00:01:06.390> bit<00:01:06.720> over<00:01:06.930> tuned

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
percent CD i was a little bit over tuned

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.170 
percent CD i was a little bit over tuned
and<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.280> only<00:01:08.430> ten<00:01:08.640> percent<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:09.060> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and if it was only ten percent then it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
and if it was only ten percent then it
wouldn't<00:01:09.420> even<00:01:09.510> be<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:10.020> bad<00:01:10.320> however

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
wouldn't even be that bad however

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
wouldn't even be that bad however
despite<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.369> example<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.820> gave<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.479> buying<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
despite the example I gave of buying a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.060 
despite the example I gave of buying a
warrant<00:01:13.110> charman<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.560> actually<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:13.950> that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
warrant charman I actually think that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.920 
warrant charman I actually think that
cinderhulk<00:01:14.729> into<00:01:15.150> black<00:01:15.330> cleaver<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
cinderhulk into black cleaver is a

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.280 
cinderhulk into black cleaver is a
really<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:17.369> powerful<00:01:17.570> item<00:01:18.570> path<00:01:18.840> not

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
really really powerful item path not

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.749 
really really powerful item path not
only<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> very<00:01:19.920> decent<00:01:20.130> chunk<00:01:20.549> of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
only do you get a very decent chunk of

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.280 
only do you get a very decent chunk of
health<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.479> tag<00:01:21.689> damage<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.259> also

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
health and the tag damage but you also

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350 
health and the tag damage but you also
benefit<00:01:23.009> from<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.340> cinderhulk<00:01:23.790> passive

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
benefit from this cinderhulk passive

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.300 
benefit from this cinderhulk passive
which<00:01:24.750> increases<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.530> amount<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.920> health<00:01:26.159> you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
which increases the amount of health you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850 
which increases the amount of health you
gain<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:27.030> items<00:01:27.509> such<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.650> black
