00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.430
 there we have it 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.950
 It's great to look for our 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.610
 next character here is and this is 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.690

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.930

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:42.400
 it's great, there's the fourth character 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.940
 of this video and then you can throw axes 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.850

 Well, you can also walk underwater 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.039

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.080
 hammers that are the characters that 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.149
