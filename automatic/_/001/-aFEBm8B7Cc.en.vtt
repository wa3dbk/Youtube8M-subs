00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:10.040
 word of the two today I'm going to present 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:13.049
 the weapon seraphim error messenger error 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.570
 messenger is like error message error 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.160
 of message we can get it in the df 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.060
 of captain scarlett killing master 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.279
 and the invincible if they get to concrete 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.279
 more specifically go nonsense that I just 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.759
 to say and look at master master that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.430
 he's carrying precisely this spleen is and if 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.120
 this bazooka is very dangerous and what 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.399
 we will have the same effect as 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.460
 loose master and have never messed with 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.190
 he if not good we are going to examine the weapon 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.899
 and we'll see what's with him 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.590
 when there is messenger there soon 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.050
 error messenger error as message 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.110
 error error message in plan 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.960
 we fail we fail name damage 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.300
 And the truth is that it is very high 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.450
 precision that is rare very good 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.830
 precision to be a bazooka cadence 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.420
 of normal fire and is to make a 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.510
 bazooka at recharge speed more or 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.320
 less good size of charger 2 and the 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.350
 message leaves you there very very surprised 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.280
 this weapon should never be released to the being 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.380
 of torque only inflicts explosive damage 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.130
 Here we see you have seen what 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.759
 has happened there they have it shoot a harpoon 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:38.530
 if as a master, there they have it and between 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:41.530
 that the harpoon goes straight and the damage 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.259
 what does it look like, it's amazing how much care 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.090
 of not using it very close to an enemy like 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.850
 has happened to me here now because we 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.340
 we end up killing if we give with this weapon 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.799
 with this bazooka so 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.840
 Certainly surely or almost certain 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.390
 let's end up killing the enemy like this 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 pirate mercenary this weapon away good 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.250
 this weapon to seraphim that is the bad thing that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.770
 has the bad thing that it has is that clear the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.039
 make very cool face very handsome here a 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.160
 video but when exploding the bullet to 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.860
 explode the harpoon is worth the harpoon has 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.530
 very little explosion radius so 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.739
 this bazooka is basically so that 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.530
 let's hit the enemies squarely but 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.170
 that yes less evil than what is the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.410
 effort as for example here then 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.610
 it will be worth the truth is that this 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.060
 will touch 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.540
 seraphim is worth it if it deserves 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.910
 very much very much worth it here takes 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.180
 again it has put me to spend the same and 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.760
 here do not you shake there you have it though 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.870
 I have been saying that the radius of explosion 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.410
 is very 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.410
 and very short 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.140
 you're next to it practically because it's going to 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.600
 explode and it will end up killing you like 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.440
 if I had given full so nothing 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.650
 remember to impact if possible 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.519
 full 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:14.079
 well we know the house grass we see its 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.120
 qualities that scratch pons and seals a 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.640
 little explosion radius for whoever 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.260
 I recommend recommending everything I recommend 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.020
 for everyone this bazooka what 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.810
 I recommend for everyone 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.970
 who could get more out of it more 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.030
 profit in concrete maya are worth 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.540
 we could immobilize the enemy attract 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.570
 a few others throw a bombshell with this 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.610
 mallet kan to which he is retained and then 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.470
 that explosion radius although very 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.280
 little one will give them to others 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.130
 Here are the worms of the sands 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.980
 everything works perfectly against all 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.250
 the class of enemies clear that the damage 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.580
 explosive causes 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.500
 be perfectly and be effective against 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.960
 all kinds of enemies that also that 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.170
 be clear when it comes to getting a 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.650
 second chance if we take and give 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.750
 of 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.340
 full to an enemy surely the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.010
 second chance we will get it 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.720
 fast fast here a pirate of these 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.150
 damn you already know you are 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.269
 very difficult to kill as they hit you 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.940
 many times then nothing and you have damn 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.130
 and there is the ideal truth to get 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.740
 second chances yes yes the enemy 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.770
 is near 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.650
 we continue talking about the bad of the bazooka 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.479
 it's simply that it's that master and the 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.020
 invincible has a probability of 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:40.020
 Very low European value is the same as 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.539
 friend master gym is one of the most bosses 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.669
 difficult that I have found in all 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:48.389
 the video games and go had to be 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.610
 in this is that it is difficult to kill and 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.310
 on top of the weapon is hard to get 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.650
 so nothing that stays with them 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.889
 Of course, the bazooka 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.470
 they love simply to order in their 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.930
 den aim fully or very close to 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.180
 enemy and it is already enemy that the most 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.940
 sure die and if he does not die from the first 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.180
 bombazo will be very very tocadísimo for 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.340
 the second arch 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.580
 the truth is that it is a very original weapon 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.330
 very effective and that's the master's weapon 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.580
 and shoot the same shoot a harpoon like 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.039
 when he chases us so 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.900
 nothing like I always say thank you for 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.900
 have seen me and a hug to all
