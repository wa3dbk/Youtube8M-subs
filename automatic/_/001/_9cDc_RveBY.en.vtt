hi I'm Howard Roth I'm Sales Manager
with<00:00:03.449> honeybee<00:00:03.780> manufacturing<00:00:04.620> I'm<00:00:05.310> here<00:00:05.609> to

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
with honeybee manufacturing I'm here to

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.930 
with honeybee manufacturing I'm here to
tell<00:00:05.940> you<00:00:06.089> about<00:00:06.120> our<00:00:06.890> 2012<00:00:07.890> features<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.790> we

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
tell you about our 2012 features that we

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.540 
tell you about our 2012 features that we
have<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.300> our<00:00:09.330> Greenbelt<00:00:09.900> headers<00:00:10.340> the<00:00:11.340> first

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
have on our Greenbelt headers the first

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.390 
have on our Greenbelt headers the first
feature<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.969> our<00:00:12.210> low<00:00:12.330> profile<00:00:12.780> cutter<00:00:13.049> bar

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
feature is our low profile cutter bar

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.990 
feature is our low profile cutter bar
we've<00:00:14.400> reduced<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.440> distance<00:00:16.440> between

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
we've reduced the distance between

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.710 
we've reduced the distance between
canvas<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.750> actual<00:00:19.740> knife<00:00:20.100> by<00:00:20.550> 50%<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.630> we

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
canvas and the actual knife by 50% so we

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.490 
canvas and the actual knife by 50% so we
get<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> smoother<00:00:22.410> flow<00:00:22.650> into<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.670> Draper's

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
get a smoother flow into the Draper's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.519 
get a smoother flow into the Draper's
we've<00:00:25.500> also<00:00:25.939> lowered<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.119> profile<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.320> that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
we've also lowered the profile so that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.030 
we've also lowered the profile so that
we<00:00:28.710> can<00:00:28.920> cut<00:00:29.160> closer<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> ground

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
we can cut closer to the ground

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.880 
we can cut closer to the ground

better dividing of your crop whereas the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.140 
better dividing of your crop whereas the

we've gone to a new style skid plate

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.410 
we've gone to a new style skid plate
because<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.600> our<00:02:53.750> new<00:02:54.049> style<00:02:55.150> profile<00:02:56.150> cutter

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420

we've done is is we've just added a

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.180 
we've done is is we've just added a
finer<00:03:13.940> adjustment<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.410> your<00:03:15.709> fingers

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
finer adjustment so that your fingers

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.970 
finer adjustment so that your fingers

can get closer to your knife as you're

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.410 
can get closer to your knife as you're

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
the hitch jack mount previous headers we

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.650 
the hitch jack mount previous headers we
we<00:03:26.690> mounted<00:03:27.049> our<00:03:27.170> Jack's<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.519> hitch<00:03:29.239> tube

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
we mounted our Jack's to the hitch tube

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.650 
we mounted our Jack's to the hitch tube
of<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.470> header<00:03:30.680> whereas<00:03:31.609> now<00:03:31.880> we<00:03:31.940> mount<00:03:32.450> the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
of the header whereas now we mount the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.380 
of the header whereas now we mount the
jack<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.380> actual<00:03:34.370> frame<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.209> header

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.130 
jack to the actual frame of the header
which<00:03:36.220> means<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.640> your<00:03:37.880> header<00:03:38.180> actually

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
which means that your header actually

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.590 
which means that your header actually
does<00:03:39.350> not<00:03:39.530> lean<00:03:39.799> over<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.310> stands<00:03:40.850> actually
