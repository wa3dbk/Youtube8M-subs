00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
at anything I was just irritated and I'm

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.130 
at anything I was just irritated and I'm
like<00:01:28.259> oh<00:01:28.549> this<00:01:29.549> isn't<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.900> got<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
like oh this isn't good and then I got a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.230 
like oh this isn't good and then I got a
slight<00:01:31.500> headache<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.520> 0<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.880> 10<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
slight headache in out of 0 to 10 it

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.609 
slight headache in out of 0 to 10 it
probably<00:01:33.540> would<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.659> been<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.869> two<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.170> three

probably would have been a two or three

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.160 
probably would have been a two or three
so<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.640> wasn't<00:01:35.820> painful<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.140> just

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
so it wasn't painful but it was just

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.560 
so it wasn't painful but it was just
there<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.700> also<00:01:38.909> started<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> get

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
there and I also started to get

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.050 
there and I also started to get
cloudiness<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.530> my<00:01:40.860> vision<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:41.970> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
cloudiness and my vision you know it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.310 
cloudiness and my vision you know it
wasn't<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:42.479> good<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.170> probably

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
wasn't as good and that was probably

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.859 
wasn't as good and that was probably
just<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:43.770> mind<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.399> big<00:01:44.579> sharp<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.210> just
