this is called gum base this stuff is
amazing<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.850> made<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.449> polymers<00:00:55.020> which

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
amazing this is made of polymers which

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.410 
amazing this is made of polymers which
are<00:00:55.379> long<00:00:55.770> chain<00:00:56.219> molecules<00:00:56.699> now<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
are long chain molecules now if you

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.590 
are long chain molecules now if you
whack<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.140> against<00:00:58.649> something<00:00:59.420> you'll<00:01:00.420> find

that<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:02.129> hard

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
what's very strange is that 25% of this

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.289 
what's very strange is that 25% of this
is<00:01:06.600> normal<00:01:07.320> PVA<00:01:07.979> glue<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.820> kind<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.119> stuff

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
is normal PVA glue that kind of stuff

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.890 
is normal PVA glue that kind of stuff
that<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> use<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.680> make<00:01:10.799> kids<00:01:11.189> art<00:01:11.490> with<00:01:11.900> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that you use to make kids art with and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.539 
that you use to make kids art with and
again<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.320> seems<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:13.979> wrong<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.430> bad

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
again that seems really wrong and bad

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.149 
again that seems really wrong and bad
you<00:01:15.540> should<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.780> eating<00:01:16.020> PVA<00:01:16.530> glue<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:16.920> again

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
you should be eating PVA glue but again

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.070 
you should be eating PVA glue but again
it's<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.759> fiber<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.450> goes<00:01:18.689> straight<00:01:19.020> through

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
it's just fiber it goes straight through

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's just fiber it goes straight through
you<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.740> there's<00:01:20.040> also<00:01:20.159> other<00:01:20.310> things<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.759> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you and there's also other things in it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.240 
you and there's also other things in it
as<00:01:20.939> well<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.380> plasticizers<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.409> elastomers

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
as well as plasticizers and elastomers

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
as well as plasticizers and elastomers
and<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> difference<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.390> waxes<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.900> resins

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
and and difference of waxes and resins

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.350 
and and difference of waxes and resins
that<00:01:25.560> will<00:01:26.100> basically<00:01:26.369> give<00:01:26.729> your<00:01:27.090> final

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that will basically give your final

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
that will basically give your final

water<00:02:02.869> especially<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.380> there

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
water especially in there

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.600 
water especially in there
a<00:02:04.729> little<00:02:05.000> blush<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.869> then<00:02:06.130> I'm<00:02:07.130> gonna<00:02:07.310> set

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
a little blush and then I'm gonna set

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.820 
a little blush and then I'm gonna set
the<00:02:07.759> magic<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.300> happen<00:02:08.360> by<00:02:09.019> putting<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.709> a

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
the magic to happen by putting it in a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:20.580 
the magic to happen by putting it in a
microwave<00:02:11.200> okay

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.600 

magic<00:02:21.430> microwaves<00:02:22.360> massaging<00:02:23.170> my<00:02:23.319> gum

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
magic microwaves massaging my gum

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.610 
magic microwaves massaging my gum
there's<00:02:25.480> essence<00:02:25.930> quite<00:02:26.170> quite<00:02:26.410> cool<00:02:26.590> so

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
there's essence quite quite cool so

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.500 
there's essence quite quite cool so
there's<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> magnetron<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.760> here<00:02:27.970> which

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
there's a magnetron in here which

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.050 
there's a magnetron in here which
basically<00:02:28.690> flips<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:30.040> polar<00:02:30.460> molecules<00:02:30.940> in

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
basically flips the polar molecules in

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.400 
basically flips the polar molecules in
the<00:02:31.150> water<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.450> they<00:02:31.570> flipped<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:32.020> flipped<00:02:32.200> it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
the water and they flipped it flipped it

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.340 
the water and they flipped it flipped it
so<00:02:32.620> fast<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.490> flipping<00:02:34.000> action<00:02:34.450> creates

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
so fast that the flipping action creates

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.950 
so fast that the flipping action creates
friction<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.980> that's<00:02:36.250> what<00:02:36.520> heats<00:02:36.820> up<00:02:37.060> your

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
friction and that's what heats up your

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:46.830 
friction and that's what heats up your
food<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:44.020> all<00:02:44.740> of<00:02:45.040> this<00:02:45.130> gum<00:02:45.430> base<00:02:45.640> has<00:02:46.180> kind<00:02:46.720> of

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
food so all of this gum base has kind of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.740 
food so all of this gum base has kind of
melted<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.650> it's<00:02:47.800> mixed<00:02:48.040> together<00:02:48.360> with<00:02:49.360> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
melted and it's mixed together with the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.320 
melted and it's mixed together with the
sugar<00:02:49.780> which<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.650> now<00:02:50.800> all<00:02:51.070> wet<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.180> can

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
sugar which is now all wet and you can

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.470 
sugar which is now all wet and you can
see<00:02:52.890> really<00:02:53.890> stringy<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.030> completely

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
see really stringy so it completely

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.020 
see really stringy so it completely
changes<00:02:56.050> forward<00:02:56.410> it's<00:02:56.530> activated<00:02:57.250> all<00:02:57.880> of

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
changes forward it's activated all of

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.250 
changes forward it's activated all of
these<00:02:58.590> elastomers<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:01.360> might<00:03:01.540> think<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:01.930> it

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
these elastomers you might think that it

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.140 
these elastomers you might think that it
because<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:02.740> so<00:03:03.520> hot<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:07.600> you<00:03:08.560> stir<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.150> it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
because it is so hot and you stir it it

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.670 
because it is so hot and you stir it it
kind<00:03:10.390> of<00:03:10.480> cools<00:03:10.870> down<00:03:11.020> a<00:03:11.170> little<00:03:11.230> bit<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.620> you

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
kind of cools down a little bit and you

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.890 
kind of cools down a little bit and you
can<00:03:11.800> feel<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.580> it's<00:03:13.150> changing<00:03:13.750> its

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
can feel that it's changing its

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.500 
can feel that it's changing its
structure<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.620> getting<00:03:14.950> string<00:03:15.370> here<00:03:15.610> let's

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
structure and getting string here let's

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.130 
structure and getting string here let's
drink<00:03:16.720> yeah

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
drink yeah

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.250 
drink yeah
now<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.910> gotta<00:03:19.060> treat<00:03:19.240> this<00:03:19.300> stuff<00:03:19.570> a<00:03:19.840> little

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
now you gotta treat this stuff a little

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.400 
now you gotta treat this stuff a little
bit<00:03:20.500> like<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.270> kind<00:03:22.270> of<00:03:22.360> wet<00:03:22.690> dough<00:03:22.959> because

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
bit like and kind of wet dough because

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.080 
bit like and kind of wet dough because
if<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.620> don't<00:03:23.860> treat<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.400> properly<00:03:24.520> it<00:03:24.940> will

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
if you don't treat it properly it will

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.870 
if you don't treat it properly it will
stick<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.480> everything<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:26.770> is<00:03:26.920> stronger

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
stick to everything and this is stronger

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.430 
stick to everything and this is stronger
kind<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.270> gloomy<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.690> window<00:03:29.050> because<00:03:29.290> it's

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
kind of gloomy the window because it's

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.840 
kind of gloomy the window because it's
call<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.739> PVA<00:03:30.130> glue<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:34.140> I'm<00:03:35.140> using<00:03:35.440> all<00:03:35.650> that

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
call that PVA glue so I'm using all that

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.270 
call that PVA glue so I'm using all that
icing<00:03:36.850> sugar<00:03:37.000> as<00:03:37.410> as<00:03:38.410> if<00:03:38.650> it's<00:03:38.830> sort<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.070> flour

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
icing sugar as as if it's sort of flour

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:52.050 
icing sugar as as if it's sort of flour
to<00:03:39.550> stop<00:03:39.760> things<00:03:39.940> from<00:03:40.120> sticking<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:51.910> gonna

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
to stop things from sticking just gonna

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.490 
to stop things from sticking just gonna
flatten<00:03:52.360> this<00:03:52.480> bit<00:03:52.690> more<00:03:52.959> using<00:03:53.620> my<00:03:53.830> fingers

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
flatten this bit more using my fingers

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.420 
flatten this bit more using my fingers
it's<00:03:56.500> still<00:03:56.800> quite<00:03:57.040> soggy

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
it's still quite soggy

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.400 
it's still quite soggy
what's<00:03:58.150> really<00:03:58.390> cool<00:03:58.510> is<00:03:58.570> that<00:03:58.690> inside<00:03:59.170> it

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
what's really cool is that inside it

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.340 
what's really cool is that inside it
were<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.860> polymers<00:04:00.450> are<00:04:01.450> now<00:04:01.930> being<00:04:02.140> held

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
were the polymers are now being held

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.199 
were the polymers are now being held
together<00:04:02.590> by<00:04:02.769> elastomers<00:04:03.670> as<00:04:03.850> well<00:04:04.000> the

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
together by elastomers as well the

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.360 
together by elastomers as well the
polymers<00:04:04.600> are<00:04:04.690> just<00:04:04.900> really<00:04:05.320> long<00:04:05.739> chains<00:04:06.190> of

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
polymers are just really long chains of

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.330 
polymers are just really long chains of
molecules<00:04:06.870> that's<00:04:07.870> beautiful<00:04:08.290> okay<00:04:08.560> I<00:04:08.830> think

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
molecules that's beautiful okay I think

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.250 
molecules that's beautiful okay I think
that's<00:04:09.850> know<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.180> ready<00:04:11.070> two<00:04:12.070> little<00:04:12.340> pieces

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.410 

so<00:04:17.260> three<00:04:17.650> pieces<00:04:18.250> who<00:04:19.120> make<00:04:19.419> sure<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.840> just

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
so three pieces who make sure you just

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.410 
so three pieces who make sure you just
check<00:04:20.840> money<00:04:23.740> bricks<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:24.890> just<00:04:25.070> not<00:04:25.250> bats<00:04:26.240> is

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
check money bricks and just not bats is

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.060 
check money bricks and just not bats is
back<00:04:26.630> again<00:04:26.780> into<00:04:27.320> a<00:04:27.470> shape<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.860> need

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
back again into a shape that you need

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.040 
back again into a shape that you need
and<00:04:28.310> those<00:04:28.490> are<00:04:28.670> that<00:04:28.760> all<00:04:29.630> these<00:04:29.750> different

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
and those are that all these different

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.860 
and those are that all these different
types<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.650> polymers<00:04:30.890> all<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.280> work<00:04:31.510> on<00:04:32.510> there

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.460 

and<00:04:35.870> I'm<00:04:36.050> going<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.320> invite<00:04:37.040> a<00:04:38.140> very<00:04:39.140> special

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
and I'm going to invite a very special

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.610 
and I'm going to invite a very special
guest<00:04:39.650> in<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.940> come<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.240> try<00:04:41.390> and<00:04:41.510> guess<00:04:41.720> what

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
guest in to come and try and guess what

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:50.530 
guest in to come and try and guess what
flavor<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:42.950> is<00:04:43.180> this<00:04:44.860> is<00:04:45.860> my<00:04:46.460> wife<00:04:46.670> georgette

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.720 

now<00:04:51.080> this<00:04:51.230> is<00:04:51.410> a<00:04:51.680> bit<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:51.950> sugar<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.400> looks<00:04:52.580> like
