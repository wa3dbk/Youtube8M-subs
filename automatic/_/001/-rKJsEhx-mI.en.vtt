now<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.440> can<00:00:07.649> see<00:00:07.890> our<00:00:07.970> camp<00:00:08.970> center<00:00:09.450> is

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
now you can see our camp center is

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.749 
now you can see our camp center is
actually<00:00:10.440> on<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.830> back<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.250> head<00:00:11.429> right

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
actually on the back of the head right

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.720 
actually on the back of the head right
up<00:00:12.240> here<00:00:12.509> against<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> firewall<00:00:16.550> now<00:00:17.550> when

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
up here against the firewall now when

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.070 
up here against the firewall now when
you<00:00:17.820> order<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.150> camp<00:00:18.480> sensor

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
you order a camp sensor

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
you order a camp sensor
it<00:00:19.350> may<00:00:19.650> come<00:00:19.980> as<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.340> whole<00:00:20.490> complete<00:00:20.939> unit<00:00:22.100> or

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
it may come as a whole complete unit or

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.170 
it may come as a whole complete unit or
just<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> sensor<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.119> top<00:00:25.849> let<00:00:26.849> me<00:00:26.939> show<00:00:27.090> you

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
just the sensor on top let me show you

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.200 
just the sensor on top let me show you
what<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.359> mean<00:00:28.250> now<00:00:29.250> some<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> stores<00:00:30.000> are

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
what I mean now some of the stores are

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.700 
what I mean now some of the stores are
gonna<00:00:30.390> sell<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> whole

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
gonna sell it like this as a whole

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.650 
gonna sell it like this as a whole
complete<00:00:32.130> unit<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> camp<00:00:33.180> suits<00:00:33.480> are

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
complete unit you see the camp suits are

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
complete unit you see the camp suits are
on<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> top<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> only<00:00:34.980> way<00:00:35.190> they<00:00:35.370> sell<00:00:35.640> it

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
on the top but the only way they sell it

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.709 
on the top but the only way they sell it
is<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> whole<00:00:36.930> unit<00:00:38.390> it's<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.510> little

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
is with the whole unit it's a little

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.940 
is with the whole unit it's a little
more<00:00:39.870> expensive<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.530> way

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
more expensive that way

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.010 
more expensive that way
and<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.370> do<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.910> change<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and if you do have to change that you

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.520 
and if you do have to change that you
have<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> reset<00:00:44.250> your<00:00:44.430> timing<00:00:44.879> or<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.320> buy

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
have to reset your timing or you can buy

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.139 
have to reset your timing or you can buy
just<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.370> sensor<00:00:49.370> this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.430> since<00:00:50.789> our<00:00:50.910> loan

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
just the sensor this is since our loan

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.670 
just the sensor this is since our loan
can<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.480> changed<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.199> little<00:00:52.500> 10

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
can be changed it's one little 10

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.229 
can be changed it's one little 10
millimeter<00:00:53.190> boat<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.670> folds<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
millimeter boat and it folds and you

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.029 
millimeter boat and it folds and you
don't<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> change<00:00:55.379> or<00:00:55.559> adjust<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
don't have to change or adjust the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.939 
don't have to change or adjust the
timing<00:00:56.629> most<00:00:57.629> stores<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> want<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
timing most stores are going to want to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.209 
timing most stores are going to want to
sell<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> even<00:01:00.120> even<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.719> OEM

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
sell it like this and even even the OEM

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.650 
sell it like this and even even the OEM
that<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.579> yourself<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> customer

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that you can do yourself in a customer

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.270 
that you can do yourself in a customer
favor<00:01:04.170> by<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.890> doing<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> sensor<00:01:07.220> now<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
favor by just doing the sensor now the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.370 
favor by just doing the sensor now the
cam<00:01:08.549> sensor<00:01:08.909> itself<00:01:09.360> held<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
cam sensor itself held on with just a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.020 
cam sensor itself held on with just a
little<00:01:10.650> 10<00:01:10.799> meter<00:01:11.040> 10<00:01:11.760> millimeter<00:01:12.240> bolt<00:01:14.030> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
little 10 meter 10 millimeter bolt you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
little 10 meter 10 millimeter bolt you
simply<00:01:15.420> take<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.840> off<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.229> pull<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> sensor

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
simply take it off and pull the sensor

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.510 
simply take it off and pull the sensor
out<00:01:18.049> otherwise<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.470> change<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.159> whole

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
out otherwise if you change the whole

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.330 
out otherwise if you change the whole
unit<00:01:21.090> you're<00:01:22.080> gonna<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> reset<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.310> your

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
unit you're gonna have to reset all your

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:41.870 
unit you're gonna have to reset all your
timing

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.090 

so<00:01:42.880> there's<00:01:43.120> our<00:01:43.300> old<00:01:43.360> camp<00:01:43.780> sensor<00:01:44.230> and<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.950> new

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
so there's our old camp sensor and a new

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.080 
so there's our old camp sensor and a new
one<00:01:45.310> they're<00:01:45.820> identical<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:47.320> just<00:01:47.530> simply

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
one they're identical and it just simply

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.969 
one they're identical and it just simply
sticks<00:01:49.090> down<00:01:49.330> inside<00:01:49.780> there<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.320> can<00:01:50.500> find<00:01:50.890> the

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
sticks down inside there so can find the

00:01:50.979 --> 00:02:01.000 
sticks down inside there so can find the
reluctor<00:01:51.370> ring<00:01:52.170> let's<00:01:53.170> put<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.410> new<00:01:53.560> one<00:01:53.740> in

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.400 

and<00:02:01.580> when<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.790> do<00:02:01.970> this<00:02:02.240> there's<00:02:02.960> really<00:02:03.170> no

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
and when you do this there's really no

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.640 
and when you do this there's really no
adjustment<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.930> slide<00:02:06.260> it<00:02:06.440> down<00:02:06.590> the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
adjustment to it you slide it down the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.620 
adjustment to it you slide it down the
place<00:02:07.010> it's<00:02:07.280> got<00:02:07.430> an<00:02:07.610> index<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.180> keep<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.540> in

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
place it's got an index to keep it in

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.690 
place it's got an index to keep it in
the<00:02:08.720> right<00:02:08.840> place<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:10.190> put<00:02:10.369> your<00:02:10.490> ten

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
the right place and you put your ten

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.770 
the right place and you put your ten
millimeter<00:02:11.180> bolt<00:02:11.420> back

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.840 

one<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> reasons<00:02:19.860> why<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.520> there's

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
one of the reasons why it's not there's

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.820 
one of the reasons why it's not there's
no<00:02:20.910> judgement<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.810> when<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.110> sits<00:02:22.350> down<00:02:22.590> in

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
no judgement to it when it sits down in

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.010 
no judgement to it when it sits down in
there<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.580> body<00:02:23.820> of<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.210> will<00:02:24.330> only<00:02:24.510> let<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.900> go

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
there the body of it will only let it go

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.530 
there the body of it will only let it go
down<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.440> far<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.520> simply<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.910> magnetic

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
down so far and it's simply a magnetic

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:47.839 
down so far and it's simply a magnetic
pickup

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.300 

now<00:02:48.849> that<00:02:49.060> 10<00:02:49.269> millimeter<00:02:49.689> bolt<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.310> holding

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
now that 10 millimeter bolt is holding

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.949 
now that 10 millimeter bolt is holding
that<00:02:51.459> down<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.329> body<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.659> that<00:02:52.840> is

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
that down and the body of that is

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.500 
that down and the body of that is
plastic<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.220> don't<00:02:54.489> over<00:02:54.849> tighten<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.329> or

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
plastic so don't over tighten it or

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.300 
plastic so don't over tighten it or
you'll<00:02:55.689> crack<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.170> plastic<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.920> make<00:02:57.129> it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
you'll crack the plastic just make it

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.199 
you'll crack the plastic just make it
real<00:02:57.489> good<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.760> snug<00:02:59.549> put<00:03:00.549> your<00:03:00.730> electrical

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
real good and snug put your electrical

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.380 
real good and snug put your electrical
connector<00:03:01.690> back<00:03:01.870> in<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.690> we're<00:03:05.200> done<00:03:05.379> now

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
connector back in and we're done now

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.940 
connector back in and we're done now
we've<00:03:07.390> got<00:03:07.569> our<00:03:07.720> new<00:03:07.930> cam<00:03:08.230> sensor<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:08.799> there

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
we've got our new cam sensor in there

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.660 
we've got our new cam sensor in there
let's<00:03:09.129> start<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.549> car

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.550 

now<00:03:16.240> if<00:03:16.330> you<00:03:16.420> look<00:03:16.600> at<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.140> doesn't<00:03:17.170> look

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
now if you look at this it doesn't look

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.650 
now if you look at this it doesn't look
any<00:03:17.950> difference<00:03:18.490> because<00:03:18.819> our<00:03:18.970> problem<00:03:19.480> was

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
any difference because our problem was

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.020 
any difference because our problem was
just<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.709> cam<00:03:20.950> sensor<00:03:21.310> signal<00:03:21.850> would

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
just that the cam sensor signal would

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.120 
just that the cam sensor signal would
break<00:03:22.270> down

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
break down

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.650 
break down
so<00:03:24.130> now<00:03:24.280> let's<00:03:24.520> break<00:03:24.730> torque<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.360> rev<00:03:25.510> it

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
so now let's break torque it and rev it

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:39.940 
so now let's break torque it and rev it
up<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.020> see<00:03:26.200> how<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.350> does

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.550 

coats<00:03:40.760> are<00:03:41.090> nice<00:03:41.270> to<00:03:41.569> have<00:03:41.780> when<00:03:41.989> we<00:03:42.050> get<00:03:42.319> them

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
coats are nice to have when we get them

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.759 
coats are nice to have when we get them
but<00:03:43.430> when<00:03:43.640> we<00:03:43.790> don't<00:03:44.000> remember<00:03:44.870> critical

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
but when we don't remember critical

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.190 
but when we don't remember critical
thinking<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.400> finding<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.300> evidence<00:03:47.420> will

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
thinking and finding the evidence will

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.280 
thinking and finding the evidence will
lead<00:03:48.379> us<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.830> problem
