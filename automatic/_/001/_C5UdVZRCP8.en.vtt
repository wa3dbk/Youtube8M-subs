00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
works really well like with and you know

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.910 
works really well like with and you know
it<00:02:32.909> doesn't<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.569> don't<00:02:33.599> need<00:02:34.049> glasses<00:02:34.319> which

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
it doesn't you don't need glasses which

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.619 
it doesn't you don't need glasses which
is<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.280> don't<00:02:35.760> even<00:02:35.819> think<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.540> was

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
is I don't even think that like that was

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.240 
is I don't even think that like that was
possible<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.079> have<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.379> an<00:02:37.500> actual<00:02:37.799> 3d

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
possible to have like an actual 3d

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.520 
possible to have like an actual 3d
screen<00:02:38.730> doesn't<00:02:39.060> use<00:02:39.180> glasses<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.840> mean<00:02:40.470> I

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
screen doesn't use glasses I mean I

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.690 
screen doesn't use glasses I mean I
guess<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.769> even<00:02:41.010> if<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.159> don't<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.610> they

guess it even if you don't like it they

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.430 
guess it even if you don't like it they
said<00:02:41.879> that<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:42.209> turn<00:02:42.450> off<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.810> 3d<00:02:43.170> and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
said that you can turn off the 3d and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.830 
said that you can turn off the 3d and
