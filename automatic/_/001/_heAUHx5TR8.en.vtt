is a pretty good technique that I've
come<00:00:18.900> across<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.500> works<00:00:20.279> well<00:00:20.670> for<00:00:22.070> reading

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
come across that works well for reading

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
these books like this and so I'm gonna

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.650 
these books like this and so I'm gonna
make<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> quick<00:00:26.279> video<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.760> kind<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.240> share<00:00:27.420> that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
make a quick video to kind of share that

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.470 
make a quick video to kind of share that
with<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.930> first<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.980> need<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.340> show<00:00:30.210> off<00:00:30.529> what<00:00:31.529> a

with you first I need to show off what a

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.470 
with you first I need to show off what a
omnibus<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> damaged<00:00:34.140> spine<00:00:34.469> would<00:00:35.480> look

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
omnibus with a damaged spine would look

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.810 
omnibus with a damaged spine would look
like<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.410> don't<00:00:37.800> read<00:00:38.340> them<00:00:38.579> correctly

fourth omnibus that I ever got you can
see<00:01:12.650> right<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.430> spine<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.720> kind<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
see right the spine here is kind of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.160 
see right the spine here is kind of
going<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.720> there's<00:01:18.960> some

going in you can see there's some

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.960 
going in you can see there's some
creases<00:01:19.729> in<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:22.340> that's<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:23.670> when

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
creases in there and that's because when

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.740 
creases in there and that's because when
I<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.180> reading<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.540> book<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:26.570> just<00:01:27.570> went

ahead and opened it like that and you
know<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.570> kept<00:01:30.900> reading<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
know I kept reading it like this so you

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.880 
know I kept reading it like this so you
can<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:36.060> what's<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> do

can see what's going on here when you do
that<00:01:38.180> this<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.869> spine<00:01:40.259> forms<00:01:41.009> kind<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.369> lip

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
that this the spine forms kind of a lip

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.940 
that this the spine forms kind of a lip
down<00:01:41.939> there<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:45.290> when<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.380> read<00:01:46.560> through<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
down there and when you read through it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.580 
down there and when you read through it
slowly<00:01:47.270> like<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.689> flipping<00:01:49.170> hundreds<00:01:49.500> of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
slowly like not flipping hundreds of

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.240 
slowly like not flipping hundreds of
pages<00:01:49.740> at<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.040> time<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:51.210> lip<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.920> little

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
pages at a time that lip that little

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.060 
pages at a time that lip that little
pocket<00:01:53.549> that's<00:01:53.970> forming<00:01:54.299> right<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:55.070> folds

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
pocket that's forming right there folds

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.020 
pocket that's forming right there folds
and<00:01:56.250> gets<00:01:56.610> worse<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.329> worse<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:59.030> eventually

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and gets worse and worse and eventually

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.899 
and gets worse and worse and eventually
like<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.079> these<00:02:01.409> creases<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.610> are

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
like you get these creases that are

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.370 
like you get these creases that are
going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> form<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.110> right<00:02:04.350> there

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
going to form like this right there

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
going to form like this right there
where<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.579> folding<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.390> itself<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
where it's like folding on itself at a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.740 
where it's like folding on itself at a
hard<00:02:07.530> angle<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:09.239> don't<00:02:09.390> want<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.690> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
hard angle and you don't want that you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690 
hard angle and you don't want that you
want<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> keep<00:02:10.289> your<00:02:10.440> books<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:11.459> good<00:02:11.640> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
want to keep your books in as good of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.170 
want to keep your books in as good of
condition<00:02:11.910> as<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.480> can

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
condition as you can

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.380 
condition as you can
um<00:02:13.750> now<00:02:14.049> it's<00:02:14.319> not<00:02:14.469> like<00:02:14.859> terribly<00:02:15.730> terribly

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
um now it's not like terribly terribly

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.390 
um now it's not like terribly terribly
noticeable<00:02:17.109> except<00:02:17.739> for<00:02:17.859> the<00:02:17.920> fact<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.189> this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
noticeable except for the fact that this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.339 
noticeable except for the fact that this
has<00:02:18.609> a<00:02:18.640> divot<00:02:19.120> in<00:02:19.329> it<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.659> can<00:02:19.840> clearly

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
has a divot in it that you can clearly

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.640 
has a divot in it that you can clearly
see<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:22.540> still<00:02:22.870> that's<00:02:23.079> that's<00:02:23.500> not

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
see but still that's that's not

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.229 
see but still that's that's not
something<00:02:24.099> that<00:02:24.219> you<00:02:24.370> want<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.879> you're

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
something that you want and you're

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.849 
something that you want and you're
spending<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.959> much<00:02:26.140> money<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.469> one<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.769> these

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
spending that much money on one of these

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.130 
spending that much money on one of these
books<00:02:27.219> that's<00:02:28.090> definitely<00:02:28.780> not<00:02:28.930> something

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
books that's definitely not something

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.649 
books that's definitely not something
that<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.530> want<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.829> see<00:02:29.980> happen<00:02:30.159> so<00:02:31.000> this

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
that you want to see happen so this

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.039 
that you want to see happen so this
technique<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.849> right<00:02:33.849> here<00:02:34.060> I'm<00:02:34.150> I'm<00:02:34.510> using<00:02:34.840> I

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
technique and right here I'm I'm using I

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.720 
technique and right here I'm I'm using I
just<00:02:35.290> got<00:02:35.469> this<00:02:35.620> one<00:02:35.799> I<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.010> took<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.519> out<00:02:36.639> of

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
just got this one I just took it out of

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.209 
just got this one I just took it out of
the<00:02:36.760> plastic<00:02:37.269> wrapping<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.680> new<00:02:38.920> printing

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:39.219 
the plastic wrapping is the new printing

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.890 
the plastic wrapping is the new printing
of<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.310> alias<00:02:39.639> on<00:02:39.790> bliss<00:02:40.060> it's<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.540> little<00:02:40.780> bit

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
of the alias on bliss it's a little bit

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.179 
of the alias on bliss it's a little bit
different<00:02:41.079> because<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.560> spines<00:02:41.859> on<00:02:42.099> the

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
different because the spines on the

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.509 
different because the spines on the
newer<00:02:42.400> books<00:02:42.790> are<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.120> little<00:02:43.540> bit<00:02:43.780> uh<00:02:44.519> they're

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
newer books are a little bit uh they're

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.830 
newer books are a little bit uh they're
made<00:02:45.669> with<00:02:45.790> different<00:02:46.120> material<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.720> it's

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
made with different material so it's

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.750 
made with different material so it's
gonna<00:02:46.959> be<00:02:47.109> a<00:02:47.139> little<00:02:47.349> different<00:02:47.500> but<00:02:47.799> um<00:02:48.010> I'm

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
gonna be a little different but um I'm

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.690 
gonna be a little different but um I'm
going<00:02:48.909> to<00:02:48.970> display<00:02:49.359> with<00:02:50.019> this<00:02:50.200> book<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
going to display with this book the

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.240 
going to display with this book the
reading<00:02:52.329> technique<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.290> will<00:02:53.530> save<00:02:53.950> you

reading technique that will save you
from<00:02:54.280> getting<00:02:54.849> that<00:02:54.879> type<00:02:55.359> of<00:02:55.389> damage<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:57.540> what

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
from getting that type of damage so what

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.990 
from getting that type of damage so what
you're<00:02:58.659> going<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.840> want<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.049> do<00:02:59.879> you're<00:03:00.879> gonna

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
you're going to want to do you're gonna

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.699 
you're going to want to do you're gonna
place<00:03:01.329> this<00:03:01.629> and<00:03:01.930> it's<00:03:02.109> better<00:03:02.290> on<00:03:02.409> a<00:03:02.439> hard

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
place this and it's better on a hard

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.619 
place this and it's better on a hard
surface<00:03:02.889> but<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.760> don't<00:03:03.909> have<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.239> hard<00:03:04.480> surface

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
surface but I don't have a hard surface

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.509 
surface but I don't have a hard surface
as<00:03:05.049> I<00:03:05.139> mentioned<00:03:05.500> you're<00:03:06.069> going<00:03:06.189> to<00:03:06.250> place<00:03:06.489> it

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
as I mentioned you're going to place it

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.940 
as I mentioned you're going to place it
spine<00:03:07.180> down<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.719> then<00:03:08.469> you're<00:03:08.620> just<00:03:08.769> going<00:03:08.919> to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
spine down and then you're just going to

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.390 
spine down and then you're just going to
let<00:03:09.189> the<00:03:09.609> covers<00:03:10.120> go<00:03:10.299> down<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:11.250> then<00:03:12.250> you're

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
let the covers go down and then you're

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.699 
let the covers go down and then you're
going<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.579> slowly<00:03:14.069> put<00:03:15.069> down<00:03:15.250> some<00:03:15.519> pages<00:03:16.709> just

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
going to slowly put down some pages just

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.110 
going to slowly put down some pages just
a<00:03:17.739> few<00:03:17.949> pages<00:03:18.129> at<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> time<00:03:18.489> not<00:03:19.209> too<00:03:19.449> much<00:03:21.120> and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
a few pages at a time not too much and

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.550 
a few pages at a time not too much and
so<00:03:22.239> you're<00:03:22.359> going<00:03:22.479> to<00:03:22.540> keep<00:03:22.690> doing<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.079> and

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
so you're going to keep doing that and

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.729 
so you're going to keep doing that and
keep<00:03:24.280> doing<00:03:24.639> that<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.199> that's<00:03:26.199> going<00:03:26.409> to<00:03:26.470> help

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
keep doing that and that's going to help

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.819 
keep doing that and that's going to help
you<00:03:27.840> kind<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.959> relax<00:03:29.919> that<00:03:30.189> spine<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:32.560> good

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
you kind of relax that spine in a good

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.179 
you kind of relax that spine in a good
direction<00:03:34.139> it's<00:03:35.139> not<00:03:35.229> going<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.590> be<00:03:35.769> leaning

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:36.189 
direction it's not going to be leaning

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.149 
direction it's not going to be leaning
on<00:03:36.310> one<00:03:36.340> side<00:03:36.849> or<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.090> other<00:03:37.439> it's<00:03:38.439> it's<00:03:38.979> going

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
on one side or the other it's it's going

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.469 
on one side or the other it's it's going
to<00:03:39.220> be<00:03:39.280> relaxed<00:03:39.970> right<00:03:40.359> in<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.659> middle<00:03:40.870> so

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
to be relaxed right in the middle so

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.909 
to be relaxed right in the middle so
you're<00:03:43.479> not<00:03:43.689> going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.959> get<00:03:44.079> a<00:03:44.139> crease<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:44.829> the

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
you're not going to get a crease on the

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.899 
you're not going to get a crease on the
spine<00:03:46.709> now<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:47.979> is<00:03:48.159> obviously<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.790> is

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
spine now this is obviously this is

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.399 
spine now this is obviously this is
going<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.090> be<00:03:49.209> more<00:03:49.629> detrimental<00:03:49.870> for<00:03:50.199> a

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
going to be more detrimental for a

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.059 
going to be more detrimental for a
bigger<00:03:50.620> book<00:03:50.889> and<00:03:51.159> this<00:03:51.370> alias<00:03:51.879> omnibus<00:03:52.299> is

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
bigger book and this alias omnibus is

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.189 
bigger book and this alias omnibus is
only<00:03:54.069> you<00:03:54.459> know<00:03:54.549> about<00:03:54.669> 30<00:03:55.060> issues<00:03:55.479> long<00:03:55.780> so

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
only you know about 30 issues long so

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:01.009 
only you know about 30 issues long so
it's<00:03:56.379> not<00:03:57.060> too<00:03:58.060> much<00:03:58.329> to<00:03:58.599> be<00:03:58.750> worried<00:03:59.049> about

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
it's not too much to be worried about

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.869 
it's not too much to be worried about
but<00:04:02.430> on<00:04:03.430> something<00:04:04.030> big<00:04:04.239> like<00:04:04.629> the<00:04:05.879> Infinity

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.159 
middle and you see that that in the
middle<00:04:22.090> there's<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.539> pocket<00:04:22.990> right<00:04:23.139> there

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
middle there's that pocket right there

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.750 
middle there's that pocket right there
and<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:24.039> naturally<00:04:24.639> forms<00:04:25.000> so<00:04:25.210> now

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
and that naturally forms so now

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.250 
and that naturally forms so now
if<00:04:25.970> I'm<00:04:26.120> reading<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:28.420> it's<00:04:29.420> gonna<00:04:29.600> already

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
if I'm reading it it's gonna already

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.220 
if I'm reading it it's gonna already
have<00:04:30.710> that<00:04:30.920> natural<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:32.180> know<00:04:32.210> this<00:04:32.870> side

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
have that natural you know this side

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.370 
have that natural you know this side
right<00:04:33.500> here<00:04:33.560> where<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.280> stitching<00:04:34.670> is<00:04:34.850> is

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
right here where the stitching is is

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.590 
right here where the stitching is is
going<00:04:36.380> to<00:04:36.470> have<00:04:36.760> been<00:04:37.760> relaxed<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.360> little<00:04:38.450> bit

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
going to have been relaxed a little bit

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.620 
going to have been relaxed a little bit
and<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.770> outer<00:04:40.010> spine<00:04:40.490> is<00:04:40.820> gonna<00:04:41.330> stay

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
and the outer spine is gonna stay

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.430 
and the outer spine is gonna stay
straight<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:43.480> that's<00:04:44.480> what<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:44.810> want<00:04:45.080> that

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
straight and that's what you want that

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.200 
straight and that's what you want that
stitching<00:04:45.950> should<00:04:45.980> be<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.370> part<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:46.880> curves

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
stitching should be the part that curves

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.120 
stitching should be the part that curves
not<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.930> outer<00:04:48.110> spine<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.680> outer<00:04:48.830> spine

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
not the outer spine the outer spine

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.010 
not the outer spine the outer spine
should<00:04:49.370> not<00:04:50.410> curve<00:04:51.410> inward<00:04:51.950> it<00:04:52.160> shouldn't

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
should not curve inward it shouldn't

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.450 
should not curve inward it shouldn't
like<00:04:54.020> on<00:04:54.170> on<00:04:54.470> that<00:04:54.650> my<00:04:54.770> teeth<00:04:54.950> or<00:04:55.130> when<00:04:55.280> I<00:04:55.340> was

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
like on on that my teeth or when I was

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.550 
like on on that my teeth or when I was
showing<00:04:55.640> you<00:04:55.820> when<00:04:56.060> I<00:04:56.090> read<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:57.350> first

time<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.770> read<00:04:57.920> it<00:04:58.070> it<00:04:58.220> would<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.760> outer<00:04:58.970> spine

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
time I read it it would the outer spine

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.840 
time I read it it would the outer spine
would<00:04:59.930> come<00:05:00.170> and<00:05:00.410> curve<00:05:00.650> with<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.400> stitching

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
would come and curve with the stitching

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.030 
would come and curve with the stitching
and<00:05:01.970> that's<00:05:02.630> not<00:05:02.780> what<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:03.050> want<00:05:03.260> you<00:05:03.470> want<00:05:03.890> it

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
actually going to read you should

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.360 
actually going to read you should
probably<00:06:03.140> do<00:06:03.350> something<00:06:03.380> like<00:06:03.770> this<00:06:03.920> if<00:06:04.160> you

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
probably do something like this if you

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.650 
probably do something like this if you

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
have to stretch that one out and make

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.110 
have to stretch that one out and make
sure<00:06:20.750> that<00:06:20.960> it<00:06:21.290> doesn't<00:06:21.860> get<00:06:22.190> that<00:06:22.460> crease<00:06:22.910> on

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
sure that it doesn't get that crease on

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.260 
sure that it doesn't get that crease on
the<00:06:23.240> spine<00:06:23.680> I<00:06:24.680> do<00:06:25.100> think<00:06:25.580> that<00:06:25.640> Marvel's

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
the spine I do think that Marvel's

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.330 
the spine I do think that Marvel's
spines<00:06:26.960> that<00:06:27.110> what<00:06:27.380> they<00:06:27.500> changed<00:06:27.890> to<00:06:28.070> as

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
spines that what they changed to as

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.130 
spines that what they changed to as
opposed<00:06:28.760> to<00:06:28.910> the<00:06:29.000> really<00:06:29.240> like<00:06:29.480> these<00:06:29.630> are<00:06:29.810> its

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
opposed to the really like these are its

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.020 
opposed to the really like these are its
thicker<00:06:30.620> so<00:06:31.310> I<00:06:31.370> think<00:06:31.430> there's<00:06:31.670> less<00:06:31.820> of<00:06:31.880> a

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
thicker so I think there's less of a

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.010 
thicker so I think there's less of a
chance<00:06:32.060> for<00:06:32.270> that<00:06:32.390> to<00:06:32.480> happen<00:06:32.600> but<00:06:32.720> if<00:06:32.900> you're

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
chance for that to happen but if you're

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.420 
chance for that to happen but if you're
ordering<00:06:33.200> some<00:06:33.590> of<00:06:33.650> the<00:06:33.710> older<00:06:33.980> ones<00:06:34.160> if<00:06:34.340> you

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
ordering some of the older ones if you

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.530 
ordering some of the older ones if you
have<00:06:34.640> that<00:06:34.820> my<00:06:35.000> teeth<00:06:35.150> or<00:06:35.420> if<00:06:35.630> you<00:06:36.260> have

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
have that my teeth or if you have

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.140 
have that my teeth or if you have

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
spider-man New Avengers the older ones

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.710 
spider-man New Avengers the older ones
before<00:06:43.830> they<00:06:44.100> changed<00:06:44.550> the<00:06:44.820> the<00:06:45.330> way<00:06:45.450> that<00:06:45.630> the

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
before they changed the the way that the

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.360 
before they changed the the way that the
covers<00:06:45.990> looked<00:06:46.260> then<00:06:46.680> you<00:06:46.830> definitely<00:06:47.100> want

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
covers looked then you definitely want

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.800 
covers looked then you definitely want
to<00:06:47.520> do<00:06:47.670> that<00:06:47.790> because<00:06:47.940> those<00:06:48.300> are<00:06:48.600> more

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
to do that because those are more

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.090 
to do that because those are more
susceptible<00:06:49.560> to<00:06:50.240> folding<00:06:51.240> now<00:06:52.200> if<00:06:52.380> you<00:06:52.500> have<00:06:52.770> a

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
susceptible to folding now if you have a

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.480 
susceptible to folding now if you have a
glued<00:06:53.400> volume<00:06:53.820> like<00:06:54.180> a<00:06:54.450> lot<00:06:55.350> of<00:06:55.440> DC's<00:06:55.860> omnibus

the<00:07:02.490> Hawkman<00:07:02.940> one<00:07:03.150> then<00:07:03.360> you<00:07:03.450> don't<00:07:03.480> have<00:07:03.630> to

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
the Hawkman one then you don't have to

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.850 
the Hawkman one then you don't have to
worry<00:07:03.900> about<00:07:04.110> it<00:07:04.230> because<00:07:04.470> that<00:07:04.500> stuff

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
worry about it because that stuff

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.370 
worry about it because that stuff
doesn't<00:07:05.040> even<00:07:05.250> go<00:07:06.210> it<00:07:06.420> you're<00:07:07.020> not<00:07:07.140> going<00:07:07.320> to
