and I get a free cake with messy and I
don't<00:00:47.550> know<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> guess<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.420> counts<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.960> messes

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
don't know I guess that counts as messes

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.139 
don't know I guess that counts as messes
goal<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> didn't<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.190> way<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
goal I didn't see that way it was a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.590 
goal I didn't see that way it was a
deflection<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.079> nonetheless<00:00:52.260> one-nil<00:00:53.600> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
deflection but nonetheless one-nil the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.540 
deflection but nonetheless one-nil the
computer<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.170> pretty<00:00:55.440> easy<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.800> guess<00:00:55.860> since

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
computer was pretty easy I guess since

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.400 
computer was pretty easy I guess since
it's<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.910> first<00:00:56.940> ever<00:00:57.449> match<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:58.020> ultimate
