00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:20.420
 and here's the ritz in minecraft and today you 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.759
 I bring a new tutorial that I'm going to 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.480
 explain how to make transport in 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.939
 minecraft 6 and transport that is very 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.780
 technological, because the truth is that 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.480
 so let's see how it's done between 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.720
 transports we need 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.600
 Obsidian we need a milkman to 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.059
 turn on the portal and as you see I've 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.900
 put the coordinates so you can 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:52.730
 see where where I'm coordinates I'm 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:01:00.579
 then we are going to give you the portal here and 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:05.110
 remember 95 257 and we go to the never 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.320
 to see if I leave quickly is taking 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.320
 much 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:12.360
 if we leave now 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.330
 well me while I 'm writing in the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.680
 read we have left in X 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.340
 - 1 and in zeta 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.340
 44 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.600
 all right 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.780
 Now the next thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.630
 travel so this part I'm going to 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.890
 accelerate a little bit I guess expose 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.290
 I'll put the typical 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.810
 nor uncut out there flying so we 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.960
 we see in more distant coordinates or until 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.960
 now 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.789
 good as you see I found here with 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.759
 a wall 879 I think it's 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.060
 enough 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.400
 far to where it has gone to be done 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.920
 notice in a portal so let's do 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.129
 our you read the parts so simple 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.510
 how to make a portal and let me know 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.510
 put the coordinates 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.360
 perhaps never 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.360
 x 879 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.300
 remember that you are going to have to walk 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.030
 pretty in it 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.340
 in the never but now you will see that 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.640
 the play goes well we give it again to the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.640
 portal 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.960
 we already have inside this world 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:57.460
 download interest if there is something already 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.460
 come, come, come, come 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.080
 well today you do not have a coordinates a 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.080
 little bit 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.920
 a little 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.990
 strange as well as this tremendous 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.990
 book that has given me this 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.530
 now now let's go do not have any 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.400
 coordinates a little bit exaggeratedly 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.280
 high, if I would put here what is the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.030
 proportion of 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.240
 for example, that you give yourself cubes in 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.800
 the dawn and you leave so many so 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:46.230
 let's check the portal 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.230
 land that has left us in x 7 thousand 72 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.060
 in z 553 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.900
 and as you can see we have advanced 7000 blocks 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.840
 when we really just advanced are 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.629
 900 then the truth is that this is 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.110
 ideal and good you see that I came out in a 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.450
 grotto in the biome in the ocean nothing 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.420
 I hope you liked the tutorial 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.610
 that now our games are 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.169
 rival to travel faster to 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.820
 find new and new lands 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:23.150
 Languages 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.150
 and nothing we see this other
