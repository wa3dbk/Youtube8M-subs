00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
yourself you were gonna want to do

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.310 
yourself you were gonna want to do
things<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> certain<00:00:57.870> order<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.199> make<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
things in a certain order to make it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.549 
things in a certain order to make it
easier<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.859> found<00:00:59.449> not<00:01:00.449> setting<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.899> snare<00:01:01.230> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
easier I found not setting a snare and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.160 
easier I found not setting a snare and
the<00:01:02.550> bait<00:01:02.910> first<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> best<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> go

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the bait first was the best way to go

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.870 
the bait first was the best way to go
because<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> other<00:01:05.760> way

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
because if you do it the other way

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
because if you do it the other way
around<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.540> got<00:01:06.689> down<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.530> last

lives<00:05:31.360> for<00:05:31.569> baby<00:05:31.780> to<00:05:31.930> you<00:05:32.080> for<00:05:32.259> Disney

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.129 

you

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.320 

and<00:05:44.139> there's<00:05:44.409> number<00:05:44.770> five<00:05:45.029> so<00:05:46.029> go<00:05:46.119> ahead<00:05:46.179> and

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
and there's number five so go ahead and

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:55.079 
and there's number five so go ahead and
run<00:05:46.389> on<00:05:46.539> back<00:05:46.749> to<00:05:46.929> the<00:05:46.990> checkpoint<00:05:53.999> after<00:05:54.999> this

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:55.089 
run on back to the checkpoint after this

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:56.269 
run on back to the checkpoint after this
would<00:05:55.240> be<00:05:55.300> a<00:05:55.330> little<00:05:55.449> quick<00:05:55.629> time<00:05:55.809> sequence

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:56.279 
would be a little quick time sequence

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.559 
would be a little quick time sequence
turns<00:05:57.279> out<00:05:57.459> this<00:05:57.610> bears<00:05:57.879> not<00:05:58.089> that<00:05:58.270> friendly

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
turns out this bears not that friendly

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.919

and<00:05:59.069> then<00:06:00.069> you<00:06:00.189> run<00:06:00.539> that's<00:06:01.539> pretty<00:06:01.749> much<00:06:01.869> a

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:01.929 
and then you run that's pretty much a

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:04.169 
and then you run that's pretty much a
wrap<00:06:02.169> for<00:06:02.439> this<00:06:02.559> part<00:06:02.979> of<00:06:03.039> the<00:06:03.099> sequence<00:06:03.459> so

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:04.179 
wrap for this part of the sequence so

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:05.219 
wrap for this part of the sequence so
