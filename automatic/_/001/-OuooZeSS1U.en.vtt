 announced interesting titles but who is 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.900
 is lost too much in ads less 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.840
 important and above all by car 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.620
 very useless compliments 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.150

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.500
 microsoft conference was the most 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.630
