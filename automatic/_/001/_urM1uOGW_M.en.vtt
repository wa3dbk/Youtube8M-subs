00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.760 

my<00:01:03.620> last<00:01:03.830> I'm<00:01:04.190> Rafi<00:01:05.050> t-that<00:01:06.050> I<00:01:06.080> basically

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
my last I'm Rafi t-that I basically

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.680

named<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.400> there's<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.360> couple<00:01:08.570> of

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
named it that there's a couple of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.420 
named it that there's a couple of
different<00:01:09.020> meanings<00:01:09.140> like<00:01:09.650> when<00:01:10.190> you<00:01:10.250> think

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
different meanings like when you think

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.280 
different meanings like when you think
about<00:01:10.490> graffiti<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:11.240> think<00:01:11.480> about<00:01:11.660> art<00:01:11.930> but

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290
