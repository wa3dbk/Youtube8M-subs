00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
here and you know if you open it up you

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.130 
here and you know if you open it up you
can<00:03:15.560> see<00:03:15.800> that<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.910> know<00:03:16.970> there's<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.239> DVD<00:03:17.870> in

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
can see that you know there's a DVD in

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.940 
can see that you know there's a DVD in
each<00:03:18.650> one<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:18.950> these<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:21.350> reason<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:21.739> brought

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
each one of these the reason I brought

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.710 
each one of these the reason I brought
this<00:03:22.160> up<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.640> not<00:03:22.880> only<00:03:23.060> because<00:03:23.330> I<00:03:23.360> actually

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
this up is not only because I actually

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.350 
this up is not only because I actually
have<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.380> my<00:03:24.590> hands<00:03:25.220> physically<00:03:26.000> but<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:28.360> think

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
have it my hands physically but I think

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.630 
have it my hands physically but I think
that<00:03:29.600> it's<00:03:30.200> going<00:03:30.799> to<00:03:31.040> be<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.190> very<00:03:31.280> useful

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
that it's going to be a very useful

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.820 
that it's going to be a very useful
program<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.330> first<00:03:32.540> few<00:03:32.720> videos<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.410> was<00:03:33.650> not

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
program the first few videos I was not

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.280 
program the first few videos I was not
highly<00:03:34.400> impressed<00:03:34.970> with<00:03:35.209> but<00:03:35.750> that's<00:03:35.870> not<00:03:36.049> to

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
highly impressed with but that's not to

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.690 
highly impressed with but that's not to
say<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.530> know<00:03:36.769> there's<00:03:37.100> some<00:03:37.160> stuff<00:03:37.459> in<00:03:37.640> here

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219 
does to pick a market build a web page

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.129 
does to pick a market build a web page
build<00:05:46.029> links<00:05:46.240> to<00:05:46.449> that<00:05:46.569> page<00:05:46.810> give<00:05:47.080> this

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
build links to that page give this

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.409 
build links to that page give this
number<00:05:47.409> one<00:05:47.650> find<00:05:48.610> out<00:05:48.789> whether<00:05:49.000> it<00:05:49.210> does<00:05:49.389> or

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
number one find out whether it does or

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.659 
number one find out whether it does or
doesn't<00:05:49.750> make<00:05:50.020> money<00:05:50.289> and<00:05:50.560> then<00:05:51.009> what<00:05:51.370> do<00:05:51.520> we

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
doesn't make money and then what do we

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
do with it from there I'm going to show

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.350 
do with it from there I'm going to show
you<00:05:53.080> guys<00:05:53.199> those<00:05:53.589> things<00:05:53.860> I<00:05:54.099> was<00:05:54.789> talking<00:05:55.000> to<00:05:55.240> a

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
you guys those things I was talking to a

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.709 
you guys those things I was talking to a
client<00:05:56.169> just<00:05:56.349> yesterday<00:05:56.860> on<00:05:56.949> the<00:05:56.979> phone<00:05:57.719> you

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
client just yesterday on the phone you

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.769 
client just yesterday on the phone you
know<00:05:58.839> a<00:05:58.870> member<00:05:59.199> from<00:05:59.409> solitary<00:06:00.250> calm<00:06:00.639> and<00:06:00.909> I

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
know a member from solitary calm and I

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.679 
know a member from solitary calm and I
began<00:06:02.139> to<00:06:02.289> realize<00:06:02.500> that<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:03.189> probably<00:06:03.659> need<00:06:04.659> to

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:04.689 
began to realize that I probably need to

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.499 
began to realize that I probably need to
system<00:06:05.560> and<00:06:05.729> systematize<00:06:06.729> these<00:06:07.180> things

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
system and systematize these things

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.369 
system and systematize these things
these<00:06:08.319> processes<00:06:09.159> and<00:06:09.430> in<00:06:10.360> fact<00:06:10.599> I<00:06:10.779> think<00:06:10.839> you

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379 
these processes and in fact I think you

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.019 
these processes and in fact I think you
know<00:06:11.500> that<00:06:11.529> client<00:06:12.099> even<00:06:12.189> mentioned<00:06:12.729> that<00:06:12.879> i

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:13.029 
know that client even mentioned that i

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:15.649 
know that client even mentioned that i
put<00:06:13.449> together<00:06:13.569> a<00:06:13.810> program<00:06:14.080> and<00:06:14.409> sell<00:06:14.650> it<00:06:14.830> and

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
put together a program and sell it and

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.579 
put together a program and sell it and
you<00:06:16.659> know<00:06:16.750> honestly<00:06:16.930> I<00:06:17.199> don't<00:06:17.259> really<00:06:17.469> think

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:17.589 
you know honestly I don't really think

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:20.339 
you know honestly I don't really think
that's<00:06:17.979> what<00:06:18.219> I<00:06:18.250> want<00:06:18.550> to<00:06:18.639> do<00:06:18.759> because<00:06:19.349> you

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
that's what I want to do because you

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:21.779 
that's what I want to do because you
know<00:06:20.439> I<00:06:20.500> want<00:06:20.650> to<00:06:20.680> give<00:06:20.830> you<00:06:20.860> an<00:06:21.069> example<00:06:21.460> of
