00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
pressed dirt it's going to be kind of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.000 
pressed dirt it's going to be kind of
like<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.980> dirt<00:00:44.480> block<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.469> create<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.800> dirt

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
like a dirt block that can create a dirt

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
like a dirt block that can create a dirt
path<00:00:47.480> it's<00:00:48.480> pretty<00:00:48.719> much<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.050> pretty<00:00:49.200> much

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
path it's pretty much it's pretty much

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
path it's pretty much it's pretty much
like<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.440> normal<00:00:49.980> dirt<00:00:50.309> grass<00:00:50.700> block<00:00:51.000> except

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
like a normal dirt grass block except

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
like a normal dirt grass block except
like<00:00:51.690> remove<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> grass<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.649> pretty<00:00:52.829> much

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
like remove the grass that's pretty much

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.619 
like remove the grass that's pretty much
all<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> normal<00:00:54.270> dirt

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
all this but it's not like a normal dirt

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.119 
all this but it's not like a normal dirt
block<00:00:54.840> because<00:00:54.989> normal<00:00:55.379> dirt<00:00:55.530> block<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.949> as

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
block because normal dirt block is as

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.819 
block because normal dirt block is as
big<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.610> guess<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.090> grass<00:00:57.390> block<00:00:57.829> accepted

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
big I guess as the grass block accepted

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.619 
big I guess as the grass block accepted
it's<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.280> dirt<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.760> top<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.149> sort<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.420> grass

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
it's just dirt on top and sort of grass

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.029 
it's just dirt on top and sort of grass
but<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.980> be

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
but this one is actually going to be

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.619 
but this one is actually going to be
just<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.250> no<00:01:02.670> grass<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.329> gonna<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.570> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
just like no grass and it's gonna have a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.729 
just like no grass and it's gonna have a
better<00:01:03.809> layer<00:01:03.960> cut<00:01:04.229> off<00:01:04.350> its<00:01:04.470> gonna<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
better layer cut off its gonna be a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.160 
better layer cut off its gonna be a
little<00:01:04.830> bit<00:01:04.979> lower<00:01:05.729> than<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> normal<00:01:06.479> block

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
little bit lower than a normal block

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.010 
little bit lower than a normal block
than<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> normal<00:01:07.650> grass<00:01:08.400> block<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.720> use

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
than a normal grass block so you can use

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.130 
than a normal grass block so you can use
it<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> road<00:01:11.299> like<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> dirt<00:01:12.600> road<00:01:12.750> dirt

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
it as like a road like a dirt road dirt

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.370 
it as like a road like a dirt road dirt
path<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:14.400> may<00:01:14.729> replace<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.630> gravel<00:01:16.110> paths

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
path and it may replace the gravel paths

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
path and it may replace the gravel paths
in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.740> villages<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.340> instead<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.759> when

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
in the villages so instead of like when

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.070 
in the villages so instead of like when
you<00:01:18.000> go<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> villages<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.689> know<00:01:18.720> there's<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
you go to villages you know there's the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.200 
you go to villages you know there's the
roads<00:01:19.290> are<00:01:19.530> made<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:20.189> gravel<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.090> now

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
roads are made from gravel right but now

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.700 
roads are made from gravel right but now
it<00:01:21.360> might<00:01:21.479> actually<00:01:21.720> made<00:01:22.140> from<00:01:22.170> those<00:01:22.500> new

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it might actually made from those new

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.249 
it might actually made from those new
blocks<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> press<00:01:23.400> dirt<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:25.080> are

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
blocks the press dirt and there are

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.149 
blocks the press dirt and there are
going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.530> some<00:01:25.680> pictures<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
path leading from the tree over to us

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.969 
path leading from the tree over to us
and<00:01:45.390> over<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.470> picture<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> actually

right here in a tweet the picture is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.990 
right here in a tweet the picture is
actually<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.800> village<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.670> Minecraft

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
actually of a village in Minecraft

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.699 
actually of a village in Minecraft
Pocket<00:02:27.270> Edition<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.840> actually<00:02:28.380> uses<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
Pocket Edition that actually uses the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.110 
Pocket Edition that actually uses the
actual<00:02:29.840> press<00:02:30.840> third<00:02:31.140> path<00:02:32.040> road<00:02:32.700> blocks

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
actual press third path road blocks

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.030 
actual press third path road blocks
instead<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.990> gravel<00:02:34.350> for<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.560> villages<00:02:34.920> and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
instead of gravel for the villages and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.130 
instead of gravel for the villages and
honestly<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.510> Bible<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.050> I

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
honestly like in this Bible because I

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.810 
honestly like in this Bible because I
think<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.560> savanna<00:02:37.860> biome<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.430> think

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
think this is the savanna biome I think

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.150 
think this is the savanna biome I think
yet<00:02:39.000> because<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.300> see<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> Keysha<00:02:39.810> wood<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:40.920> it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
yet because I see a Keysha wood so it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.130 
yet because I see a Keysha wood so it
doesn't<00:02:41.459> actually<00:02:41.580> look<00:02:42.480> too<00:02:42.690> good<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.989> me<00:02:43.110> I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
doesn't actually look too good to me I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.420 
doesn't actually look too good to me I
think<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.590> would<00:02:43.680> look<00:02:43.770> better<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.280> normal

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
think it would look better in a normal

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.100 
think it would look better in a normal
like<00:02:44.670> Plains<00:02:44.970> biome<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.930> this

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
like Plains biome but in this in this

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.690 
like Plains biome but in this in this
specific<00:02:46.560> volume<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.920> doesn't<00:02:47.130> like<00:02:47.250> look

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
specific volume it doesn't like look

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.430 
specific volume it doesn't like look
that<00:02:47.730> great<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.239> me<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.510> hopefully<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:49.050> don't

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
that great to me so hopefully I don't

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.860 
that great to me so hopefully I don't
know<00:02:49.530> there's<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.770> way<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.010> change<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.690> for<00:02:51.690> but

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
know there's a way to change it for but

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.780 
know there's a way to change it for but
for<00:02:52.110> each<00:02:52.230> biome<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.890> press<00:02:53.430> dirt<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
for each biome for the press dirt to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.830 
for each biome for the press dirt to
look<00:02:53.910> different<00:02:54.090> because<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.570> just<00:02:54.660> doesn't

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
look different because it just doesn't

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.690 
look different because it just doesn't
fit<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> savanna<00:02:55.440> biome<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.220> think

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
fit the savanna biome like this I think

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.170 
fit the savanna biome like this I think
it<00:02:56.790> fit<00:02:56.940> Plains<00:02:57.510> biome<00:02:57.570> but<00:02:57.870> definitely<00:02:58.200> not<00:02:58.260> a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
it fit Plains biome but definitely not a

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.280 
it fit Plains biome but definitely not a
savanna<00:03:00.180> biome<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.600> anyway<00:03:00.840> just<00:03:00.989> give<00:03:01.170> your

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
savanna biome so anyway just give your

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.390 
savanna biome so anyway just give your
thoughts<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.680> what<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.890> think<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.220> press

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
thoughts on what you think of the press

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.820 
thoughts on what you think of the press
third<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.850> at<00:03:03.480> how<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.590> looks<00:03:04.739> in

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
third and at how you think it looks in

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.199 
third and at how you think it looks in
the<00:03:04.890> Savannah<00:03:05.160> bomb<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:05.519> I'm<00:03:05.700> not<00:03:06.060> so

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
the Savannah bomb because I'm not so

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.930 
the Savannah bomb because I'm not so
sure<00:03:06.239> about<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.750> but<00:03:06.780> let's<00:03:07.380> just<00:03:07.590> move<00:03:07.739> on<00:03:07.940> to

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
sure about it but let's just move on to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.180 
sure about it but let's just move on to

discuss and the next thing and that is
boats<00:03:11.610> there's<00:03:11.880> more<00:03:12.030> information<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.510> boats

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
boats there's more information on boats

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.380 
boats there's more information on boats
we<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.380> been<00:03:13.470> anticipating<00:03:14.010> boats<00:03:14.280> for<00:03:14.580> too

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
we have been anticipating boats for too

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.940 
we have been anticipating boats for too
long<00:03:15.570> now<00:03:15.630> it's<00:03:15.989> Ben's<00:03:16.140> been<00:03:16.350> too<00:03:16.500> long<00:03:16.800> I

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
long now it's Ben's been too long I

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.350 
long now it's Ben's been too long I
think<00:03:17.160> they<00:03:17.250> started<00:03:17.519> they<00:03:17.730> first<00:03:18.000> mentioned

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
think they started they first mentioned

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.720 
think they started they first mentioned
it<00:03:18.450> after<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.900> 0.9<00:03:19.350> came<00:03:19.620> out<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.010> it's<00:03:20.519> been

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
it after the 0.9 came out so it's been

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.220 
it after the 0.9 came out so it's been
it's<00:03:20.910> been<00:03:21.000> over<00:03:21.329> half<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.690> year<00:03:21.720> since<00:03:22.079> we've

it's been over half a year since we've

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.590 
it's been over half a year since we've
been<00:03:22.320> talking<00:03:22.620> about<00:03:22.650> boats<00:03:23.390> so<00:03:24.390> as<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.510> can

and he tweeted out trying to make boats
have<00:03:27.810> two<00:03:28.019> riders<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.739> walk<00:03:29.400> though<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
have two riders is a walk though the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.360 
have two riders is a walk though the
most<00:03:30.600> arcane<00:03:30.900> code<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.920> it's<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.130> walk<00:03:32.340> in

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
most arcane code so it's like a walk in

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.130 
most arcane code so it's like a walk in
the<00:03:32.459> park<00:03:32.519> it's<00:03:32.850> easy<00:03:33.060> but<00:03:33.360> it's<00:03:33.630> just<00:03:33.930> weird

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
the park it's easy but it's just weird

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.530 
the park it's easy but it's just weird
really<00:03:34.470> weird<00:03:34.560> code<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.010> guess<00:03:35.280> for<00:03:35.430> him<00:03:35.579> but

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
really weird code I guess for him but

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.170 
really weird code I guess for him but
maybe<00:03:36.690> maybe<00:03:37.140> it'll<00:03:37.500> work<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.220> he'll<00:03:38.730> he<00:03:38.970> he

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
maybe maybe it'll work and he'll he he

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.410 
maybe maybe it'll work and he'll he he
actually<00:03:39.269> posted<00:03:39.690> three<00:03:39.870> screenshots<00:03:40.320> on

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
actually posted three screenshots on

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.990 
actually posted three screenshots on
including<00:03:42.890> him<00:03:43.890> working<00:03:44.250> on<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.610> he<00:03:44.850> says

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
including him working on and he says

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.460 
including him working on and he says
right<00:03:45.180> here<00:03:45.209> now<00:03:45.600> that's<00:03:45.870> better<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.380> he's

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
right here now that's better and he's

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.580 
right here now that's better and he's
actually<00:03:46.980> has<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.670> wolf<00:03:48.180> pup<00:03:48.900> or<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.140> nun<00:03:49.380> wolf

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
actually has a wolf pup or a nun wolf

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.170 
actually has a wolf pup or a nun wolf
pup<00:03:49.829> just<00:03:49.860> like<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.130> wolf<00:03:50.400> with<00:03:50.670> him<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.060> the

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
pup just like a wolf with him in the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.819 
pup just like a wolf with him in the
boat<00:03:51.329> like<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> back<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.170> guess<00:03:52.350> that's

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
boat like in the back so I guess that's

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.140 
boat like in the back so I guess that's
probably<00:03:53.100> an<00:03:53.519> awesome<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:53.940> she<00:03:54.030> can

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
probably an awesome that she can

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.370 
probably an awesome that she can
actually<00:03:54.390> put<00:03:54.590> wolf<00:03:55.590> son<00:03:56.570> or<00:03:57.570> your<00:03:57.690> dogs<00:03:58.140> or

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
actually put wolf son or your dogs or

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.410 
actually put wolf son or your dogs or
whatever<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:58.890> your<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.519> your<00:03:59.760> boat<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.299> can

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
whatever in your in your boat so you can

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.910 
whatever in your in your boat so you can
travel<00:04:00.600> with<00:04:00.780> them<00:04:00.959> if<00:04:01.049> you'd<00:04:01.170> go<00:04:01.470> anywhere<00:04:01.500> so

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
travel with them if you'd go anywhere so

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.949 
travel with them if you'd go anywhere so
that's<00:04:02.100> that's<00:04:02.340> pretty<00:04:02.459> awesome<00:04:02.780> as<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.870> can

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
that's that's pretty awesome as you can

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.690 
that's that's pretty awesome as you can
see<00:04:04.079> right<00:04:04.110> here<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.769> guess<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.400> this

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
see right here and I guess that this

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.030 
see right here and I guess that this
also<00:04:05.910> means<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.209> there<00:04:06.390> you'll<00:04:06.510> be<00:04:06.540> able<00:04:06.630> to

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
also means that there you'll be able to

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.340 
also means that there you'll be able to
Italy<00:04:08.040> be<00:04:08.160> able<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.670> put<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.940> two<00:04:09.390> people<00:04:09.720> that'd

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
Italy be able to put a two people that'd

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.650 
Italy be able to put a two people that'd
be<00:04:10.410> pretty<00:04:10.530> cool<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:10.890> well<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.390> i'm<00:04:12.390> not<00:04:12.480> sure

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
be pretty cool as well and i'm not sure

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.090 
be pretty cool as well and i'm not sure
if<00:04:12.870> he<00:04:12.959> measures<00:04:13.260> in<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.470> future<00:04:13.739> tweets<00:04:13.950> i'm

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
if he measures in the future tweets i'm

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.830 
if he measures in the future tweets i'm
just<00:04:14.220> going<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.370> mention<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.730> now<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.540> buttons

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
just going to mention it now the buttons

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.900 
just going to mention it now the buttons
on<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.049> left<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.530> right<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.919> see<00:04:16.950> those

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
on the left and the right you see those

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.580 
on the left and the right you see those
are<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.060> believe<00:04:18.419> these<00:04:19.049> are<00:04:19.109> going<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.380> be<00:04:19.470> like

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
are I believe these are going to be like

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.409 
are I believe these are going to be like
the<00:04:19.709> paddles<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.100> have<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.489> craft<00:04:20.729> so<00:04:21.359> you

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
the paddles to have to craft so you

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.690 
the paddles to have to craft so you
gonna<00:04:21.510> have<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.690> craft<00:04:21.840> paddles<00:04:22.229> obviously

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
gonna have to craft paddles obviously

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.860 
gonna have to craft paddles obviously
we've<00:04:23.700> talked<00:04:24.030> about<00:04:24.150> this<00:04:24.240> before<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.750> have

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
we've talked about this before you have

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.960 
we've talked about this before you have
to<00:04:24.960> craft<00:04:25.140> paddles<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.740> use<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.099> boat<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.460> I

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
to craft paddles to use the boat and I

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.770 
to craft paddles to use the boat and I
guess<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.300> left<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.630> right

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
guess the left and right

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.629 
guess the left and right
will<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:27.990> like<00:04:28.139> paddling<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:29.160> for<00:04:29.310> example<00:04:29.340> of

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
will be like paddling so for example of

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.120 
will be like paddling so for example of
you<00:04:29.730> paddle<00:04:30.139> only<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.230> right<00:04:31.410> button<00:04:31.710> then

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
you paddle only the right button then

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.710 
you paddle only the right button then
you'll<00:04:32.340> move<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.790> left<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.510> only

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
you'll move to the left of the only

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.790 
you'll move to the left of the only
paddle<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.050> left<00:04:34.230> button<00:04:34.470> you'll<00:04:34.620> move<00:04:34.710> to

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
paddle the left button you'll move to
