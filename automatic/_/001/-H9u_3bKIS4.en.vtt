and<00:04:47.830> i<00:04:47.889> calculated<00:04:48.430> it<00:04:48.639> if<00:04:48.819> i'm<00:04:49.300> going<00:04:49.419> to<00:04:49.509> do

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
and i calculated it if i'm going to do

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:50.520 
and i calculated it if i'm going to do
it<00:04:49.690> twice<00:04:49.810> because<00:04:49.990> i<00:04:50.139> don't<00:04:50.289> know<00:04:50.380> if<00:04:50.470> i'm

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
it twice because i don't know if i'm

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.930 
it twice because i don't know if i'm
gonna<00:04:50.650> do<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.830> twice<00:04:51.039> but<00:04:51.280> if<00:04:51.370> i<00:04:51.430> do<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:51.699> twice

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
gonna do it twice but if i do it twice

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.409 
gonna do it twice but if i do it twice
at<00:04:52.270> zero<00:04:52.690> point<00:04:52.870> 10<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:53.590> as<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.830> 0.3<00:04:54.550> 0.4<00:04:55.030> 0

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.900 
point n i am going to do 0.5 0.6 if this
happen<00:04:59.770> it's<00:04:59.889> not<00:05:00.009> this<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.310> not<00:05:00.340> true<00:05:00.639> but

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
happen it's not this is not true but

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.050 
happen it's not this is not true but
this<00:05:01.240> i<00:05:01.360> calculated<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:02.050> 0.5<00:05:02.949> 0.6<00:05:03.580> will<00:05:03.729> be<00:05:03.849> in

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
this i calculated it 0.5 0.6 will be in

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.860 
this i calculated it 0.5 0.6 will be in
zero<00:05:04.389> point<00:05:04.599> 11<00:05:05.280> then<00:05:06.280> just<00:05:06.759> take<00:05:07.479> out<00:05:07.630> the

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
will be because this is just calculation

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.070

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
will be zero point 15 and then I would

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.850 
will be zero point 15 and then I would
have<00:05:23.830> hittin<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.729> in<00:05:24.909> zero<00:05:25.300> point<00:05:25.509> 16<00:05:26.050> but<00:05:26.740> by

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
have hittin it in zero point 16 but by

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.360 
have hittin it in zero point 16 but by
then<00:05:27.070> I'm<00:05:27.340> pretty<00:05:27.610> sure<00:05:27.789> this<00:05:28.630> series<00:05:29.370> would
