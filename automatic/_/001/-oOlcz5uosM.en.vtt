now therein lies a bit of the problem

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.980 
now therein lies a bit of the problem
it's<00:06:07.800> so<00:06:08.040> expensive<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.850> it's<00:06:09.210> so<00:06:09.450> fast<00:06:09.780> that

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
it's so expensive and it's so fast that

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.930 
it's so expensive and it's so fast that
really<00:06:10.320> you<00:06:10.410> need<00:06:10.530> your<00:06:10.710> own<00:06:10.800> racetrack<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.580> to

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
really you need your own racetrack to to

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.620 
really you need your own racetrack to to
really<00:06:12.120> enjoy<00:06:12.480> it
