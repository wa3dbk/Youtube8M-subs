ansh<00:00:00.210> enough<00:00:00.480> but<00:00:00.630> I<00:00:00.659> think<00:00:00.900> it's<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.079> little

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.260 
ansh enough but I think it's a little

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.679 
ansh enough but I think it's a little
bit<00:00:01.380> too<00:00:01.589> late<00:00:01.770> because<00:00:01.949> driven<00:00:02.550> has<00:00:02.970> so<00:00:03.480> many

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
bit too late because driven has so many

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.809 
bit too late because driven has so many
stds<00:00:04.230> he's<00:00:04.500> got<00:00:04.680> I'm<00:00:05.190> sorry<00:00:05.430> stray<00:00:05.700> off

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
stds he's got I'm sorry stray off

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.249 
stds he's got I'm sorry stray off
because<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.089> many<00:00:06.180> stds<00:00:06.600> he's<00:00:06.810> got<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.140> much

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
because so many stds he's got so much

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.280 
because so many stds he's got so much
going<00:00:07.500> on<00:00:07.589> all<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.890> his<00:00:08.010> expansions<00:00:08.519> and

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
going on all of his expansions and

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.169 
going on all of his expansions and
eventually<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:11.130> dragon<00:00:11.550> will<00:00:11.730> finally

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
eventually this this dragon will finally

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.060 
eventually this this dragon will finally
fall<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> wrath<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.380> fusion<00:00:13.769> cutters

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
fall to the wrath of the fusion cutters

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.400 
fall to the wrath of the fusion cutters
I<00:00:14.219> believe<00:00:14.460> or<00:00:15.360> another<00:00:15.660> tank<00:00:15.990> popping<00:00:16.320> out

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
I believe or another tank popping out

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.660 
I believe or another tank popping out
there's<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.770> vultures<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> finish<00:00:17.550> it

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
there's the vultures going to finish it

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.340 
there's the vultures going to finish it
off<00:00:17.850> actually<00:00:19.279> so<00:00:20.510> nicely<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.900> show<00:00:22.050> maybe

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
off actually so nicely I like show maybe

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.769 
off actually so nicely I like show maybe
the<00:00:22.500> SCV<00:00:22.830> gotta<00:00:23.010> kill<00:00:23.250> ya<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.090> SCD<00:00:24.420> got<00:00:24.600> that

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the SCV gotta kill ya that SCD got that

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.830 
the SCV gotta kill ya that SCD got that
Dragoon<00:00:25.080> kill<00:00:25.350> also<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.099> was<00:00:26.220> nice<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:27.269> um<00:00:27.449> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
Dragoon kill also that was nice but um I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.570 
Dragoon kill also that was nice but um I
think<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.590> tray<00:00:28.769> lox<00:00:28.920> game<00:00:29.220> at<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.490> point

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
think it's tray lox game at this point

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.139 
think it's tray lox game at this point
to<00:00:29.939> win<00:00:30.150> um<00:00:30.539> well<00:00:31.489> you<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.850> could<00:00:33.030> go

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
to win um well you know it could go

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.729 
to win um well you know it could go
either<00:00:33.180> way<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.570> suppose<00:00:33.960> he<00:00:34.110> did<00:00:34.260> lose<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> lot

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
either way I suppose he did lose a lot

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
either way I suppose he did lose a lot
of<00:00:34.770> tanks<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.730> he<00:00:35.850> probably<00:00:36.000> lost<00:00:36.210> more

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
of tanks of that he probably lost more

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.880 
of tanks of that he probably lost more
tanks<00:00:36.750> than<00:00:36.870> he<00:00:36.930> could<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.350> he<00:00:37.559> shouldn't

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
tanks than he could have he shouldn't

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.069 
tanks than he could have he shouldn't
have<00:00:37.980> lost<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.370> second<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.000> other<00:00:39.180> tank<00:00:39.510> up

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
have lost that second that other tank up

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.910 
have lost that second that other tank up
there<00:00:41.450> but<00:00:42.450> again<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.020> kind<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.680> strong

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
there but again just kind of in strong

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.369 
there but again just kind of in strong
position<00:00:44.129> three<00:00:44.969> even<00:00:45.120> lost<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.480> lot<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.930> money

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
position three even lost a lot of money

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.389 
position three even lost a lot of money
in<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.739> he<00:00:46.920> lost<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.309> shuttle<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.570> zealots

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
in that he lost a shuttle for zealots

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.299 
in that he lost a shuttle for zealots
forger<00:00:50.399> goons<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.870> delayed<00:00:52.680> his<00:00:52.860> expansion

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
forger goons and delayed his expansion

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.939 
forger goons and delayed his expansion
that<00:00:54.000> entire<00:00:54.360> time<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.899> delayed<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> lot<00:00:55.860> of

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
that entire time and delayed a lot of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
that entire time and delayed a lot of
his<00:00:56.070> tech<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.579> well<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> he<00:00:59.820> lost<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.629> lot

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
his tech as well so he lost a lot

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.130 
his tech as well so he lost a lot
basically<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.710> strelok<00:01:02.190> only<00:01:02.579> lost<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.480> couple

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
basically and strelok only lost a couple

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.070 
basically and strelok only lost a couple
tanks<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.939> maybe<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.060> vulture<00:01:06.450> or<00:01:06.689> something

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
tanks and maybe a vulture or something

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.590 
tanks and maybe a vulture or something
like<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.260> maybe<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.770> scg<00:01:08.159> or<00:01:08.400> two<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.850> really

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
like that maybe at scg or two so really

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.750 
like that maybe at scg or two so really
um<00:01:09.780> strelok<00:01:10.500> came<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:10.979> away<00:01:11.460> ahead

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
um strelok came out of that away ahead

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.429 
um strelok came out of that away ahead
so<00:01:12.000> he<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.240> looking<00:01:12.540> very<00:01:12.600> very<00:01:13.020> good<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.409> in

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
so he is looking very very good here in

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.520 
so he is looking very very good here in
this<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.040> game<00:01:14.750> getting<00:01:15.750> some<00:01:15.930> supply

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
this in this game getting some supply

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.590 
this in this game getting some supply
depots<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.250> match<00:01:17.729> all<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.090> factories

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
depots up to match all these factories

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.789 
depots up to match all these factories
that<00:01:18.630> he's<00:01:18.930> putting<00:01:19.140> out<00:01:19.290> right<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:19.619> he's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
that he's putting out right now he's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.899 
that he's putting out right now he's
going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.070> able<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> lot<00:01:20.880> of

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
going to be able to have a lot of

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.859 
going to be able to have a lot of
production<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.720> very<00:01:21.930> soon<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:23.479> yeah<00:01:24.479> just

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
production here very soon and yeah just

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.920 
production here very soon and yeah just
really<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.350> good<00:01:25.650> good<00:01:26.070> position<00:01:26.549> for

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
really really good good position for

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.730 
really really good good position for
strelok<00:01:27.930> here<00:01:30.020> I'm<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.170> sure<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.439> he's<00:01:31.500> maybe

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
strelok here I'm not sure if he's maybe

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.200 
strelok here I'm not sure if he's maybe
going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:31.979> try<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.220> well<00:01:32.790> let's<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.090> he

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
going to try and well let's see he

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.969 
going to try and well let's see he
doesn't<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.350> troops<00:01:34.650> right<00:01:34.860> now

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
doesn't have a lot of troops right now

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.020 
doesn't have a lot of troops right now
so<00:01:35.189> we're<00:01:35.310> probably<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> see<00:01:35.970> him

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
so we're probably not going to see him

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.700 
so we're probably not going to see him
do<00:01:36.180> push<00:01:36.420> off<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.840> two<00:01:36.960> bases<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.439> probably

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
do push off just two bases and probably

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.890 
do push off just two bases and probably
is<00:01:37.829> still<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.430> him<00:01:38.600> move<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.750> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
is still going to see him move out and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.319 
is still going to see him move out and
take<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.200> third<00:01:40.409> base<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:41.009> believe<00:01:41.329> but

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
take this third base I would believe but

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.210 
take this third base I would believe but
you<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.649> never<00:01:43.680> tell<00:01:45.290> anyway<00:01:46.290> let's

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you know you can never tell anyway let's

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.440 
you know you can never tell anyway let's

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
have a river coming out in just a moment

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
have a river coming out in just a moment
to<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.960> picked<00:01:52.229> up<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> show<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.040> he<00:01:53.159> could

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
to be picked up in the show so he could

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.999 
to be picked up in the show so he could
see<00:01:53.520> some<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.090> late<00:01:54.450> river<00:01:54.869> her<00:01:55.110> ass<00:01:55.259> now

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009

he<00:01:56.579> did<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> significant<00:01:57.719> amount<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.899> damage

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
he did do a significant amount of damage

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.450 
he did do a significant amount of damage
to<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> defense's<00:01:58.770> didn't<00:01:59.009> take<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> any

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
to the defense's didn't take that any

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.340 
to the defense's didn't take that any
turrets<00:01:59.759> but<00:01:59.939> took<00:02:00.060> down<00:02:00.240> some<00:02:00.420> tanks<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.229> it's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
turrets but took down some tanks so it's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.370 
turrets but took down some tanks so it's
gonna<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.710> bit<00:02:01.860> difficult<00:02:02.820> for

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
gonna be a little bit difficult for

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.780 
gonna be a little bit difficult for
strelok<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.560> defend<00:02:04.950> against<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.430> river<00:02:05.670> her

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
strelok to defend against a river her

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.690 
strelok to defend against a river her
ass<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.180> he<00:02:06.210> comes<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.630> here<00:02:06.810> except<00:02:07.649> i<00:02:07.950> just

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
ass if he comes in here except i just

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.520 
ass if he comes in here except i just
remembered<00:02:08.970> he<00:02:09.060> has<00:02:09.179> these<00:02:09.330> Goliath

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
remembered he has these Goliath

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.760 
remembered he has these Goliath
so<00:02:11.209> actually<00:02:12.209> stray<00:02:12.990> Hawks<00:02:13.200> gonna<00:02:13.470> be<00:02:13.560> able<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
so actually stray Hawks gonna be able to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.410 
so actually stray Hawks gonna be able to
shut<00:02:13.950> down<00:02:13.980> any<00:02:14.340> River<00:02:14.670> Rats<00:02:14.880> very<00:02:15.209> easily

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
shut down any River Rats very easily

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.180 
shut down any River Rats very easily
because<00:02:15.720> all<00:02:16.260> he<00:02:16.380> has<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.530> do<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.709> target<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
because all he has to do is target the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.920 
because all he has to do is target the
shuttle<00:02:17.459> with<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> goliaths<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.209> planned

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
shuttle with the goliaths and planned

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.240 
shuttle with the goliaths and planned
out<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.080> siege<00:02:19.290> tank<00:02:19.530> take<00:02:19.740> care<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.010> river

out a siege tank take care of the river

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.430 
out a siege tank take care of the river
and<00:02:20.430> that's<00:02:20.550> pretty<00:02:20.730> much<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.200> really<00:02:22.200> not

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
and that's pretty much it so really not

here<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.510> wouldn't<00:02:39.870> be<00:02:39.930> surprised<00:02:40.260> as

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
here so what I wouldn't be surprised as

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.250 
here so what I wouldn't be surprised as
if<00:02:40.970> now<00:02:41.970> dreamin<00:02:42.390> he's<00:02:42.630> got<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.840> know<00:02:43.050> exactly

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
if now dreamin he's got to know exactly

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.979 
if now dreamin he's got to know exactly
what's<00:02:43.680> going<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.190> strelok<00:02:44.550> space<00:02:44.989> he's

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
what's going on in strelok space he's

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.360 
what's going on in strelok space he's
got<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.260> know<00:02:46.350> what's<00:02:46.590> going<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:46.890> because<00:02:47.100> he's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
got to know what's going on because he's

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.009 
got to know what's going on because he's
got<00:02:47.519> he's<00:02:47.730> had<00:02:47.880> observers<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.450> there<00:02:48.600> he's<00:02:48.870> had

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
got he's had observers in there he's had

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.810 
got he's had observers in there he's had
his<00:02:49.110> units<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.560> there<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.220> he<00:02:50.250> be<00:02:50.459> surprised<00:02:50.700> if

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
his units in there so he be surprised if

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.300 
his units in there so he be surprised if
he<00:02:50.910> just<00:02:51.030> uses<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:52.320> river<00:02:52.680> as<00:02:52.860> part<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.220> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
he just uses that river as part of a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.120 
he just uses that river as part of a
frontal<00:02:53.730> attack<00:02:54.080> as<00:02:55.080> opposed<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:57.800> as<00:02:58.800> opposed

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
frontal attack as opposed to as opposed

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.670 
frontal attack as opposed to as opposed
to<00:02:59.250> harassment<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.750> guess<00:03:01.230> well<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.590> know

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
to harassment and I guess well you know

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.840 
to harassment and I guess well you know
I<00:03:01.709> guess<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.040> might<00:03:02.130> even<00:03:02.250> be<00:03:02.370> smart<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.819> not

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
I guess it might even be smart to not

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.059 
I guess it might even be smart to not
even<00:03:03.180> do<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.300> frontal<00:03:03.690> attack<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:04.709> just<00:03:04.890> kind

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
even do a frontal attack but just kind

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.520 
even do a frontal attack but just kind
of<00:03:05.100> hold<00:03:05.340> stuff<00:03:05.760> out<00:03:06.000> here<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.750> prevent

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
of hold stuff out here and prevent

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.050 
of hold stuff out here and prevent
strelok<00:03:08.040> from<00:03:08.220> getting<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.489> third<00:03:08.640> base<00:03:08.850> while

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
strelok from getting a third base while

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.840 
strelok from getting a third base while
he<00:03:09.300> himself<00:03:09.690> expands<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.670> might<00:03:11.819> be

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
he himself expands so that might be

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.270 
he himself expands so that might be
something<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.300> he<00:03:12.480> might<00:03:12.660> do<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.160> looks

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
something that he might do and it looks

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.590 
something that he might do and it looks
like<00:03:14.430> that's<00:03:14.549> kind<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.180> what<00:03:15.299> he's<00:03:15.390> doing

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
like that's kind of what he's doing

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.840 
like that's kind of what he's doing
right<00:03:15.630> now<00:03:15.840> all<00:03:15.989> they<00:03:16.110> could<00:03:16.260> be<00:03:16.410> setting<00:03:16.739> up

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
right now all they could be setting up

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.069 
right now all they could be setting up
forces<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:17.910> got<00:03:18.060> forces<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.570> either<00:03:18.720> side

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
forces you got forces on either side

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.360 
forces you got forces on either side
here<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.440> what<00:03:19.590> he<00:03:19.650> might<00:03:19.799> be<00:03:19.950> thinking<00:03:19.980> he's

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
here so what he might be thinking he's

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.280 
here so what he might be thinking he's
got<00:03:20.549> observer<00:03:20.880> right<00:03:21.150> out<00:03:21.299> in<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.480> middle<00:03:21.540> so

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
got observer right out in the middle so

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.720 
got observer right out in the middle so
what<00:03:22.530> he's<00:03:22.650> probably<00:03:22.890> going<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.190> do<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.549> when

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
what he's probably going to do is when

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.030 
what he's probably going to do is when
strap<00:03:24.120> moves<00:03:24.450> out<00:03:24.690> driven<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.590> going<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.799> try

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
strap moves out driven is going to try

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.920 
strap moves out driven is going to try
and<00:03:26.070> bounce<00:03:26.519> down<00:03:26.910> from<00:03:27.239> two<00:03:27.450> different<00:03:27.600> sides

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
and bounce down from two different sides

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.530 
and bounce down from two different sides
with<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> small<00:03:29.280> force<00:03:29.310> here<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:33.360> just

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
with a small force here to to just

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.050 
with a small force here to to just
basically<00:03:33.690> surround<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.620> destroy<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.850> force

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
basically surround and destroy the force

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.509 
basically surround and destroy the force
as<00:03:36.440> strelok<00:03:37.440> tries<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.860> move<00:03:37.980> out<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.310> take

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
as strelok tries to move out to take

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.000 
as strelok tries to move out to take
that<00:03:38.670> third<00:03:38.940> base<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.450> more<00:03:40.440> bullish<00:03:40.769> or<00:03:40.829> pass

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
that third base and more bullish or pass

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.380 
that third base and more bullish or pass
going<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:41.370> ER<00:03:41.519> dropship<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.060> didn't<00:03:42.209> even<00:03:42.299> see

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
going in ER dropship I didn't even see

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.640 
going in ER dropship I didn't even see
the<00:03:42.570> dropship<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:42.959> saw<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.170> star<00:03:43.440> point<00:03:43.620> I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
the dropship I saw the star point I

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.620 
the dropship I saw the star point I
thought<00:03:43.769> was<00:03:43.920> for<00:03:44.070> science<00:03:44.400> vessels<00:03:44.760> dropship

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
thought was for science vessels dropship

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.910 
thought was for science vessels dropship
is<00:03:45.750> going<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.959> go<00:03:46.049> down<00:03:46.079> but<00:03:46.440> not<00:03:46.620> before<00:03:46.799> he

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
is going to go down but not before he

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.640 
is going to go down but not before he
gets<00:03:47.100> several<00:03:48.320> vultures<00:03:49.320> in<00:03:49.440> here<00:03:49.560> and

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
gets several vultures in here and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.259 
gets several vultures in here and
they're<00:03:49.769> going<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:49.950> do<00:03:50.070> some<00:03:50.280> significant

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
they're going to do some significant

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.110 
they're going to do some significant
damage<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:52.590> really<00:03:53.160> really<00:03:53.340> good<00:03:53.579> harassment

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
damage so really really good harassment

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.630 
damage so really really good harassment
here<00:03:54.269> by<00:03:55.109> strelok<00:03:55.590> just<00:03:55.829> really<00:03:56.310> further

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
here by strelok just really further

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.210 
here by strelok just really further
securing<00:03:57.269> his<00:03:57.359> lead<00:03:57.660> here<00:03:57.959> he<00:03:58.799> does<00:03:58.980> need<00:03:59.190> to

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
securing his lead here he does need to

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.509 
securing his lead here he does need to
get<00:03:59.400> another<00:03:59.549> base<00:03:59.790> before<00:04:00.000> too<00:04:00.329> long<00:04:00.510> or

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
get another base before too long or

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.530 
get another base before too long or
dreamin<00:04:02.519> is<00:04:02.609> going<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.820> start<00:04:03.030> catching<00:04:03.239> up

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
dreamin is going to start catching up

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.900 
dreamin is going to start catching up
and<00:04:03.690> getting<00:04:04.019> ahead<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.410> him<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.680> economy<00:04:05.280> but

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
and getting ahead of him in economy but

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.880 
and getting ahead of him in economy but
this<00:04:06.630> whole<00:04:06.810> time<00:04:07.019> has<00:04:07.230> been<00:04:07.260> building<00:04:07.680> up

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
this whole time has been building up

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.800 
this whole time has been building up
unit<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.370> he's<00:04:08.489> got<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.700> really<00:04:09.180> nice<00:04:09.450> little

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
unit so he's got a really nice little

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.630 
unit so he's got a really nice little
force<00:04:10.049> here<00:04:10.260> because<00:04:10.890> even<00:04:11.130> got<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.280> command

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
force here because even got a command

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.740 
force here because even got a command
center<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:11.970> he's<00:04:12.090> just<00:04:12.269> waiting<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.660> have

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
center so he's just waiting to have

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.050 
center so he's just waiting to have
enough<00:04:12.959> troops<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:14.100> really<00:04:14.370> push<00:04:14.579> out<00:04:14.790> and

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
enough troops to really push out and

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.759 
enough troops to really push out and
then<00:04:15.390> we're<00:04:15.510> probably<00:04:15.630> gonna<00:04:15.870> see<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.049> push<00:04:16.289> out

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
then we're probably gonna see a push out

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.349 
then we're probably gonna see a push out
the<00:04:16.889> moment<00:04:17.220> here<00:04:19.370> yeah<00:04:20.370> clearing<00:04:21.209> this<00:04:21.299> up

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
the moment here yeah clearing this up

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.689 
the moment here yeah clearing this up
destroying<00:04:22.169> this<00:04:22.319> power<00:04:22.590> generator<00:04:23.069> probably

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
destroying this power generator probably

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:24.890 
destroying this power generator probably
gonna<00:04:23.789> see<00:04:23.940> him<00:04:24.000> lift<00:04:24.210> these<00:04:24.360> buildings<00:04:24.750> off

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
gonna see him lift these buildings off

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.029 
gonna see him lift these buildings off
and<00:04:25.139> that'll<00:04:25.319> really<00:04:25.860> clear<00:04:26.190> off<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.460> way<00:04:26.580> I

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
and that'll really clear off the way I

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.230 
and that'll really clear off the way I
it's<00:04:29.039> not<00:04:29.220> out<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.400> sync<00:04:29.699> I<00:04:29.789> really<00:04:30.030> just

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
it's not out of sync I really just

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.969 
it's not out of sync I really just
predicted<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:30.930> a<00:04:30.990> month<00:04:31.289> before<00:04:31.500> happened

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
predicted that a month before happened

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.189 
predicted that a month before happened
up<00:04:32.099> to<00:04:32.400> but<00:04:33.330> here<00:04:33.599> he's<00:04:33.690> going<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.900> move<00:04:34.080> out

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
up to but here he's going to move out

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.050 
up to but here he's going to move out
now<00:04:34.379> nowadays<00:04:35.099> third<00:04:35.340> up<00:04:35.490> his<00:04:35.639> opening<00:04:35.970> he's

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
now nowadays third up his opening he's

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.430 
now nowadays third up his opening he's
going<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.270> try<00:04:36.419> move<00:04:36.569> out<00:04:36.720> now<00:04:37.139> we're<00:04:37.289> going<00:04:37.379> to

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
going to try move out now we're going to

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.899 
going to try move out now we're going to
see<00:04:37.620> if<00:04:37.770> drive-ins<00:04:38.099> little<00:04:38.370> ploy<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.699> going<00:04:38.849> to

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
see if drive-ins little ploy is going to

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.610 
see if drive-ins little ploy is going to
work<00:04:39.000> he's<00:04:39.240> setting<00:04:39.569> up<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:39.900> don't<00:04:40.379> know<00:04:40.470> if<00:04:40.560> he

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
work he's setting up I don't know if he

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.619 
work he's setting up I don't know if he
has<00:04:40.740> speed<00:04:40.919> upgrade<00:04:41.250> or<00:04:41.789> not<00:04:42.030> but<00:04:42.240> he's<00:04:42.360> got

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
has speed upgrade or not but he's got

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.010 
has speed upgrade or not but he's got
his<00:04:42.840> forces<00:04:43.319> just<00:04:43.889> poised<00:04:44.759> poised<00:04:45.599> ready<00:04:45.870> to

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
his forces just poised poised ready to

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.140 
his forces just poised poised ready to
move<00:04:46.139> out<00:04:46.259> here<00:04:46.530> strelok<00:04:47.460> is<00:04:47.610> going<00:04:47.789> to<00:04:47.849> see

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
move out here strelok is going to see

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.089 
move out here strelok is going to see
this<00:04:48.180> though<00:04:48.539> he<00:04:49.080> knows<00:04:49.409> this<00:04:49.620> is<00:04:49.770> out<00:04:49.919> there

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
this though he knows this is out there

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.379 
this though he knows this is out there
so<00:04:50.310> we're<00:04:50.460> probably<00:04:50.610> gonna<00:04:50.819> see<00:04:51.000> him<00:04:51.120> be<00:04:51.360> a

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
so we're probably gonna see him be a

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.870 
so we're probably gonna see him be a
little<00:04:51.630> bit<00:04:51.750> cautious<00:04:51.960> moving<00:04:52.500> out<00:04:52.650> I'm<00:04:53.610> not

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
little bit cautious moving out I'm not

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.879 
little bit cautious moving out I'm not
sure<00:04:54.060> he's<00:04:54.210> got<00:04:54.389> Goliath<00:04:55.139> he's<00:04:55.319> got<00:04:55.470> science

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
sure he's got Goliath he's got science

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.830 
sure he's got Goliath he's got science
vessels<00:04:56.250> he's<00:04:56.669> got<00:04:56.849> a<00:04:56.880> plenty<00:04:57.120> of<00:04:57.300> vultures<00:04:57.690> as

no actually just a yeah couple boulders
going<00:05:11.190> down<00:05:11.310> but<00:05:11.430> not<00:05:11.520> too<00:05:11.729> much<00:05:11.759> damage

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
going down but not too much damage

picking up more zealot bombs as well he

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.640 
picking up more zealot bombs as well he
really<00:05:15.360> probably<00:05:15.960> could<00:05:16.169> have<00:05:16.199> gotten<00:05:16.440> in<00:05:16.590> a

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
really probably could have gotten in a

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.469 
really probably could have gotten in a
little<00:05:16.800> bit<00:05:16.919> closer<00:05:17.099> no<00:05:17.849> actually<00:05:18.210> there's<00:05:18.389> a

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
little bit closer no actually there's a

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.390 
little bit closer no actually there's a
turret<00:05:18.750> there<00:05:18.900> when<00:05:19.110> she<00:05:19.229> saw<00:05:19.440> which<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:20.099> didn't

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
turret there when she saw which I didn't

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.719 
turret there when she saw which I didn't
see<00:05:20.580> so<00:05:22.069> couldn't<00:05:23.069> gotten<00:05:23.280> too<00:05:23.370> much<00:05:23.490> closer

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
see so couldn't gotten too much closer

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.520 
see so couldn't gotten too much closer
in<00:05:23.880> there<00:05:24.000> but<00:05:24.180> he's<00:05:24.569> missed<00:05:24.870> his<00:05:24.960> opportunity

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
in there but he's missed his opportunity

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.589 
in there but he's missed his opportunity
that<00:05:25.650> goliaths<00:05:26.039> are<00:05:26.190> now<00:05:26.310> out<00:05:26.520> so<00:05:27.120> I<00:05:27.150> really

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
that goliaths are now out so I really

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:28.999 
that goliaths are now out so I really
think<00:05:27.750> he's<00:05:27.930> lost<00:05:28.169> his<00:05:28.380> chance<00:05:28.620> here<00:05:28.860> he's

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
think he's lost his chance here he's

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.529 
think he's lost his chance here he's
gonna<00:05:29.159> he's<00:05:29.759> gonna<00:05:29.849> have<00:05:30.030> maybe<00:05:30.210> one<00:05:30.449> more

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
gonna he's gonna have maybe one more

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.320 
gonna he's gonna have maybe one more
chance<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:30.960> move<00:05:31.080> in<00:05:31.229> here<00:05:31.409> but<00:05:32.150> strelok<00:05:33.150> has

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
chance to move in here but strelok has

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.870 
chance to move in here but strelok has
seized<00:05:33.569> up<00:05:33.779> now<00:05:34.099> so<00:05:35.099> driven<00:05:35.370> has<00:05:35.550> missed<00:05:35.789> his

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
seized up now so driven has missed his

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.390 
seized up now so driven has missed his
opportunity<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:37.650> try<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:37.979> go<00:05:38.069> in<00:05:38.190> for<00:05:38.340> a

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
opportunity to try and go in for a

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.610 
opportunity to try and go in for a
pincher<00:05:38.699> move<00:05:38.849> here<00:05:38.969> I<00:05:39.000> think<00:05:39.349> strelok<00:05:40.349> is<00:05:40.500> as

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
pincher move here I think strelok is as

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.339 
pincher move here I think strelok is as
well<00:05:40.800> way<00:05:41.159> too<00:05:41.219> well<00:05:41.580> defended<00:05:42.139> he's<00:05:43.139> got<00:05:43.319> a

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
well way too well defended he's got a

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.100 
well way too well defended he's got a

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
ton of vultures there and that's going

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.320 
ton of vultures there and that's going
to<00:05:46.169> be<00:05:46.289> way<00:05:46.560> way<00:05:47.130> too<00:05:47.159> many<00:05:47.340> vultures<00:05:47.759> for<00:05:48.029> this

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
to be way way too many vultures for this

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.779

after all um I think there's a little

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:16.100 
after all um I think there's a little
bit<00:06:14.819> suicidal<00:06:15.029> though<00:06:15.509> there's<00:06:15.690> just<00:06:15.870> way<00:06:16.050> too

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
bit suicidal though there's just way too

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.809 
bit suicidal though there's just way too
many<00:06:16.289> vultures<00:06:16.710> he's<00:06:16.860> got<00:06:17.039> Templar<00:06:17.460> the<00:06:17.610> mix

many vultures he's got Templar the mix

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.879 
many vultures he's got Templar the mix
storming<00:06:18.659> but<00:06:18.810> missing<00:06:19.259> a<00:06:19.319> lot<00:06:19.440> of<00:06:19.560> trips<00:06:19.770> you

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
storming but missing a lot of trips you

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.170 
storming but missing a lot of trips you
really<00:06:20.099> needed<00:06:20.370> to<00:06:20.430> focus<00:06:20.580> on<00:06:20.880> some<00:06:21.029> of<00:06:21.060> those

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
really needed to focus on some of those

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.540 
really needed to focus on some of those
tanks<00:06:21.569> I<00:06:21.659> think<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:22.020> look<00:06:22.560> at<00:06:22.650> this<00:06:22.770> driven

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
tanks I think and look at this driven

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.769 
tanks I think and look at this driven
sports<00:06:23.759> just<00:06:24.090> getting<00:06:24.270> absolutely

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:24.779 
sports just getting absolutely

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:26.830 
sports just getting absolutely
slaughtered<00:06:25.259> by<00:06:25.560> the<00:06:25.620> tears<00:06:25.979> of<00:06:26.070> Tanks

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
slaughtered by the tears of Tanks

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.530 
slaughtered by the tears of Tanks
and<00:06:27.560> just<00:06:27.889> not<00:06:28.130> doing<00:06:28.430> anything<00:06:28.850> at<00:06:29.090> all<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:29.449> I

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
and just not doing anything at all and I

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.600 
and just not doing anything at all and I
think<00:06:29.780> strelok<00:06:30.260> knows<00:06:30.949> that<00:06:31.280> that<00:06:31.460> was

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
think strelok knows that that was

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.100 
think strelok knows that that was
dreaming<00:06:31.970> whole<00:06:32.150> army<00:06:32.449> and<00:06:32.570> he<00:06:32.600> says<00:06:32.900> all

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
dreaming whole army and he says all

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.450 
dreaming whole army and he says all
right<00:06:33.350> I<00:06:33.500> was<00:06:33.740> just<00:06:33.860> going<00:06:34.040> to<00:06:34.130> take<00:06:34.280> that

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
right I was just going to take that
