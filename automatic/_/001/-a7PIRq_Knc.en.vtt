00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.670
 hello everyone is at the day hi 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.050
 everyone is today a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.170
 criticism on an animated that was me 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.550
 advised from his bench seriously 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.610
 at my best friend's house I'm looking for 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.430
 opening i fall on sakura trick i 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.860
 look at one of the skype conversations I 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.600
 see we're going to propose sakura trick on 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.570
 leave me comments youtube urns 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.460
 at the board his kora trick is you are 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.720
 contributed or what and so I ended up 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.030
 watch the animated sakura trick 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.350
 with the French accent it's disgusting 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.120
 try something else and so I'm done 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.879
 by watching digital and sacrera 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.600
 kill it does it with special effects 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.660
 or not yeah yeah that's cool and fucking 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.970
 yeah so it's not a masterpiece 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.650
 anything but it feels good to 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.810
 fall on an animated where our impression 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.730
 it's not fair 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.660
 yeah what a hundred steps but then what's 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.820
 what does it mean 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.230
 well these are two girls friends of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.670
 college who enters high school and who 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.920
 kiss and and we follow their 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.690
 daily said like that looks boring 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.160
 but I swear to you that it's really 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.920
 nice and besides we'll start with 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.540
 the negative points 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.660
 no yes it's not very objective 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.200
 let's say rather than for me my opinion 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.570
 staff 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.370
 there is nothing that bothered me the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.080
 drawings are very correct voices 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.370
 stick well to girls characters 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.530
 are endearing etc 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.850
 after if you do not like it 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.770
 would not surprise me maybe 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.500
 will you find passages where 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.870
 characters a little nunuche or the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.870
 drawings that sometimes have 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.890
 something particular of the times he 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.090
 are points on or in place of the decor 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.920
 without any reason that says attention 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.920
 it's not a crazy thing like 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.720
 good this is how it is in a situation 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.030
 normal with simplistic drawings 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.290
 li na vi and also at times it looks like 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.820
 really that these are drawings of 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.230
 manga and animal names 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.790
 I do not really know how to explain 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.680
 all really guys you see the drawings 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.430
 you their lawn color and it makes its 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.950
 creature 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.710
 but it did not bother me on the music side 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.480
 it's sweet it's fine most remain 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.170
 discreet but sticks well to the atmosphere 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.450
 and the opening and the bailly ending are not 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.160
 bad at all by the most memorable but 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.310
 nice while keeping one side 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.440
 realistic and sometimes completely barred 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.570
 which corresponds to the animate so 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.150
 it's good work but then it's 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.600
 what the genres of his creature and and 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.420
 well youri slices of life comedian so 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.050
 yes of lesbianism then there is no 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.500
 sex scenes 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.180
 yeah well yeah but do not you 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.560
 if you like kisses then there you 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.500
 are going to be served because the heroines 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.820
 flares up in almost every episode 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.440
 now and suddenly I find it very 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.880
 interesting and accessible to a more 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.860
 many that there are girls 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.450
 straight or low fords I would understand 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.459
 that sex scenes between two girls 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.100
 do not be their cam that's for sure if 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.470
 conversely of yaoi but I do not have 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.540
 really feel comfortable if there are any 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.580
 guys who are already fucking that even the vida 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.130
 beautiful with the fucking sex scenes 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.780
 lesbian that lasts five minutes 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.360
 even if it excites me at first I am 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.310
 still faring badly 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.930
 at ease in late May so suddenly there 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.989
 I really advise everyone 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.700
 that you are soil moby sexual 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.380
 extra terrestrial what do you want I 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.540
 really think that's the chances of 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.180
 please you because good the right of 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.879
 jewelry 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.709
 oh there I see two people of the same 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:57.840
 sex kissing I feel uncomfortable 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.129
 then slices of life so for those 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.719
 who do not know what these are 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.099
 everyday scenes so do not wait 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.329
 too much 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.700
 and what do we do at once? 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.939
 daily bah we're going to buy some 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.129
 clothes attended a wedding that made 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:14.370
 the day of the year here are situations 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.739
 banal but not boring actually anime 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.570
 consisting of twelve episodes but each 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.829
 episode is composed of two episodes in 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.079
 is basically it's like 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.530
 watch an animated 24 episodes of 12 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.509
 minutes 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.570
 good besides done also who is at the 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.570
 open in green he is then comedy 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.120
 damn shit slap put 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.440
 seriously when I looked at this 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.789
 year but I was singing generic 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.960
 japanese digimon to but this humor 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.130
 but it's crazy 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.419
 so still I will not do my 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.610
 bad faith as for all animals 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.169
 comic it's very funny beginning then that 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.370
 starts to run out of steam at the end 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.530
 of a while but the voice is 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.150
 really the first episodes are very 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.979
 funny it's level ii bac a2 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.449
 testochoc we play this can do it is and 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.639
 and if you do not know these two 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:04.020
 animated forced already just in the 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:07.080
 first episode the very beginning good ago 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.830
 a classic overall plan a 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.810
 second plane c a bigger plane 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.599
 classic also between the two planes they 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.729
 have done a sounding to sign the 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:21.479
 transition so it's just starting 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.039
 you tell yourself ok I feel good and then 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.150
 between girls to well personalities 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.710
 soaked 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.909
 the comics of the situations the 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.310
 dialogues and the 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.650
 broken fourth hour high school 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.780
 completely crossed out 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.220
 spelling by equalize and I you 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:41.159
 really swear sometimes I got 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:43.259
 found like this to give an example 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:45.540
 without this pole is a flash back 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.490
 it looks like this here it is 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.070
 can there be echo of the 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.980
 idle all right ben there a flash back 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.080
 it may look like that there is 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.090
 strictly nothing special it's a 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.360
 scene with marc and flash back in the 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.090
 corner is awesome a lot is really 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.160
 the humor is to remember in his creature 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.350
 so is I hope you will not be 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.090
 disappointed it's still good 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.340
 fall on a good youri compared to 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.380
 other not memorable mario licka fuel oil 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.850
 inoni like the boys of the same thing 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.650
 that I blamed enough lloris was the 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.880
 man's place where age has passed 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.560
 from one extreme to the other 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.450
 in top 10 animated world more 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.530
 disappointed when I approached cana zukin at 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.870
 micro and married olic 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.520
 I had mentioned the excessive place of 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.350
 the man in the ain gala blanquer a 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.580
 heterosexual relationship so for no one and 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.410
 this via nice even her skin anyway a 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.230
 little evil and in the other the second 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.480
 main character and masculine he is 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.470
 pretends to be a girl is in the 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.970
 first video about mangoes 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.500
 absolutely disgusting when jim hall 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:46.770
 men no it's not a man I do not 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.470
 do not know balla at least with his 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.090
 creature finds that there is a happy medium 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.980
 we obviously focus clearly 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.720
 more about girls but even learns 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.910
 sometimes men and who have 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.510
 replicas so here is another point 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.460
 positive 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.200
 no really it's animated it's good 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.000
 it's very good it will not be 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.530
 definitely not your favorite animated 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.840
 the opening and the ending will not be 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.520
 probably not you prefer but everything 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.720
 it's really nice and it makes 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.970
 pleasure to see 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.380
 and in my case right now 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.030
 of course it's my there would be 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.680
 favorite and I hope I have stoked the 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.360
 curiosity of an anonymous youtuber that 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.250
 will benefit for casey got animated in his 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.120
 Video sion youri this I you 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:26.120

 ciao
