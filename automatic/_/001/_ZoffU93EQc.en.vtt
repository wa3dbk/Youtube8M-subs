00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.580
 the helsport fjellheimen superlight 3 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.189
 camp a mouthful 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.070
 and it's not right because with 22 100 grams 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.630
 it is the lightest tent in this test 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.630
 and yes also from the compact 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.410
 yes the helsport fjellheimen superlight 3 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.350
 camp 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.550
 15 so you really do 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.350
 my finger can light the hallway one 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.210
 see a micro drip stop so that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.559
 means he is also tearing 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.329
 it is also very good file 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.800
 very flexible and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.089
 and that it is the weight of that hell sport 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 The lightest tent right now you are 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.330
 class that does not suit him of course 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.250
 only in the canvas but also in the 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.170
 parts that are included are the he this 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.239
 are the big herrings that they add 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.839
 supply 5 pieces for corners and for the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.510
 rear end 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.070
 just fix the base well and this 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.070
 are the other pegs that come with it 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.220
 no I have to ask you a bit 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.320
 for example , the holding power thereof 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.770
 is in Dutch pasture 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.570
 and find out what on rock grounds 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.830
 hair removal really takes you there for you 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 are going 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.560
 yes for the rest easy tent of course 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.399
 full of very beautiful light can 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.750
 saving 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.750
 targeted certain details 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.530
 one of those things and that communion 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.020
 very much against in tent once they 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.820
 zipper to have most of the a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.649
 zipper with a flap upright no 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.750
 hello has opted for and as one 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.450
 pretty expensive solution to just one 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.450
 water-resistant zipper to be mounted as a door 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.360
 yes also this tent it is double sided 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.849
 silo communicates cloth 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.170
 waterproof only you can see it 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.200
 this tent and you see it at a lot 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.970
 silicone tent that they are 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.470
 good sense of mind and dirt 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.759
 because that just remains one 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.530
 stick a little on 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.479
 well again very nice with this tent 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.630
 is of course that the sticks 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.369
 red and yellow are coded with a 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.739
 You can also use it in the color coding loop 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.770
 set up very well at night without you 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.000
 makes mistakes with sticks double 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.069
 tension points for the guy lines and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.870
 in the back the whole sport does something eh yes 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.080
 pretty special 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.520
 you have a vent here 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.110
 you can open up the front is there 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.170
 also one with a knife with an out 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.910
 holder there you go air of course 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.540
 through and here you have another one 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.159
 with which you get this way 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.890
 throw it and do it at the back 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.420
 open so that it is at the bottom 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.010
 more air can pass through from the ground 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.709
 come and roll the little jokes 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.060
 because that also saves weight look 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.439
 can live to the place where the 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.519
 pegs are very small strong ones 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:04.299
 strings 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:06.639
 also to save one of the weight 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.579
 the disadvantages of this kind of very thin cloth 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.170
 is that is terrible weather is sensitive 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.060
 when the sun comes up he goes very nicely 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.099
 standing tight it starts to rain it becomes 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.230
 colder than it immediately goes down 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.180
 so you will have to re-post that often 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.620
 is just a drawback that you are here 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.879
 no span gas because in this case 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.340
 They will get the one I get out of it every time 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.169
 must pick and pull again to get well again 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.849
 to get tight about just for something too 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.159
 unload the moment the weather 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.879
 it gets sunny so it does n't look too much 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:36.310
 gets tension 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.870
 yes then we go now we are inside yes 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.939
 has sports at a door and that is 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.489
 of course only tricky if you 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.229
 changing wind conditions 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.729
 it is a nice expensive thread in the 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:49.060
 also remains very watertight 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.659
 with waterproof zipper the space in the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.870
 awning 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.159
 it is with a measurement 53 in the length 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.169
 the one of the smallest second smallest 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.389
 canopy space in this test 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:01.120
 on the other hand, the interior space is this 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.290
 tent with a length of 2 meters and 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.540
 a width of one hundred and sixty-five 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.269
 centimeters and a height of 1 meter 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.459
 four and again just nice in itself 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.459
 nice and large well it's a real one 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.959
 December 4-season tent the outer cloth 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.519
 connect closely to the ground where you 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.239
 its few anyway if you don't 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.889
 want 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.780
 the ventilation opening here is sufficient 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.519
 around the top of the tent properly 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.349
 the wood and then the 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.990
 The back side still has its opening and 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.370
 then we will view the inner tent 7 and 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.289
 yellow inner tent I always mind 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.400
 nice because it's a very positive feeling 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.080
 gives in the tent 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.479
 even though it rains very hard outside 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.419
 well inside it is only very good 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.419
 arranged you have 1 2 3 bags in this 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.659
 There are three more and there are three 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.620
 other ventilation opening and then u 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.479
 velcro strap 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.740
 and then you can fold it away again 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:52.330
 and again of course 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.130
 shoot me especially if you 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.069
 scandinavia goes on holiday to the car 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.610
 can be nice outside the hell sport 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:02.650
 fjellheimen superlight 3 camp 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.729
 the inner tent has more than enough space 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.949
 for 2 people 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.259
 and the three of them are also doing well 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.729
 awning is what small you can cook 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.990
 lost second backpack but then holds 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.139
 it also on 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.940
 yes, and then the cloth 15 which is so dennie j 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.759
 thin that it is with every hint of wind 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.229
 very much going to flutter with everyone 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.479
 weather change it you will like it for a moment 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.289
 should post that you see what you are taking 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.270
 must learn to live 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.099
 that's just how yes and then that 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.669
 thin harins and all those other small ones 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.979
 details 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.909
 it does provide the weights of 2 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.250
 kilos 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.840
 if you go for a walk together 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.009
 every kilo in the backpack 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.370
 you hardly notice what you have in a tent 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.370
 with you
