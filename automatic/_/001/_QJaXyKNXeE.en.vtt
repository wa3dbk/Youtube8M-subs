00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.130
 very nice a lot has changed for 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.250
 the time of our absence the best side 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.740
 Well, for example the organization itself 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.110
 I like spaces much more 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.910
 home to any unit convicted with 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.059
 over the course of time of the year everyone is flying all 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.640
 faster and faster faster faster here but 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.489
 here I am today with my children I them 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.200
 I liked watching our eyes on 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.290
 in fact it is very significant 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.910
 for us the festival seems to me every 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.629
 rock musician in our country precisely 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.490
 invasions 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.480
 gave way 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.480
 or is there a start in life 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.700
 i see you 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.630
 not really something like that burn 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.920
 inexplicable what words to describe 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.280
 is impossible 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.930
 but something here unites them and they 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.090
 energy seems to give it we months 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.770
 layers of indians but it's all peaceful because 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.240
 what man has aggression is 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.950
 energy but its not necessary 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.950
 throw out holding a gun and 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.540
 businessmen politicians and will return to 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.640
 a little sweep spent each other 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.120
 and apparently hooked up in some way but 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.210
 I want to believe that such here 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.960
 acceptance as the opposite 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.680
 protect from uniting 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.680
 it's just that 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.120
 incredible probably or 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.840
 generally in human life which 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.840
 can 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.850
 from this pile 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.850
 through which happens around though
