to like these and it changes to

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.740 
to like these and it changes to
landscape<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.340> that's<00:02:54.520> cool<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:55.420> can<00:02:55.599> even

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
landscape so that's cool you can even

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.560 
landscape so that's cool you can even
change<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.730> pages<00:02:57.730> using<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.030> volume<00:02:58.360> keys

which<00:02:58.840> isn't<00:02:59.020> very<00:02:59.170> practical<00:02:59.560> for<00:02:59.920> me

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
which isn't very practical for me

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.680 
which isn't very practical for me
because

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
because

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.640 
because
normally<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.440> public<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.640> disguise<00:03:03.120> so

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
normally have the public in disguise so

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.310 
normally have the public in disguise so
really<00:03:04.650> isn't<00:03:04.770> that<00:03:05.160> much<00:03:05.550> magical<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:07.080> the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
really isn't that much magical so the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.890 
really isn't that much magical so the
way<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> just<00:03:07.830> changed<00:03:08.250> pages<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.880> if<00:03:09.750> I'm

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
way I just changed pages is if I'm

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.850 
way I just changed pages is if I'm
