is the fact that it doesn't have a
microphone<00:01:05.090> I<00:01:05.480> thought<00:01:05.780> that<00:01:05.840> right<00:01:06.350> there

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
microphone I thought that right there

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.310 
microphone I thought that right there
would<00:01:06.830> be<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:07.040> microphone<00:01:07.670> but<00:01:08.479> no<00:01:08.689> it's<00:01:08.990> just<00:01:09.110> a

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
would be a microphone but no it's just a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.580 
would be a microphone but no it's just a
light<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.830> glows<00:01:10.070> let<00:01:10.580> me<00:01:10.759> know<00:01:10.909> that<00:01:11.180> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
light that glows let me know that the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.420 
light that glows let me know that the
camera<00:01:12.590> is<00:01:12.619> working<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:15.020> keyboard<00:01:15.430> like

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
camera is working and the keyboard like

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.640
