possibility<00:05:41.460> but<00:05:41.610> it's<00:05:42.240> still<00:05:42.510> worth<00:05:42.719> noting

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
possibility but it's still worth noting

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.469 
possibility but it's still worth noting
how<00:05:43.400> powerful<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.550> how<00:05:44.669> credible<00:05:45.210> this

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
having that kind of spaced apart that's

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.730 
having that kind of spaced apart that's
why<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.240> like<00:06:28.420> these<00:06:28.570> moderate<00:06:28.960> fire<00:06:29.200> weapons
