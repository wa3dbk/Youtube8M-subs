 popular first of all I want to clarify 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.349
 I'm going to talk about what my 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.750
 opinion are the most popular not the 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.239
 best team players about games 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.189
 that are really very well done but 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.719
 have managed to reach fame as 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.850
 these that maybe are not so good 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.050
 facts or also argued but it 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.660
 they have made more famous since they are 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.850
 most popular characters or are more 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.000
 frightening and leaving this 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.180
 we started at number 5 we have 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.560
 a sonic dot exe sonic point ex is a 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.899
 computer game that has been made very 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.850
 famous in recent times I do not know 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.350

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.360
 we know it's a sony with eyes 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.970
 bleeding that is dedicated to assassinate 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.290
 the characters in that game saga 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 despite not having such a good story as 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.210
 others has come to do very 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.880
 popular at number 4 we have 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.740
 there do not hesitate between putting the creepy pasta 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.570
 of hymn or the song of Paul or the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.340
 band but apart from that they go a little 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.140
 related, I consider the anthem 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.930
 has become more popular in the latter 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.120
 years as this clip says up there 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.330
 pedophile that attracts children towards their 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.010
 cave to never let them out anymore 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.960
 know what he does to the poor children 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.760
 in addition as the hymn song already 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.950
 includes the song of the town the band 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.970
 I preferred to put the hymn before 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.730
 the other 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.770
 in position number 3 we have hero 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.510
 brain although it is the least frightening of 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.430
 the ones in this top since we've 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.620
 used to it coming out everywhere 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.200
 but brain is only the trip and pastas more 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.330
 famous of video games everything started 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.700
 with a suspicious image and a joke of 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.680
 some guys just needed that to 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.870
 run a legend as famous as today 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.580
 in day is that of hero bright even 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.910
 came to the point of thinking that it is not 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.740
 put in honor of his deceased brother and 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.020
 we arrived at number 2 where 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.580
 we have a tale sun 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.979

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.260

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.570
 popular and terrifying this creepy pasta is 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.670
 that really takes where he was in the 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.320
 game I want a character more thing than 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.420
 it gave a lot of credibility to the story 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.430
 to the point where people gave him 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.130
 fear unlocking it and stopped playing the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.410
 game where it came out and we got to the 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.090
 ranked number 1 in my personal opinion 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.830
 it is indisputably the number one 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.480
 one although if you think it should be 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.740
 another one you can put it in the box 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.230
 comments 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.900
 for me the number one position takes him 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.030
 will have outlet may not everyone know 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.620
 exactly who he is will come to join but 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.780
 anyone with a minimum interest 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.610
 for video games at least he has heard 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.130

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.720

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.920

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.440
