00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.139
 So personally, I never understood why adult men get in 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.049
 Put carnival costumes in a boxing ring around then at prices like that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.980
 were to jump on and yes but there are just nothing for girls rather 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.160
 Something like our monthly for tough guys is always with you 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.320
 But still makes the world's best wrestlers "addicted" 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.529
 Berlin and that wanted to Olaf offered not to be missed 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.210
 Abbas is there again the OECD greets Belgian euro auctions he the old one 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.569
 role-play 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:32.570
 do not be afraid the price with which just wants to play 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.150
 the American pro or is it the superstar of the scene and along with 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.559
 on the way for his colleague on a tour through Germany while stopping in Berlin 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.520
 The many followers are poison for this yes what is it 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.520
 actually sports or show 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.610
 we have our viewers decide what they want to see it's like at 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.480
 cooking is a bit hurt by Ryan and some are half of it 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.310
 This is the sport year to others is the entertainment with fireworks and it 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.660
 colorful disguise 50 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.040
 also a hard sport or show the audience it was shared opinion 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.170
 So it said it's just entertainment to use for now 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.620
 for what a bad this total I did not put that 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.490
 from time to time 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
 I also participated in the studio around me and made it possible 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.410
 infiltrate 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.780
 as in real life, there are also good and evil characters in the rest 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.560
 Of course, the multiple world champion is a good but still a lot 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.650
 he would rather be right 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.000
 bad 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.250
 and now people are looking to hate you, maybe it's you again 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.990
 they are supposed to misbehave from the floor Wendel the good one is me 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.140
 I had to be very limited and careful because Michel always as a role model 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.230
 comes over twice 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.090
 how do you actually get to the refrain? 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.560
 Surely it has already been an age childhood dream or 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.410
 MaterialScience boy I always wanted as Lulu we will be back 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.680
 better to imagine in terms of because I discovered later 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.850
 but since then I live only and Rene doubles in tight pants in the ring of Rome 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.180
 the city has 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.000
 In the rain, my ex would certainly not meet but private seems so 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.250
 to be really nice guy
