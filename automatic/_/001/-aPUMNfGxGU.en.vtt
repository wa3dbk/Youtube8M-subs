00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
one of the key things that we did with

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.309 
one of the key things that we did with
the<00:01:44.099> new<00:01:44.220> Grizzly<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.880> we<00:01:45.239> relocated<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.170> air

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
the new Grizzly is we relocated the air

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.190 
the new Grizzly is we relocated the air
filter<00:01:46.770> under<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.340> seat<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:48.209> gave<00:01:48.509> us<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.720> lot

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
filter under the seat this gave us a lot

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
filter under the seat this gave us a lot
of<00:01:49.229> options<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.489> improve<00:01:50.849> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
of options and really improve the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.029 
of options and really improve the
overall<00:01:51.030> performance<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:52.200> allowed<00:01:52.800> us<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
overall performance it allowed us to

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.219 
overall performance it allowed us to
actually<00:01:53.459> put<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> bigger<00:01:54.300> air<00:01:54.599> filter<00:01:55.050> element

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
actually put a bigger air filter element

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.469 
actually put a bigger air filter element
in<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.830> Grizzly<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.520> service<00:01:56.970> intervals

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
in the Grizzly so service intervals

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.339 
in the Grizzly so service intervals
become<00:01:57.840> longer

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
become longer

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.680 
become longer
it<00:01:58.739> gave<00:01:58.950> us<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.190> longer<00:01:59.459> intake<00:02:00.090> tract<00:02:00.420> which

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
it gave us a longer intake tract which

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.880 
it gave us a longer intake tract which
actually<00:02:01.050> improved<00:02:01.709> the<00:02:01.860> overall

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
actually improved the overall

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.490 
actually improved the overall
performance<00:02:02.459> of<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.000> motor<00:02:03.239> it<00:02:03.810> also<00:02:04.200> freed

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
performance of the motor it also freed

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.290 
performance of the motor it also freed
up<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:04.709> space<00:02:05.099> in<00:02:05.310> front<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> seat<00:02:05.970> for

from 686 I believe so there is more and
they've<00:04:32.669> done<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.940> lot<00:04:33.030> with<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.389> like<00:04:33.539> Travis

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
they've done a lot with it like Travis

it

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.520 
it
it's<00:04:36.000> gulping<00:04:36.570> more<00:04:36.720> air<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.139> making<00:04:37.289> more

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530
