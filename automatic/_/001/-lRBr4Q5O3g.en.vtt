and I'm taking some of the pod hd500
d250<00:03:27.060> magic<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.840> applying<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.320> just<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
d250 magic and applying it just to the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.130 
d250 magic and applying it just to the
bridge<00:03:28.980> position<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.210> jtv<00:03:30.660> with<00:03:30.840> all<00:03:31.020> the

bridge position of the jtv with all the
Variax<00:03:31.500> functionality<00:03:32.160> bypass<00:03:32.520> so<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.000> can

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
Variax functionality bypass so you can

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.520 
Variax functionality bypass so you can
hear<00:03:33.180> what<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.390> guitar<00:03:33.660> sounds<00:03:33.900> like<00:03:34.080> kind<00:03:34.500> of

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
hear what the guitar sounds like kind of

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.370 
hear what the guitar sounds like kind of

front end of the p75 model then i'm

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.110

reverb<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.100> sound<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.430> think<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:48.060> going<00:03:48.150> to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
reverb for a sound I think it's going to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:04:16.780 
reverb for a sound I think it's going to
be<00:03:48.330> kind<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.600> familiar
