00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
talking to my buddy the other day if

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.980 
talking to my buddy the other day if
like<00:04:22.580> there<00:04:22.760> was<00:04:22.849> such<00:04:23.030> thing<00:04:23.060> as<00:04:23.389> an<00:04:23.510> opposite

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
like there was such thing as an opposite

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.990 
like there was such thing as an opposite
world<00:04:24.289> and<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:24.949> that<00:04:25.010> world<00:04:25.190> like<00:04:25.610> everything

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
world and in that world like everything

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.430 
world and in that world like everything
would<00:04:26.120> be<00:04:26.240> opposite<00:04:26.630> of<00:04:26.750> what<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:26.990> is<00:04:27.080> in<00:04:27.229> this

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
would be opposite of what it is in this

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.290 
would be opposite of what it is in this
world<00:04:27.740> so<00:04:28.099> instead<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.520> like<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:29.000> know<00:04:29.210> people

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
world so instead of like you know people

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.200 
world so instead of like you know people
walking<00:04:30.199> dogs<00:04:30.500> dogs<00:04:30.979> with<00:04:31.250> wrong<00:04:31.460> people<00:04:31.820> all

walking dogs dogs with wrong people all
right<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.539> then<00:04:32.659> the<00:04:32.780> dogs<00:04:33.020> would<00:04:33.229> have<00:04:33.260> to

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
right and then the dogs would have to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.379 
right and then the dogs would have to
pick<00:04:33.650> up<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:33.889> people<00:04:34.130> shit<00:04:34.610> only<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.180> shit

that<00:04:36.800> put<00:04:36.949> them<00:04:37.099> out<00:04:37.190> of<00:04:37.220> their<00:04:37.340> mouths

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
that put them out of their mouths

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.700 
that put them out of their mouths
wouldn't<00:04:38.599> matter<00:04:38.750> because<00:04:39.139> the<00:04:39.380> shit<00:04:39.590> would

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
wouldn't matter because the shit would

have nothing to do with language they're

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.570 
have nothing to do with language they're
not<00:05:13.120> based<00:05:13.360> in<00:05:13.600> language<00:05:14.020> so<00:05:14.229> we<00:05:14.410> have<00:05:14.979> words

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
not based in language so we have words

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.090 
not based in language so we have words
in<00:05:15.970> language<00:05:16.600> that<00:05:16.870> we<00:05:17.199> use<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.919> describe

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
in language that we use to describe

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.800 
in language that we use to describe
those<00:05:18.520> sounds<00:05:18.970> but<00:05:19.150> they're<00:05:19.300> not<00:05:19.450> in<00:05:19.600> fact

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
those sounds but they're not in fact

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.469 
those sounds but they're not in fact
that<00:05:20.110> real<00:05:20.560> noise<00:05:21.100> that<00:05:21.430> an<00:05:21.520> animal<00:05:21.940> makes<00:05:22.270> it

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
that real noise that an animal makes it

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.480 
that real noise that an animal makes it
varies<00:05:23.470> it's<00:05:23.740> really<00:05:23.950> simple

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
varies it's really simple

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.620 
varies it's really simple
oh<00:05:24.700> oh<00:05:25.290> oh<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:27.310> like<00:05:27.430> if<00:05:27.550> a<00:05:27.610> pizza<00:05:28.060> pig<00:05:28.360> says

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
oh oh oh so like if a pizza pig says

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.900 
oh oh oh so like if a pizza pig says
oink<00:05:28.870> oink<00:05:29.260> in<00:05:29.470> America<00:05:29.979> it<00:05:30.550> would<00:05:30.669> still<00:05:30.880> make

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
oink oink in America it would still make

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.790 
oink oink in America it would still make
the<00:05:31.060> same<00:05:31.360> noise<00:05:31.570> in<00:05:31.780> France<00:05:32.080> but<00:05:32.380> they<00:05:32.470> say<00:05:32.740> it

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
the same noise in France but they say it

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.740 
the same noise in France but they say it
was<00:05:32.950> saying<00:05:33.160> coin<00:05:33.430> coin<00:05:33.820> because<00:05:34.479> in<00:05:34.570> reality

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
was saying coin coin because in reality

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.810 
was saying coin coin because in reality
it's<00:05:35.440> not<00:05:35.650> saying<00:05:35.919> either<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.370> word<00:05:36.520> is<00:05:36.669> just

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
it's not saying either the word is just

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.850 
it's not saying either the word is just
a<00:05:36.970> representation<00:05:37.330> that<00:05:38.139> acts<00:05:38.350> as<00:05:38.470> a<00:05:38.530> proxy

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
a representation that acts as a proxy

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.409 
a representation that acts as a proxy
because<00:05:39.340> its<00:05:39.460> characteristic<00:05:40.030> of<00:05:40.090> the<00:05:40.210> type

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
because its characteristic of the type

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:47.909 
because its characteristic of the type
of<00:05:40.450> sound<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.900> pig<00:05:41.080> actually<00:05:41.410> makes<00:05:45.780> yes<00:05:46.919> then

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919
