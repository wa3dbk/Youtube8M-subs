00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
cooling unit on it and I wanted to use

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.349 
cooling unit on it and I wanted to use
those<00:00:23.310> two<00:00:23.430> cars<00:00:23.609> because<00:00:23.820> they're<00:00:23.970> very

those two cars because they're very

those two cars because they're very
similar<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.230> fact<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.439> they<00:00:25.590> both<00:00:25.830> have

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
similar in the fact that they both have

similar in the fact that they both have
custom<00:00:26.369> cooling<00:00:26.640> solutions<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.119> they're

custom cooling solutions and they're

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.849 
custom cooling solutions and they're
both<00:00:27.300> slightly<00:00:27.570> overclocked<00:00:28.109> now<00:00:28.590> what<00:00:28.740> we're

both slightly overclocked now what we're

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
both slightly overclocked now what we're
going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.789> test<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.240> we're<00:00:30.480> gonna

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
going to do for this test is we're gonna

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.389 
going to do for this test is we're gonna
overclock<00:00:31.019> them<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.320> far<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.219> them

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
overclock them as far as we can get them

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.670 
overclock them as far as we can get them
using<00:00:32.820> whatever<00:00:33.750> software<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.559> with

that<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.730> want<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> talk<00:00:54.449> about<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that we just want to talk about the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.959 
that we just want to talk about the
speed<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.860> these<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.070> gonna<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.309> DirectX<00:00:56.670> 11

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
speed and these are gonna be DirectX 11

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
speed and these are gonna be DirectX 11
or<00:00:57.090> DirectX<00:00:57.449> 10<00:00:57.719> benchmarks<00:00:58.440> DirectX<00:00:58.800> 12<00:00:58.920> is

or DirectX 10 benchmarks DirectX 12 is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.650 
or DirectX 10 benchmarks DirectX 12 is
not<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.550> yet<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.239> I'm<00:01:00.329> gonna<00:01:00.449> make<00:01:00.629> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
not a thing yet but I'm gonna make a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.240 
not a thing yet but I'm gonna make a
prediction<00:01:00.870> before<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.559> started<00:01:01.829> because

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
prediction before we get started because

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
prediction before we get started because
the<00:01:02.399> r9<00:01:02.579> fury<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.359> extremely<00:01:03.960> new<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the r9 fury is extremely new and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.920 
the r9 fury is extremely new and
slightly<00:01:04.949> more<00:01:05.549> expensive<00:01:05.700> by<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.630> little

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
slightly more expensive by like a little

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.630 
slightly more expensive by like a little
bit<00:01:07.049> depending<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.470> where<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
bit depending on where you get it and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.450 
bit depending on where you get it and
also<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.450> know<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> GTX<00:01:10.049> 980<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:11.159> goes<00:01:11.310> on

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
also the you know the GTX 980 it goes on

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.530 
also the you know the GTX 980 it goes on
sale<00:01:11.610> more<00:01:11.790> often<00:01:11.970> because<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.330> been<00:01:12.450> out

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
sale more often because it's been out

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
sale more often because it's been out
for<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.720> while<00:01:12.869> anyway<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> very<00:01:14.220> new<00:01:14.400> card

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
for a while anyway it's a very new card

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.910 
for a while anyway it's a very new card
I<00:01:14.820> expect<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> drivers<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.590> newer

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
I expect that as the drivers get newer

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.520 
I expect that as the drivers get newer
we're<00:01:17.640> gonna<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:17.939> better<00:01:18.330> performance<00:01:18.810> on

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
we're gonna see better performance on

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.370 
we're gonna see better performance on
the<00:01:19.770> side<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.460> fury<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.140> only<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the side of the fury but this is only a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.929 
the side of the fury but this is only a
speculation<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.280> that's<00:01:23.490> usually<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.790> way

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
speculation but that's usually the way

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.219 
speculation but that's usually the way
things<00:01:24.180> work<00:01:24.390> especially<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.110> have

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
things work especially when we have

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.719 
things work especially when we have
something<00:01:25.560> new<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.890> completely<00:01:26.640> new

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
something new this is completely new

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.249 
something new this is completely new
technology<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.360> high<00:01:27.479> band<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.110> with

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
technology with the high band and with

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.580 
technology with the high band and with
memory<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.930> DirectX<00:01:31.439> 12

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
memory and all that and when DirectX 12

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.580 
memory and all that and when DirectX 12
comes<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.840> Fury<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.380> going

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
comes up I think that the Fury is going

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.039 
comes up I think that the Fury is going
to<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.829> substantially<00:01:35.460> faster<00:01:35.640> by<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.780> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
to get substantially faster by like you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.410 
to get substantially faster by like you
know<00:01:37.140> 10<00:01:37.380> 15<00:01:37.530> 20<00:01:38.009> %<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:39.030> because

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
know 10 15 20 % and that's because

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.350 
know 10 15 20 % and that's because
DirectX<00:01:40.320> 12<00:01:40.470> borrows<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.250> lot<00:01:41.549> from<00:01:41.610> mantle<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
DirectX 12 borrows a lot from mantle and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.899 
DirectX 12 borrows a lot from mantle and
mantle<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.049> that's<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> API<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.670> AMD

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
mantle and that's the API that that AMD

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.389 
mantle and that's the API that that AMD
was<00:01:45.149> working<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:46.290> gives<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.799> lower

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
was working on that gives you lower

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.280 
was working on that gives you lower

only able to push that to about 11 33 I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.660 
only able to push that to about 11 33 I

had to bump the power boost up to 13% we

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.370 
had to bump the power boost up to 13% we

got it running at 11:40 a couple of

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.350 
got it running at 11:40 a couple of
times<00:02:24.530> which<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:24.800> only<00:02:25.070> 100<00:02:25.490> megahertz<00:02:25.700> over

factory

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.280

so<00:02:30.520> not<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.550> crazy<00:02:32.000> overclock<00:02:32.510> all<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.080> aside

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
so not a crazy overclock all that aside

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.240 
so not a crazy overclock all that aside
we're<00:02:33.500> gonna<00:02:33.590> talk<00:02:33.770> about<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.040> performance

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
we're gonna talk about the performance

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.670 
we're gonna talk about the performance
right<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:35.240> frickin<00:02:35.870> minute<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.350> just<00:02:36.530> see

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
right this frickin minute and just see

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.990 
right this frickin minute and just see
where<00:02:36.800> these<00:02:36.890> two<00:02:37.100> cards<00:02:37.400> stand<00:02:37.670> we're<00:02:37.910> gonna

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
where these two cards stand we're gonna

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.660 
where these two cards stand we're gonna
start<00:02:38.300> off<00:02:38.420> by<00:02:38.660> looking<00:02:39.080> at<00:02:39.410> valley<00:02:39.860> at<00:02:40.400> 4k

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
start off by looking at valley at 4k

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.730 
start off by looking at valley at 4k
they're<00:02:41.390> both<00:02:41.600> having<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.960> lot<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.200> problems<00:02:42.650> I

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
they're both having a lot of problems I

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.020 
they're both having a lot of problems I
mean<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.100> turn<00:02:43.220> off<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.460> AAT<00:02:43.700> relate

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
mean you have to turn off the AAT relate

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.540 
mean you have to turn off the AAT relate
it<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.210> work<00:02:44.660> but<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:45.860> can't<00:02:46.100> benchmark

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
it to work but it's a can't benchmark

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.850 
it to work but it's a can't benchmark
we're<00:02:46.760> starting<00:02:47.030> off<00:02:47.120> at<00:02:47.300> 4k<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.200> as<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.740> can

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
we're starting off at 4k and as you can

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.280 
we're starting off at 4k and as you can
see<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.550> AMD<00:02:49.910> slightly<00:02:50.390> wins<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.780> r9<00:02:50.930> fury

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
see the AMD slightly wins the r9 fury

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.800 
see the AMD slightly wins the r9 fury
slightly<00:02:51.770> wins<00:02:52.010> but<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.760> minimum<00:02:53.030> dip<00:02:53.600> down<00:02:53.750> a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
slightly wins but the minimum dip down a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.870 
slightly wins but the minimum dip down a
little<00:02:54.080> bit<00:02:54.290> lower<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.710> then<00:02:54.800> when<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.280> move

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
little bit lower and then when you move

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.480 
little bit lower and then when you move
it<00:02:55.970> up<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.090> 1080p<00:02:56.660> it's<00:02:57.620> almost<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.130> tie<00:02:58.280> with<00:02:58.460> a

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
it up to 1080p it's almost a tie with a

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.730 
it up to 1080p it's almost a tie with a
slight<00:02:58.820> edge<00:02:59.060> for<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.960> mean<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.350> very<00:03:00.530> slight

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
slight edge for I mean a very slight

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.900 
slight edge for I mean a very slight
edge<00:03:00.890> like<00:03:01.070> one<00:03:01.250> one<00:03:02.030> FPS<00:03:02.480> edge<00:03:03.050> for<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:04.130> 980

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
edge like one one FPS edge for the 980

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.680 
edge like one one FPS edge for the 980
bioshock<00:03:05.870> at<00:03:06.110> 4k<00:03:06.710> and<00:03:07.160> we<00:03:07.730> have<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> pretty<00:03:08.480> nice

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690

them dropped below 30 FPS at all they

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.850 
them dropped below 30 FPS at all they
didn't<00:03:18.380> even<00:03:18.470> get<00:03:18.620> close

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
didn't even get close

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.640 
didn't even get close
it's<00:03:19.610> an<00:03:19.700> ATP<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.300> our<00:03:20.810> time<00:03:20.960> fury<00:03:21.230> still<00:03:21.470> wins

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
it's an ATP the our time fury still wins

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.580 
it's an ATP the our time fury still wins
at<00:03:21.800> Bioshock<00:03:22.220> thief<00:03:22.640> running<00:03:23.360> at<00:03:23.450> 4k<00:03:23.630> very

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
at Bioshock thief running at 4k very

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.460 
at Bioshock thief running at 4k very
very<00:03:25.520> similar<00:03:25.880> results<00:03:26.270> but<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.930> want<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.380> point

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
very similar results but I want to point

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.580 
very similar results but I want to point
out<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.910> GTX<00:03:28.910> 980<00:03:29.120> was<00:03:29.900> slightly<00:03:30.200> ahead

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
out that the GTX 980 was slightly ahead

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.770 
out that the GTX 980 was slightly ahead
and<00:03:30.860> also<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.820> frame<00:03:32.060> time<00:03:32.300> for<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.510> little<00:03:32.690> bit

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
and also the frame time for a little bit

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.060 
and also the frame time for a little bit
better<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.170> maybe<00:03:33.440> they'll<00:03:33.650> have<00:03:33.740> to<00:03:33.860> improve

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
better so maybe they'll have to improve

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.410 
better so maybe they'll have to improve
that<00:03:34.190> in<00:03:34.370> software<00:03:34.670> but<00:03:34.850> we<00:03:34.910> had<00:03:35.030> some<00:03:35.180> dips

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
that in software but we had some dips

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.300 
that in software but we had some dips
the<00:03:35.750> r9<00:03:35.870> fury<00:03:36.260> that<00:03:36.440> brought<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.890> overall

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
the r9 fury that brought the the overall

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.950 
the r9 fury that brought the the overall
score<00:03:37.640> down<00:03:37.790> turn<00:03:38.180> on<00:03:38.270> mantle<00:03:38.630> though<00:03:38.780> the

score down turn on mantle though the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.480 
score down turn on mantle though the
story's<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.290> little<00:03:39.320> different<00:03:39.500> it's<00:03:39.890> now

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
story's a little different it's now

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.270 
story's a little different it's now
slightly<00:03:41.030> in<00:03:41.390> favor<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.350> fury<00:03:42.590> but<00:03:42.800> again

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
slightly in favor of the fury but again

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.100 
slightly in favor of the fury but again
not<00:03:43.700> by<00:03:43.880> much<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.240> we<00:03:44.450> did<00:03:44.600> have<00:03:44.690> some<00:03:44.750> frame

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
not by much and we did have some frame

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
fury slightly ahead benchmarks are so

fury slightly ahead benchmarks are so
close<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.250> want<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.670> point<00:03:52.790> out<00:03:52.850> that

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
close and I want to point out that

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.120 
close and I want to point out that

the<00:03:55.610> fury<00:03:55.880> was<00:03:56.060> quite<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.540> bit<00:03:56.750> ahead<00:03:56.840> but<00:03:57.170> you

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
the fury was quite a bit ahead but you

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.810 
the fury was quite a bit ahead but you
know<00:03:57.560> we're<00:03:58.310> all<00:03:58.430> gonna<00:03:58.520> play<00:03:58.670> this

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
know we're all gonna play this

it's around 10 FPS faster the the fury
is<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:03.800> is<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.520> theory<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:04.970> that<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.420> all

right<00:04:05.900> now<00:04:05.960> before<00:04:06.080> I<00:04:06.260> talk<00:04:06.380> about<00:04:06.440> trying<00:04:06.770> 3

right now before I talk about trying 3

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.650 
right now before I talk about trying 3
they<00:04:07.310> both<00:04:07.520> have<00:04:07.730> their<00:04:07.940> own<00:04:08.060> technologies

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
they both have their own technologies

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.870 
they both have their own technologies
that<00:04:08.780> allow<00:04:09.020> you<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.200> play<00:04:09.350> 4k<00:04:09.860> games<00:04:10.310> on<00:04:10.820> a

that allow you to play 4k games on a
1080p<00:04:11.480> monitor<00:04:11.990> you<00:04:12.380> get<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.560> basically<00:04:12.800> run

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
1080p monitor you get to basically run

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.950 
1080p monitor you get to basically run
the<00:04:13.370> game<00:04:13.490> at<00:04:13.610> 4k<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.270> then<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:14.930> know

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
the game at 4k and then it you know

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.500 
the game at 4k and then it you know
squishes<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.770> for<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.190> 1080p<00:04:16.730> monitor<00:04:16.820> and

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
squishes it for a 1080p monitor and

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.780 
squishes it for a 1080p monitor and
NVIDIA<00:04:18.080> calls<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.890> know<00:04:19.010> DSR<00:04:19.460> dynamic

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
NVIDIA calls it you know DSR dynamic

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.129 
NVIDIA calls it you know DSR dynamic
super<00:04:19.970> resolution<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.450> then<00:04:20.540> we<00:04:20.600> got<00:04:20.720> VSR

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
super resolution and then we got VSR

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.499 
super resolution and then we got VSR
on<00:04:22.560> for<00:04:23.129> AMD<00:04:23.340> they're<00:04:23.879> both<00:04:23.970> basically<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
on for AMD they're both basically the

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:25.790 
on for AMD they're both basically the
same<00:04:24.659> thing<00:04:24.960> now<00:04:25.319> I<00:04:25.349> want<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.500> talk<00:04:25.620> about

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
same thing now I want to talk about

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.140 
same thing now I want to talk about
trying<00:04:25.979> three<00:04:26.250> because<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.849> know<00:04:26.970> if<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
trying three because you know if the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.570 
trying three because you know if the
filters<00:04:27.479> turned<00:04:27.750> pretty<00:04:28.500> much<00:04:28.620> all<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.490> way

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
filters turned pretty much all the way

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.550 
filters turned pretty much all the way
to<00:04:29.639> max<00:04:29.909> 1080p<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.960> about<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:31.379> same

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
to max 1080p is about the same

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.529 
to max 1080p is about the same
performance<00:04:31.680> as<00:04:32.069> 4k<00:04:32.400> with<00:04:32.759> medium<00:04:33.150> filters

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
performance as 4k with medium filters

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.110 
performance as 4k with medium filters
and<00:04:33.750> 4k<00:04:34.080> looks<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.469> hell<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:34.889> a<00:04:34.979> lot<00:04:35.129> sharper<00:04:35.340> so

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
and 4k looks a hell of a lot sharper so

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.520 
and 4k looks a hell of a lot sharper so
think<00:04:36.780> about<00:04:36.870> that<00:04:37.080> when<00:04:37.229> you're<00:04:37.289> hearing

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
think about that when you're hearing

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.809 
think about that when you're hearing
these<00:04:37.620> 4k<00:04:37.949> results<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.310> lot<00:04:38.430> people<00:04:38.520> are<00:04:38.669> like

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
these 4k results a lot people are like

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.080 
these 4k results a lot people are like
why<00:04:39.419> are<00:04:39.479> you<00:04:39.569> doing<00:04:39.810> 4k<00:04:40.259> 1080p<00:04:40.919> in<00:04:41.159> 1440p<00:04:41.879> or

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
why are you doing 4k 1080p in 1440p or

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.670 
why are you doing 4k 1080p in 1440p or
what<00:04:42.210> most<00:04:42.360> people<00:04:42.599> have<00:04:42.689> them<00:04:42.840> like<00:04:42.960> no<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.319> lot

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
what most people have them like no a lot

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.290 
what most people have them like no a lot
of<00:04:43.740> people<00:04:43.919> can<00:04:44.009> play<00:04:44.159> 4k<00:04:44.580> on<00:04:44.729> their<00:04:44.909> 1080p

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.700 
medium filters the fury is a little bit
ahead<00:04:50.849> it's<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.389> know<00:04:51.479> you<00:04:51.569> see<00:04:51.659> 72<00:04:51.990> or<00:04:52.020> 67<00:04:52.560> so

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
ahead it's you know you see 72 or 67 so

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.740 
ahead it's you know you see 72 or 67 so
not<00:04:53.430> crazy<00:04:53.729> but<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.180> little<00:04:54.389> bit<00:04:54.479> of<00:04:54.539> head<00:04:54.659> and

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
not crazy but a little bit of head and

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.619 
not crazy but a little bit of head and
then<00:04:55.139> at<00:04:55.409> 1080p<00:04:55.889> again<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:57.000> Fury's<00:04:57.300> a<00:04:57.330> little

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629 
then at 1080p again the Fury's a little

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.020 
then at 1080p again the Fury's a little
bit<00:04:57.719> ahead<00:04:57.780> but<00:04:58.080> both<00:04:58.229> cards<00:04:58.650> are<00:04:58.919> similar<00:04:59.849> as

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
bit ahead but both cards are similar as

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.149 
bit ahead but both cards are similar as
far<00:05:00.360> as<00:05:00.659> their<00:05:01.080> performance<00:05:01.199> between<00:05:01.710> 1080

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.010 
far as their performance between 1080
and<00:05:02.280> 4k<00:05:02.639> so<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:03.270> vanishing<00:05:03.599> of<00:05:03.629> Ethan<00:05:03.900> Carter

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
and 4k so the vanishing of Ethan Carter

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.290 
and 4k so the vanishing of Ethan Carter
is<00:05:04.199> an<00:05:04.289> Unreal<00:05:04.590> Engine<00:05:04.710> game<00:05:05.099> and<00:05:05.370> in<00:05:05.940> that<00:05:06.150> one
