00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
chart on the side there and make a

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.070 
chart on the side there and make a
notation<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.920> where<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.820> set<00:01:32.150> up<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.540> that's

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.170 
field guide right here to the birds and
there's<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.620> lot<00:03:26.829> of<00:03:26.859> birds<00:03:27.219> in<00:03:27.519> here<00:03:27.969> in<00:03:28.060> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
there's a lot of birds in here in the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.750 
there's a lot of birds in here in the
states<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.719> about<00:03:28.989> 900<00:03:29.739> in<00:03:29.889> here<00:03:30.219> that<00:03:30.459> i<00:03:30.489> could

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
states is about 900 in here that i could

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.440 
states is about 900 in here that i could
virtually<00:03:31.239> see<00:03:31.950> but<00:03:32.950> being<00:03:33.730> new<00:03:33.909> to<00:03:33.939> birding<00:03:34.389> i

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
virtually see but being new to birding i

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.199 
virtually see but being new to birding i
want<00:03:34.629> to<00:03:34.689> simplify<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.230> as<00:03:35.409> much<00:03:35.620> as<00:03:35.650> possible

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
want to simplify it as much as possible

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.869 
want to simplify it as much as possible
so<00:03:37.409> start<00:03:38.409> out<00:03:38.590> in<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:38.950> beginning<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.549> learn

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
so start out in the beginning and learn

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.849 
so start out in the beginning and learn
your<00:03:40.120> bird<00:03:40.329> shapes<00:03:41.019> if<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:41.379> don't<00:03:41.560> know<00:03:41.709> the

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
your bird shapes if you don't know the

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.030 
your bird shapes if you don't know the
shape<00:03:42.099> of<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.400> bird<00:03:42.609> it's<00:03:42.939> hard<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.469> identify<00:03:44.469> it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
shape of a bird it's hard to identify it

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.330 
shape of a bird it's hard to identify it
and<00:03:45.459> it's<00:03:46.359> hard<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.719> ask<00:03:46.900> somebody<00:03:47.620> who<00:03:47.980> does

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
and it's hard to ask somebody who does

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.129 
and it's hard to ask somebody who does
know<00:03:48.609> it<00:03:48.819> so<00:03:49.239> i<00:03:49.269> think<00:03:49.359> this<00:03:49.599> is<00:03:49.659> the<00:03:49.780> shape

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
know it so i think this is the shape

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.659 
know it so i think this is the shape
right<00:03:50.500> here<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.980> everybody<00:03:51.400> would<00:03:51.609> know

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
right here that everybody would know

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.259 
right here that everybody would know
just<00:03:52.510> right<00:03:52.719> offhand<00:03:52.900> what<00:03:53.439> it<00:03:53.620> is<00:03:53.799> this<00:03:54.790> one<00:03:55.060> a

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
just right offhand what it is this one a

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.119 
just right offhand what it is this one a
lot<00:03:55.510> of<00:03:55.629> people<00:03:55.989> would<00:03:56.139> obably<00:03:56.500> know<00:03:56.680> as<00:03:56.889> well

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
lot of people would obably know as well

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.909 
lot of people would obably know as well
when<00:03:57.879> birds<00:03:58.150> are<00:03:58.389> in<00:03:58.449> the<00:03:58.689> air<00:03:58.870> they<00:03:59.379> can<00:03:59.650> tend

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
when birds are in the air they can tend

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.069 
when birds are in the air they can tend
to<00:04:00.129> look<00:04:00.310> differently<00:04:00.939> so<00:04:01.599> it<00:04:01.750> can<00:04:01.870> take<00:04:02.019> a

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
to look differently so it can take a

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.379 
to look differently so it can take a
look<00:04:02.409> at<00:04:02.530> this<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:03.310> look<00:04:03.519> at<00:04:03.669> this<00:04:03.790> wing<00:04:04.060> shape

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
look at this and look at this wing shape

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.360 
look at this and look at this wing shape
that<00:04:04.629> this<00:04:04.780> one<00:04:04.989> offers<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.739> that<00:04:06.010> this<00:04:06.159> one

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
that this one offers and that this one

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.099 
that this one offers and that this one
all<00:04:06.579> first<00:04:06.879> and<00:04:07.419> then<00:04:07.540> we<00:04:07.629> can<00:04:07.659> take<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.959> look

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
all first and then we can take a look

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.839 
all first and then we can take a look
down<00:04:08.439> here<00:04:08.469> this<00:04:09.040> one<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.459> see<00:04:09.609> something

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
down here this one and see something

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.240 
down here this one and see something
very<00:04:10.239> different<00:04:10.449> going<00:04:10.719> on<00:04:11.109> so<00:04:11.739> those<00:04:11.980> are<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
very different going on so those are the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.000 
very different going on so those are the
kinds<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.269> observations<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.650> want<00:04:14.889> to

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
kinds of observations that you want to

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.729 
kinds of observations that you want to
get<00:04:15.819> in<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.000> practice<00:04:16.539> of<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:17.289> that<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.560> know

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
get in the practice of so that you know

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.680 
get in the practice of so that you know
what<00:04:17.919> you're<00:04:18.099> looking<00:04:18.220> at<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:19.209> want<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.509> take

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
what you're looking at you want to take

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.110 
what you're looking at you want to take
a<00:04:19.720> possession<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.859> your<00:04:20.889> book<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.519> go<00:04:22.000> ahead

book I'm going to be your land large

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.110 
book I'm going to be your land large
large<00:04:28.659> water<00:04:28.990> birds<00:04:29.320> I've<00:04:29.590> got<00:04:30.190> an<00:04:30.310> index<00:04:30.789> tab

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
large water birds I've got an index tab

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.659 
large water birds I've got an index tab
on<00:04:31.360> here<00:04:31.840> take<00:04:32.349> it<00:04:32.500> easy<00:04:32.710> for<00:04:33.039> me<00:04:33.159> in<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.370> field

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
on here take it easy for me in the field

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.200 
on here take it easy for me in the field
to<00:04:33.880> find<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.419> the<00:04:35.110> next<00:04:35.470> group<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.860> birds<00:04:36.340> that

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
to find it the next group of birds that

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.200 
to find it the next group of birds that
I<00:04:37.270> have<00:04:37.570> indexed<00:04:38.259> here<00:04:38.590> are<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:39.310> large<00:04:39.610> land

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210

I have indexed here are the large land
Birds<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:42.159> takes<00:04:42.340> up<00:04:42.580> about<00:04:42.699> a<00:04:42.880> quarter

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
Birds so this takes up about a quarter

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.510 
Birds so this takes up about a quarter
of<00:04:43.599> the<00:04:44.020> book<00:04:44.229> and<00:04:44.530> then<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.860> next<00:04:44.889> one<00:04:45.340> is

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
of the book and then the next one is

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.980 
of the book and then the next one is
going<00:04:45.669> to<00:04:45.759> take<00:04:45.970> up<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.270> quarter<00:04:46.630> of<00:04:46.659> the<00:04:46.780> book

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990

give me some challenges and I have those

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.700 
give me some challenges and I have those
marked<00:05:00.280> here<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:01.750> first<00:05:01.990> one<00:05:02.170> is<00:05:02.200> the
