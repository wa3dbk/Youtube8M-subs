00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.400 

so<00:00:25.090> there's<00:00:25.240> little<00:00:25.720> differences<00:00:26.170> here

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
so there's little differences here

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.580 
so there's little differences here
between<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.920> two<00:00:26.950> models<00:00:27.430> they<00:00:27.880> are<00:00:28.590> very
