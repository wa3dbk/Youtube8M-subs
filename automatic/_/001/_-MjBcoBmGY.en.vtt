people are in this business is to make a
living<00:03:12.440> painting<00:03:13.070> maybe<00:03:13.760> that's<00:03:13.940> where<00:03:14.120> they

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
living painting maybe that's where they

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.630 
living painting maybe that's where they
can<00:03:14.450> t<00:03:14.600> out<00:03:14.720> updated<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:15.950> but<00:03:16.190> when<00:03:16.310> they<00:03:16.400> go<00:03:16.520> in

to<00:03:32.420> is<00:03:32.930> we<00:03:33.140> have<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.290> have<00:03:33.440> fast<00:03:33.680> work<00:03:33.890> speed

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
to is we have to have fast work speed

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.310 
to is we have to have fast work speed
and<00:03:34.400> we've<00:03:34.820> now<00:03:35.060> created<00:03:35.390> an<00:03:35.690> atom<00:03:36.050> ization

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
and we've now created an atom ization

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.810 
and we've now created an atom ization
that<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.740> droplets<00:03:37.160> are<00:03:37.280> so<00:03:37.400> close<00:03:37.610> together

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
that the droplets are so close together

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.880 
that the droplets are so close together
that<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.540> doesn't<00:03:38.870> leave<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.200> solvent<00:03:39.650> or<00:03:39.740> the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
that it doesn't leave the solvent or the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.260 
that it doesn't leave the solvent or the
water<00:03:40.040> laying<00:03:40.370> around<00:03:40.610> those<00:03:40.760> droplets<00:03:41.000> it

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
water laying around those droplets it

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.820 
water laying around those droplets it
presses<00:03:41.600> it<00:03:41.720> out<00:03:41.810> quicker<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:42.590> we're<00:03:42.710> getting

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
presses it out quicker so we're getting

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.620 
presses it out quicker so we're getting
faster<00:03:43.250> flash<00:03:43.430> off<00:03:43.670> times<00:03:43.940> faster<00:03:44.420> through

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
faster flash off times faster through

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.270 
faster flash off times faster through
care<00:03:44.810> times<00:03:45.110> I<00:03:45.350> can<00:03:45.710> get<00:03:45.830> them<00:03:45.920> in<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.040> out<00:03:46.190> of

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
care times I can get them in and out of

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.650 
care times I can get them in and out of
the<00:03:46.340> booth<00:03:46.460> quicker<00:03:46.730> we<00:03:47.120> also<00:03:47.270> got<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.540> share
