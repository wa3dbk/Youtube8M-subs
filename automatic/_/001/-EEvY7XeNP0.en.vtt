00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.549
 another video from me i am three apps 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.859
 including the review on this today 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.130
 sticker tree casey reimer for the iphone 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.290
 5 5 s and the ipad heritage all purpose 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.089
 Amazon ordered because I wanted mine 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.560
 ipad he now with stickern 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.420
 stick over but then I have me 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.189
 thought it could be a week later 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.539
 I do not like it anymore or that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.240
 just not so good in the hand 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.220
 like the ipad in itself without anything 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.689
 it and that's why I was thinking looking 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.519
 I prefer an alternative where you can 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.260
 more easily can remove am 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.120
 then directly first on Amazon and have 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 Looked for a sticker tree case 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.930
 and then I found these here 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.730
 which was actually quite cheap 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.000
 So I think I have for both cases 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.590
 altogether about 20 euro paid if we there 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.210
 not sure though 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.800
 Of course, the links to the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.660
 individual products as always below in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.039
 otherwise have the video description 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.960
 Of course I first looked like that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.940
 ratings are so from these levels 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.379
 Unfortunately, none of them could be found here 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.629
 So that means I have to do that now 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.480
 just buy it yourself and test it like that 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.489
 It is then in practice and was on 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.619
 every case was very positively surprised 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.119
 So the first time as the heights here 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.159
 I could not have attached any 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.100
 Mistakes are so that everything is very much 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.900
 accurate and very precise the material of 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.780
 the whole thing is a bit harder now 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.820
 Plastic outside and that's all 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.320
 Perfect the recesses are very good 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.390
 the buttons are very easy 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.040
 press and on the back is then 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.049
 as I said this motif here with the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.640
 all different sticks and looks 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.530
 in my opinion also really cool 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.689
 from as you could your opinion to the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.549
 All the way down the contact costs me 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.290
 it's really interesting right now 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.689
 Definitely one of my favorites 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.850
 Cases why use the most 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.100
 because I'm so in the partner look so of the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.840
 if in ipad and iphone should have 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.310
 it is definitely cool if 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.500
 both the same height have the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.670
 graphics are very well rendered so 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.829
 There was definitely a lot 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.850
 high quality printer used as of me 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.979
 it is definitely a clear one 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.020
 Purchase recommendation as for this price can 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.640
 you do not do anything wrong otherwise 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 Of course it is a matter of taste if I 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.090
 something like that could be there without it 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.320
 consider beating as left and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.759
 Of course we are months in the video 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.560
 description otherwise I would say 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.520
 if I liked it again 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.250
 I myself and thumb up 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.869
 Look forward to a comment 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.610
 otherwise if you do not have another 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.290
 subscribe to more videos 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.210
 in any case, this channel quarter on 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.010

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.600
