00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.470
 hi all merchant this is my new 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.750
 release of mine craft mechanisms today 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.170
 I will shoot not one but how could you have 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:32.000
 notice my good friend not myself 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:34.790
 since the pixel is all close friends yes 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.070
 the reaction is just divine today we 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.829
 we will show this mechanism 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.079
 he was here done stage sillies on my 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.500
 the world but the mechanism is very interesting very 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.750
 helpful there is one problem in this 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.539
 the mechanism that it will need to replenish 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.940
 the garden but how will it be replenished from behind and how 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.940
 make it sit endless I'm you 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.940
 I show what makes this mechanism is 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.780
 essentially a stove filler we have 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.940
 a stove in which there is nothing but if you 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.400
 you need to fill it you just click 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.940
 This button starts filling 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.909
 the stoves 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.880
 as you see, coal is starting to attack 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.580
 here we press the button again coal 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.800
 stops coming very comfortable very 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.030
 useful so well let's go and immediately 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.390
 we will construct that it was convenient to begin with 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.940
 what scheme will be placed in the wall if 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.400
 do you want the stove to stand like this 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.470
 like on the floor 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.840
 then you have to move the whole circuit down 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.280
 but I think it's easy for you to figure it out. 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.890
 what 's what 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.560
 We set the oven so it's nice 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.020
 looks at 2 blocks and put here 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.020
 a lamp so that we see pity for 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.870
 did not put the button so we turn 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.210
 back scheme first thing we need 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.750
 do we need a funnel need a funnel 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.330
 We put here so funnel stove that could 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.060
 to get fired in this funnel we need 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.010
 put let's take 100 miles of crazy 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.680
 we have enough for the test 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.930
 also to make this infinite 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.050
 I advise the tank to put it like this 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.300
 a little hooper 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.400
 even a full one clogged hopper to you 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.490
 will not be right away as for 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.910
 remelting stark need about 8 pieces 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.210
 Coal and I think will be enough and one 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.910
 funnel while here got some coal 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.970
 until we had time to block so you 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.450
 set everything up 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.630
 signal we output via the repeater from 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.570
 buttons do you understand the button this lamp 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.910
 we carry my lodge like this 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.360
 Opera through hopper two blocks set here 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.520
 so here you need on this place 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.880
 sharpen your attention this is such 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.310
 mechanism come on and trigger according to 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:02.450
 I remember this here a lot 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:04.820
 mechanism already made a little video well 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.730
 it is so to say the generator is short 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.910
 momentum is a trigger all in one 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.380
 Well, I think you know him if you look 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.360
 channel and simple 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.000
 generally when here appears 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.760
 signal from the button it goes here on 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.060
 torch and here redstone is very well 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.580
 a piece of loot from the opera are moved with 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.730
 of this funnel in it when we press still 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.290
 time he moves back that is 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.200
 when we press the button over here 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.170
 a signal appears and unlocks here 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.280
 This super amount will begin to transfer to you 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.580
 right here in the oven clearing enough 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.310
 just there is one huge plus 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.560
 of this scheme and we are so abundant that is 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.070
 you can build a lot like this in a row 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.239
 Sword can I did not know to make a length 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.610
 so 10 stoves and even above each button on 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.680
 that is very convenient so now I 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.830
 I will show you one very interesting diagram. 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.400
 we developed together but there is a small 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.980
 the difficulty this scheme gives the same well 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.200
 coal when we press the button she 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.290
 generally very compact well let's 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.989
 see here we clicked the button that's how 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.299
 you see began 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.849
 come killed let's see how she 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.229
 everything works very simply sitting here 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:28.330
 Denis throws but oh well if 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.000
 you have a good friend on the server and you 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.900
 play together then you can use 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.530
 Such a method through if you of course all 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:43.169
 thanks for watching you was 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.169
 units on all bye everyone bye everyone good luck
