00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
happened to my first try it's pretty

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.470 
happened to my first try it's pretty
cool<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.849> was<00:02:38.910> because<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.209> was<00:02:39.360> it

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
cool I think it was because I was it

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.030 
cool I think it was because I was it
taking<00:02:39.780> really<00:02:39.989> bad<00:02:40.140> care<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.829> had<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
taking really bad care of it and I had a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.800 
taking really bad care of it and I had a
whole<00:02:41.849> bunch<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.209> care<00:02:42.390> mistakes<00:02:42.690> already

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
whole bunch of care mistakes already

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.110 
whole bunch of care mistakes already
stacked<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:44.099> that<00:02:44.310> goes<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.579> prove<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.819> if

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
stacked up so that goes to prove that if

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.430 
stacked up so that goes to prove that if
you<00:02:45.239> have<00:02:45.359> a<00:02:45.389> bunch<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.690> stacked<00:02:45.989> up<00:02:46.170> already

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
you have a bunch of stacked up already

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.720 
you have a bunch of stacked up already
it<00:02:46.590> won't<00:02:46.739> be<00:02:46.859> too<00:02:46.980> hard<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.250> kill<00:02:47.459> what<00:02:47.639> you

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
it won't be too hard to kill what you

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.660 
it won't be too hard to kill what you
