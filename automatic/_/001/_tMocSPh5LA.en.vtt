 Announcement I will also be natural 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.590
 my first time with juniper six 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.330
 record and then a road to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.119
 make a digel the man needs if you want 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.800
 then the uniqa 6 has as you see here 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.840
 20 hedge with her to get the hedgehog 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.210
 and I'll get one in 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.949
 pack a small red seal and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.810
 each succession then experiencing receiving 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.010
 uniqa 6 in which I try the beagle 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.570
 has just unlock 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.279
 there could be a few funny ones 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
 naturally arising from it 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.739

 guide how to get the uniqa 6 fastest 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.170
 unlocks and see you 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.940
 members starts fell so reagan on 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.100
 congress but this map we have the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.390
 do best in conquest mode because 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.489
 there you can be sure that it too 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.829
 we have to work the floods 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.320
 down or make up depending on 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.420
 they are limping here on the map 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.579
 placed exactly the bridge 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.109
 bridge to the right of b 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.579
 of course we have to go there in 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.860
 I was still happy about this round 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.180
 did not have much time to go there 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.409
 but I still managed it like you 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.700
 Look , we are the same 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.920
 to lose 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.659
 and yes that's one of the tasks we do 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 do it with juniper six 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.110
 actually get a very light 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.729
 we just have to go here 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.380
 overrun instead of december completely 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.939
 to run over it and an easy target 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.100
 to be right here is the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.170
 ladder up and are already therewith 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.280
 grandma, but already half the rent 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.930
 we can do it less well 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.090
 to be shot down the stupid is just 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.100
 just as I said that left immediately 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.299
 a flag is well then you have to be real 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.700
 take care a little bit because you will 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.200
 you like to be unbalanced or with 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.610
 shotgun missiles or what knows 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.049
 So I always know how to take care 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.670
 it was already dead 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.960
 we go back here and through 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.810
 Here we already see the control 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.310
 panel either is the right one seemed 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.509
 without the left green if both are not 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.740
 flowers are then you have to just times 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.540
 wait a short time that is it was before 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.310
 activated shortly and then it is the same 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.530
 again activated as you can here 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.600
 looks at what and what has 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.640
 actually already the first task 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.000
 done for the uniqa six and now 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.610
 Let's move on to the second one 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.890
 the second task around the uniqa six 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.229
 to unlock it is five 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.240
 kill people in the water so from the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.340
 water out, I thought so 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.860
 is actually better if you do that 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.920
 in the lumpini gaarden makes like here 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.530
 conquest or domination because here must 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.880
 you just nice out of the water 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.130
 she wants to shoot like she said here 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.510
 you always pass well so the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.240
 Points are distributed so that you 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.590
 actually always the water 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.910
 actually always here in the middle is 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.370
 and people always have to go back and forth 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.900
 run and as you can see that 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.400
 People do not always that one either 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.170
 there in the water is check that not the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.910
 just wait was the throat where the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.140
 opponent is the look and find me 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.640
 but not so easy if you like me 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.590
 I should of course see you then 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.570
 easy goal or distance is 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.430
 hard to show anyone here anyway 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.870
 but if you just be patient 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.459
 you can look ugly here within 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.610
 From a short time I think I have ten 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.900
 minutes uses his five kills 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.340
 get together a big deal 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.750
 problem and as I said the people 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.550
 always have to 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.890
 English players always have to stay here 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.870
 over the bridge and that is really one 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.130
 a good thing hallein why so 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.510
 a little bit to watch here I have 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.890
 again the weapon changed and 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.090
 swimming is a bit stupid here 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.310
 and look a bit like I said 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.870
 at best place for me you can too 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.510
 on sank dragon when the tide 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.100
 from above and then at in one 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.209
 point one with the house however is 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.430
 me as far too busy and do not have 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.870
 a caught behind to wonderful of 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.880
 did not notice anything at the back 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.350
 that's the way it is and as I said 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.940
 really very fast that they have 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.560
 get together if you have me too 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.790
 he is still running away 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.290
 I do not know if that's the same 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.600
 was that another was now but 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.060
 however, how much to collect again 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.220
 I think I can not get away easily 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.650
 So problem as you see 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.630
 no big task as I said 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.100
 ten max. 15 minutes needed 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.950
 Here I have the magnum again 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.750
 unwrapped as a fault here 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.100
 there is also a bit of distance in the water 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.620
 it namely not as simple quantity of 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.390
 amount 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.659
 and because it's so funny 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.370
 but moving is actually an easy one 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.900
 thing is not really at all 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.959
 problem and so you can then slowly 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.280
 but surely enable uniqa six 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.489
 Of course, if you already do the flood 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.659
 and have injured throat and there have 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:15.180
 I already have my uniqa six-ya and 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.280
 people now next in an hour 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.430
 then follows my first time with the 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.690
 unique on 6 I hope he will be there 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.120
 and have fun and then there is still 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.600
 a road studio where I have 20 catchers 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.919
 make a look with the uniqa six times 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.229
 how easy we'll see each other 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.680
 then until next time home 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.680
 heralds
