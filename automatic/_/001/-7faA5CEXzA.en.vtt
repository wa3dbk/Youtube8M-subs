00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
up it's a little bit off there but

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.940 
up it's a little bit off there but
that's<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.990> compensate<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.650> coming<00:01:37.860> around

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
that's to compensate for coming around

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.670 
that's to compensate for coming around

fabric that's made of it feels very

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.160 
fabric that's made of it feels very
durable<00:01:42.329> does<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.689> feel<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
durable does it feel like it's going to

scratched or it's not it doesn't feel
like<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.649> an<00:01:46.710> appeal<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.040> from<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> edges

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
like it's an appeal it from the edges

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.160 
like it's an appeal it from the edges
because<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> shoved<00:01:48.600> underneath<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
because like it shoved underneath that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.380 
because like it shoved underneath that
plastic<00:01:49.680> not<00:01:50.220> glued<00:01:50.640> down<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.119> some<00:01:51.270> other

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
plastic not glued down like some other

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.660 
plastic not glued down like some other
cases<00:01:51.630> were<00:01:52.040> obviously<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.220> probably<00:01:53.460> glue

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
cases were obviously it's probably glue

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.069 
cases were obviously it's probably glue
down<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.090> doesn't<00:01:54.329> feel<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.689> glued

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
down but doesn't feel like it just glued

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.810 
down but doesn't feel like it just glued
down<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.560> paste<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:55.979> feels<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.700> it's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
down just paste it there feels like it's

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.310 
down just paste it there feels like it's
underneath<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.299> plastic<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> case

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
underneath that plastic of the case

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.469 
underneath that plastic of the case
itself<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.950> we'll<00:01:59.189> stay<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.060> case<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.420> not

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
itself so we'll stay on the case is not

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.270 
itself so we'll stay on the case is not
going<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.659> peel<00:02:00.930> up<00:02:01.110> or<00:02:01.259> fri<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.979> you

going to peel up or fri at all and you
do<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.759> nice<00:02:03.000> hard<00:02:03.360> plastic<00:02:03.479> design<00:02:04.200> of

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
do get that nice hard plastic design of

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.440 
do get that nice hard plastic design of
the<00:02:04.619> case<00:02:04.770> itself<00:02:05.070> which<00:02:05.579> will<00:02:05.880> bend<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.299> is

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the case itself which will bend it is

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.419 
the case itself which will bend it is
flexible<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.320> still<00:02:07.619> does<00:02:07.860> keep<00:02:08.039> its<00:02:08.190> hard

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
flexible but it still does keep its hard

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.190 
flexible but it still does keep its hard
rigid<00:02:08.700> shape<00:02:09.149> down<00:02:09.569> here<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.840> dock<00:02:10.020> it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
rigid shape down here at the dock it

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.320 
rigid shape down here at the dock it
does<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.470> little<00:02:10.590> bit<00:02:10.770> more<00:02:10.890> flexible<00:02:11.489> gets

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
does get a little bit more flexible gets

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.699 
does get a little bit more flexible gets
a<00:02:12.390> little<00:02:12.569> more<00:02:12.750> silicone<00:02:13.200> e<00:02:13.260> down<00:02:13.470> here<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
a little more silicone e down here to

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.940 
a little more silicone e down here to
die

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950

something that you wouldn't normally be

used to feeling under while you're

used to feeling under while you're
holding<00:04:21.630> your<00:04:21.780> iphone<00:04:22.049> so<00:04:22.440> it's<00:04:22.560> definitely

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
holding your iphone so it's definitely

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.339 
holding your iphone so it's definitely
something<00:04:23.010> different<00:04:23.479> over<00:04:24.479> time<00:04:24.840> i<00:04:25.080> believe

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
something different over time i believe

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.080 
something different over time i believe
that<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:25.740> case<00:04:26.010> because<00:04:26.220> of<00:04:26.580> this

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
that this case because of this

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.850 
that this case because of this
combination<00:04:27.540> with<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.660> white<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.169> feel<00:04:28.740> like

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
combination with the white I feel like

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.050 
combination with the white I feel like
going<00:04:29.070> in<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:29.370> out<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.460> your<00:04:29.610> pocket<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.940> lot

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
going in and out of your pocket a lot

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.760 
going in and out of your pocket a lot
and<00:04:30.240> getting<00:04:30.300> used<00:04:30.690> a<00:04:30.840> lot<00:04:30.960> being<00:04:31.260> put<00:04:31.590> down<00:04:31.620> a

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
and getting used a lot being put down a

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.650 
and getting used a lot being put down a
different<00:04:31.980> surfaces<00:04:32.580> I<00:04:32.760> feel<00:04:33.300> like<00:04:33.389> it<00:04:33.510> could

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
different surfaces I feel like it could

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.820 
different surfaces I feel like it could
suffer<00:04:34.110> from<00:04:34.230> a<00:04:34.320> little<00:04:34.650> bit<00:04:34.740> of

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
suffer from a little bit of

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.770 
suffer from a little bit of
discoloration<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.850> this<00:04:36.180> case<00:04:36.360> can<00:04:36.510> pick<00:04:36.660> up

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
discoloration that this case can pick up

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.689 
discoloration that this case can pick up
dirt<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.229> grime<00:04:37.470> over<00:04:37.860> time<00:04:38.100> because<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.490> is

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
dirt and grime over time because it is

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.189 
dirt and grime over time because it is
fabric<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.300> can't<00:04:39.600> really<00:04:39.810> throw<00:04:40.020> it<00:04:40.139> in

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
fabric and you can't really throw it in

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.290 
fabric and you can't really throw it in
the<00:04:40.290> wash<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.710> wash<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:40.889> maybe<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:41.970> could<00:04:42.120> but

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
the wash and wash it maybe you could but

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.850 
the wash and wash it maybe you could but
i<00:04:42.360> would<00:04:42.570> have<00:04:42.660> recommend<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.229> especially

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
i would have recommend it especially

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.650 
i would have recommend it especially
with<00:04:44.250> your<00:04:44.310> iphone<00:04:44.669> in<00:04:44.790> it<00:04:44.910> i<00:04:45.000> feel<00:04:45.270> that<00:04:45.330> this

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
with your iphone in it i feel that this

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.000 
with your iphone in it i feel that this
would<00:04:45.930> get<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.169> little<00:04:46.350> bit<00:04:46.440> dirty<00:04:46.620> over<00:04:46.830> time

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
would get a little bit dirty over time

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.100 
would get a little bit dirty over time
the<00:04:47.220> whites<00:04:47.460> would<00:04:47.669> continue<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.120> brown<00:04:48.449> that

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
the whites would continue to brown that

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.330 
the whites would continue to brown that
other<00:04:49.290> clothes<00:04:49.590> would<00:04:49.770> continue<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.250> get

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
other clothes would continue to get

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.700 
other clothes would continue to get
darker<00:04:50.760> over<00:04:50.970> time<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:52.290> don't<00:04:52.530> believe

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
darker over time and I don't believe

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.020 
darker over time and I don't believe
that<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:52.949> case<00:04:53.160> would<00:04:53.280> have<00:04:53.400> such<00:04:53.669> as<00:04:53.820> long

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
that this case would have such as long

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.790 
that this case would have such as long
as<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.210> lifespan<00:04:54.570> of<00:04:54.720> some<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:55.080> other<00:04:55.290> other

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
as a lifespan of some of other other

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.770 
as a lifespan of some of other other
cases<00:04:56.130> out<00:04:56.460> there<00:04:56.490> but<00:04:57.360> if<00:04:57.479> you're<00:04:57.600> getting

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
cases out there but if you're getting

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.629 
cases out there but if you're getting
this<00:04:57.930> case<00:04:58.139> for<00:04:58.440> maybe<00:04:58.650> by<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.250> time<00:04:59.340> the

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
this case for maybe by the time the

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.090 
this case for maybe by the time the
iphone<00:04:59.940> switches<00:05:00.300> sizes<00:05:00.780> within<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.470> year<00:05:01.680> so

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
iphone switches sizes within the year so

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.310 
iphone switches sizes within the year so
switches<00:05:02.850> models<00:05:03.270> you're<00:05:03.750> probably<00:05:03.990> going<00:05:04.229> to

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
switches models you're probably going to

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.690 
switches models you're probably going to
be<00:05:04.380> fine<00:05:04.620> unless<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:04.979> think<00:05:05.250> about<00:05:05.340> having

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
be fine unless you think about having

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.760 
be fine unless you think about having
this<00:05:05.760> case<00:05:05.940> for<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.120> super<00:05:06.540> long<00:05:06.570> time<00:05:06.930> that

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
this case for a super long time that

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.960 
this case for a super long time that
could<00:05:07.889> be<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.100> only<00:05:08.190> downside<00:05:08.639> I<00:05:08.669> can<00:05:08.820> really

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
could be the only downside I can really

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.520 
could be the only downside I can really
find<00:05:09.300> or<00:05:09.540> think<00:05:09.750> about<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.169> case<00:05:10.350> is<00:05:10.380> that

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
find or think about of this case is that

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.960 
find or think about of this case is that
it<00:05:10.830> would<00:05:11.070> probably<00:05:11.340> get<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.580> little<00:05:11.729> bit<00:05:11.820> dirty

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
it would probably get a little bit dirty

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.400 
it would probably get a little bit dirty
going<00:05:12.210> in<00:05:12.330> your<00:05:12.600> pocket<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:12.990> being<00:05:13.200> that<00:05:13.320> is

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
going in your pocket and being that is

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.690 
going in your pocket and being that is
material<00:05:13.919> it's<00:05:14.010> fabric<00:05:14.340> it's<00:05:14.460> like<00:05:14.580> you're

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
material it's fabric it's like you're

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.159 
material it's fabric it's like you're
closed<00:05:15.030> it's<00:05:15.510> going<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.750> eventually<00:05:15.930> get

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
closed it's going to eventually get

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.840 
closed it's going to eventually get
stained<00:05:16.440> is<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.710> gonna<00:05:16.950> eventually<00:05:17.340> get<00:05:17.580> dirty

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
stained is it gonna eventually get dirty

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.100 
stained is it gonna eventually get dirty
with<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.270> case<00:05:18.450> you<00:05:18.600> don't<00:05:18.720> want<00:05:18.840> to<00:05:18.900> worry
