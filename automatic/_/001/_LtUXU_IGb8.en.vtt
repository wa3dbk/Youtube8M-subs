00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.530 
firm roots is that yes we want to make
the<00:01:05.220> opportunity<00:01:05.730> available<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> be

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the opportunity available for you to be

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.240 
the opportunity available for you to be
as<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.870> you<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.080> be<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.260> football<00:01:07.590> but

as good as you can be at football but
whilst<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.640> got<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:08.970> realistic<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
whilst we got to be realistic and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.840 
whilst we got to be realistic and
recognize<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.040> everybody<00:01:11.250> in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
recognize that you know not everybody in

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.680 
footballer
so<00:01:14.040> therefore<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.610> learning<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.210> goes<00:01:15.240> on

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
so therefore the learning that goes on

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.140 
so therefore the learning that goes on
is<00:01:15.960> prime<00:01:16.320> importance<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:18.000> maintain

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
is prime importance if we can maintain

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.660 
is prime importance if we can maintain
the<00:01:18.570> level<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.840> progress<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.619> make<00:01:20.190> them<00:01:20.430> into

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the level of progress and make them into

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.580 
the level of progress and make them into
something<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.300> footballer<00:01:21.660> then<00:01:22.170> mission

something as a footballer then mission

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.330 
something as a footballer then mission
accomplished

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
accomplished

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.319

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.539 

the<00:01:28.630> transition<00:01:29.320> has<00:01:29.530> been<00:01:29.799> a<00:01:29.829> lot<00:01:30.100> smoother

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
the transition has been a lot smoother

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.060 
the transition has been a lot smoother
into<00:01:30.789> that<00:01:30.969> senior<00:01:31.630> skill<00:01:31.899> because<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.829> kids

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070
