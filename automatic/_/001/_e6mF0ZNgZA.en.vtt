00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
other ones hatching I haven't checked

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.280 
other ones hatching I haven't checked
these<00:02:19.680> ones<00:02:19.950> yet<00:02:20.160> oh<00:02:20.569> yes<00:02:21.569> one<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.110> Reds

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
these ones yet oh yes one of the Reds

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.759 
these ones yet oh yes one of the Reds
that's<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.280> good<00:02:23.400> sign<00:02:23.640> because<00:02:24.290> then<00:02:25.290> that

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
that's a good sign because then that

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.160 
that's a good sign because then that
elbow<00:02:26.099> is<00:02:26.220> sweating<00:02:26.519> because<00:02:27.269> normally<00:02:28.019> just

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
elbow is sweating because normally just

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.350 
elbow is sweating because normally just
when<00:02:28.379> one<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:29.190> want<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.610> add<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.970> container

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
when one just want to add the container

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.030 
when one just want to add the container
has<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.810> start<00:02:31.080> hatching<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.620> then<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.830> holes

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
has to start hatching and then the holes

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.390 
has to start hatching and then the holes
start<00:02:32.370> hatching<00:02:32.549> pretty<00:02:33.510> much<00:02:34.280> because<00:02:35.280> they

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
start hatching pretty much because they

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.470 
start hatching pretty much because they
can<00:02:35.549> sense<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.940> movement<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.650> other

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
can sense the movement and the other

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.180 
can sense the movement and the other
hatchlings<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.660> stuff<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:43.530> sometimes<00:02:43.769> you

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
hatchlings and stuff but sometimes you

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.619 
hatchlings and stuff but sometimes you
do<00:02:44.340> get<00:02:44.610> one<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:45.060> two<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:47.090> don't<00:02:48.090> actually

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
do get one or two that don't actually

00:02:48.629 --> 00:03:01.940 
do get one or two that don't actually
start<00:02:49.260> hatching<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:50.069> whale<00:02:50.370> at<00:02:50.579> all<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:01.680> I'm

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
start hatching to whale at all so I'm

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.580 
start hatching to whale at all so I'm
not<00:03:02.040> getting<00:03:02.160> very<00:03:02.609> good<00:03:02.670> angle<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:06.590> put

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
not getting very good angle of this put

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.530 
not getting very good angle of this put
it<00:03:07.680> back<00:03:07.829> in<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.220> I'm<00:03:08.430> gonna<00:03:08.700> stab<00:03:09.030> him<00:03:09.060> too
