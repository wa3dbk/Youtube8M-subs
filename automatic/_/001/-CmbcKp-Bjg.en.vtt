you apply the first time you have to let
it<00:01:00.989> dry<00:01:01.379> before<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.340> anything<00:01:02.579> else<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
it dry before you do anything else to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.700 
it dry before you do anything else to
your<00:01:03.329> face<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.260> literally<00:01:04.470> just

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
your face because you can literally just

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.200 
your face because you can literally just
take<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.070> off<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.000> could

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
take it off like that like you could

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.520 
take it off like that like you could
literally<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.869> take<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.200> finger<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
literally just take your finger and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.980 
literally just take your finger and
swipe<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.549> off<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.240> think<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.630> about<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
swipe it off so I think that's about the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
swipe it off so I think that's about the
worst<00:01:10.770> thing<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.369> foundation<00:01:11.820> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
worst thing about this foundation is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.050 
worst thing about this foundation is
that<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.840> moist<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.590> your<00:01:13.770> face<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.280> you

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
that it's so moist in your face that you

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.420 
that it's so moist in your face that you
have<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> let<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.689> dry<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.950> don't<00:01:17.220> let<00:01:17.400> it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
have to let it dry if you don't let it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.800 
have to let it dry if you don't let it
dry<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> would<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.150> come<00:01:18.299> over<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.689> two

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
dry it would just come over in two

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
dry it would just come over in two
seconds<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.759> when<00:01:20.909> I
