you<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.390> fit<00:00:51.540> quad<00:00:51.780> start<00:00:52.020> no<00:00:52.170> problem<00:00:52.530> but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you can fit quad start no problem but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.680 
you can fit quad start no problem but
this<00:00:52.800> time<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.030> real<00:00:54.210> thin<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
this time it was it was real thin so it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.330 
this time it was it was real thin so it
got<00:00:54.809> rough<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> second<00:00:55.829> day<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.100> went<00:00:56.280> off

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
got rough so the second day one went off

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.270 
got rough so the second day one went off
there's<00:00:56.610> no<00:00:56.789> chance<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.300> go<00:00:57.480> faster<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> got

there's no chance you go faster so I got

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
there's no chance you go faster so I got

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
off and kept it tight line to the first

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.170 
off and kept it tight line to the first
hill<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.649> knew<00:01:08.039> I<00:01:08.070> was<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.550> for<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> line

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and you know I guess we were both going

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.039 
and you know I guess we were both going
for<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> same<00:01:11.160> one<00:01:11.550> and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.970> came<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:12.780> first

and he went down so you know it's a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.910 
and he went down so you know it's a
shame<00:01:15.360> he<00:01:15.450> didn't<00:01:15.659> carry<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.200> finished

see<00:02:34.100> Graham<00:02:34.340> had<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.670> bit<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:34.880> crack<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.270> grin

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
see Graham had a bit of crack of grin

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.479 
see Graham had a bit of crack of grin
but<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.709> don't<00:02:36.860> really<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.160> don't<00:02:37.340> arrest

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
but you don't really you don't arrest

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.060 
but you don't really you don't arrest
usually<00:02:38.060> talk<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.930> him<00:02:39.170> talk<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.500> Gomez<00:02:39.920> and

usually talk to him talk to Gomez and

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.259 
usually talk to him talk to Gomez and
then<00:02:40.160> we<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:40.370> decided<00:02:40.820> that<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:40.970> was<00:02:41.120> too

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
then we just decided that it was too

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.430 
then we just decided that it was too
difficult<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.810> ride<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.170> we're<00:02:42.260> going<00:02:42.380> to

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
difficult to ride that we're going to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.400 
difficult to ride that we're going to
try<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.709> help<00:02:42.800> each<00:02:43.010> other<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.810> push

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
try and help each other so we push

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.380 
try and help each other so we push

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
probably had enough for a good half an

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.810 
probably had enough for a good half an
hour<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.750> got<00:02:47.930> 5<00:02:48.800> meters<00:02:49.160> maximum<00:02:49.370> with<00:02:49.730> the

hour and got 5 meters maximum with the
three<00:02:50.060> bikes<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.570> then<00:02:51.260> maybe<00:02:51.530> after<00:02:51.980> now<00:02:52.069> 45

off<00:03:07.069> and<00:03:07.250> then<00:03:07.340> rode<00:03:07.580> off<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.780> know<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:08.930> was

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
off and then rode off so you know I was

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.170 
off and then rode off so you know I was
going<00:03:09.319> for<00:03:09.560> Wade's<00:03:09.769> because<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:10.640> got<00:03:10.940> on<00:03:11.030> well

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
going for Wade's because I got on well

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.759 
going for Wade's because I got on well
with<00:03:11.209> him<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.600> when<00:03:11.930> he<00:03:11.959> got<00:03:12.470> disqualified

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
with him and when he got disqualified

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.170 
with him and when he got disqualified
for<00:03:13.220> missing<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.519> check<00:03:13.730> fight<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.030> know<00:03:14.150> I

for missing the check fight you know I

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.600 
for missing the check fight you know I
was<00:03:14.269> really<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.920> felt<00:03:15.920> from<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.310> know<00:03:16.430> because

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
was really I felt from you know because

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.220 
was really I felt from you know because
I<00:03:16.670> spoke<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.030> Utley<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.510> he<00:03:17.570> wasn't<00:03:18.019> happy

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
I spoke to Utley and and he wasn't happy

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.870 
I spoke to Utley and and he wasn't happy
but<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.829> know<00:03:18.950> it's<00:03:19.070> racing<00:03:19.489> away<00:03:19.640> things

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
but you know it's racing away things

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.030 
but you know it's racing away things
cause<00:03:20.150> God<00:03:20.840> knows<00:03:20.870> how<00:03:21.170> Graham<00:03:21.410> felt<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:21.950> he's

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040

been disqualified three times especially

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.460 
been disqualified three times especially
when<00:03:23.900> he's<00:03:23.989> won<00:03:25.030> when<00:03:26.030> when<00:03:26.329> I<00:03:26.360> said<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.810> we

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
when he's won when when I said that we

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.470 
when he's won when when I said that we
all<00:03:27.920> won<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.370> for<00:03:28.610> people<00:03:28.790> when<00:03:29.090> it's<00:03:29.239> a<00:03:29.329> bit

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
all won and for people when it's a bit

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.240 
all won and for people when it's a bit
it's<00:03:29.630> not<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.959> same<00:03:30.170> as<00:03:30.380> winning<00:03:30.680> by<00:03:30.920> yourself

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
it's not the same as winning by yourself

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.440 
it's not the same as winning by yourself
you<00:03:31.340> know<00:03:31.459> last<00:03:31.640> year<00:03:31.730> when<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.030> won<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.239> was

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
you know last year when I won it was

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.360 
you know last year when I won it was
like<00:03:32.600> an<00:03:33.079> awesome<00:03:33.470> feeling<00:03:33.650> but<00:03:33.950> this<00:03:34.070> year

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
like an awesome feeling but this year

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.330 
like an awesome feeling but this year
you<00:03:34.610> won<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:35.540> it's<00:03:35.690> like<00:03:35.930> did<00:03:36.799> I<00:03:36.890> really<00:03:37.220> win

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
you won and it's like did I really win

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.780 
you won and it's like did I really win
but<00:03:38.000> apart<00:03:38.840> from<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.170> it's<00:03:39.489> it's<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.670> way

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
but apart from that it's it's the way

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.069 
but apart from that it's it's the way
extreme<00:03:41.150> races<00:03:41.450> are<00:03:41.570> going<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.840> know<00:03:41.930> they're

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
extreme races are going you know they're

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.660 
extreme races are going you know they're
really<00:03:42.200> difficult<00:03:42.530> now<00:03:42.920> in<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.190> track<00:03:43.400> catch

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
really difficult now in the track catch

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.000 
really difficult now in the track catch
out<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:43.970> top<00:03:44.150> riders<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:44.750> they<00:03:45.650> might<00:03:45.829> make

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
out the top riders and they might make

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.560 
out the top riders and they might make
it<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.310> add<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:46.820> I<00:03:47.030> think<00:03:47.209> that's<00:03:47.359> what<00:03:47.480> they

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
it to add and I think that's what they

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.380 
it to add and I think that's what they
did<00:03:47.720> there<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.190> it's<00:03:49.190> good<00:03:49.430> because<00:03:49.820> now<00:03:50.180> they

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
did there and it's good because now they

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.180 
did there and it's good because now they
realize<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:50.810> it's<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.590> add<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:51.980> it's

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
realize that it's to add that it's

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.650 
realize that it's to add that it's
better<00:03:52.430> when<00:03:52.609> it's<00:03:52.760> race<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.239> when<00:03:53.390> it's<00:03:53.510> all

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
better when it's race and when it's all

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.990 
better when it's race and when it's all
whenever<00:03:54.620> when<00:03:55.160> everyone<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.549> ride<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:55.880> like

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
whenever when everyone can ride it like

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.550 
whenever when everyone can ride it like
as<00:03:56.180> long<00:03:56.329> as<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.540> top<00:03:56.690> five<00:03:56.900> riders<00:03:57.109> can<00:03:57.410> ride

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
as long as the top five riders can ride

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.860 
as long as the top five riders can ride
it<00:03:57.739> you<00:03:57.829> know<00:03:57.920> it's<00:03:58.040> good<00:03:58.220> for<00:03:58.250> everyone<00:03:58.579> so

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
it you know it's good for everyone so

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.849 
it you know it's good for everyone so
hopefully<00:03:59.870> next<00:04:00.049> year<00:04:00.350> it'll<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.709> little

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
hopefully next year it'll be a little

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.039 
hopefully next year it'll be a little
bit<00:04:01.130> easier<00:04:01.340> there<00:04:02.060> but<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.660> whole<00:04:02.690> of<00:04:02.959> the

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
bit easier there but the whole of the

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.509 
bit easier there but the whole of the
other<00:04:03.200> race<00:04:03.350> was<00:04:03.530> really<00:04:03.680> good<00:04:03.920> I<00:04:03.950> enjoyed<00:04:04.130> it

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
other race was really good I enjoyed it

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.069 
other race was really good I enjoyed it
but<00:04:04.940> just<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.269> one<00:04:05.420> section<00:04:05.690> was<00:04:05.930> too

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
but just that one section was too

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.000 
but just that one section was too
difficult<00:04:06.400> what<00:04:07.400> films<00:04:07.760> in<00:04:08.000> Talladega<00:04:08.570> Nights

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
difficult what films in Talladega Nights

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.960 
difficult what films in Talladega Nights
and<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.390> guys<00:04:11.390> I<00:04:11.540> actually<00:04:11.690> hadn't

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.090 

I'd<00:04:15.970> still<00:04:16.269> have<00:04:16.360> to<00:04:16.450> do<00:04:16.600> my<00:04:16.750> hands<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.920> then

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
I'd still have to do my hands and then

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.180 
I'd still have to do my hands and then
just<00:04:18.430> keep<00:04:18.820> flowing
