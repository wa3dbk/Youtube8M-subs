is<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.790> matte<00:03:10.329> texture<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.140> will<00:03:11.319> leave

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
is a matte texture so it will leave

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.890 
is a matte texture so it will leave
fingerprints<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:13.030> of<00:03:13.209> course<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:13.569> can<00:03:13.690> see

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
fingerprints and of course you can see

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.199 
fingerprints and of course you can see
the<00:03:14.079> Neo<00:03:14.380> Hybrid<00:03:14.470> written<00:03:15.400> on<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.640> side<00:03:15.850> and

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
the Neo Hybrid written on the side and

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.360 
the Neo Hybrid written on the side and
it<00:03:16.810> comes<00:03:17.049> in<00:03:17.230> both<00:03:17.350> silver<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.010> chrome

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
it comes in both silver and chrome

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.009 
it comes in both silver and chrome
models<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.850> obviously<00:03:19.269> being<00:03:19.450> these<00:03:19.630> silver

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
models is obviously being these silver

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.930 
models is obviously being these silver
you<00:03:20.530> can<00:03:20.650> see<00:03:20.799> it<00:03:20.920> has<00:03:20.950> actual<00:03:21.489> contact

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
you can see it has actual contact

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.610 
you can see it has actual contact
buttons<00:03:22.269> which<00:03:22.389> I<00:03:22.480> apparently<00:03:22.750> gives<00:03:23.170> really

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
buttons which I apparently gives really

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.440 
buttons which I apparently gives really
good<00:03:23.709> contact<00:03:24.250> points<00:03:24.489> through<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.000> nexus<00:03:25.329> 5

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
good contact points through a nexus 5

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.879 
good contact points through a nexus 5
now<00:03:25.630> when<00:03:25.750> comparing<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.350> other<00:03:26.590> cases

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
now when comparing that to other cases

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.590 
now when comparing that to other cases
like<00:03:27.670> for<00:03:27.850> example<00:03:27.910> I'm<00:03:28.209> going<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.359> bring<00:03:28.480> in

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
like for example I'm going to bring in

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.240 
like for example I'm going to bring in
another<00:03:28.750> case<00:03:28.959> here<00:03:29.200> this<00:03:29.769> one<00:03:29.980> what's<00:03:30.130> with

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
another case here this one what's with

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.710 
another case here this one what's with
the<00:03:30.340> ballistic<00:03:30.880> case<00:03:31.030> this<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.389> definitely

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
the ballistic case this is definitely

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.449 
the ballistic case this is definitely
gonna<00:03:31.810> give<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.049> more<00:03:32.230> protection<00:03:32.769> but<00:03:33.370> it

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
gonna give you more protection but it

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.979 
gonna give you more protection but it
also<00:03:33.609> costs<00:03:34.090> forty<00:03:34.420> dollars<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:34.810> it's<00:03:34.900> going

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
also costs forty dollars so it's going

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.440 
also costs forty dollars so it's going
to<00:03:35.049> add<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.200> lot<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.829> bulk<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.280> your<00:03:36.310> case<00:03:36.609> this

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
to add a lot of bulk to your case this

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.360 
to add a lot of bulk to your case this
phone<00:03:37.780> is<00:03:37.810> kind<00:03:38.350> of<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:38.739> not<00:03:38.980> phone<00:03:39.190> this

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
phone is kind of this not phone this

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.740 
phone is kind of this not phone this
case<00:03:39.670> is<00:03:39.850> kind<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.209> medium<00:03:40.569> in<00:03:40.720> between

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
case is kind of the medium in between

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.809 
case is kind of the medium in between
it's<00:03:41.319> going<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.799> give<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.100> that<00:03:42.250> protection

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
it's going to give you that protection

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.690 
it's going to give you that protection
not<00:03:43.540> as<00:03:43.720> good<00:03:44.079> as<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.230> ballistic<00:03:44.829> but<00:03:45.220> decent

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
not as good as a ballistic but decent

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.150 
not as good as a ballistic but decent
protection<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.389> also<00:03:46.900> keeping<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.560> slim

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
protection and also keeping that slim

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.039 
protection and also keeping that slim
form<00:03:48.489> factor<00:03:48.760> which<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.000> love<00:03:49.269> about<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.690> Nexus

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
form factor which I love about the Nexus

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.229 
form factor which I love about the Nexus
5<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:51.100> being<00:03:51.340> said<00:03:51.489> you<00:03:51.579> can<00:03:51.730> see<00:03:52.209> that

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
5 that being said you can see that

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.629 
5 that being said you can see that
there's<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.600> little<00:03:52.780> bit<00:03:52.959> of<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.260> rounded<00:03:53.680> lip

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
there's a little bit of a rounded lip

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.129 
there's a little bit of a rounded lip
here<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.359> will<00:03:55.420> actually<00:03:55.480> create<00:03:55.810> lift

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
here and that will actually create lift

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.479 
here and that will actually create lift
on<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.470> phone<00:03:56.650> so<00:03:56.829> when<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.069> put<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.310> face

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
on the phone so when you put it face

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.150 
on the phone so when you put it face
down<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:58.030> won't<00:03:58.540> be<00:03:58.630> making<00:03:58.780> contact<00:03:59.440> if<00:03:59.650> you

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
down it won't be making contact if you

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.199 
down it won't be making contact if you
go<00:04:00.280> ahead<00:04:00.519> and<00:04:00.639> consider<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.970> can<00:04:01.090> actually

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
go ahead and consider you can actually

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.390 
go ahead and consider you can actually
separate<00:04:01.810> these<00:04:02.260> two<00:04:02.319> pieces<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:03.069> this<00:04:03.250> is

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
separate these two pieces so this is

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.789 
separate these two pieces so this is
like<00:04:03.519> a<00:04:03.549> bumper<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.269> this<00:04:05.109> of<00:04:05.290> course<00:04:05.319> is<00:04:05.650> the

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
like a bumper and this of course is the

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.670 
like a bumper and this of course is the
case<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.040> has<00:04:06.459> an<00:04:06.819> air<00:04:07.599> cushion<00:04:07.930> technology

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
case that has an air cushion technology

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.870 
case that has an air cushion technology
apparently<00:04:09.099> which<00:04:09.280> allows<00:04:09.519> for<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.760> better

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
apparently which allows for a better

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.460 
apparently which allows for a better
shock<00:04:10.209> absorption<00:04:10.599> and<00:04:10.840> this<00:04:10.959> is<00:04:11.079> like<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.319> a

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
shock absorption and this is like a a

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.699 
shock absorption and this is like a a
TPU<00:04:12.220> kind<00:04:12.639> of<00:04:12.729> material<00:04:13.209> not<00:04:13.720> as<00:04:13.930> flexible<00:04:14.320> as

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
TPU kind of material not as flexible as

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.710 
TPU kind of material not as flexible as
some<00:04:15.310> of<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.459> cheaper<00:04:15.790> ones<00:04:15.970> are<00:04:16.269> pretty

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
some of the cheaper ones are pretty

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.819 
some of the cheaper ones are pretty
sturdy<00:04:17.109> and<00:04:17.530> if

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
sturdy and if

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.589 
sturdy and if
course<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.129> spigen<00:04:18.639> branding<00:04:19.120> on<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.419> back

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
course the spigen branding on the back

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.179 
course the spigen branding on the back
there<00:04:19.870> now<00:04:20.379> let's<00:04:20.560> nice<00:04:20.680> about<00:04:20.859> as<00:04:20.979> well<00:04:21.159> as

00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:21.189 
there now let's nice about as well as

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:22.529 
there now let's nice about as well as
you<00:04:21.280> can<00:04:21.459> interchange<00:04:21.699> this<00:04:22.060> with<00:04:22.210> different

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
you can interchange this with different

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.600 
you can interchange this with different
pieces<00:04:22.720> our<00:04:23.050> bumpers<00:04:23.830> for<00:04:24.129> example<00:04:24.490> there<00:04:24.580> is

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
pieces our bumpers for example there is

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.450 
pieces our bumpers for example there is
a<00:04:24.729> gold<00:04:25.300> chrome<00:04:25.840> version<00:04:26.139> or<00:04:26.530> gold<00:04:27.280> version

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
a gold chrome version or gold version

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.709 
a gold chrome version or gold version
that<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.699> can<00:04:27.879> actually<00:04:28.000> use<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.509> can

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:28.719 
that you can actually use so you can

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:30.300 
that you can actually use so you can
take<00:04:28.900> that<00:04:29.080> gold<00:04:29.439> piece<00:04:29.740> buy<00:04:29.949> it<00:04:30.009> separately

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
take that gold piece buy it separately

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.890 
take that gold piece buy it separately
and<00:04:30.520> then<00:04:30.580> attach<00:04:30.849> it<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.180> there<00:04:31.659> you<00:04:31.689> go<00:04:31.810> you

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
and then attach it and there you go you

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.320 
and then attach it and there you go you
have<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.229> different<00:04:32.620> looking<00:04:33.039> case<00:04:33.250> that<00:04:34.060> being

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
have a different looking case that being

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.670 
have a different looking case that being
