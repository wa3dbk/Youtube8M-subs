just this thing you know as opposed to

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.119 
just this thing you know as opposed to
being<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:37.090> know<00:00:37.240> something<00:00:37.810> that<00:00:37.840> i<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:39.100> a

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
being you know something that i have a

being you know something that i have a
relationship<00:00:39.789> with<00:00:40.000> and<00:00:40.480> I<00:00:40.510> think<00:00:40.690> cover<00:00:40.840> it

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
relationship with and I think cover it

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.560 
relationship with and I think cover it
helps<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:41.350> do<00:00:41.440> that<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:42.969> still<00:00:43.270> think<00:00:43.449> it's

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
careful with designers because I think

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.980 
careful with designers because I think
they're<00:01:11.890> just<00:01:11.920> looking<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.900> create<00:01:13.900> something

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
give anything I can you know some photos

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.720 
give anything I can you know some photos
something<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.360> helps<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.930> create<00:02:28.430> two<00:02:29.430> I

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
something that helps to create two I

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.870 
something that helps to create two I
said<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.750> helps<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.290> remove<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:32.459> barrier

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
said it helps to remove the barrier

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.199 
said it helps to remove the barrier
between<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.390> band<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.110> fan<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.220> think

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
between the band and the fan I think

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.800 
between the band and the fan I think
that<00:02:36.860> music<00:02:37.860> does<00:02:38.069> speak<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:38.700> itself<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.299> I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that music does speak for itself and I

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.300 
that music does speak for itself and I
think<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.260> hear<00:02:40.410> something<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.860> be<00:02:41.040> moved

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
think you can hear something to be moved

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.530 
think you can hear something to be moved
by<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:44.220> think<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.700> many<00:02:44.790> people<00:02:45.000> they

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
by it and I think for many people they

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.270 
by it and I think for many people they
would<00:02:45.660> hear<00:02:45.810> something<00:02:46.230> be<00:02:46.560> moved<00:02:46.799> by<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.069> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
would hear something be moved by it and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.600 
would hear something be moved by it and
want<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.640> little<00:02:47.760> bit<00:02:47.970> more<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.560> think<00:02:49.980> that

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
want a little bit more so I think that

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.599 
want a little bit more so I think that
more<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.380> cover<00:02:52.590> or<00:02:52.920> on<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.370> you

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
more can be on the cover or on the you

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.670 
more can be on the cover or on the you
know<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.060> rear<00:02:54.299> card<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.720> see<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> little<00:02:55.470> photo

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
it's all about the emotional connection

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.979 
it's all about the emotional connection
you<00:03:06.780> have<00:03:06.989> with<00:03:07.019> your<00:03:07.440> fan<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.910> while<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
you have with your fan so while the

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.229 
you have with your fan so while the
music<00:03:10.109> is<00:03:10.500> number<00:03:10.799> one<00:03:10.980> importance<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.970> course

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
music is number one importance of course

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.180 
music is number one importance of course
there<00:03:13.049> should<00:03:13.079> be<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.440> little<00:03:13.650> bit<00:03:13.829> more<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.070> I

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
there should be a little bit more and I

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.890 
there should be a little bit more and I
think<00:03:14.220> cover<00:03:14.549> art<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> way<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.269> do<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.630> or

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
think cover art is a way to do that or

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.130 
think cover art is a way to do that or
your<00:03:16.049> package<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.620> way<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.799> do<00:03:16.980> that
