white<00:00:25.680> heel<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.900> video<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:32.960> don't

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
white heel and in that video I don't

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.160 
white heel and in that video I don't
usually<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.860> wear<00:00:35.070> socks<00:00:35.309> shoes<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
usually not wear socks shoes it's just I

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.500 
usually not wear socks shoes it's just I
can't<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.399> don't<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.640> feeling<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:41.510> and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
can't I just don't like feeling so and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.139 
can't I just don't like feeling so and
also<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.200> find<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.340> were<00:00:44.550> shoes

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
also I find that if you were shoes

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.560 
also I find that if you were shoes
without<00:00:45.510> socks<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:47.460> sole<00:00:47.760> tends<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.360> peel

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
without socks and the sole tends to peel

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.279 
without socks and the sole tends to peel
away<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.840> little<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.550> inside<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
away a little bit the inside so and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.930 
away a little bit the inside so and
that's<00:00:52.920> why<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> don't<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:54.030> wear<00:00:54.239> socks<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.940> just

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that's why I don't not wear socks I just

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.760 
that's why I don't not wear socks I just
like<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.629> walk<00:00:58.050> around<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> house<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.710> no

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
like I walk around the house with no

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.719 
like I walk around the house with no
socks<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.809> shoes<00:01:00.809> unless<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.500> sandals<00:01:01.920> they
