of Mythology the age of empire series so
and<00:00:12.960> these<00:00:13.410> games<00:00:13.860> contain<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.460> lot<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.730> complex

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
and these games contain a lot of complex

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.070 
and these games contain a lot of complex
game<00:00:16.830> functions<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.270> villagers

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
game functions like the villagers

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.990 
game functions like the villagers

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
objects that go in stages and then

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.769 
objects that go in stages and then
destroy<00:00:26.189> themselves<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.910> controlling

enemies and stuff so these games are
really<00:00:32.099> complex<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.940> could<00:00:33.090> argue<00:00:33.239> they're

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
really complex you could argue they're

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.810 
really complex you could argue they're
more<00:00:33.660> complex<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.469> don't<00:00:34.530> know<00:00:34.800> RTS<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.579> mean

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
start off with something simple guys so

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.580 
start off with something simple guys so
I've<00:00:47.879> made<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.120> simple<00:00:48.390> scene<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
I've made a simple scene and this is a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.910 
I've made a simple scene and this is a
house<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.219> I've<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.329> basically<00:00:52.199> created

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
house and I've just basically created

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.869 
house and I've just basically created
rectangles<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.670> stuff<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.410> triangles<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
rectangles and stuff and triangles and

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.540 
rectangles and stuff and triangles and
little<00:00:56.879> chimney<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:58.230> house<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.370> go

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
little chimney so this house if I go

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.569 
little chimney so this house if I go
over<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> script<00:01:00.270> has<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> health<00:01:01.579> variable

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
over to the script has a health variable

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.780 
over to the script has a health variable
so<00:01:03.480> house<00:01:03.840> health<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.409> public<00:01:04.890> sozin<00:01:05.400> bunch<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
so house health is public sozin bunch of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.160 
so house health is public sozin bunch of
other<00:01:05.909> stuff<00:01:06.150> I'll<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.510> through<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
other stuff I'll get through that in a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.560 
other stuff I'll get through that in a
minute<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.220> house<00:01:08.400> health<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
minute so the house health is just a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.760 
minute so the house health is just a
float<00:01:10.350> which<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.100> 100<00:01:12.350> simple<00:01:13.350> enough<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
float which is 100 simple enough of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.399 
float which is 100 simple enough of
creates<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:14.909> GUI<00:01:15.479> interface<00:01:16.110> so

a<00:01:52.140> house<00:01:52.610> health<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.790> less<00:01:54.000> than<00:01:54.149> zero<00:01:54.420> week

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
a house health is less than zero week

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.620 
a house health is less than zero week
with<00:01:54.899> zero<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.470> stick<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:55.950> zero<00:01:56.630> don't

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
with zero just stick it as zero don't

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.389 
with zero just stick it as zero don't
let's<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:57.899> below<00:01:58.439> zero<00:01:58.799> because<00:01:59.009> nothing<00:01:59.340> will

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
let's go below zero because nothing will

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.700 
let's go below zero because nothing will
happen<00:01:59.549> and<00:02:00.049> then<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.170> create<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> label

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
happen and then we create the label

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.770 
happen and then we create the label
itself<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:02.340> cost<00:02:02.759> as<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> string<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
itself now we cost as a string it's a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.959 
itself now we cost as a string it's a
string<00:02:04.020> variable<00:02:04.219> house<00:02:05.219> damage<00:02:05.700> house

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
string variable house damage house

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.459 
string variable house damage house
health<00:02:06.270> all<00:02:06.509> right<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.020> place<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
health all right so we just place the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.900 
health all right so we just place the
health<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.890> string<00:02:08.190> then<00:02:08.369> place<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.789> in

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
health in a string then place it in

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.600 
health in a string then place it in
another<00:02:09.119> label<00:02:09.860> below<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.069> button<00:02:11.370> alright

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
another label below the button alright

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.280 
another label below the button alright
guys<00:02:11.790> simple<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.989> update

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
guys simple is that on the update

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.030 
guys simple is that on the update
function

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
function

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
function
we<00:02:14.700> test<00:02:15.000> for<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.330> range<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.689> things<00:02:15.989> now<00:02:16.430> in<00:02:17.430> RTS

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
we test for a range of things now in RTS

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.509 
we test for a range of things now in RTS
games<00:02:18.769> objects<00:02:19.769> go<00:02:19.920> through<00:02:20.159> different

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
games objects go through different

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.520 
games objects go through different
states<00:02:20.879> so<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.689> the<00:02:21.780> first<00:02:22.049> state<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.409> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
states so this is the first state of the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.350 
states so this is the first state of the
house<00:02:22.769> it's<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:23.790> say<00:02:23.939> it's<00:02:24.030> brand<00:02:24.299> new

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
house it's you can say it's brand new

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.780 
house it's you can say it's brand new
has<00:02:24.569> got<00:02:24.750> no<00:02:24.870> damage<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.680> when<00:02:26.549> we<00:02:26.579> get

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
has got no damage to it when we get

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.220 
has got no damage to it when we get
about<00:02:26.939> halfway<00:02:27.180> through<00:02:27.390> there's<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.989> bit<00:02:28.140> of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
about halfway through there's a bit of

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.500 
about halfway through there's a bit of
damage<00:02:28.439> some<00:02:28.860> cracks<00:02:29.189> and<00:02:29.610> when<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.299> health

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
damage some cracks and when the health

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.839 
damage some cracks and when the health
is<00:02:30.659> a<00:02:30.690> zero<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.650> whole<00:02:31.860> thing<00:02:32.099> collapses<00:02:32.640> so

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
is a zero the whole thing collapses so

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.759 
is a zero the whole thing collapses so
how<00:02:33.120> do<00:02:33.180> we<00:02:33.299> do<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.690> well<00:02:33.900> I've<00:02:34.110> created

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
how do we do that well I've created

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.009 
how do we do that well I've created
different<00:02:35.280> methods<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.209> one's<00:02:36.450> phase<00:02:36.690> one

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
different methods this one's phase one

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.770 
different methods this one's phase one
phase<00:02:37.650> two<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.069> phase<00:02:38.129> three<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.730> each<00:02:39.510> of

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
phase two and phase three and each of

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.720 
phase two and phase three and each of
these<00:02:39.900> objects<00:02:40.409> have<00:02:40.650> rigid<00:02:41.069> bodies<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.549> mean

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
these objects have rigid bodies I mean

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.979 
these objects have rigid bodies I mean
this<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.239> simplest<00:02:42.569> way<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> could

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
this is the simplest way I could

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.940 
this is the simplest way I could
demonstrate<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:45.409> when<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.739> Health

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
demonstrate this and when the Health

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.369 
demonstrate this and when the Health
gets<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.609> a<00:02:48.150> particular<00:02:48.720> value<00:02:50.390> these<00:02:51.390> methods

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
gets to a particular value these methods

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.800 
gets to a particular value these methods
are<00:02:52.500> called<00:02:52.530> out<00:02:53.099> guys<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.549> we<00:02:54.030> store<00:02:54.420> these

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
are called out guys and we store these

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.990 
are called out guys and we store these
boolean<00:02:55.349> values<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:56.129> test<00:02:56.400> whether<00:02:56.609> they've

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
boolean values to test whether they've

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.649 
boolean values to test whether they've
already<00:02:57.239> been<00:02:57.799> been<00:02:58.799> called<00:02:59.629> because<00:03:00.629> we

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
already been been called because we

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.180 
already been been called because we
don't<00:03:00.900> need<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.109> happen<00:03:01.230> again<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.680> again<00:03:01.920> so

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
don't need to happen again and again so

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.879 
don't need to happen again and again so
once<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:03.060> for<00:03:03.780> example<00:03:04.170> once<00:03:04.349> house<00:03:04.530> destroy

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
once this for example once house destroy

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.660 
once this for example once house destroy
one<00:03:05.129> is<00:03:05.280> called<00:03:06.470> destroy<00:03:07.470> one<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.769> true<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.400> it

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
one is called destroy one is true so it

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.349 
one is called destroy one is true so it
won't<00:03:08.819> happen<00:03:08.940> again

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
won't happen again

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.910 
won't happen again
all<00:03:09.599> right<00:03:09.720> guys<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.079> just<00:03:10.590> want<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.769> call

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.550 
all right guys so just want to call
these<00:03:11.069> methods<00:03:11.549> once<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.440> when<00:03:13.440> these

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
these methods once and when these

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.199 
these methods once and when these
methods<00:03:13.920> are<00:03:14.040> called<00:03:14.280> some<00:03:14.879> of<00:03:14.909> the<00:03:15.030> game

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
methods are called some of the game

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.439 
methods are called some of the game
objects<00:03:15.780> rigid<00:03:16.500> bodies<00:03:16.799> or<00:03:17.069> at<00:03:17.340> use<00:03:17.579> gravity

anything in here we can do we can

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.439 
anything in here we can do we can
activate<00:03:24.150> particle<00:03:24.690> effects<00:03:26.120> change<00:03:27.120> some

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
activate particle effects change some

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.770 
activate particle effects change some
animations<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:29.790> know<00:03:29.910> guys<00:03:30.120> sound<00:03:30.419> effects

animations you know guys sound effects
anything<00:03:31.699> so<00:03:33.079> these<00:03:34.079> methods<00:03:34.319> are<00:03:34.620> really

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
anything so these methods are really

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.970 
anything so these methods are really
good<00:03:34.949> way<00:03:35.129> to<00:03:35.190> store<00:03:35.609> different<00:03:35.879> kind<00:03:36.359> of

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
good way to store different kind of

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.520 
good way to store different kind of
phases<00:03:37.980> for<00:03:38.340> your<00:03:38.459> house<00:03:38.609> so<00:03:39.169> let's<00:03:40.169> just<00:03:40.319> save

damage is a hundred house health I

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:49.670 
damage is a hundred house health I
should<00:03:48.629> have<00:03:48.720> called<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.930> house<00:03:49.079> health<00:03:49.349> sort

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
should have called the house health sort

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.119 
should have called the house health sort
of<00:03:49.739> guy<00:03:49.889> so<00:03:50.449> ninety<00:03:51.449> eighty<00:03:51.799> when<00:03:52.799> we<00:03:52.889> get<00:03:53.040> to

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
of guy so ninety eighty when we get to

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.970 
of guy so ninety eighty when we get to
seventy<00:03:53.609> three<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.359> door<00:03:54.629> kind<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.169> wobbles

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
seventy three the door kind of wobbles

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.210 
seventy three the door kind of wobbles
and<00:03:56.129> falls<00:03:56.340> over<00:03:56.489> this<00:03:57.419> is<00:03:57.599> phase<00:03:57.780> one<00:03:58.220> let's

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
and falls over this is phase one let's

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.990 
and falls over this is phase one let's
wait<00:03:59.459> for<00:03:59.549> that<00:03:59.669> to<00:03:59.790> fall<00:03:59.940> over<00:04:00.239> all<00:04:00.569> right

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
wait for that to fall over all right

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.849 
wait for that to fall over all right
disappears<00:04:03.000> into<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.269> ground

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
disappears into the ground

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.509 
disappears into the ground
6050<00:04:05.129> when<00:04:05.879> it<00:04:06.000> gets<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.299> thirty<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:07.519> roof

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
6050 when it gets to thirty the roof

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.530 
6050 when it gets to thirty the roof
sides<00:04:09.060> fall<00:04:09.480> off<00:04:09.690> okay<00:04:10.970> phase<00:04:11.970> two<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:12.449> phase

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
sides fall off okay phase two and phase

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.069 
sides fall off okay phase two and phase
three<00:04:12.949> when<00:04:13.949> it's<00:04:14.129> a<00:04:14.220> zero<00:04:14.659> the<00:04:15.659> whole<00:04:15.690> thing

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
three when it's a zero the whole thing

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.909 
three when it's a zero the whole thing
collapses<00:04:16.620> all<00:04:16.829> right<00:04:16.919> guys<00:04:17.159> so<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:18.919> it's

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
collapses all right guys so and it's

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.529 
collapses all right guys so and it's
relatively<00:04:20.310> simple<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:21.030> might<00:04:21.209> want<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.389> do

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
relatively simple you might want to do

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.180 
relatively simple you might want to do
something<00:04:21.810> where<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:21.989> spasm<00:04:22.440> control<00:04:22.919> there

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
something where that spasm control there

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.270 
something where that spasm control there
but<00:04:23.960> that's<00:04:24.960> generally<00:04:25.469> how<00:04:25.530> things<00:04:25.919> work<00:04:26.130> in

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
but that's generally how things work in

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.500 
but that's generally how things work in
RTS<00:04:26.729> games

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
RTS games

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.330 
RTS games
so<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.020> bunch<00:04:28.380> of<00:04:28.530> enemies<00:04:28.680> will<00:04:28.980> be<00:04:29.070> attacking

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
so a bunch of enemies will be attacking

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.100 
so a bunch of enemies will be attacking
this<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.790> taken<00:04:30.090> off<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.300> bit<00:04:30.450> of<00:04:30.570> health<00:04:30.750> every

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
this and taken off a bit of health every

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.940 
this and taken off a bit of health every
time<00:04:31.380> when<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.100> health<00:04:32.280> gets<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.700> certain

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
time when the health gets to certain

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.890 
time when the health gets to certain
thresholds<00:04:34.950> or<00:04:35.070> certain<00:04:35.610> phases<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.270> can

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
thresholds or certain phases you can

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.990 
thresholds or certain phases you can
call<00:04:37.650> methods<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.310> these<00:04:38.460> methods<00:04:38.670> can

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
call methods and these methods can

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.830 
call methods and these methods can
handle<00:04:39.420> any<00:04:39.660> logic<00:04:40.470> or<00:04:40.830> any<00:04:41.480> you<00:04:42.480> know<00:04:42.600> any

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
handle any logic or any you know any

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.320 
handle any logic or any you know any
chain<00:04:43.230> of<00:04:43.730> methods<00:04:44.730> that<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:44.910> want<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.120> call

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
chain of methods that you want to call

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.080 
chain of methods that you want to call
to<00:04:45.660> effect<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.500> house<00:04:46.650> can<00:04:47.190> be<00:04:47.220> some<00:04:47.910> really

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
to effect the house can be some really

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.970 
to effect the house can be some really
nice<00:04:48.270> effects<00:04:48.630> but<00:04:48.870> I've<00:04:49.140> just<00:04:49.200> used<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.860> use

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
nice effects but I've just used the use

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.860 
nice effects but I've just used the use
gravity<00:04:50.340> property<00:04:50.940> in<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.090> rigidbody<00:04:51.360> but

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
gravity property in the rigidbody but

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.780 
gravity property in the rigidbody but
that's<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.230> quick<00:04:52.410> way<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.590> doing<00:04:52.860> things<00:04:53.070> so

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
that's the quick way to doing things so

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.270 
that's the quick way to doing things so
anyway<00:04:54.270> that's<00:04:54.630> how<00:04:54.930> we<00:04:54.990> do<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.620> destruction

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
anyway that's how we do the destruction

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.310 
anyway that's how we do the destruction
of<00:04:56.370> objects<00:04:56.760> in<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:56.970> 90's<00:04:57.420> game<00:04:57.690> or<00:04:57.930> strategy

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
of objects in a 90's game or strategy

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.990 
of objects in a 90's game or strategy
game<00:04:58.530> in<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:59.250> next<00:04:59.430> few<00:04:59.580> videos<00:04:59.670> we'll

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
game in the next few videos we'll

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.760 
game in the next few videos we'll
explore<00:05:00.750> a<00:05:00.810> bit<00:05:00.990> more<00:05:01.050> going<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.530> bit<00:05:01.650> more

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
explore a bit more going to bit more

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.130 
explore a bit more going to bit more
