00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.430 
we're looking at the scout armors from
Halo<00:00:17.369> 3<00:00:17.790> pretty<00:00:18.390> good<00:00:18.570> selection<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.050> armors<00:00:19.380> I

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
Halo 3 pretty good selection of armors I

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.690 
Halo 3 pretty good selection of armors I
know<00:00:19.560> I've<00:00:19.650> been<00:00:19.710> saying<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.160> but<00:00:20.520> it

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
know I've been saying that a lot but it

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.280 
know I've been saying that a lot but it
turns<00:00:20.910> out<00:00:21.060> more<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.360> them<00:00:21.540> had<00:00:21.689> more<00:00:21.930> figures

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290 
turns out more of them had more figures

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.500 
turns out more of them had more figures
than<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.590> thought<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.490> pretty<00:00:23.700> good<00:00:23.820> batch<00:00:24.180> I

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
than I thought so a pretty good batch I

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.720 
than I thought so a pretty good batch I
mean<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.470> Halo<00:00:25.740> 3<00:00:25.980> line<00:00:26.130> they<00:00:26.400> really

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
mean for the Halo 3 line they really

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.069 
mean for the Halo 3 line they really
couldn't<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.060> done<00:00:27.119> too<00:00:27.390> much<00:00:27.570> better<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:27.960> it

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
couldn't have done too much better if it

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.200 
couldn't have done too much better if it
wasn't<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> quality<00:00:28.890> control<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.849> we

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
wasn't for the quality control so we

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.749 
wasn't for the quality control so we
have<00:00:30.419> the<00:00:30.750> orange<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.439> white<00:00:31.470> stripe<00:00:32.009> light

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
the tan scout and I could be completely

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.759 
the tan scout and I could be completely
wrong<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.019> know<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> figures

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
wrong on this I know one of the figures

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.529 
wrong on this I know one of the figures
had<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> problem<00:01:02.339> came<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> battle

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
had this problem came with a battle

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.479 
had this problem came with a battle
rifle<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.199> undersized<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.160> was<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
rifle that was undersized it was for the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.170 
rifle that was undersized it was for the
ODST

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
ODST

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
ODST
so<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.710> an<00:01:07.830> assault<00:01:08.160> rifle

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
so I have that one with an assault rifle

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.830 
so I have that one with an assault rifle
but<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:08.880> sure<00:01:09.120> if<00:01:09.210> he's<00:01:09.360> supposed<00:01:09.690> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
but I'm not sure if he's supposed to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.180 
but I'm not sure if he's supposed to
have<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.290> works<00:01:10.530> though<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:10.980> he

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
have it it works though because he

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.160 
have it it works though because he
doesn't<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.580> trigger<00:01:11.880> finger<00:01:12.120> so<00:01:12.540> that's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
doesn't have a trigger finger so that's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.260 
doesn't have a trigger finger so that's
something<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.710> note<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.490> armor<00:01:14.700> Peck<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
something to note the armor Peck one I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.700 
something to note the armor Peck one I
don't<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.540> which<00:01:15.810> weapons<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.439> actually

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
don't know which weapons are actually

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.620 
don't know which weapons are actually
technically<00:01:17.070> his<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> battle<00:01:18.329> rifle

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
technically his I have a battle rifle

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
technically his I have a battle rifle
and<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> pistol<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.380> him<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.250> I'm<00:01:20.340> assuming

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
and a pistol with him so I'm assuming

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.399 
and a pistol with him so I'm assuming
the<00:01:20.880> armored<00:01:21.150> pack<00:01:21.329> gave<00:01:21.570> me<00:01:21.750> enough<00:01:22.020> weapons

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the armored pack gave me enough weapons

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.990 
the armored pack gave me enough weapons
to<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.250> he<00:01:23.310> does<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> trigger

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
to do that and he does have a trigger

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.980 
to do that and he does have a trigger
finger<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.540> works<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:25.049> ok<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.189> cyan<00:01:26.670> one

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
finger so that works out ok the cyan one

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.719 
finger so that works out ok the cyan one
he<00:01:27.990> has<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> shotgun<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.009> trigger<00:01:29.189> finger<00:01:29.430> so

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
he has a shotgun and a trigger finger so

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.490 
he has a shotgun and a trigger finger so
that<00:01:29.880> works<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.810> orange<00:01:31.140> one<00:01:31.290> has<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that works out the orange one has a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.380 
that works out the orange one has a
sniper<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.399> trigger<00:01:32.640> finger<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.149> that's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
sniper and a trigger finger so that's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.870 
sniper and a trigger finger so that's
good<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.200> red<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.530> over<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:35.009> has<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.310> trigger

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
good the red one over here has a trigger

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.370 
good the red one over here has a trigger
finger<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.329> his<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:36.630> hand<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
finger on his right hand but just the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.889 
finger on his right hand but just the
standard<00:01:37.619> secondary<00:01:38.250> left<00:01:38.610> hand<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> two

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
SMGs

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.459 
SMGs
so<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.490> holds<00:01:42.030> fine<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.479> second<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
so the one holds fine the second one the

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.740 
so the one holds fine the second one the
left<00:01:43.649> hand<00:01:43.979> does<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:44.520> hold<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.149> all<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.570> blue

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
left hand does not hold at all the blue

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.539 
left hand does not hold at all the blue
one<00:01:45.930> has<00:01:46.170> no<00:01:46.350> trigger<00:01:46.649> finger<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.219> he<00:01:47.399> can

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
one has no trigger finger but he can

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.639 
one has no trigger finger but he can
hold<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.270> beam<00:01:48.479> rifle<00:01:48.750> without<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.469> that's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
hold the beam rifle without it so that's

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.160 
hold the beam rifle without it so that's
OK<00:01:50.009> by<00:01:50.040> me<00:01:50.219> and<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.149> burgundy<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:51.810> has<00:01:52.140> a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
one and the red one actually looked

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.450 
one and the red one actually looked
glossy<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> other<00:02:13.740> ones<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> little<00:02:14.340> bit

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460

and<00:02:56.190> my<00:02:56.610> character<00:02:56.970> jumping<00:02:57.270> up<00:02:57.450> under<00:02:57.960> the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
and my character jumping up under the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.480 
and my character jumping up under the
table<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.500> maybe<00:02:58.830> he's<00:02:59.010> gonna<00:02:59.130> make<00:02:59.370> an

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
table so maybe he's gonna make an

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.330 
table so maybe he's gonna make an
appearance<00:02:59.730> before<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.540> end<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:00.990> video<00:03:01.340> no

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
appearance before I end the video no

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.920 
appearance before I end the video no
maybe<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.700> don't<00:03:02.820> know<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.030> guess<00:03:03.240> not<00:03:03.420> all<00:03:03.630> right

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
maybe I don't know I guess not all right

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.510 
maybe I don't know I guess not all right
so<00:03:04.080> that's<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.350> Scout<00:03:04.650> armors<00:03:04.950> from<00:03:05.070> halo<00:03:05.310> 3
