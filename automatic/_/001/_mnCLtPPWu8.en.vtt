boot<00:00:58.770> across<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> four<00:00:59.399> funnest<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.969> pretty

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

fantastic<00:01:01.070> negatives<00:01:02.070> were<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.850> stud

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
fantastic negatives were the stud

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.090

Opera<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.030> hadn't<00:01:06.299> been<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.840> think

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
Opera if I hadn't been for that I think

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.300 
Opera if I hadn't been for that I think
there<00:01:07.229> would<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.409> been<00:01:07.470> higher<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> list

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
there would have been higher on the list

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.960 
there would have been higher on the list
so<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.720> number<00:01:10.290> three<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.100> nike<00:01:11.760> vapor

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970
