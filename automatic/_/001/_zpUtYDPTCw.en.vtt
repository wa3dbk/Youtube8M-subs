00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 we realize that all the proponents 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.830
 from this this well- reasoned logic 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.069
 rights of the hommists who preaches us 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.929
 deadlines 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.309
 how would I say the benefits of a 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.750
 multiracial society 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.980
 we realize that today there is 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.299
 still a lot of theirs 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.080
 fundamentals that are being undermined 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.460
 we realize that a large number 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.699
 analysis that had been done by 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.140
 proponents of the very logic 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.750
 thinking from a scientific point of view 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.189
 are questioned in a very way 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.900
 clear there is an excellent article and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.540
 I refer listeners in this 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.480
 review on momentum is going to touch probably 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.340
 a particularly sensitive topic on 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.450
 the Vulgate scientist and that's what 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 you called his new order 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.969
 genetics then there is still matter 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.050
 to say and just put material 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.570
 in question this is perhaps also a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.440
 track precisely that can allow to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.000
 in any case to compete 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.320
 question his statements that we are 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.149
 imposes as such just before 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.430
 that I like to answer by recalling when 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.070
 even a presupposed worried that we do not 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.559
 can no longer talk about terms of one can 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.719
 more about wholesale breeds since 1945 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.369
 because it has been repeated to us 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.229
 there would be only one and that's it 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.640
 finally that baron breach article 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.590
 it turns out that the scientifically 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.600
 correct there for a few years 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.650
 now we've taken a big hit in 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.810
 the mouth we'll say that like that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.220
 there is a school finally there is still 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.720
 a number of discoveries 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.720
 scientists who have all wiped out 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.390
 especially this famous thesis 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.400
 yves coppens legrand in and of itself 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.320
 scientists who told us we 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.060
 was all from the lucian guenon 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.160
 we were all Africans 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.450
 had left Africa there are some 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.130
 millennia and millennia and that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.290
 had broadcast that we would be reassembled 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.130
 in the north of the land camp and 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.000
 it's good in clear it was a message 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.740
 scientifically correct who was not holding 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.420
 the road everyone knew it but 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.130
 nobody dared to question it 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.330
 obviously it was a big ponte I 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.190
 even visited a few years ago 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.860
 oradour on glane in vendÃ©e same sound 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.150
 book the release of oradour on glane at 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.440
 museum of remembrance so it was a 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.640
 refutation of racist theses 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.470
 racialist etc 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.869
 we could see that to take us 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.610
 it's good we even sold bombay room 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.660
 the boyfriend is keeping his thesis she 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.450
 is dead since we have just discovered 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.100
 that and cdc scientific laboratories 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.270
 independent especially Anglo-Saxon this 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.800
 case in the Anglo Saxon countries one is 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.480
 much freer than in europe where he 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.590
 there is a lead screed still one one comes 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.890
 to discover things quite 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.489
 interesting especially that 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.110
 presumably finally parquet 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.540
 presumably there is some 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.390
 number of human species that are born 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.519
 in situ in europe asia and not at all 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.620
 and not at all from a single strain in 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.420
 africa so the coppens thesis already 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.530
 went rolling the second thing we come 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.260
 to discover that the Neanderthal man 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.870
 of the Neanderthal man so 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.480
 visibly Europeans at doses to 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.750
 doses at some certain dosage between 1 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.140
 at 5 % of common dna code with him which 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.640
 is still not zero 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.620
 only the Europeans and the peoples 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.959
 asians have neandertal genes 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.269
 but not Africans so already the 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.980
 thesis also go ali dead for them 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.720
 scientifically correct we discovered 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.070
 other men 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.600
 the florian man 6 but we did not 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.950
 managed to decrypt its code adn it was 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.900
 found in a cave in Indonesia in 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.100
 to not succeed to decipher his dna by 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.630
 against it was found what is called the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.630
 third man the man of denisova the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.700
 find in a cave in Siberia 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.989
 he is probably the ancestor of 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.049
 Melanesian peoples etc. 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.880
 so you see there is a merger of 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.650
 various breeds that are discovered 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.180
 now of genetic code that are 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.820
 decrypted which completely restores 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.860
 causes the scientifically correct that 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.959
 was that really related to a 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.760
 mix of ideology effects one gets 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.739
 would be believed at the moment of the sphere 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.940
 lyssenko mitch mourihno that's it 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.870
 was trying to make people believe things 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.980
 more implausible 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.810
 the Soviet Union to make the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.340
 science to ideology it's exactly 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.780
 that for the string was a bit big 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.280
 and es10 low rebound since we are all 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.940
 blacks we are all from the black of 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.590
 various degrees 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.659
 Well, there is no reason to prevent their 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.290
 come to europe right now everything 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.510
 it's over 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.159
 the science to demonstrate and it fucks the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.890
 scares since there are a number 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:58.250
 of people including the newspaper the world 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.590
 1 the sacred scriptures of the 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.930
 French ripoublique in an article of the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.459
 December 24, 2010 have not passed a good 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.440
 christmas this year there is it we have it 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.239
 said the year 2010 will have been very 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.310
 rich for peace at paleo embarrassed 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.230
 genomics is that of discovery 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.910
 from the part denied in Neanderthal at 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.500
 current non-Africans and 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.630
 the denisovian heritage among the Papuans 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.100
 geneticists know that these advances 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.500
 can resuscitate theses 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.880
 racialists it's scary huh 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.039
 and we wonder how far it will go 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.350
 so he takes care to clarify that 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.669
 this legacy that this dna inheritance and 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.800
 non- coding ie it does not have 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.449
 Known functions my ass 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.039
 voyeur bar mom data are forced 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.300
 still to redo backpedaling 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.620
 and that's because at some point 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.060
 obviously science does not give them 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.260
 reason but they are still obliged to 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.910
 put ideology in the pope and 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.229
 milan the tokens says we are exploiting this 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.610
 kind of things but how are we 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.840
 exploit it my account yes we will not 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.460
 embarrassing since science gives us 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.870
 reason and you've been bothering us for 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.590
 years now that we're right and 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.419
 that we demonstrate it to you scientifically 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.650
 we will put you as the friend would say 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.750
 dieudonnÃ© we will put you a good 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.919
 can l2 15 the guys this was going you there 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.330
 to be entitled we will never let go 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.770
 you this is one realizes that 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.810
 truly there is manipulation and 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.550
 that and have appealed to science to 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.750
 every time to try to support all 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.830
 these great ideologies that today 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.530
 they are beaten very badly 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.270
 clearly then historically there is 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.770
 things that can not be I 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.820
 we could not go against it 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.560
 obvious that to realize 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.699
 that actually there is not a year 7 ago 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.710
 ancestors and that the story of 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.180
 humanity is not just about 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.860
 a human race that would have declined 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.490
 in different forms ceases that of 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.139
 great old 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.090
 excuse me or what would have 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.479
 been a pure exception in the field 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.560
 of life there is no equivalent 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.110
 here I think we 'll finally be able to 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.580
 quickly maybe car and I 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.389
 understood that a Scandinavian and a Zairian 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.130
 it was not the same 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.360
 or else you have to redo the missions and 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.560
 if there were any who still believed I 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.210
 think there maybe they understood 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.660
 that this was not the case the world 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.660
 exactly
