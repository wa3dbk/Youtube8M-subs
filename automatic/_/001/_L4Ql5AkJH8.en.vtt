I<00:02:39.830> do<00:02:39.890> recommend<00:02:40.460> a<00:02:41.000> heavy<00:02:41.270> bottom<00:02:41.720> one<00:02:42.370> and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
I do recommend a heavy bottom one and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.980 
I do recommend a heavy bottom one and
then<00:02:43.520> get<00:02:43.700> about<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.970> half<00:02:44.270> a<00:02:44.450> can<00:02:44.630> of<00:02:44.690> water

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
then get about a half a can of water

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.250 
then get about a half a can of water
from<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.440> top<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:47.570> doesn't<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.140> be

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
from the top it doesn't have to be

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.600 
from the top it doesn't have to be
perfectly<00:02:48.740> accurate<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.070> actually<00:02:55.220> do

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
perfectly accurate and I actually do

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.450 
perfectly accurate and I actually do
measure<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.180> ketchup<00:02:56.800> into<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:58.040> measuring

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
measure the ketchup into the measuring

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.610 
measure the ketchup into the measuring
spoon<00:02:58.760> for<00:02:59.060> this<00:03:02.080> because<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.260> don't<00:03:03.410> want

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
spoon for this because you don't want

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.160 
spoon for this because you don't want
too<00:03:03.860> much<00:03:04.070> oh<00:03:04.480> it's<00:03:05.480> about<00:03:05.630> right<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.840> I'm<00:03:12.020> not

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
too much oh it's about right and I'm not

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.570 
too much oh it's about right and I'm not
going<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.380> be<00:03:12.440> using<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.800> spin<00:03:13.070> for<00:03:13.370> anything

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
going to be using the spin for anything

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.199 
going to be using the spin for anything
else

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
else

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.150

shudders<00:03:15.080> kind<00:03:15.350> of<00:03:15.440> went<00:03:15.590> off<00:03:15.800> in<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.820> pot<00:03:17.090> you

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.470 

notice<00:03:22.160> there's<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.430> bit<00:03:22.610> stuck<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:23.090> that's<00:03:23.300> why

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
notice there's a bit stuck in that's why

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.220 
notice there's a bit stuck in that's why
I<00:03:23.510> always<00:03:23.780> put<00:03:24.020> a<00:03:24.050> little<00:03:24.200> bit<00:03:24.320> more<00:03:26.230> just

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
I always put a little bit more just

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.210 
I always put a little bit more just
whisk<00:03:27.530> got<00:03:27.800> up<00:03:28.010> gently<00:03:29.590> with<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.740> heat<00:03:30.980> off

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
whisk got up gently with the heat off

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.540 
whisk got up gently with the heat off
now<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:32.390> want<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.780> add<00:03:33.020> your<00:03:33.350> cornstarch<00:03:34.280> and

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
now you want to add your cornstarch and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.150 
now you want to add your cornstarch and
spice<00:03:34.910> mixture<00:03:35.510> with<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.470> heat<00:03:36.680> off<00:03:36.890> because

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
spice mixture with the heat off because

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.240 
spice mixture with the heat off because
if<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.520> forget<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.560> bring<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.920> boil

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
if you forget and bring that to a boil

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.520 
if you forget and bring that to a boil
first<00:03:40.640> all<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.300> cornstarch<00:03:41.810> will<00:03:42.080> clump<00:03:42.320> up

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
first all the cornstarch will clump up

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.990 
first all the cornstarch will clump up
and<00:03:42.709> you'll<00:03:42.830> have<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:43.070> heck<00:03:43.220> of<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.459> time<00:03:43.640> getting

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
and you'll have a heck of a time getting

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.540 
and you'll have a heck of a time getting
it<00:03:44.090> out<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:45.890> just<00:03:46.850> put<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.180> in<00:03:47.239> a<00:03:47.300> bit

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
it out of you so just put it in a bit

00:03:48.550 --> 00:04:00.649 
it out of you so just put it in a bit
and<00:03:49.550> screw<00:03:50.300> that<00:03:50.510> in

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.940 

the<00:04:01.659> reason<00:04:01.959> you<00:04:02.019> have<00:04:02.170> to<00:04:02.319> do<00:04:02.439> that<00:04:02.620> is

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
the reason you have to do that is

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.559 
the reason you have to do that is
because<00:04:03.099> it's<00:04:03.459> home<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:03.909> it<00:04:04.180> doesn't<00:04:04.480> have

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
because it's home and it doesn't have

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.509 
because it's home and it doesn't have
any<00:04:04.720> chemicals<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.319> it<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.500> help<00:04:06.370> it

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
any chemicals in it that help it

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.460 
any chemicals in it that help it
dissolve<00:04:06.670> easily<00:04:07.709> like<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.860> packages<00:04:09.430> do

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
dissolve easily like the packages do

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.319 
dissolve easily like the packages do
need<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.620> little<00:04:11.860> bit<00:04:12.129> efficient<00:04:12.610> what<00:04:13.120> you

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
need a little bit efficient what you

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:44.640 
need a little bit efficient what you
like<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.720> rush<00:04:20.079> you<00:04:20.289> just<00:04:20.530> go<00:04:20.739> in<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:44.350> may<00:04:44.590> be

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
like and rush you just go in that may be

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.810 
like and rush you just go in that may be
looking<00:04:45.130> familiar<00:04:45.370> already<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:46.240> some<00:04:46.479> you<00:04:46.690> and

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
looking familiar already to some you and

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.879 
looking familiar already to some you and
get<00:04:48.820> your<00:04:48.940> heat<00:04:49.180> on<00:04:50.100> medium<00:04:51.100> and<00:04:52.560> stir<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.710> till

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
get your heat on medium and stir it till

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:04.560 
get your heat on medium and stir it till
it<00:04:54.010> comes<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.490> boil

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.420 

well<00:05:05.570> zoom<00:05:05.810> in<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.050> bit<00:05:06.170> so<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.680> can<00:05:06.860> see<00:05:07.160> when

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
well zoom in a bit so you can see when

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.730 
well zoom in a bit so you can see when
it<00:05:07.550> starts<00:05:08.120> to<00:05:08.240> heat<00:05:08.570> up<00:05:08.600> you'll<00:05:09.500> notice

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
it starts to heat up you'll notice

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.280 
it starts to heat up you'll notice
there's<00:05:10.700> going<00:05:10.850> to<00:05:10.910> be<00:05:10.970> little<00:05:11.480> clear<00:05:11.870> spots

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
there's going to be little clear spots

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.530 
there's going to be little clear spots
developing<00:05:13.040> throughout<00:05:13.310> this<00:05:14.060> is<00:05:14.240> where<00:05:14.420> it's

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
developing throughout this is where it's

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:26.290 
developing throughout this is where it's
important<00:05:15.050> that<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.290> keep<00:05:15.560> stirring<00:05:25.210> when<00:05:26.210> it

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
important that you keep stirring when it

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.330 
important that you keep stirring when it
does<00:05:26.510> come<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:26.960> boil<00:05:27.230> it<00:05:27.470> will<00:05:27.680> get<00:05:27.890> dark<00:05:28.190> and

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
does come to boil it will get dark and

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:38.170 
does come to boil it will get dark and
clear<00:05:28.670> at<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.030> same<00:05:29.090> time<00:05:36.580> when<00:05:37.580> it<00:05:37.670> does<00:05:37.880> come

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
clear at the same time when it does come

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.900 
clear at the same time when it does come
to<00:05:38.360> a<00:05:38.390> boil<00:05:38.780> and<00:05:39.110> it<00:05:39.920> has<00:05:40.040> little<00:05:40.220> bubbles<00:05:40.730> all

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
to a boil and it has little bubbles all

to a boil and it has little bubbles all
over<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.270> surface<00:05:41.830> should<00:05:42.830> turn<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.250> heat

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
over the surface should turn the heat

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.880 
over the surface should turn the heat
right<00:05:43.550> down<00:05:43.880> to<00:05:44.090> low<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.600> go<00:05:45.530> get<00:05:45.710> your

you don't have schmaltz which is

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.280 
you don't have schmaltz which is
rendered<00:05:50.180> chicken<00:05:50.210> fat<00:05:50.780> you<00:05:50.990> can<00:05:51.260> a

as vegetable shortening or lard but I

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.410 
as vegetable shortening or lard but I

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
would step back on it a bit because you
