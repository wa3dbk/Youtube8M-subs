the bullet time effect that you all know
and<00:00:02.429> love<00:00:02.610> has<00:00:03.419> been<00:00:03.629> around<00:00:03.840> for<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.140> while<00:00:04.170> and

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
and love has been around for a while and

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.430 
and love has been around for a while and
sometimes<00:00:05.339> it's<00:00:05.670> done<00:00:05.879> with<00:00:06.210> an<00:00:06.480> array<00:00:07.410> of

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
sometimes it's done with an array of

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.299 
sometimes it's done with an array of
multiple<00:00:08.400> cameras<00:00:08.910> but<00:00:09.630> what<00:00:09.990> I've<00:00:10.200> seen

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
multiple cameras but what I've seen

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.970 
multiple cameras but what I've seen
actually<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.870> big<00:00:13.139> studios<00:00:13.559> have

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
actually is that the big studios have

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.350 
actually is that the big studios have
now<00:00:14.099> moved<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.460> using<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.790> single<00:00:15.210> High

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
now moved to using a single High

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.599 
now moved to using a single High
Definition<00:00:15.509> high-speed<00:00:16.350> camera<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.980> they

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
Definition high-speed camera and they

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.269 
Definition high-speed camera and they
just<00:00:17.820> move<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.390> really<00:00:18.720> fast<00:00:19.070> around<00:00:20.070> whatever

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
just move it really fast around whatever

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.759 
just move it really fast around whatever
they<00:00:21.090> need<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> do<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> effect<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:22.020> gives<00:00:22.650> them

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
they need to do the effect on gives them

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.620 
they need to do the effect on gives them
a<00:00:22.800> lot<00:00:22.949> more<00:00:23.070> flexibility<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.330> ends<00:00:24.570> up

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
a lot more flexibility and it ends up

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.650 
a lot more flexibility and it ends up
being<00:00:24.869> cheaper<00:00:25.320> than<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.490> buying<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.150> whole

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
being cheaper than just buying a whole

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.029 
being cheaper than just buying a whole
lot<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.930> cameras<00:00:28.289> or<00:00:28.380> renting<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> lot<00:00:28.949> of

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
literally just took the lazy susan

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.890 
literally just took the lazy susan
attach<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.350> arm<00:01:17.160> to<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> top<00:01:17.910> of<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.330> then

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
attach this arm to the top of it then

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.040 
attach this arm to the top of it then
screwed<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.410> down<00:01:19.440> to<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> base<00:01:20.250> plate<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.050> could

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
screwed it down to a base plate I could

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.820 
screwed it down to a base plate I could
call<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.410> done

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
call this done

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.500 
call this done
I<00:01:22.860> could<00:01:23.070> clamp<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.610> HD<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.580> GoPro<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
I could clamp the HD the GoPro to the

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.950 
I could clamp the HD the GoPro to the
end<00:01:27.690> of<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.910> set<00:01:29.910> it<00:01:29.940> on<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.120> table<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:30.780> use

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
end of it and set it on a table and use

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.900 
end of it and set it on a table and use
a<00:01:30.990> clamp<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.560> fasten<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.190> down<00:01:32.370> to<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> table

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
a clamp to fasten this down to the table

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.330 
a clamp to fasten this down to the table
so<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> doesn't<00:01:33.540> move<00:01:33.660> and<00:01:33.990> then<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.860> could<00:01:35.070> spin

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
so it doesn't move and then I could spin

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.750 
so it doesn't move and then I could spin
it<00:01:35.370> by<00:01:35.670> hand<00:01:36.860> from<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.070> side<00:01:38.310> while<00:01:38.580> holding

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
it by hand from one side while holding

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.970 
it by hand from one side while holding
the<00:01:39.030> product<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.660> place<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.290> whatever<00:01:40.530> we

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
the product in place or whatever we

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.940 
the product in place or whatever we
could<00:01:41.160> literally<00:01:41.430> call<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.030> done<00:01:43.880> however

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
could literally call this done however

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.080 
could literally call this done however
I'm<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:47.250> bit<00:01:47.370> worried<00:01:47.580> about<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.910> all

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
I'm a little bit worried about this all

I'm a little bit worried about this all
showing<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.510> in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.690> frame<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.280> I'm<00:01:50.610> going<00:01:50.940> to

showing up in the frame so I'm going to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.130 
showing up in the frame so I'm going to
add<00:01:52.140> an<00:01:52.650> attachment<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:54.210> holds<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> camera

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
add an attachment that holds the camera

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.400 
add an attachment that holds the camera
up<00:01:55.440> about<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.010> tall<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:57.210> also<00:01:57.900> allows<00:01:58.170> me

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
up about this tall that also allows me

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.410 
up about this tall that also allows me
to<00:01:58.619> adjust<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.250> distance<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.910> that<00:02:00.330> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
to adjust the distance out that the

it look cool alright let's check out
I've<00:03:50.640> literally<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:51.240> dropped<00:03:51.660> this<00:03:51.930> into

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
I've literally just dropped this into

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.010 
I've literally just dropped this into
the<00:03:52.650> editing<00:03:52.950> software<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.610> set<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.300> time<00:03:54.540> to

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
the editing software and set the time to

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.140 
the editing software and set the time to
go<00:03:55.140> down<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.410> 30<00:03:55.590> frames<00:03:55.770> a<00:03:56.040> second<00:03:56.490> since<00:03:57.000> we

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
go down to 30 frames a second since we

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.420 
go down to 30 frames a second since we
filmed<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.540> 120<00:03:58.230> frames<00:03:58.380> per<00:03:58.860> second<00:03:59.310> that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
filmed it 120 frames per second that

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.100 
filmed it 120 frames per second that
gives<00:03:59.850> us<00:03:59.940> a<00:03:59.970> pretty<00:04:00.150> good<00:04:00.300> ratio<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:00.959> things

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
gives us a pretty good ratio and things

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.980 
gives us a pretty good ratio and things
were<00:04:01.230> already<00:04:01.740> in<00:04:01.980> slow<00:04:02.190> motion<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.550> haven't

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
were already in slow motion I haven't

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.430 
were already in slow motion I haven't
to<00:04:03.050> add<00:04:03.200> any<00:04:03.500> effects<00:04:04.070> or<00:04:05.000> anything<00:04:05.270> now<00:04:06.260> as

to add any effects or anything now as
you<00:04:06.560> can<00:04:06.680> see<00:04:07.030> looks<00:04:08.030> pretty<00:04:08.270> good<00:04:08.480> -<00:04:08.810> little

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
you can see looks pretty good - little

Wiggly and my lighting could obviously

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.450 
Wiggly and my lighting could obviously
be<00:04:10.640> better<00:04:11.440> but<00:04:12.440> it's<00:04:12.590> not<00:04:12.710> bad<00:04:12.920> for<00:04:13.160> how<00:04:13.220> cheap

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
be better but it's not bad for how cheap

be better but it's not bad for how cheap
it<00:04:13.610> was<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.510> fact<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.780> we<00:04:14.900> only<00:04:15.050> used

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
it was and the fact that we only used

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.520 
it was and the fact that we only used
one<00:04:15.650> GoPro<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.660> would<00:04:17.660> definitely<00:04:18.110> call<00:04:18.320> this

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530

was<00:04:21.830> really<00:04:22.160> cool-looking<00:04:22.490> it's<00:04:23.300> not<00:04:23.450> what<00:04:23.600> a

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
was really cool-looking it's not what a

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.120 
was really cool-looking it's not what a
professional<00:04:23.930> studio<00:04:24.410> would<00:04:24.680> put<00:04:24.800> out<00:04:24.950> but

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130
