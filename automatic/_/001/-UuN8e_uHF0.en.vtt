00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
yeast so the next thing we need to add

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.109 
yeast so the next thing we need to add
is<00:00:28.230> some<00:00:28.560> olive<00:00:29.039> oil<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.519> here's<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.820> little

is<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:37.309> pecorino<00:00:38.309> cheese<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
is just pecorino cheese so it's a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
is just pecorino cheese so it's a
sheep's<00:00:39.480> milk<00:00:39.780> cheese<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.559> about<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
sheep's milk cheese you want about a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.880 
sheep's milk cheese you want about a
third<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> cup<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.020> goes<00:00:43.559> in

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
third of a cup or so so that goes in

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.580 
third of a cup or so so that goes in
with<00:00:44.160> our<00:00:44.309> liquid<00:00:44.520> ingredients<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.320> of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
with our liquid ingredients and of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.850 
with our liquid ingredients and of
course<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.190> need<00:00:47.399> salt<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.809> flavor<00:00:49.050> our<00:00:49.379> dough

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
course we need salt to flavor our dough

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.209 
course we need salt to flavor our dough
and<00:00:50.219> also<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.449> keep<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.750> rising<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.770> check

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
and also to keep the rising in check

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.970 
and also to keep the rising in check
because<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> didn't<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.239> any<00:00:54.960> salt<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
because if you didn't have any salt in a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.979 
because if you didn't have any salt in a
dough<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.399> made<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.300> yeast<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.750> just

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
dough that you made the yeast would just

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.410 
dough that you made the yeast would just
run<00:00:58.230> rampant<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.579> wouldn't<00:00:59.879> have<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.120> very

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
run rampant and you wouldn't have a very

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.020 
run rampant and you wouldn't have a very
good<00:01:00.629> flavor<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.469> dough<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.789> have

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
good flavor in your dough so we have

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.960 
good flavor in your dough so we have
that<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.170> need<00:01:04.409> some<00:01:04.830> pepper<00:01:05.220> about

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
that and then we need some pepper about

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.190 
that and then we need some pepper about
oh<00:01:06.510> I'd<00:01:06.810> say<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.320> teaspoon<00:01:07.950> or<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.360> now

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
oh I'd say a teaspoon or so and now

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.039 
oh I'd say a teaspoon or so and now
we're<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:10.890> gonna<00:01:11.040> whirl<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.850> around<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
we're just gonna whirl that around for a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.730 
we're just gonna whirl that around for a
couple<00:01:13.470> minutes

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.110

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
all right now that we have that all

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.660 
all right now that we have that all
mixed<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.170> begin<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> add<00:01:19.800> our<00:01:20.130> flour

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
mixed up we can begin to add our flour

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.660 
mixed up we can begin to add our flour
so<00:01:21.270> we've<00:01:21.450> got<00:01:21.630> about<00:01:21.750> 4<00:01:22.230> cups<00:01:22.500> I'm<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.550> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so we've got about 4 cups I'm going to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240 
so we've got about 4 cups I'm going to
add<00:01:23.760> it<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.060> little<00:01:24.360> bit<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> time<00:01:24.980> so<00:01:25.980> I<00:01:26.040> want

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.130 
add it a little bit at a time so I want
to<00:01:26.340> create<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.730> dough<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.510> is<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.590> too<00:01:28.950> sticky

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
to create a dough that is not too sticky

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.620 
to create a dough that is not too sticky
but<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.170> too<00:01:31.710> hard<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.060> you're<00:01:33.210> doing<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
but not too hard so if you're doing this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.660 
but not too hard so if you're doing this
in<00:01:33.690> a<00:01:33.900> mixer<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> little<00:01:35.190> bit<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:35.640> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
in a mixer do this a little bit at a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.690 
in a mixer do this a little bit at a
time<00:01:36.410> okay<00:01:37.410> I<00:01:37.440> think<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.830> can<00:01:38.010> take<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.490> out

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
time okay I think I can take that out

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.480 
time okay I think I can take that out
now<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.870> gonna<00:01:40.050> knead<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.650> my<00:01:40.920> board

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
now I'm gonna knead it on my board

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.400 
now I'm gonna knead it on my board
I<00:01:43.760> think<00:01:44.760> Nona<00:01:45.030> would<00:01:45.300> be<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.780> proud<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.140> me

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
I think Nona would be really proud of me

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.760 
I think Nona would be really proud of me
making<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.370> in<00:01:47.580> her<00:01:47.760> honor<00:01:48.050> so<00:01:49.050> now<00:01:49.290> once<00:01:49.560> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
making this in her honor so now once you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.400 
making this in her honor so now once you
have<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.220> dough<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.490> want<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> knead<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.420> use

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
have the dough you want to knead it use

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.370 
have the dough you want to knead it use
your<00:01:52.619> hands<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.910> kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> turn<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.140> dough

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
your hands and kind of turn the dough

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.330 
your hands and kind of turn the dough
every<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.369> often<00:01:57.200> you'll<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.470> something

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
every so often you'll have something

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.090 
every so often you'll have something
that<00:01:59.610> looks<00:01:59.760> like<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.660> really<00:02:01.560> beautiful

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
that looks like this a really beautiful

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.749 
that looks like this a really beautiful
soft<00:02:02.520> looking<00:02:03.240> ball<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:04.170> dough<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:05.430> now<00:02:05.700> we

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
soft looking ball of dough so now we

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.490 
soft looking ball of dough so now we
need<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.420> put<00:02:06.690> this<00:02:06.840> into<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.320> bowl<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:08.190> rise<00:02:09.500> so

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
need to put this into a bowl to rise so
