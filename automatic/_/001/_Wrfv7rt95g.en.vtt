game I made it great I gave away all
these<00:03:42.030> bikes<00:03:42.300> like<00:03:42.540> check<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.870> out<00:03:42.959> isn't<00:03:43.110> that

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
these bikes like check it out isn't that

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.710 
these bikes like check it out isn't that
awesome<00:03:43.610> instead<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.670> like<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.300> kind<00:03:45.690> of

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
awesome instead of like that kind of

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.170 
awesome instead of like that kind of
being<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.140> gimmick<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.680> game<00:03:47.390> yeah

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.830 

but<00:03:54.180> uh<00:03:55.550> mechanically<00:03:56.550> this<00:03:56.850> looks<00:03:57.240> this

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
but uh mechanically this looks this

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.780 
but uh mechanically this looks this
looks<00:03:57.900> less<00:03:58.380> like<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:59.130> know<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> physics

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
looks less like you know a physics

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.730 
looks less like you know a physics
biking<00:04:00.270> game<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.690> more<00:04:00.840> like<00:04:01.020> a<00:04:01.050> runner<00:04:01.470> I

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
biking game and more like a runner I

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.920 
biking game and more like a runner I
would<00:04:01.890> say<00:04:02.070> almost<00:04:02.820> like<00:04:03.090> ski<00:04:03.390> safari<00:04:03.570> or

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
would say almost like ski safari or

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.500 
would say almost like ski safari or
something<00:04:04.080> yeah<00:04:04.940> kind<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.150> kind<00:04:06.300> of<00:04:06.390> wish

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
something yeah kind of I kind of wish

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.540 
something yeah kind of I kind of wish
there<00:04:06.690> was<00:04:06.810> more<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.320> because<00:04:07.920> like<00:04:08.070> like

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
there was more to it because like like

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.730 
there was more to it because like like
ski<00:04:08.820> safari<00:04:08.970> proves<00:04:09.600> that<00:04:09.750> like<00:04:10.020> backflipping

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
ski safari proves that like backflipping

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.730 
ski safari proves that like backflipping
is<00:04:10.920> super<00:04:11.220> fun<00:04:11.400> right<00:04:11.820> right<00:04:12.690> yeah<00:04:13.170> but<00:04:13.650> you

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
is super fun right right yeah but you

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.950 
is super fun right right yeah but you
can<00:04:13.920> only<00:04:13.950> really<00:04:14.190> backflip<00:04:14.970> off<00:04:15.210> of<00:04:17.210> one<00:04:18.210> are

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
can only really backflip off of one are

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.479 
can only really backflip off of one are
you<00:04:19.020> likely<00:04:19.260> actually<00:04:19.620> like<00:04:19.710> ramps<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.310> like

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
you likely actually like ramps and like

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.400 
you likely actually like ramps and like
some<00:04:21.120> really<00:04:21.300> good<00:04:21.510> jumps<00:04:21.960> and<00:04:22.110> stuff<00:04:22.290> like

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
some really good jumps and stuff like

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.390 
some really good jumps and stuff like
that<00:04:23.150> who<00:04:24.150> was<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.560> who's<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.710> guy<00:04:25.950> on<00:04:26.340> the

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
that who was a who's this guy on the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.670 
that who was a who's this guy on the
bike<00:04:26.670> because<00:04:26.970> he's<00:04:27.120> supportive<00:04:27.750> like<00:04:27.900> he's

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
bike because he's supportive like he's

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.020 
bike because he's supportive like he's
kind<00:04:28.920> of<00:04:28.980> creeping<00:04:29.280> me<00:04:29.400> out<00:04:29.430> when<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.850> goes<00:04:30.000> to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
kind of creeping me out when it goes to

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.950 
kind of creeping me out when it goes to
that<00:04:30.270> end<00:04:30.540> of<00:04:30.870> level<00:04:31.140> menu<00:04:31.500> or<00:04:31.890> whatever<00:04:32.450> is<00:04:33.450> uh

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:45.980 

he<00:04:36.960> clicks<00:04:37.260> almost<00:04:37.590> like<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:38.430> real<00:04:44.840> now<00:04:45.840> we're

sick flips 36 lips and straight into a

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:03.440 
sick flips 36 lips and straight into a
rock<00:04:59.330> what's<00:05:00.330> red<00:05:00.600> oh<00:05:00.810> well<00:05:01.610> well<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:02.640> mean<00:05:02.910> you

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
rock what's red oh well well I mean you

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.140 
rock what's red oh well well I mean you
know<00:05:03.480> you<00:05:03.630> kind<00:05:03.810> of<00:05:03.840> basically<00:05:04.110> see<00:05:04.440> like<00:05:04.680> the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
know you kind of basically see like the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.700 
know you kind of basically see like the
gist<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.300> all<00:05:06.450> this<00:05:06.660> here<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:06.960> guess<00:05:07.260> there's

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
gist of all this here I guess there's

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.820 
gist of all this here I guess there's
not<00:05:07.980> much<00:05:08.040> reason<00:05:08.280> for<00:05:08.520> me<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:09.410> watch<00:05:10.410> me<00:05:10.650> play

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
not much reason for me to watch me play

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.950 
not much reason for me to watch me play
this<00:05:11.010> it's<00:05:11.220> uh<00:05:11.430> it's<00:05:11.730> a<00:05:11.910> biking<00:05:12.330> platformer

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
this it's uh it's a biking platformer

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.930 
this it's uh it's a biking platformer
that<00:05:12.990> will<00:05:13.530> get<00:05:13.740> bikes<00:05:14.040> to<00:05:14.370> underprivileged

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
that will get bikes to underprivileged

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.940 
that will get bikes to underprivileged
kids<00:05:15.140> yeah<00:05:16.140> well<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.470> mean<00:05:16.680> at<00:05:16.860> school

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
kids yeah well I mean at school

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.530 
kids yeah well I mean at school
allegedly<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:17.610> guess<00:05:18.030> just<00:05:18.150> what<00:05:18.300> kills<00:05:18.450> me

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
allegedly I guess just what kills me

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.360 
allegedly I guess just what kills me
about<00:05:18.570> this<00:05:18.750> is<00:05:18.900> likely<00:05:19.500> if<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.130> game<00:05:20.340> doesn't

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
about this is likely if the game doesn't

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.140 
about this is likely if the game doesn't
do<00:05:20.970> good<00:05:21.410> like<00:05:22.640> it's<00:05:23.640> gonna<00:05:23.790> be<00:05:23.970> hella

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
things you saw and then you know of

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.150

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
guess all the proceeds of this goes

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.830 
guess all the proceeds of this goes
towards<00:06:01.200> that<00:06:01.380> bike<00:06:01.650> total<00:06:02.190> which<00:06:03.090> India<00:06:03.600> and
