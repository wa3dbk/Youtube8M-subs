obelisk and mace toward to it it really

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.180 
obelisk and mace toward to it it really
doesn't<00:01:32.360> have<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.720> lot<00:01:32.900> of<00:01:33.110> your<00:01:33.470> all<00:01:33.920> of

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
undertones aim to the foundation so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.390 
undertones aim to the foundation so
haven't<00:01:38.720> abroad<00:01:39.080> that<00:01:39.409> in<00:01:39.619> music<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.190> things

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
haven't abroad that in music and things

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.250 
haven't abroad that in music and things
in<00:01:40.610> combination<00:01:41.180> with<00:01:41.330> this<00:01:41.510> is<00:01:41.690> why<00:01:41.900> some

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
in combination with this is why some

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.660 
in combination with this is why some
things<00:01:42.470> have<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.830> do<00:01:43.210> I<00:01:44.950> also<00:01:45.950> do<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.369> with<00:01:46.520> this

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
things have to do I also do it with this

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.880 
things have to do I also do it with this
but<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.330> way<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:47.690> do<00:01:47.750> it<00:01:47.930> here<00:01:48.290> but<00:01:48.740> it

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
but the way that I do it here but it

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.500 
but the way that I do it here but it
makes<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.400> job<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:49.670> much<00:01:50.240> more<00:01:50.479> easier<00:01:51.189> so<00:01:52.510> you

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
makes the job so much more easier so you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.120 
makes the job so much more easier so you
can<00:01:53.659> then<00:01:53.780> use<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:53.990> Beautyblender<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:54.920> veil

to put a song with the same theme way as
you<00:01:58.340> would<00:01:58.460> usually<00:01:58.700> do<00:01:59.090> with<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.869> recent

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
you would usually do with the recent

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.690

time

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
time

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.539 
time
basically<00:02:01.360> it's<00:02:02.170> sort<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.470> like<00:02:02.770> mixing<00:02:03.369> it

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
basically it's sort of like mixing it

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.880 
basically it's sort of like mixing it
with<00:02:03.790> some<00:02:04.090> moisturizer<00:02:04.630> so<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.530> take<00:02:05.860> your

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
with some moisturizer so you take your

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.150 
with some moisturizer so you take your
foundation<00:02:06.700> here's<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.600> second<00:02:07.930> foundation

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
foundation here's the second foundation

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:17.250 
foundation here's the second foundation
and<00:02:09.780> basically<00:02:14.370> there's<00:02:15.370> your<00:02:16.270> palate<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and basically there's your palate the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.350 
and basically there's your palate the
back<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.590> your<00:02:17.709> hands<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:18.910> put<00:02:19.150> some

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
back of your hands so you just put some

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.080 
back of your hands so you just put some
of<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.720> right<00:02:20.530> into<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.770> skin<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:22.030> can

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
of this right into the skin and you can

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.729 
of this right into the skin and you can
see<00:02:22.239> that<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.720> foundation<00:02:23.290> though<00:02:23.470> it

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
see that it's a foundation though it

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:24.990 
see that it's a foundation though it
really<00:02:24.190> doesn't<00:02:24.489> have<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> lot<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:24.850> your

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
really doesn't have a lot of your

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.600 
really doesn't have a lot of your
undertones<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.250> going<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.489> be

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
undertones to it and this is going to be

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.870 
undertones to it and this is going to be

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
in connective solution so basically here

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.650 
in connective solution so basically here
is<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.440> somatic<00:02:44.830> that's<00:02:45.069> been<00:02:45.280> previously

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
smallest amount so that's literally just

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.580 
smallest amount so that's literally just
a<00:02:55.030> bat<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.569> can<00:02:55.720> actually<00:02:56.019> see<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> color

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
a bat you can actually see the color

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.240 
a bat you can actually see the color
feel<00:02:56.920> now<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.519> want<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.850> small<00:02:58.120> night<00:02:58.390> because

feel now you want a small night because

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.190 
feel now you want a small night because
this<00:03:00.250> space<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.239> really<00:03:01.569> pick<00:03:01.810> my<00:03:01.959> teeth

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
this space that you really pick my teeth

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.640 
this space that you really pick my teeth
and<00:03:02.380> this<00:03:02.830> is<00:03:02.950> why<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.220> really<00:03:03.549> works<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:05.410> here

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
and this is why it really works so here

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.400 
and this is why it really works so here
is<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.950> foundation<00:03:06.579> they<00:03:07.359> you<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.049> see<00:03:08.230> that

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
is the foundation they you can see that

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.220 
is the foundation they you can see that
stuff<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.829> minute<00:03:09.390> I'm<00:03:10.390> just<00:03:10.810> gonna<00:03:10.959> rub<00:03:11.200> that

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
stuff a minute I'm just gonna rub that

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.339 
stuff a minute I'm just gonna rub that
and

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.589 

so<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:16.950> can<00:03:17.219> see<00:03:17.430> how<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.879> foundation<00:03:18.450> had

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
so you can see how the foundation had

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.420 
so you can see how the foundation had
significantly<00:03:19.560> changed<00:03:20.010> color

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
significantly changed color

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.140 
significantly changed color
um<00:03:21.109> and<00:03:22.109> it's<00:03:22.950> what<00:03:23.219> I<00:03:23.579> am

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
um and it's what I am

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.020 
um and it's what I am
that<00:03:24.510> was<00:03:24.659> literally<00:03:25.079> just<00:03:25.560> another<00:03:26.069> like<00:03:26.430> 10

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
that was literally just another like 10

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.849 
that was literally just another like 10
seconds<00:03:27.599> that<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.900> took<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.200> chance<00:03:28.439> why<00:03:28.709> man

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
seconds that it took the chance why man

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.690 
seconds that it took the chance why man
that<00:03:28.950> foundation<00:03:29.579> so<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.829> methods<00:03:32.280> really

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
that foundation so the methods really

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.300
