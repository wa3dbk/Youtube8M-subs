00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.650 
book Scouts in her 20s and I think that
this<00:03:23.900> exploration<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:25.310> Scout<00:03:25.700> goes<00:03:26.270> through

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
this exploration that Scout goes through

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.600 
this exploration that Scout goes through
is<00:03:26.989> an<00:03:27.290> exploration<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.010> lot<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.340> people

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
is an exploration that a lot of people

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.240 
is an exploration that a lot of people
who<00:03:29.090> maybe<00:03:29.870> grew<00:03:30.110> up<00:03:30.230> in<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.530> small<00:03:30.890> town<00:03:30.920> or

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
who maybe grew up in a small town or

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.300 
who maybe grew up in a small town or
grow<00:03:31.670> up<00:03:31.790> in<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.030> very<00:03:32.209> bubble<00:03:32.989> community<00:03:33.950> if

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
grow up in a very bubble community if

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.130 
grow up in a very bubble community if
they<00:03:34.459> go<00:03:34.610> away<00:03:34.820> to<00:03:34.880> college<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.690> then<00:03:35.780> return

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
they go away to college and then return

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.870 
they go away to college and then return
home<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:36.650> feel<00:03:36.800> like<00:03:36.980> this<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.310> an<00:03:37.430> experience

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
home I feel like this is an experience

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.550 
home I feel like this is an experience
that<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:38.209> lot<00:03:38.420> of<00:03:38.450> people<00:03:38.810> go<00:03:38.959> through<00:03:39.200> they

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
that a lot of people go through they

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.020 
that a lot of people go through they
return<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:39.980> their<00:03:40.100> home<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.280> they<00:03:40.610> realize

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
return to their home and they realize

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.910 
return to their home and they realize
that<00:03:41.060> not<00:03:41.660> everything's<00:03:42.140> as<00:03:42.320> perfect<00:03:42.709> as<00:03:42.890> you

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
that not everything's as perfect as you

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.830 
that not everything's as perfect as you
thought<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.489> would<00:03:43.670> be<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.420> things<00:03:44.630> that<00:03:44.720> you

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
thought it would be the things that you

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.210 
thought it would be the things that you
loved<00:03:45.170> when<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:45.350> are<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.590> kid<00:03:45.890> aren't

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
loved when you are a kid aren't

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.890 
loved when you are a kid aren't
necessarily<00:03:46.550> things<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.239> can<00:03:47.510> love<00:03:47.690> and

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
necessarily things that you can love and

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.780 
necessarily things that you can love and
enjoy<00:03:48.020> anymore<00:03:48.620> even<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.280> people<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.670> you

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
enjoy anymore even the people that you

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.150 
enjoy anymore even the people that you
love<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.360> can<00:03:50.750> still<00:03:51.110> love<00:03:51.290> them<00:03:51.530> but<00:03:51.830> there

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
love you can still love them but there

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160 
love you can still love them but there
might<00:03:52.340> be<00:03:52.400> different<00:03:53.300> viewpoints<00:03:53.840> different

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
might be different viewpoints different

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.140 
might be different viewpoints different
perspectives<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:54.800> you're<00:03:55.220> seeing<00:03:55.550> now<00:03:55.670> that

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
perspectives that you're seeing now that

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.410 
perspectives that you're seeing now that
make<00:03:56.570> them<00:03:56.870> not<00:03:57.650> quite<00:03:58.040> as<00:03:58.430> perfect<00:03:58.970> as<00:03:59.390> you

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
make them not quite as perfect as you

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.180 
make them not quite as perfect as you
thought<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.930> they<00:04:00.080> were<00:04:00.140> there<00:04:00.830> are<00:04:00.950> parts

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
thought that they were there are parts

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.560 
thought that they were there are parts
of<00:04:01.250> this<00:04:01.370> book<00:04:01.550> that<00:04:01.730> were<00:04:01.820> really<00:04:02.239> difficult

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
of this book that were really difficult

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.260 
of this book that were really difficult
for<00:04:02.870> me<00:04:03.050> to<00:04:03.709> get<00:04:03.890> through<00:04:04.070> not<00:04:04.489> because<00:04:04.850> the

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
for me to get through not because the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.210 
for me to get through not because the
writing<00:04:05.600> was<00:04:05.720> bad<00:04:05.930> or<00:04:06.140> difficult<00:04:06.620> but<00:04:06.860> because

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
writing was bad or difficult but because

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.890 
writing was bad or difficult but because
the<00:04:07.730> things<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.180> were<00:04:08.270> being<00:04:08.510> expressed

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
the things that were being expressed

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.460 
the things that were being expressed
were<00:04:09.620> so<00:04:10.459> problematic<00:04:11.060> but<00:04:11.420> also<00:04:11.630> so<00:04:12.110> of<00:04:12.290> its

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
were so problematic but also so of its

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.230 
were so problematic but also so of its
time<00:04:12.799> and<00:04:13.130> also<00:04:13.850> so<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.209> this<00:04:14.450> time

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
time and also so of this time

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.120 
time and also so of this time
it<00:04:15.540> made<00:04:15.840> me<00:04:16.020> want<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.260> throw<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.680> book<00:04:16.890> up

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
it made me want to throw this book up

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.190 
it made me want to throw this book up
against<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.760> wall<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.540> best<00:04:18.750> possible

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
against the wall in the best possible

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.140 
against the wall in the best possible
way<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.800> way<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.040> some<00:04:20.550> of<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.700> characters

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
way the way that some of the characters

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.050 
way the way that some of the characters
in<00:04:21.300> here<00:04:21.450> talk<00:04:21.780> about<00:04:22.080> race<00:04:22.920> and<00:04:23.250> segregation

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060

Living<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.990> small-town<00:04:28.560> living<00:04:28.770> all<00:04:29.360> felt<00:04:30.360> so

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
Living and small-town living all felt so

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.340 
Living and small-town living all felt so
1950s<00:04:32.220> but<00:04:32.640> also<00:04:32.910> with<00:04:33.360> current<00:04:33.720> events<00:04:34.080> felt

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
1950s but also with current events felt

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.430 
1950s but also with current events felt
so<00:04:34.850> now<00:04:35.850> sort<00:04:36.510> of<00:04:36.600> observing<00:04:37.080> this<00:04:37.200> as

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
so now sort of observing this as

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.050 
so now sort of observing this as
something<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.280> was<00:04:38.490> written<00:04:38.640> in<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:38.880> 50s

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
something that was written in the 50s

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.630 
something that was written in the 50s
and<00:04:39.420> hasn't<00:04:39.750> been<00:04:39.870> touched<00:04:40.080> since<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:41.400> see

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
and hasn't been touched since and to see

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.030 
and hasn't been touched since and to see
what<00:04:42.420> hasn't<00:04:42.840> hasn't<00:04:42.990> changed<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.800> minds

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
what hasn't hasn't changed in the minds

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.020 
what hasn't hasn't changed in the minds
of<00:04:44.250> some<00:04:44.430> people<00:04:44.790> is<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.810> really<00:04:46.380> interesting

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
of some people is a really interesting

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.910 
of some people is a really interesting
experiment<00:04:48.030> I<00:04:48.330> think<00:04:48.600> this<00:04:48.720> book<00:04:48.900> forces<00:04:49.500> the

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
experiment I think this book forces the

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.270 
experiment I think this book forces the
reader<00:04:50.130> or<00:04:50.520> at<00:04:50.670> least<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:50.940> forced<00:04:51.240> me<00:04:51.450> to

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
reader or at least to forced me to

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.400 
reader or at least to forced me to
reconcile<00:04:53.280> this<00:04:53.670> idea<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.390> someone<00:04:54.720> having

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
reconcile this idea of someone having

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.040 
reconcile this idea of someone having
really<00:04:56.040> problematic<00:04:56.610> thoughts<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.390> issues

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
really problematic thoughts and issues

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.100 
really problematic thoughts and issues
and<00:04:58.380> beliefs<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.040> still<00:04:59.990> understanding<00:05:00.990> them

to<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.380> certain<00:05:01.740> extent<00:05:02.370> that's<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.790> struggle<00:05:03.120> at

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
to a certain extent that's a struggle at

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.610 
to a certain extent that's a struggle at
least<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.510> scalp<00:05:03.840> goes<00:05:04.140> through<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.560> don't

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
least that scalp goes through I don't

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.500 
least that scalp goes through I don't
know<00:05:04.800> if<00:05:04.860> that's<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.400> right<00:05:05.610> way<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:05.910> approach

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
know if that's the right way to approach

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.790 
know if that's the right way to approach
this<00:05:06.810> book<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.230> don't<00:05:07.410> know<00:05:07.470> if<00:05:07.530> that's<00:05:07.680> the

this book I don't know if that's the

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
right way to approach those situations

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.660 
right way to approach those situations
but<00:05:09.930> I<00:05:09.990> think<00:05:10.320> everyone<00:05:10.710> has<00:05:11.100> someone<00:05:11.580> in

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
but I think everyone has someone in

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.790 
but I think everyone has someone in
their<00:05:11.820> life<00:05:12.000> that<00:05:12.270> they<00:05:12.870> don't<00:05:13.050> necessarily

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
their life that they don't necessarily

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.040 
their life that they don't necessarily
agree<00:05:14.100> with<00:05:14.190> but<00:05:14.580> they<00:05:14.940> love<00:05:15.150> them<00:05:15.330> anyways<00:05:15.720> so

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
agree with but they love them anyways so

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.420 
agree with but they love them anyways so
yeah<00:05:16.200> in<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.470> end<00:05:16.500> I<00:05:16.650> gave<00:05:16.770> this<00:05:16.860> book<00:05:17.040> a<00:05:17.250> 3<00:05:17.280> out

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
yeah in the end I gave this book a 3 out

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.460 
yeah in the end I gave this book a 3 out
of<00:05:17.520> 5<00:05:17.670> stars<00:05:17.940> it's<00:05:18.210> hard<00:05:18.570> to<00:05:18.720> give<00:05:18.840> this<00:05:19.020> more

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
of 5 stars it's hard to give this more

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.720 
of 5 stars it's hard to give this more
than<00:05:19.680> that<00:05:19.800> in<00:05:19.950> my<00:05:19.980> opinion<00:05:20.490> just<00:05:20.520> because

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
than that in my opinion just because

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.180 
than that in my opinion just because
it's<00:05:21.300> not<00:05:21.570> like<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.350> best<00:05:22.560> book<00:05:22.830> ever<00:05:23.070> written

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
it's not like the best book ever written

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.460 
it's not like the best book ever written
but<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.640> think<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.240> brings<00:05:24.510> up<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.870> lot<00:05:25.050> of<00:05:25.230> really

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
but I think it brings up a lot of really

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.170 
but I think it brings up a lot of really
interesting<00:05:25.500> ideas<00:05:25.980> and<00:05:26.670> I<00:05:26.820> think<00:05:27.030> it's<00:05:27.120> a

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
interesting ideas and I think it's a

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.000 
interesting ideas and I think it's a
really<00:05:27.420> interesting<00:05:27.600> companion<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.620> think

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
really interesting companion I think

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.370 
really interesting companion I think
that<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:29.760> is<00:05:29.970> actually<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.450> more<00:05:30.840> interesting

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
that this is actually a more interesting

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.460 
that this is actually a more interesting
layer<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:32.190> add<00:05:32.580> to<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.510> characters<00:05:33.960> that<00:05:34.350> are

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
layer to add to the characters that are

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.200 
layer to add to the characters that are
in<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.770> kill<00:05:34.920> mockingbird<00:05:35.460> because<00:05:35.730> in<00:05:35.940> tekele

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
in to kill mockingbird because in tekele

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.790 
in to kill mockingbird because in tekele
mockingbird<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.960> finches<00:05:37.230> are<00:05:37.410> basically

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
mockingbird the finches are basically

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.250 
mockingbird the finches are basically
like<00:05:38.010> perfect<00:05:38.460> people<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.970> in<00:05:39.420> this<00:05:39.540> book<00:05:39.840> you

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
like perfect people and in this book you

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.050 
like perfect people and in this book you
realize<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.710> they're<00:05:41.010> not<00:05:41.040> and<00:05:41.550> I<00:05:41.700> feel<00:05:41.880> like

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
realize that they're not and I feel like

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.180 
realize that they're not and I feel like
in<00:05:42.330> To<00:05:42.570> Kill<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:42.750> Mockingbird<00:05:42.920> racism<00:05:43.920> and

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
in To Kill a Mockingbird racism and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.910 
in To Kill a Mockingbird racism and
prejudices<00:05:45.120> and<00:05:45.420> biases<00:05:45.870> are<00:05:45.990> so<00:05:46.290> overtly

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
prejudices and biases are so overtly

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.250 
prejudices and biases are so overtly
clear<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.700> in<00:05:47.820> this<00:05:47.970> one<00:05:48.210> they're<00:05:48.540> more<00:05:49.050> like

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
clear and in this one they're more like

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.760 
clear and in this one they're more like
systemic<00:05:49.770> and<00:05:50.160> subtle<00:05:51.090> and<00:05:51.330> that's<00:05:52.170> more

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
systemic and subtle and that's more

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.560 
systemic and subtle and that's more
realistic<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.640> way<00:05:53.790> the<00:05:54.000> world<00:05:54.150> actually

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
realistic to the way the world actually

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.870 
realistic to the way the world actually
is<00:05:54.810> so<00:05:55.380> yeah<00:05:55.530> I<00:05:55.560> kind<00:05:55.890> of<00:05:55.980> really<00:05:56.280> liked<00:05:56.550> it<00:05:56.700> for

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
is so yeah I kind of really liked it for

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.580 
is so yeah I kind of really liked it for
that<00:05:57.060> even<00:05:57.510> though<00:05:57.690> this<00:05:58.050> book<00:05:58.260> was<00:05:58.440> so

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
that even though this book was so

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.770 
that even though this book was so
frustrating<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.400> read<00:05:59.610> at<00:05:59.940> times<00:06:00.240> because<00:06:00.750> of

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
frustrating to read at times because of

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.270 
frustrating to read at times because of
some<00:06:01.080> of<00:06:01.170> the<00:06:01.230> things<00:06:01.500> that<00:06:01.590> these<00:06:01.800> characters

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
some of the things that these characters

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.370 
some of the things that these characters
are<00:06:02.460> saying<00:06:02.640> I<00:06:03.000> really<00:06:03.660> liked<00:06:03.930> it<00:06:04.110> that<00:06:04.260> it

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
are saying I really liked it that it

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.140 
are saying I really liked it that it
actually<00:06:04.740> said<00:06:04.980> those<00:06:05.220> things<00:06:05.520> so<00:06:05.850> clearly

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
actually said those things so clearly

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.800 
actually said those things so clearly
because<00:06:06.540> it<00:06:06.990> really<00:06:07.710> forces<00:06:08.580> you<00:06:09.030> to<00:06:09.060> confront

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
because it really forces you to confront

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.960 
because it really forces you to confront
these<00:06:10.530> problematic<00:06:11.070> thoughts<00:06:11.400> that<00:06:11.700> people

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
these problematic thoughts that people

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.210 
these problematic thoughts that people
legitimately<00:06:12.360> have<00:06:13.230> so<00:06:13.650> yeah<00:06:13.770> those<00:06:13.980> are<00:06:14.040> my

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
legitimately have so yeah those are my

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.550 
legitimately have so yeah those are my
just<00:06:14.970> quick<00:06:15.300> thoughts<00:06:15.570> on<00:06:15.840> to<00:06:16.200> go<00:06:16.320> set<00:06:16.530> a

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
just quick thoughts on to go set a

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.350 
just quick thoughts on to go set a
watchman<00:06:16.650> this<00:06:17.430> is<00:06:17.610> one<00:06:17.760> of<00:06:17.790> those<00:06:17.970> books<00:06:18.210> that

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
watchman this is one of those books that

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.700 
watchman this is one of those books that
I<00:06:18.480> feel<00:06:18.720> like<00:06:18.870> I'm<00:06:19.020> going<00:06:19.260> to<00:06:19.290> be<00:06:19.530> thinking

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
I feel like I'm going to be thinking

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.950 
I feel like I'm going to be thinking
about<00:06:19.980> and<00:06:20.340> wrestling<00:06:20.760> with<00:06:20.790> for<00:06:21.120> quite<00:06:21.720> some

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
about and wrestling with for quite some

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.480 
about and wrestling with for quite some
time

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
time

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.070 
time
I<00:06:22.520> kind<00:06:22.699> of<00:06:22.729> want<00:06:22.940> to<00:06:23.090> reread<00:06:23.780> to<00:06:23.930> kill<00:06:24.050> a

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
I kind of want to reread to kill a

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.990 
I kind of want to reread to kill a
mockingbird<00:06:24.500> and<00:06:24.889> potentially<00:06:25.370> reread<00:06:25.729> this

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
mockingbird and potentially reread this

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.200 
mockingbird and potentially reread this
the<00:06:26.750> same<00:06:26.960> day<00:06:27.169> because<00:06:27.770> I<00:06:28.460> think<00:06:28.880> it's<00:06:29.030> just

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
the same day because I think it's just

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.499 
the same day because I think it's just
so<00:06:29.780> interesting<00:06:30.259> it<00:06:30.710> adds<00:06:30.949> such<00:06:31.280> a<00:06:31.310> new<00:06:32.060> and

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
so interesting it adds such a new and

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.110 
so interesting it adds such a new and
complicated<00:06:33.380> and<00:06:33.680> realistic<00:06:34.340> layer<00:06:34.639> to<00:06:34.940> those

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
complicated and realistic layer to those

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.520 
complicated and realistic layer to those
characters<00:06:35.569> that<00:06:35.599> I<00:06:35.750> think<00:06:36.139> I<00:06:36.289> actually

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
characters that I think I actually

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.100 
characters that I think I actually
really<00:06:37.039> liked<00:06:37.310> I<00:06:37.550> know<00:06:37.880> that<00:06:38.240> not<00:06:38.539> everyone<00:06:39.020> is

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
really liked I know that not everyone is

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.270 
really liked I know that not everyone is
gonna<00:06:39.259> feel<00:06:39.470> this<00:06:39.620> way<00:06:39.770> they're<00:06:39.949> gonna<00:06:40.069> be

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
gonna feel this way they're gonna be

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.189 
gonna feel this way they're gonna be
people<00:06:40.550> who<00:06:40.639> are<00:06:40.729> really<00:06:41.090> upset<00:06:41.389> that<00:06:41.419> their

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
people who are really upset that their

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.010 
people who are really upset that their
characters<00:06:42.830> were<00:06:43.039> ruined<00:06:43.550> but<00:06:43.849> I<00:06:43.880> do<00:06:44.020> like

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
characters were ruined but I do like

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.930 
characters were ruined but I do like
that's<00:06:45.380> about<00:06:45.770> had<00:06:46.220> to<00:06:46.370> wrestle<00:06:46.580> with<00:06:46.759> these

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
that's about had to wrestle with these
