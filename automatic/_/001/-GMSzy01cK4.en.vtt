middle lane right here your other hand

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.679 
middle lane right here your other hand
can<00:01:45.840> catch<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:47.340> moment<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.729> catch<00:01:47.969> it<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
can catch it the moment you catch it the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.080 
can catch it the moment you catch it the
hand<00:01:48.959> that<00:01:49.139> was<00:01:49.289> using<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.189> before<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.819> going<00:01:51.029> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
hand that was using a before is going to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.669 
hand that was using a before is going to
flick<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.389> in<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.569> air<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.929> give<00:01:52.469> it<00:01:52.590> the

flick it in the air and give it the

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.199 
flick it in the air and give it the
momentum<00:01:53.069> just<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.369> how<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.549> use<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:53.999> ribs

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
momentum just like how we use the ribs

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:55.669 
momentum just like how we use the ribs
you<00:01:54.329> remember<00:01:54.600> how<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.749> rips<00:01:55.079> flick<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.590> in

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
you remember how the rips flick it in

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.129 
you remember how the rips flick it in
the<00:01:55.799> air<00:01:55.889> like<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.359> well<00:01:57.359> this<00:01:57.509> time<00:01:57.840> I'm

00:01:58.129 --> 00:01:58.139 
the air like this well this time I'm

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.440 
the air like this well this time I'm
going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> grab<00:01:58.529> it<00:01:58.560> flick<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> air<00:01:59.450> I'm

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
going to grab it flick it in the air I'm

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.760 
going to grab it flick it in the air I'm
going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> use<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.049> as<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.289> momentum<00:02:01.709> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
going to use that as a momentum to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.410 
going to use that as a momentum to
create<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.130> other<00:02:02.219> figure<00:02:02.579> eight<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
create the other figure eight so the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.179 
create the other figure eight so the
right<00:02:03.599> hand<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.959> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.770> your<00:02:04.920> figure

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
right hand is going to do your figure

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.730 
right hand is going to do your figure
eight<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:05.490> kind<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.880> down<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.209> center

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
eight it's kind of going down the center

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.809 
eight it's kind of going down the center
running<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.829> grab<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.190> okay

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
running to grab it okay

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.180 
running to grab it okay
here's<00:02:09.630> what<00:02:09.840> it'll<00:02:10.020> look<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.200> right<00:02:10.530> here

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
here's what it'll look like right here

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.920 
here's what it'll look like right here
though<00:02:12.490> right<00:02:13.180> there<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:16.390> don't<00:02:16.660> want<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.840> get

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
though right there you don't want to get

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.240 
though right there you don't want to get
too<00:02:17.050> close<00:02:17.230> you're<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.800> hit<00:02:17.920> your<00:02:18.100> head

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
too close you're going to hit your head

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.670 
too close you're going to hit your head
this<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.610> why<00:02:18.880> we<00:02:19.030> use<00:02:19.060> foam<00:02:19.450> right<00:02:19.660> now<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.530> be

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
this is why we use foam right now so be

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.260 
this is why we use foam right now so be
sure<00:02:20.710> you<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.190> your<00:02:21.310> hand<00:02:21.520> extended<00:02:21.940> up<00:02:22.090> and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
sure you have your hand extended up and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.630 
sure you have your hand extended up and
feel<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.140> distance<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.160> need<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.460> be

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
feel the distance that you need to be

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.100 
feel the distance that you need to be
and<00:02:24.910> right<00:02:25.720> there

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
and right there

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.010 
and right there
um<00:02:26.290> again<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.550> best<00:02:27.730> way<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.880> practice<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.750> to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
um again the best way to practice is to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.200 
um again the best way to practice is to
simply<00:02:29.410> grab<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.190> do<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.790> over<00:02:30.880> again

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
simply grab it and do it over again

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.430 
simply grab it and do it over again
until<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.810> feel<00:02:31.960> really<00:02:32.290> comfortable

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
until you can feel really comfortable

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.280 
until you can feel really comfortable
reverse<00:02:33.010> figure<00:02:33.280> eight<00:02:33.550> grab<00:02:34.330> if<00:02:34.810> you're<00:02:35.170> not

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
reverse figure eight grab if you're not

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.740 
reverse figure eight grab if you're not
grabbing<00:02:35.590> right<00:02:36.310> or<00:02:36.550> just<00:02:36.760> bounces<00:02:37.120> off<00:02:37.300> oh<00:02:37.540> no

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
grabbing right or just bounces off oh no

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.210 
grabbing right or just bounces off oh no
just<00:02:38.140> keep<00:02:38.260> trying<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.650> until<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:38.980> can<00:02:39.100> get

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
just keep trying it until you can get

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.980 
just keep trying it until you can get
that<00:02:39.340> feel<00:02:39.550> right<00:02:39.940> here<00:02:40.060> if<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:40.690> don't<00:02:40.780> grab

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
that feel right here if you don't grab

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.540 
that feel right here if you don't grab
it<00:02:41.020> just<00:02:41.620> go<00:02:41.710> back<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.890> that<00:02:42.010> reverse<00:02:42.340> figure

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
it just go back to that reverse figure

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.460 
it just go back to that reverse figure
eight<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.120> do<00:02:43.270> it<00:02:43.390> again<00:02:43.510> till<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.020> can<00:02:44.260> grab

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
eight and do it again till you can grab

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.240 
eight and do it again till you can grab
it<00:02:45.000> once<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.150> grab<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:47.650> handy<00:02:48.160> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
it once you grab it this handy the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.040 
it once you grab it this handy the
outside<00:02:48.550> flings<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.150> up<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.840> then<00:02:49.930> you're

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
outside flings it up and then you're

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.000 
outside flings it up and then you're
doing<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.290> reverse<00:02:50.530> figure<00:02:50.830> eight<00:02:50.890> with<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
doing a reverse figure eight with the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.360 
doing a reverse figure eight with the
other<00:02:51.190> hand<00:02:52.530> again<00:02:53.530> once<00:02:53.800> we<00:02:53.920> come<00:02:54.070> towards

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
other hand again once we come towards

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.100 
other hand again once we come towards
the<00:02:54.430> center<00:02:54.850> we<00:02:55.450> wrap<00:02:55.630> other<00:02:56.470> hand<00:02:56.680> looks<00:02:58.110> grab

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
the center we wrap other hand looks grab

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.780 
the center we wrap other hand looks grab
flicks<00:03:00.570> wrap<00:03:01.570> please<00:03:02.050> wrap<00:03:02.640> eventually<00:03:03.640> what

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
flicks wrap please wrap eventually what

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.980 
flicks wrap please wrap eventually what
you'll<00:03:03.940> do<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.210> just<00:03:04.240> go<00:03:04.420> straight<00:03:04.810> in<00:03:04.900> one

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
you'll do is you just go straight in one

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:21.209 
you'll do is you just go straight in one
pattern<00:03:05.290> like<00:03:05.650> this

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:21.219 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:26.860 

so<00:03:22.219> now<00:03:22.480> do<00:03:23.480> this<00:03:24.219> over<00:03:25.219> up<00:03:25.400> over<00:03:25.819> up<00:03:26.030> over<00:03:26.659> up

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
so now do this over up over up over up

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.670 
so now do this over up over up over up

boom boom boom boom boom or we go here
yeah<00:03:36.609> this<00:03:37.609> centerline<00:03:38.090> grab<00:03:38.329> here<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.650> we're

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
yeah this centerline grab here so we're

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.289 
yeah this centerline grab here so we're
doing<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.250> reverse<00:03:40.519> figure<00:03:40.760> eights<00:03:41.000> again<00:03:41.269> I

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
doing the reverse figure eights again I

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.640 
doing the reverse figure eights again I
just<00:03:41.540> wanted<00:03:41.719> to<00:03:41.840> show<00:03:41.989> this<00:03:42.139> to<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.319> just<00:03:42.560> so

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
just wanted to show this to you just so

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.890 
just wanted to show this to you just so
you<00:03:42.739> know<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.970> can<00:03:44.150> omit<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.480> figure<00:03:44.750> Eight's

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
you know you can omit the figure Eight's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.960 
you know you can omit the figure Eight's
and<00:03:45.079> just<00:03:45.230> do<00:03:45.470> care<00:03:45.980> center<00:03:46.310> line<00:03:46.459> graphs<00:03:46.730> as

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
and just do care center line graphs as

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.259 
and just do care center line graphs as
well<00:03:47.049> straight<00:03:48.049> through<00:03:48.489> and<00:03:49.489> all<00:03:49.639> that<00:03:49.819> is<00:03:50.000> is

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
well straight through and all that is is

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.789 
well straight through and all that is is
the<00:03:50.750> hand<00:03:50.959> is<00:03:51.079> pushing<00:03:51.379> it<00:03:51.500> through<00:03:51.590> one

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
the hand is pushing it through one

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.770 
the hand is pushing it through one
revolution<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.669> catching<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.239> push<00:03:53.750> it

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
revolution and catching it push it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.349 
revolution and catching it push it
through<00:03:54.019> catch<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.859> hand<00:03:55.790> that's<00:03:55.879> in<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.150> back

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
through catch a hand that's in the back

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.020 
through catch a hand that's in the back
close<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.379> front<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:58.010> then<00:03:58.579> it<00:03:58.790> becomes

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
close to the front and then it becomes

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.530 
close to the front and then it becomes
the<00:03:59.209> launching<00:03:59.540> point<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.939> here<00:04:01.939> boom<00:04:04.540> now

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
the launching point so here boom now

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.149 
the launching point so here boom now
this<00:04:05.720> is<00:04:05.870> like<00:04:06.019> an<00:04:06.169> over-exaggeration<00:04:06.470> you're

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
this is like an over-exaggeration you're

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.789 
this is like an over-exaggeration you're
actually<00:04:07.430> only<00:04:07.489> giving<00:04:07.849> it<00:04:07.909> one<00:04:08.120> revolution

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
actually only giving it one revolution

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.549 
actually only giving it one revolution
is<00:04:09.799> slow<00:04:10.280> motion
