winder that was very forward-thinking as

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.790 
winder that was very forward-thinking as
a<00:00:19.699> very<00:00:19.910> nice<00:00:20.060> modern<00:00:20.570> design<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:21.320> getting

all sorts of different colors even a
soft<00:00:23.390> touch<00:00:23.600> colors<00:00:23.990> but<00:00:24.439> the<00:00:24.560> thing<00:00:24.710> that<00:00:24.740> was

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
soft touch colors but the thing that was

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.200 
soft touch colors but the thing that was
different<00:00:25.160> about<00:00:25.430> it<00:00:25.580> was<00:00:25.699> one<00:00:25.970> it's

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
different about it was one it's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.300 
different about it was one it's
battery-powered<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:27.199> two<00:00:27.800> it's<00:00:28.070> fully

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
battery-powered and two it's fully

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.250 
battery-powered and two it's fully
digitally<00:00:28.699> controlled<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.750> with<00:00:29.900> this<00:00:30.019> one

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
digitally controlled so with this one

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.750 
digitally controlled so with this one
they<00:00:30.410> basically<00:00:30.800> taken<00:00:31.250> their<00:00:31.369> original

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
they basically taken their original

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.250 
they basically taken their original
design<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.180> single<00:00:32.540> watch<00:00:32.689> winder<00:00:33.110> and

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
design the single watch winder and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.530 
design the single watch winder and
they've<00:00:33.680> adjusted<00:00:33.949> it<00:00:34.190> into<00:00:34.550> two<00:00:34.790> now<00:00:35.059> in<00:00:35.390> the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
they've adjusted it into two now in the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.470 
they've adjusted it into two now in the
back<00:00:35.719> here<00:00:36.160> see<00:00:37.160> on<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.370> bottom<00:00:37.550> that<00:00:38.300> this

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
back here see on the bottom that this

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.060 
back here see on the bottom that this
one<00:00:38.630> actually<00:00:38.809> has<00:00:39.110> a<00:00:39.380> battery<00:00:39.800> compartment

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
one actually has a battery compartment

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.650 
one actually has a battery compartment
as<00:00:40.489> well<00:00:40.520> so<00:00:40.850> this<00:00:40.969> is<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.180> battery-powered

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
as well so this is a battery-powered

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.250

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
before it actually asks for more power

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.450 
before it actually asks for more power
up<00:00:53.960> I've<00:00:54.379> gotten<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.680> up<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:54.860> about<00:00:55.039> two<00:00:55.250> weeks

up I've gotten it up to about two weeks

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.010 
up I've gotten it up to about two weeks
before<00:00:55.610> it<00:00:55.850> needs<00:00:55.940> power<00:00:56.210> on<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.510> on<00:00:56.750> a

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
before it needs power on a on a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.959 
before it needs power on a on a
basically<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.559> normal<00:00:57.739> system<00:00:58.100> that<00:00:58.340> runs<00:00:58.430> 650

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
basically a normal system that runs 650

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.880 
basically a normal system that runs 650
for<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.180> day<00:00:59.329> 650<00:00:59.899> turns<00:01:00.079> per<00:01:00.320> day<00:01:00.440> on<00:01:00.559> each<00:01:00.590> of

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
for a day 650 turns per day on each of

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.380 
for a day 650 turns per day on each of
these<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:01.550> it's<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.699> really<00:01:01.969> neat<00:01:02.120> system

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390

these so it's a really neat system
what's<00:01:02.989> really<00:01:04.030> cool<00:01:05.030> about<00:01:05.089> this<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.660> when

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780

the inside and they're white LEDs so it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.320 
the inside and they're white LEDs so it
it<00:01:12.830> brightens<00:01:13.490> up<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.760> inside<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.090> can<00:01:14.180> see

until<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.320> next<00:01:39.350> spin<00:01:40.310> happens<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.180> next

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
until the next spin happens so the next

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.390 
until the next spin happens so the next
turn<00:01:41.570> of<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.650> watch<00:01:42.829> happened<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:43.280> it's

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
turn of the watch happened so it's

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.520 
turn of the watch happened so it's
really<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.880> can<00:01:44.000> actually<00:01:44.150> see<00:01:44.570> actively

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
really you can actually see actively

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.410 
really you can actually see actively
what's<00:01:45.770> happening<00:01:46.189> with<00:01:46.310> your<00:01:46.460> system<00:01:46.850> when<00:01:47.390> I

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
what's happening with your system when I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.149 
what's happening with your system when I
touch<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.960> screen<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.560> go<00:01:48.829> into<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
touch the screen I go into the

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.160 
touch the screen I go into the
adjustment<00:01:49.640> mode<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.329> I<00:01:50.390> can<00:01:50.420> adjust<00:01:50.810> my<00:01:50.869> turns

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
adjustment mode so I can adjust my turns

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.889 
adjustment mode so I can adjust my turns
per<00:01:51.380> day<00:01:51.560> with<00:01:51.799> this<00:01:51.890> up<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.250> down<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.750> can

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
per day with this up and down and I can

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.960 
per day with this up and down and I can
adjust<00:01:53.990> my<00:01:54.409> right<00:01:54.619> side<00:01:54.890> independently<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.909> I

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
adjust my right side independently so I

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.249 
adjust my right side independently so I
can<00:01:56.090> have<00:01:56.240> two<00:01:56.329> different<00:01:56.360> watches<00:01:56.930> in<00:01:57.049> here

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
can have two different watches in here

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.050 
can have two different watches in here
and<00:01:57.409> run<00:01:57.799> them<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:58.070> two<00:01:58.189> different<00:01:58.340> ways

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
and run them in two different ways

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.819 
and run them in two different ways
you<00:01:59.420> have<00:01:59.509> your<00:01:59.659> which<00:02:00.500> way<00:02:00.649> you're<00:02:00.799> turning

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
you have your which way you're turning

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.270 
you have your which way you're turning

have your minutes till the next turn

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.480 
have your minutes till the next turn
once<00:02:06.079> you've<00:02:06.200> made<00:02:06.350> all<00:02:06.409> your<00:02:06.530> adjustments

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
once you've made all your adjustments

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.530 
once you've made all your adjustments
you<00:02:07.579> just<00:02:07.759> hit<00:02:07.850> okay<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.329> it<00:02:09.320> starts<00:02:10.209> so<00:02:11.209> very

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
cool when it goes into standby mode you

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.160 
cool when it goes into standby mode you
you<00:02:13.280> get<00:02:13.400> an<00:02:13.700> active<00:02:14.209> update<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.810> battery

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
you get an active update on the battery

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.500 
you get an active update on the battery
as<00:02:15.349> well<00:02:15.379> as<00:02:15.709> how<00:02:16.220> many<00:02:16.370> minutes<00:02:16.489> so<00:02:16.730> your<00:02:16.849> next

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
so it's a really nice device especially

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.250 
so it's a really nice device especially
if<00:02:19.460> you<00:02:19.550> have<00:02:19.700> two<00:02:19.910> different<00:02:20.090> watches<00:02:20.690> that

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
if you have two different watches that

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.440 
if you have two different watches that
most<00:02:21.980> watch<00:02:22.280> winders<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:23.000> only<00:02:23.240> adjust

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
most watch winders you can only adjust

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.610 
most watch winders you can only adjust
one<00:02:24.410> one<00:02:25.400> setting<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.030> both<00:02:26.240> spins<00:02:27.200> will

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
one one setting so both spins will

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.560 
one one setting so both spins will
actually<00:02:27.950> be<00:02:28.070> exactly<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.640> same<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:29.360> one's

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570

really<00:02:29.720> nice<00:02:29.870> because<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.140> can<00:02:30.260> adjust<00:02:30.350> both

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
really nice because you can adjust both

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.490 
really nice because you can adjust both
