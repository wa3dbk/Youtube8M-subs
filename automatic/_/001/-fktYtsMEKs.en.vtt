00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:32.610 
think on some of them they're even up to
90<00:02:23.440> numbers<00:02:30.540> when<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.570> first<00:02:31.870> saw<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.110> drawings

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
90 numbers when I first saw the drawings

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.699 
90 numbers when I first saw the drawings
I<00:02:32.800> went<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.100> visit<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.430> museum<00:02:33.940> in<00:02:34.060> 2009<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.470> I

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
I went to visit the museum in 2009 and I

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.199 
I went to visit the museum in 2009 and I
had<00:02:35.860> never<00:02:36.070> seen<00:02:36.340> anything<00:02:36.550> like<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:37.090> was

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
had never seen anything like it I was

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.470 
had never seen anything like it I was
utterly<00:02:37.450> amazed<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.050> size<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.709> color

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
utterly amazed the size the color

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.940 
utterly amazed the size the color
they're<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.720> strong<00:02:41.140> they're<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:41.560> powerful

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
they're so strong they're so powerful

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.580 
they're so strong they're so powerful
some<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.880> them<00:02:43.030> are<00:02:43.150> really<00:02:43.470> gentle<00:02:44.470> and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
some of them are really gentle and

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.610 
some of them are really gentle and
rhythmic<00:02:44.980> others<00:02:46.019> if<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.260> didn't<00:02:47.500> know<00:02:47.590> that

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
rhythmic others if I didn't know that

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.350 
rhythmic others if I didn't know that
they<00:02:47.890> were<00:02:47.950> Aboriginal<00:02:48.160> drawings<00:02:48.940> if<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.209> would

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
they were Aboriginal drawings if I would

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.380 
they were Aboriginal drawings if I would
have<00:02:49.510> no<00:02:49.690> idea<00:02:50.019> where<00:02:50.140> they<00:02:50.230> came<00:02:50.440> from

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.790 

the<00:02:55.390> works<00:02:55.600> are<00:02:55.780> actually<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.290> amazing

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
the works are actually in amazing

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.370 
the works are actually in amazing
condition<00:02:57.420> probably<00:02:58.420> partly<00:02:58.810> because<00:02:58.990> they

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
condition probably partly because they

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.290 
condition probably partly because they
have<00:02:59.650> been<00:02:59.920> they<00:03:00.220> were<00:03:00.280> rolled<00:03:00.580> for<00:03:00.820> 40<00:03:01.120> years

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
have been they were rolled for 40 years

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.240 
have been they were rolled for 40 years
and<00:03:01.720> then<00:03:01.960> we're<00:03:02.230> under<00:03:02.470> boards<00:03:02.770> for<00:03:02.950> 20<00:03:03.220> and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
and then we're under boards for 20 and

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.650 
and then we're under boards for 20 and
they<00:03:03.460> haven't<00:03:03.640> been<00:03:03.820> on<00:03:03.970> display<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.390> haven't

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
they haven't been on display and haven't

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.500 
they haven't been on display and haven't
been<00:03:04.690> accessed<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:07.090> approach<00:03:07.300> to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
been accessed the approach to

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.940 
been accessed the approach to
conservation<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.350> drawing<00:03:08.590> collection

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
conservation of the drawing collection

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.260 
conservation of the drawing collection
is<00:03:09.070> really<00:03:09.370> quite<00:03:09.730> simple

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
is really quite simple

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.010 
is really quite simple
we'll<00:03:10.870> be<00:03:11.050> repairing<00:03:11.710> edge<00:03:12.010> tears<00:03:13.020> unfolding

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
we'll be repairing edge tears unfolding

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.310 
we'll be repairing edge tears unfolding
corners<00:03:14.560> where<00:03:15.040> they've<00:03:15.340> been<00:03:16.140> folded<00:03:17.140> over

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
corners where they've been folded over

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.560 
corners where they've been folded over
through<00:03:17.530> storage<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.490> here<00:03:18.670> we<00:03:18.790> can<00:03:18.970> see<00:03:19.240> the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
through storage so here we can see the

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.900 
through storage so here we can see the
the<00:03:20.140> effect<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:20.860> paper<00:03:21.070> being<00:03:21.280> rolled<00:03:21.520> for

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
the effect of the paper being rolled for

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.840 
the effect of the paper being rolled for
around<00:03:22.330> 40<00:03:22.690> years<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.320> it's<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.370> actually

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
around 40 years and it's it actually

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.010 
around 40 years and it's it actually
kind<00:03:25.000> of<00:03:25.030> looks<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.240> bit<00:03:25.270> like<00:03:25.390> corrugated<00:03:25.960> iron

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
kind of looks a bit like corrugated iron

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.860 
kind of looks a bit like corrugated iron
doesn't<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.500> we<00:03:27.460> won't<00:03:27.610> be<00:03:27.760> trying<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.420> remove

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
doesn't it we won't be trying to remove

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.140 
doesn't it we won't be trying to remove
that<00:03:29.310> part<00:03:30.310> because<00:03:30.400> it's<00:03:30.670> such<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.850> massive

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
that part because it's such a massive

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.120 
that part because it's such a massive
task<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.990> whole<00:03:32.110> collection<00:03:32.440> but<00:03:33.040> also

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
task for the whole collection but also

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.860 
task for the whole collection but also
it<00:03:33.430> tells<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.760> story<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:34.270> another<00:03:34.450> part<00:03:34.750> of

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
it tells the story it's another part of

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:44.070 
it tells the story it's another part of
the<00:03:34.990> story<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.530> drawings<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:43.930> this

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
the story of the drawings and so this

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.230 
the story of the drawings and so this
drawing<00:03:44.320> shows<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:45.070> use<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.250> graphite<00:03:45.850> and

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
drawing shows the use of graphite and

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.600 
drawing shows the use of graphite and
how<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.660> certain<00:03:47.110> angles<00:03:47.530> it's<00:03:48.070> almost

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
how it certain angles it's almost

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.090 
how it certain angles it's almost
iridescent<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.360> glows<00:03:49.870> as<00:03:50.170> shimmers<00:03:50.560> it's

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
iridescent it glows as shimmers it's

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.530 
iridescent it glows as shimmers it's
really<00:03:51.340> quite<00:03:51.550> beautiful<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.360> know<00:03:52.480> you

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
really quite beautiful but you know you

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.990 
really quite beautiful but you know you
need<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.810> be<00:03:53.400> look<00:03:54.400> at<00:03:54.520> them<00:03:54.640> down<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:54.910> the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
need to be look at them down on the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.400 
need to be look at them down on the
ground<00:03:55.030> level<00:03:55.540> which<00:03:55.660> when<00:03:56.170> they<00:03:56.320> were

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
ground level which when they were

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.570 
ground level which when they were
drawing<00:03:56.650> them<00:03:56.980> they<00:03:57.160> would<00:03:57.310> have<00:03:57.340> actually

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
drawing them they would have actually

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.760 
drawing them they would have actually
got<00:03:58.240> that<00:03:58.420> effect<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:01.960> could<00:04:02.110> also<00:04:02.290> see

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
got that effect and you could also see

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.130 
got that effect and you could also see
they<00:04:02.920> used<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.190> pencil<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:03.880> this<00:04:04.720> pink

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
they used to pencil and this this pink

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.430 
they used to pencil and this this pink
appears<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.710> be<00:04:05.800> pencil<00:04:06.300> here<00:04:07.300> we<00:04:08.050> believe<00:04:08.320> the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
appears to be pencil here we believe the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.870 
appears to be pencil here we believe the
pencils<00:04:08.830> came<00:04:09.010> from<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.310> mission<00:04:09.580> school

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
pencils came from the mission school

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.180 
pencils came from the mission school
pencil<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:10.840> chalk<00:04:11.110> were<00:04:11.380> also<00:04:11.710> used<00:04:11.980> in<00:04:12.130> the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
pencil and chalk were also used in the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.190 
pencil and chalk were also used in the
drawings<00:04:12.670> I<00:04:12.940> think<00:04:13.480> I'm<00:04:13.540> really<00:04:13.900> looking

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
drawings I think I'm really looking

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.500 
drawings I think I'm really looking
forward<00:04:14.410> to<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:14.980> actually<00:04:15.760> seeing<00:04:16.210> the<00:04:16.359> whole
