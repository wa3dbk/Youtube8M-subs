thing is supposed to do is remove
something<00:01:49.409> called<00:01:49.680> bilirubin<00:01:50.090> from<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
something called bilirubin from the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.289 
something called bilirubin from the
blood<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.340> bilirubin<00:01:53.939> is

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
blood now this is just the bilirubin is

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.289 
blood now this is just the bilirubin is
a<00:01:54.390> byproduct<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.619> breaking<00:01:56.460> down<00:01:56.490> calories

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
a byproduct of breaking down calories

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.399 
a byproduct of breaking down calories
into<00:01:57.719> usable<00:01:58.320> energy<00:01:58.880> almost<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.180> smog<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
into usable energy almost like smog is a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.550 
into usable energy almost like smog is a
byproduct<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.369> burning<00:02:03.119> fossil<00:02:03.540> fuels<00:02:04.110> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
byproduct of burning fossil fuels to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.619 
byproduct of burning fossil fuels to
create<00:02:05.159> energy<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.390> move<00:02:06.540> automobiles

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
create energy and to move automobiles

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.350 
create energy and to move automobiles
now<00:02:09.629> bilirubin<00:02:10.289> gives<00:02:10.920> p<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.760> yellowish

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
now bilirubin gives p that yellowish

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.430 
now bilirubin gives p that yellowish
color<00:02:12.690> as<00:02:12.989> well

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
color as well

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
color as well
is<00:02:13.530> poop<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.130> brownish<00:02:15.000> color<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.280> liver

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
is poop that brownish color so the liver

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.600 
is poop that brownish color so the liver
doesn't<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:17.970> job<00:02:18.410> from<00:02:19.410> hepatitis<00:02:19.620> A<00:02:20.130> then

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
doesn't do is job from hepatitis A then

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.610 
doesn't do is job from hepatitis A then
too<00:02:20.880> much<00:02:21.060> bilirubin<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:22.170> build<00:02:22.410> up<00:02:22.530> in

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
too much bilirubin can build up in

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.280 
too much bilirubin can build up in
