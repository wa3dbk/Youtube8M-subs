00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.210
 in this video we will see how to adjust 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.100
 the positioning of the sections on 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.170
 traced using the form of 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.930
 road design by Leonardo Hicks 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.660
 and select the tracciolino e 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.029
 then we activate the command 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.570
 positioning sections in the first 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.790
 tab shown in the check box 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.410
 automatic positioning skills 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.230
 allows you to adjust the position of the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.130
 sections thanks to check boxes 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 below 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.590
 if it is not active as you can see none 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.269
 section will be determined on track a 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.460
 unless the 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.820
 manual positioning criteria such as 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.309
 we will see later then reactivate the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.170
 automatic positioning and fix the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.660
 position of the sections using the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.809
 check box debased sections up 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.969
 all the features once again 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.980
 the apply button allows to 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.640
 immediately observe the outcome of the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.950
 choice made we now activate also the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.350
 step positioning skill box 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.479
 constant and set the pace of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.070
 generation that may be different in 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.990
 function of the different areas of the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.610
 route 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.439
 we observe the outcome of our choices 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.210
 without abandoning the dialogue of 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.610
 insertion 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.950
 if we activate the checkbox 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.180
 variations in elevation 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.130
 the entry will be regulated by the value 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.259
 indicated in the minimum slope box 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.960
 as we can see after the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.520
 press the apply button while the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.070
 check box fittings 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.960
 altimetric if active causes 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.119
 inserting land sections into 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.090
 correspondence of the points of tangency of the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.860
 elevation connections to adjust the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.990
 width of the soil sections 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.229
 we insert the requested measures in the fields 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.880
 left width and right width 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.130
 after pressing the apply button 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.590
 we note the immediate adaptation of the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.030
 width of the ground sections after 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.100
 having seen how to adjust the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.289
 automatic positioning of the sections 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.149
 let's see how it is possible to fix the 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.640
 their position in a precise point of the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.250
 traced a long a specific trait 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.260
 street to make more effective and 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.090
 the example we activate the visualization 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.430
 of a reference element 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.540
 we return to the positioning menu 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.849
 sections by activating the manual card such as 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.830
 you see four buttons allow 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.080
 in order to determine the position 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.599
 of sections by progressive for 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.660
 open range coordinates of progressive or 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.430
 of coordinates wanting to insert a 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.890
 section at the element 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.580
 point pin enel we choose the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.950
 add button for coordinates we use 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.410
 then the tool pique and let's help each other 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.269
 with the snack to capture exactly the 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.760
 coordinates of the point where the section 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.910
 land will have to pass remaining 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.010
 orthogonal to the track at the click 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.440
 back in the positioning dialogue 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.629
 sections and we fix if necessary 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.200
 comment is the width of the section from 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.870
 generate then confirm in the box 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.040
 section list is now visible 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.950
 the positioning instruction of the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.720
 section at the coordinates entered on 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.700
 confirmation we can observe how the 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.099
 soil section is inserted so as to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.410
 go through the given point and like this one 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.450
 positioning is not affected in any way 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.380
 from any changes made to 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.840
 route 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.840
 being the section restricted only 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.760
 at a point independent of it 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.889
 back in the section positioning menu 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.599
 to see how to adjust the presence of 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.510
 sections too close together 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.340
 it is possible to set the distance 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.260
 minimum below which a 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.090
 automatic thinning mechanism 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.090
 as can be seen in our example 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.209
 let's see now another mode of 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.549
 determination of the position of 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.090
 section insertion by range of 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.340
 coordinates in this case is necessary 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.440
 fix on the track or near 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.150
 it two points that represent the 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.769
 end of an interval within the 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.739
 which can be determined? 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.109
 position of the sections is possible 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.180
 set a constant step insertion from 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.209
 indicate or to the default number 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.319
 as in our example 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.359
 we also set a width 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.709
 different for the length of the two sides 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.979
 and confirm 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.560
 as previously in the list box 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.449
 sections we observe the presence of a 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.669
 positioning instruction of 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.410
 sections according to the modalities just 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.780
 fixed 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.699
 and here is the result on which we see 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.229
 how to carry out some interventions 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.180
 beauty 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.400
 we return for this once again 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.490
 in the section positioning dialog e 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.949
 choose the graphics card the list 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.050
 drop down color section allows 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.819
 set the color of the notches used for 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.610
 represent all the sections of the 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.340
 traced with the options proposed in the 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.169
 position list adjusts the position 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.240
 of the text accompanying the section 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.550
 being able to choose between a position 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.699
 grazing at the axis or at the end 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.919
 of the attack with the color drop-down list 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.199
 text you can set a color for the 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.970
 text other than the one chosen for the 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.740
 notches 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.210
 given the extreme speed directing 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.460
 the action of the route offered by 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.349
 program let's give ourselves a few tries 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.319
 to determine the optimal size 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.330
 of the text thanks to the box of 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.000
 control draws the section line 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.830
 real we can finally get that 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.990
 notch length matches 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.530
 exactly to the real width of the 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.530
 section
