00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello dear viewers again 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.590
 my channel this time imagine 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.170
 your attention the vacuum cleaner is not the most 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.809
 old sample 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.940
 so the first would have been much harder without 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.320
 wheels 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.380
 the very first prototype in everything was called 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.670
 vacuum cleaner Moscow 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 surely there are people who know about 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.650
 such vacuum cleaners probably remained those 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.289
 who else used them 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:40.620
 subsequent modifications were already called 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:42.870
 Uralets is hard to see here next 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.450
 Multi- fikatsii already received wheels 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.270
 its thanks to why they became more 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.449
 so maneuverable 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.610
 another hose flange appeared with 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:57.719
 carvings were modern because on 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.230
 previous models were so turning 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.760
 how to explain it like snaps 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.650
 seemingly 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.350
 Well, if you get a vacuum cleaner such flanges 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.439
 Be sure to take a video review show 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.840
 to see what the difference is also 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.680
 more modern modification of the vacuum cleaner 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.720
 which top cover and pen already 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.810
 plastic decorative i.e. pen 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.320
 semi-circular is not so fixed here too 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.549
 Uralets last modification 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.740
 which I present to your attention 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:37.060
 You can say such an average that in it 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:45.880
 interesting 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:50.140
 firing pedal cap which 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.450
 closes I think the flange themselves are curious 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.080
 what does he have inside the filter 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.140
 behind bars you principle there 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.759
 urgently several times the gauze is we all 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.399
 equally 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.750
 shiver at least some filtering many 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.299
 Soviet vacuum cleaners generally issuing 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.420
 directly vacuuming then another flat 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:14.709
 for an hour the smell of dust stay here 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.600
 here you can put on an adapter for blowing 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.190
 connect the hose just like many 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.030
 means with its own can be separated 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:32.680
 spray flowers dye because 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:35.799
 much this model does not open 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.099
 has a coiling cord the way many 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.730
 Other Urals on such a device 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:46.660
 I didnâ€™t just put it 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.660
 may be connected here so as to make it cheaper 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.180
 design still some considerations but 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:58.120
 what is already unknown to us 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.540
 rear wheels quite large comfortable 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.459
 there is an attack when 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.730
 not connected to the fictional hole 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.489
 hose air goes here through these honeycombs 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.859
 lattice grating plastic on 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.989
 previous model even here these lattices and 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:19.120
 the ribs were iron let's see how 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.900
 dust collector latch such here 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.900
 metal 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.700
 here is his rather large separator 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:44.940
 interesting color for some reason on the streets 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:50.280
 a lot of motley flowers used here 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:52.560
 he filter cone bag on did it under 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.750
 the cone is interesting by the way I want to notice 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.890
 flyanets 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.380
 the specified dust collector is removed very 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.739
 it is easy to unscrew it before the nut 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:06.350
 and the flange is taken out of all locking 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:09.680
 rings and other ores 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.680
 put in place 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:23.120
 we do not conveniently do by hand 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.120
 eat 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.750
 works quietly 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.180
 obvious 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.180
 intrusive 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.690
 I will go out and barely feel 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.690
 air flow 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.170
 Here, in principle, here is a video review 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.480
 unpretentious like that showed that as if 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.490
 will appear older or newer 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.300
 Models will definitely shoot 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.360
 compare show if what is interesting 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.560
 ask about say the senate will 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:12.070
 I make it out to show what's inside that's all 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.460
 good and up to the new video clips to 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.460
 dating
