00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
so quick and I'm so excited about quick

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.140 
so quick and I'm so excited about quick
you<00:00:12.570> know<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:13.049> kicked<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.349> off<00:00:13.469> at<00:00:13.679> light

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
you know we kicked it off at light

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.070 
you know we kicked it off at light
basically<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> idea<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.540> light<00:00:15.690> light<00:00:15.900> makes

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
basically the idea of light light makes

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.320 
basically the idea of light light makes
every<00:00:16.410> step<00:00:16.440> better<00:00:16.980> write<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.730> makes<00:00:18.060> every

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
every step better write it makes every

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.750 
every step better write it makes every
step<00:00:18.359> more<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.840> higher<00:00:19.590> performance<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.279> then

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
step more a higher performance and then

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.480 
step more a higher performance and then
here<00:00:21.090> with<00:00:21.330> quickness<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
here with quickness it's that that is it

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.730 
here with quickness it's that that is it
focuses<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.449> step<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.109> quickness

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
focuses in on that step that quickness

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
focuses in on that step that quickness
that<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.460> time<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.000> make<00:00:27.150> space<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
that that time that you make space and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.950 
that that time that you make space and
that<00:00:28.289> you're<00:00:28.439> able<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:29.570> get<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> crowd<00:00:30.929> on

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that you're able to get the crowd on

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.990 
that you're able to get the crowd on
your<00:00:31.289> side<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.650> well<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.850> know<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
your side as well because you know I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.400 
your side as well because you know I
think<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.450> idea<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.780> quickness<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.200> pretty

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
think the idea of quickness is pretty

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.780 
think the idea of quickness is pretty
understood<00:00:34.829> when<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.160> hear<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> crowd<00:00:35.640> go

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
understood when you hear the crowd go

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.360 
understood when you hear the crowd go
ooh<00:00:35.969> quickness<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.170> happened<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.890> know<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
ooh quickness just happened you know and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.720 
ooh quickness just happened you know and
so<00:00:38.640> that's<00:00:39.020> really<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.530> goal<00:00:40.770> was<00:00:40.800> with

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so that's really what the goal was with

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.380 
so that's really what the goal was with
the<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.210> quickness<00:00:42.559> benefit<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.879> to<00:00:44.879> maximize

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the the quickness benefit is to maximize

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.720 
the the quickness benefit is to maximize
that<00:00:45.690> idea<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.680> making<00:00:46.860> space<00:00:47.129> making

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that idea of making space making

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.240 
that idea of making space making
somebody<00:00:48.030> miss<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> way<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.070> did

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
somebody miss and the way that we did

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.880 
somebody miss and the way that we did
that<00:00:50.430> was<00:00:50.670> by<00:00:51.230> completely<00:00:52.230> looking<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
that was by completely looking at the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.049 
that was by completely looking at the
entire<00:00:53.719> you<00:00:54.719> know<00:00:54.840> action<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.820> foot<00:00:56.820> coming

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
entire you know action of foot coming

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
entire you know action of foot coming
down<00:00:57.300> contacting<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> ground<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.890> then

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
down contacting the ground and then

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.760 
down contacting the ground and then
coming<00:00:59.430> back<00:00:59.460> up<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.289> starts<00:01:01.680> from

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
coming back up and so it all starts from

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.490 
coming back up and so it all starts from
the<00:01:01.890> bottom<00:01:02.570> one<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> keys<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:03.989> quickness

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the bottom one of the keys to quickness

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.340 
the bottom one of the keys to quickness
distractions<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.460> you'll<00:01:05.489> notice<00:01:06.290> now<00:01:07.290> we

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
distractions so you'll notice now we

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.440 
distractions so you'll notice now we
have<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.880> you've<00:01:09.060> heard<00:01:09.330> all<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
have the if you've heard all that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
have the if you've heard all that
squeaking<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> crazy<00:01:10.380> light<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.890> we've

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
squeaking from the crazy light one we've

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.980 
squeaking from the crazy light one we've
got<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.549> traction<00:01:11.909> back<00:01:12.360> into<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> crazy

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
got that traction back into the crazy

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.859 
got that traction back into the crazy
quick<00:01:13.820> next<00:01:14.820> step<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> fact<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.689> it's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
quick next step is the fact that it's

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.840 
quick next step is the fact that it's
all<00:01:16.049> decoupled<00:01:16.650> completely<00:01:17.400> broken<00:01:17.610> up

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
all decoupled completely broken up

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
all decoupled completely broken up
that's<00:01:18.330> critical<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> same<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.890> know<00:01:20.009> if

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
that's critical the same way you know if

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.520 
that's critical the same way you know if
you<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.270> doesn't<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.259> one

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you if it doesn't if it's just one one

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.289 
you if it doesn't if it's just one one
large<00:01:22.740> piece<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.189> can't<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.520> expand<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
large piece it can't really expand it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.880 
large piece it can't really expand it
it's<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> ground<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> pods

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
it's the ground but because all the pods

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.320 
it's the ground but because all the pods
are<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.340> Independence<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:26.970> finishing

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
are like Independence is finishing

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
are like Independence is finishing
moving<00:01:27.540> separately<00:01:27.979> they're<00:01:28.979> able<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.250> grab

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
moving separately they're able to grab

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
moving separately they're able to grab
and<00:01:29.909> actually<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.240> more<00:01:30.810> traction<00:01:31.140> because

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and actually have more traction because

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.380 
and actually have more traction because
it's<00:01:31.770> grabbing<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> ground<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.119> it's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it's grabbing more of the ground as it's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.719 
it's grabbing more of the ground as it's
aligning<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.200> take<00:01:34.409> off<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.549> that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
aligning to take off and and do that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.899 
aligning to take off and and do that
next<00:01:35.880> move<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> cues

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
next move you can see some of the cues

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.310 
next move you can see some of the cues
of<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.509> wrapping<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:39.990> starting<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> get

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
of you know wrapping is starting to get

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.810 
of you know wrapping is starting to get
a<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:40.470> bit<00:01:40.650> more<00:01:40.770> 3d<00:01:41.220> taking<00:01:41.670> some

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
a little bit more 3d taking some

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.280 
a little bit more 3d taking some
learnings<00:01:42.180> from<00:01:42.360> some<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.840> stuff<00:01:43.049> from

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
learnings from some of this stuff from

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.490 
learnings from some of this stuff from
you<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> 90s<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.229> things<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.409> were

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you know the 90s and things that we were

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.770 
you know the 90s and things that we were
doing<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.920> feet<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.970> wear<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.540> pure

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
doing with feet you wear and with pure

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.980 
doing with feet you wear and with pure
motion<00:01:49.700> what's<00:01:50.700> controlling<00:01:51.329> all<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.659> this

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
motion what's controlling all of this

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.210 
motion what's controlling all of this
what's<00:01:52.229> orchestrating<00:01:52.770> all<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.009> movement

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
what's orchestrating all this movement

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
what's orchestrating all this movement
is<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.640> sprint<00:01:53.909> frame<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:55.110> one's<00:01:55.290> actually

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
is this sprint frame this one's actually

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.550 
is this sprint frame this one's actually
been<00:01:55.710> enlarged<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.030> extended<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.380> just

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
been enlarged it is extended and it just

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.749 
been enlarged it is extended and it just
makes<00:01:58.710> sense<00:01:58.890> if<00:01:59.100> you're<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> decouple

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
makes sense if you're going to decouple

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.980 
makes sense if you're going to decouple
the<00:02:00.030> bottom<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:00.780> able<00:02:00.840> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the bottom and it's going to be able to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.179 
the bottom and it's going to be able to
move<00:02:01.079> independently<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.799> got<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.100> have

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
move independently you got to have

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.590 
move independently you got to have
something<00:02:02.460> that's<00:02:02.729> orchestrating<00:02:03.299> all<00:02:03.420> that

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
something that's orchestrating all that

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.060 
something that's orchestrating all that
movement<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> sprint

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
movement and that's what the sprint

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.010 
movement and that's what the sprint
frame<00:02:05.250> does<00:02:05.490> brought<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> little<00:02:06.570> shine<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
frame does brought a little shine to it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.460 
frame does brought a little shine to it
as<00:02:07.229> well<00:02:07.340> just<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.459> make<00:02:08.640> sure<00:02:09.140> when<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.289> gets

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
as well just to make sure when this gets

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.610 
as well just to make sure when this gets
on<00:02:10.679> court<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.849> see<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.540> nice<00:02:12.810> pop<00:02:13.110> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
on court you see this nice pop and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.809 
on court you see this nice pop and
to<00:02:13.799> call<00:02:14.400> attention<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.000> shoe<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:17.760> is

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
to call attention to the shoe this is

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.940 
to call attention to the shoe this is
the<00:02:18.150> first<00:02:18.420> time<00:02:18.629> that<00:02:18.690> we've<00:02:18.989> ever<00:02:19.110> had<00:02:19.379> text

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
the first time that we've ever had text

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.970 
the first time that we've ever had text
fit<00:02:20.099> in<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.150> upper<00:02:21.420> for<00:02:21.750> basketball<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.409> this

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
fit in the upper for basketball and this

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.410 
fit in the upper for basketball and this
is<00:02:23.099> something<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.760> across<00:02:23.970> all<00:02:24.299> the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
is something that you see across all the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.300 
is something that you see across all the
crazy<00:02:24.629> quick<00:02:24.870> products<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:26.129> it's

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
crazy quick products and really it's

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.309 
crazy quick products and really it's
this<00:02:26.459> idea<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.060> red<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.510> stretch<00:02:27.930> base

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
this idea the red is the stretch base

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.160 
this idea the red is the stretch base
and<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.190> shoe<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.580> able<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:30.030> move<00:02:30.329> and<00:02:30.959> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
and so the shoe is able to move and you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.809 
and so the shoe is able to move and you
know<00:02:31.260> unrestricted<00:02:31.920> motion<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.519> areas

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
know unrestricted motion and the areas

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.759 
know unrestricted motion and the areas
that<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:33.060> need<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.329> but<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.409> this

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
that you need it but then this this

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.420 
that you need it but then this this
print<00:02:35.129> is<00:02:35.360> helping<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.510> control<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.260> lot<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
print is helping to control a lot of the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.500 
print is helping to control a lot of the
movement<00:02:39.180> where<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.420> don't<00:02:39.599> need<00:02:39.860> as<00:02:40.860> much

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
movement where you don't need as much

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.170 
movement where you don't need as much
motion<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.260> dense<00:02:43.440> area<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:43.860> equal

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
motion so the dense area is equal

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.349 
motion so the dense area is equal
control<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.690> more<00:02:46.170> exposed<00:02:46.500> base<00:02:47.359> equals

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
control and the more exposed base equals

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.210 
control and the more exposed base equals
that<00:02:48.739> allows<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.769> little<00:02:50.040> bit<00:02:50.129> more

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
that allows a little bit more

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.740 
that allows a little bit more
breathability<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.849> allows<00:02:51.120> for<00:02:51.299> more<00:02:51.420> motion

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
breathability and allows for more motion

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.890 
breathability and allows for more motion
what<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.950> at<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.579> end<00:02:53.810> there's<00:02:54.810> a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
what I like is that at the end there's a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.240 
what I like is that at the end there's a
lot<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.079> components<00:02:55.410> but<00:02:55.650> what<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.920> get<00:02:56.099> is

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
lot of components but what you get is

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.920 
lot of components but what you get is
this<00:02:56.430> new<00:02:56.640> skin<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.269> almost<00:02:57.450> like<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.750> perm

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
this new skin is almost like the perm

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.860 
this new skin is almost like the perm
and<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.560> new<00:02:58.709> skin<00:02:59.129> of<00:02:59.340> performance<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.090> that

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
and the new skin of performance and that

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
and the new skin of performance and that
you<00:03:00.959> get<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.200> see<00:03:01.349> across<00:03:01.560> multiple

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
you get to see across multiple

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.220 
you get to see across multiple
categories<00:03:03.290> there's<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.379> lot<00:03:04.409> going<00:03:04.680> on<00:03:05.159> that's

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
categories there's a lot going on that's

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.080 
categories there's a lot going on that's
just<00:03:07.230> below<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.739> surface<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.790> know<00:03:08.879> these

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
just below the surface so you know these

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.250 
just below the surface so you know these
weddings<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.599> you<00:03:09.720> see<00:03:09.870> they<00:03:10.049> all<00:03:10.230> go

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
weddings that you see they all go

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.319 
weddings that you see they all go
straight<00:03:10.470> down<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.310> platform<00:03:11.790> similar<00:03:12.239> to

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
straight down to the platform similar to

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.000 
straight down to the platform similar to
some<00:03:12.629> of<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.750> conversations<00:03:12.930> on<00:03:13.440> crazy<00:03:13.799> like

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
some of the conversations on crazy like

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.309 
some of the conversations on crazy like
one<00:03:14.220> how<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.909> know<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.090> take<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.450> web<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.230> go

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
one how you know you take the web and go

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.839 
one how you know you take the web and go
straight<00:03:16.530> down<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.980> platform<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.519> control

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
straight down to the platform to control

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.670 
straight down to the platform to control
those<00:03:18.030> movements<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:19.019> got<00:03:19.169> the<00:03:19.290> same<00:03:19.410> thing

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
those movements you got the same thing

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.319 
those movements you got the same thing
going<00:03:19.919> on<00:03:20.040> here<00:03:20.099> where<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.579> wedding<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.970> going

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
going on here where the wedding is going

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.960 
going on here where the wedding is going
in<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:22.109> kind<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.489> orientation<00:03:23.489> all<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.880> way

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
in this kind of orientation all the way

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.150 
in this kind of orientation all the way
down<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.450> what<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.349> like<00:03:25.500> about<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.889> is<00:03:25.950> you
