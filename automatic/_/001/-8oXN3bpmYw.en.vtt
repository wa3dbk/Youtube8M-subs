00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
was at that point that we started

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.530 
was at that point that we started
talking<00:00:29.550> sustained<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:30.000> starting<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> food

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
walk and how they can support us and the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.729 
walk and how they can support us and the
benefits<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> food<00:00:33.900> co-op<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:34.650> that

we<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.040> bring<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.340> through<00:00:35.489> very<00:00:35.699> cheaply<00:00:35.940> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
we can bring in through very cheaply to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.119 
we can bring in through very cheaply to
students<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:37.230> even<00:00:37.320> more<00:00:37.559> importantly<00:00:37.980> we

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
students but even more importantly we

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.310 
students but even more importantly we
can<00:00:38.280> build<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:39.000> community<00:00:39.360> around<00:00:39.629> food<00:00:40.080> which

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
can build a community around food which

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.650 
can build a community around food which
is<00:00:40.650> what<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.120> would<00:00:42.269> like<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.540> achieve

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
is what we really would like to achieve

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.509 
is what we really would like to achieve
I'm<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.680> getting<00:00:43.830> people<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> think<00:00:44.280> about

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
I'm just getting people to think about

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:45.680 
I'm just getting people to think about
their<00:00:44.699> food<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.879> where<00:00:45.150> it<00:00:45.239> comes<00:00:45.360> from<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
their food and where it comes from and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.119 
their food and where it comes from and
how<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.989> interacts<00:00:46.320> their<00:00:46.559> lives<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:47.010> how

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
how it interacts their lives and how

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.120 
how it interacts their lives and how
they<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.460> actually<00:00:47.580> bring<00:00:47.850> people<00:00:48.210> together

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
they can actually bring people together

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.590 
they can actually bring people together
we<00:00:50.130> asked<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.399> about<00:00:50.700> an<00:00:50.850> hour's<00:00:51.210> worth<00:00:51.450> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
we asked for about an hour's worth of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.479 
we asked for about an hour's worth of
volunteering<00:00:52.050> each<00:00:52.320> month<00:00:52.559> more<00:00:52.800> volunteers

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
and that could be tasks from helping us

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.580 
and that could be tasks from helping us

we<00:01:45.800> also<00:01:45.950> don't<00:01:46.100> want<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.490> make<00:01:46.550> any<00:01:46.730> profit<00:01:46.910> on

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
we also don't want to make any profit on

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.700 
we also don't want to make any profit on
it<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:47.600> one<00:01:47.930> of<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.110> big<00:01:48.140> things<00:01:48.350> for<00:01:48.590> us

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
it and so one of the big things for us

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.460 
it and so one of the big things for us
that<00:01:49.330> we<00:01:50.330> know<00:01:50.480> we<00:01:50.660> keep<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.050> prices<00:01:51.260> as

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
that we know we keep the prices as

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.600 
that we know we keep the prices as
possible<00:01:51.800> because<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.100> know<00:01:52.190> that<00:01:52.340> students

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
possible because you know that students

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.840 
possible because you know that students
need<00:01:52.730> to<00:01:52.880> have<00:01:53.000> those<00:01:53.150> prices<00:01:53.360> low<00:01:54.700> one<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.790> the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
need to have those prices low one of the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.280 
need to have those prices low one of the
benefits<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.270> we've<00:01:56.480> seen<00:01:56.690> is<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:56.960> people

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
benefits that we've seen is that people

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.630 
benefits that we've seen is that people
who<00:01:57.470> are<00:01:57.560> brought<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.920> by<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.100> cheap<00:01:58.370> prices

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
who are brought in by the cheap prices

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.969 
who are brought in by the cheap prices
that<00:01:58.910> were<00:01:59.000> able<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.300> offer<00:01:59.590> also<00:02:00.590> learn<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.770> lot

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
that were able to offer also learn a lot

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
local food and that's something that we

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
were on campus on Tuesdays really

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.520 
were on campus on Tuesdays really
convenient<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.450> means<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.900> there's<00:02:32.080> always

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
convenient it means that there's always

convenient it means that there's always
people<00:02:32.920> around<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.490> there's<00:02:33.790> always<00:02:34.060> people

people around and there's always people
looking<00:02:34.750> for<00:02:35.020> cheaper<00:02:35.620> sources<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.100> food

looking for cheaper sources of food
don't<00:02:37.720> necessarily<00:02:38.290> have<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.530> be<00:02:39.660> interested

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
don't necessarily have to be interested

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.840 
don't necessarily have to be interested
in<00:02:40.810> their<00:02:41.020> ethics<00:02:41.500> behind<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.070> more<00:02:42.430> gravity

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
in their ethics behind the more gravity

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.120 
in their ethics behind the more gravity
for<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.450> no<00:02:43.930> packaging<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:44.740> more

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
for the no packaging it's more

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.060 
for the no packaging it's more
convenient<00:02:45.700> for<00:02:45.940> them<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:47.230> people<00:02:47.620> who

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
convenient for them and but people who

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.840 
convenient for them and but people who
are<00:02:48.280> interested<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.300> want<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.540> support<00:02:49.720> us<00:02:50.850> so

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
are interested and want to support us so

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.660 
are interested and want to support us so
I<00:02:52.540> think<00:02:52.750> feedlots<00:02:53.440> provide<00:02:53.890> really<00:02:54.250> cheap

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
I think feedlots provide really cheap

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.120 
I think feedlots provide really cheap
and<00:02:54.850> healthy<00:02:55.440> alternative<00:02:56.440> for<00:02:56.590> students

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
and healthy alternative for students

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.650 
and healthy alternative for students
which<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.460> something<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.790> they<00:02:58.480> probably

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
which is something that they probably

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.870 
which is something that they probably
want<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.230> do<00:02:59.410> but<00:02:59.740> find<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.460> quite<00:03:00.580> difficult

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
want to do but find it quite difficult

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.570 
want to do but find it quite difficult
to<00:03:01.210> access<00:03:01.330> that<00:03:01.690> sheet<00:03:01.960> Palpatine's<00:03:02.620> yeah<00:03:03.250> I

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
to access that sheet Palpatine's yeah I

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.550 
to access that sheet Palpatine's yeah I
also<00:03:04.000> shows<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.540> students<00:03:05.200> are<00:03:05.320> really

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
also shows that students are really

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.350 
also shows that students are really
proactive<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.370> really<00:03:06.520> happy<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.240> volunteer

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
and happy to do things that make changes

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.410 
and happy to do things that make changes
and<00:03:10.540> differences<00:03:10.960> or<00:03:11.140> positive<00:03:11.830> experience

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
and differences or positive experience

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.880 
and differences or positive experience
it's<00:03:13.420> always<00:03:13.600> good<00:03:13.750> just<00:03:13.780> walk<00:03:14.050> small<00:03:14.500> to

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
it's always good just walk small to

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.200 
it's always good just walk small to
figure<00:03:15.280> out<00:03:15.400> they<00:03:15.490> can<00:03:15.640> also<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.940> food<00:03:16.090> is

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
figure out they can also the food is

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.650 
figure out they can also the food is
really<00:03:16.300> good

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
really good

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.900 
really good
I<00:03:17.750> think<00:03:18.350> that's<00:03:18.470> basically<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:19.310> love<00:03:19.790> it

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
I think that's basically it I love it

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.300 
I think that's basically it I love it
it's<00:03:20.060> organic<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:20.930> it's<00:03:21.050> cheap<00:03:21.320> looking<00:03:22.040> able

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.550 
it's organic and it's cheap looking able

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
to write hopefully status you know from

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.700 
to write hopefully status you know from
