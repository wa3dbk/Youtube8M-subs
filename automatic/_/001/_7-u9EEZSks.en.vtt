00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.570
 in the first peaceful morning on vanikoro 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.330
 we finally got out the little hydroplane the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.379
 first mission is last antoine 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.090
 and so it's going to be a test because 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.140
 that anonye is among the most balÃ¨ze 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.150
 of the expedition 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.519
 so if I fly with antoine I think 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.430
 that everyone is reassured about the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.590
 antoine de biron's abilities who 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.270
 supervise this tedious work 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:39.420
 prepare a flight of locating the children 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 already own the seaplane we are going 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.660
 go check more places 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.410
 it's a little bit in the mountains 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.329
 difficult to access by foot and its 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.480
 tracking even hacker gps it does not work 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.480
 always 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.550
 on the shore in the straw village or 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.550
 the first flight looks like events 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.729
 no 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.400
 we 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.260
 antoine fly over the island looking 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.480
 of a 10 of cairns mounds 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.960
 that oral traditions attribute to 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.570
 survivors of the sinking 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.370
 the seaplane saves time 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.620
 went to see a place where there was 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.450
 a big mound train near an area where 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.160
 they will discover a theater near a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.800
 area where shipwrecked people were arriving 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.570
 to laugh at people and noria flights 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.570
 the small seaplane is just beginning
