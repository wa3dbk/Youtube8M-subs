00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
with the problem um actually not very

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.349 
with the problem um actually not very
well<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.010> don't<00:03:10.340> think<00:03:10.549> any<00:03:10.670> Airport<00:03:11.150> deals

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.330 
well but I don't think any Airport deals
very<00:03:11.510> well<00:03:11.780> with<00:03:11.959> these<00:03:12.109> problems<00:03:12.350> as<00:03:13.100> we've

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
very well with these problems as we've

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.270 
very well with these problems as we've
seen<00:03:13.519> across<00:03:13.970> Europe<00:03:14.359> I<00:03:14.900> mean<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.769> think<00:03:16.130> it's

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
seen across Europe I mean I think it's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.910 
seen across Europe I mean I think it's
just<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.549> lack<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.730> information<00:03:17.060> as<00:03:17.510> always<00:03:17.959> the
