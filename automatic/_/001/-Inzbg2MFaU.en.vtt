00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
here's a set with an I review it's 8400

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.750 
here's a set with an I review it's 8400
-<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.090> sports<00:01:42.390> car<00:01:42.750> there's<00:01:43.290> 68<00:01:43.800> pieces<00:01:44.040> I

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
- it's a sports car there's 68 pieces I

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.060 
- it's a sports car there's 68 pieces I
think<00:01:45.480> my<00:01:45.660> favorite<00:01:46.050> part<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.530> whole<00:01:46.710> kit

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
think my favorite part of the whole kit

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.190 
think my favorite part of the whole kit
is<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.610> tree<00:01:48.000> itself<00:01:48.360> because<00:01:48.750> they're<00:01:48.990> hard

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
is the tree itself because they're hard

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.180 
is the tree itself because they're hard
to<00:01:49.260> find

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
to find

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.950 
to find
even<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.730> pickup<00:01:51.090> rec<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.390> only<00:01:51.510> have<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
even on pickup rec they only have the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.080 
even on pickup rec they only have the
pine<00:01:52.200> trees<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.830> these<00:01:53.310> little<00:01:53.490> fruit<00:01:53.790> trees

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
pine trees so these little fruit trees

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.310 
pine trees so these little fruit trees
they're<00:01:54.300> really<00:01:54.450> hard<00:01:54.660> to<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:54.930> unless<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
they're really hard to get unless you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.420 
they're really hard to get unless you
get<00:01:55.440> them<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.740> brick<00:01:55.980> link<00:01:56.220> or<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.970> this<00:01:57.210> set

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
get them on brick link or in this set

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.950 
get them on brick link or in this set
okay<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.670> will<00:01:59.760> open<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.150> up<00:02:00.270> there's<00:02:00.630> our

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
okay so we will open it up there's our

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.120 
okay so we will open it up there's our
tree<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:03.210> there's<00:02:03.930> one<00:02:04.140> bigger<00:02:04.410> parts

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:18.620 

smaller<00:02:08.130> parts<00:02:10.490> car<00:02:11.490> base<00:02:13.400> instructions<00:02:17.630> okay

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
smaller parts car base instructions okay

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.480 
smaller parts car base instructions okay
and<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.550> carts<00:02:20.880> layout<00:02:22.280> just<00:02:23.280> give

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
and here is the carts layout just give

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.570 
and here is the carts layout just give
you<00:02:23.700> some<00:02:23.910> idea<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.660> parts<00:02:25.580> they're

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
you some idea of the parts they're

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.850 
you some idea of the parts they're
actually<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.240> set<00:02:27.510> but<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.440> do<00:02:28.500> want<00:02:28.709> to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
actually in the set but I do want to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.040 
actually in the set but I do want to
sort<00:02:28.980> my<00:02:29.130> parts<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.520> sometimes<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.240> just<00:02:30.450> snap<00:02:31.020> a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
sort my parts so sometimes I just snap a

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.030 
sort my parts so sometimes I just snap a
couple<00:02:31.320> them<00:02:31.560> together

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
couple them together

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.140 
couple them together
it's<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:32.820> unit<00:02:33.150> they're<00:02:33.330> just<00:02:33.510> 1<00:02:33.660> by<00:02:33.840> 4<00:02:35.150> plate

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
it's one unit they're just 1 by 4 plate

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.420 
it's one unit they're just 1 by 4 plate
then<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.570> just<00:02:36.750> come<00:02:37.740> together<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.190> don't

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
then I just come together so I don't

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.600 
then I just come together so I don't
lose<00:02:38.580> them<00:02:38.760> as<00:02:38.910> I'm<00:02:39.120> building<00:02:40.430> some<00:02:41.430> wheel

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
lose them as I'm building some wheel

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.860 
lose them as I'm building some wheel
