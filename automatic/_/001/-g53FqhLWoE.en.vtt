00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.929
 hi girls this time i would 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.110
 show the graphics in the enamels 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.300
 of the aifo therefore it must be said that while for 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.460
 other disposing of graphics was sufficient 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.250
 and polish columbia perfectly with 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.710
 a polishing soul and for these enamels e 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.329
 really almost essential to use theirs 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.339
 specific basis we say and why in 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.519
 indeed I made several attempts but 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:40.620
 we say that the effect is badly exposed 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:52.370
 actually gets using this 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:52.370
 this base is the basic water base 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.550
 and alternatively if you also have the base 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.050
 for them graphic gauche of the item goes 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.030
 very good also the perfect one too 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.220
 that's what ours is now 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:23.070
 colors therefore this is the first and of the 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:30.810
 silver number 61 own the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.810
 this is classic silver 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.000
 very strong effect and indeed these 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.150
 were three first holographic glazes 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.150
 to have a noticeable effect 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:55.630
 this is eleven year old number 62 that we say 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:04.250
 yes we say a no de rosa core arm 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.410
 in short it then depends on the light 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.410
 of the sun of the artificial one 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.290
 then this is the of the number 63 that 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.290
 let's try classic pink 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.049
 this 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.360
 That's why a little darker than a 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.069
 violets let's say it's a bit darker 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.069
 of the other and the number 64 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:02.760
 this then there is this that instead the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.760
 number 65 is a beautiful heavenly 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.760
 Here they are 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:26.100
 how to glaze with a touch you know there is 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.240
 loses some of their effect 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.820
 on the other hand, don't wear a top coat e 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.590
 not too hard so maybe 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.990
 it's better to put a top coat after the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.820
 second hand and then maybe give us one 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.400
 third coat once it is dried 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:46.530
 touch to have again 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:55.130
 the effect we say a lot the graph in 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:55.130
 last number 66 that garden 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.120
 perfect 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.370
 and don't think of anything else to come and there 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.629
 greeting 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.629
 next time bye
