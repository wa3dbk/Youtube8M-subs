00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
had any leak and they usually come with

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.220 
had any leak and they usually come with
this<00:00:38.610> kind<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.030> ugly<00:00:40.969> guard<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:42.480> doesn't

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
this kind of ugly guard up here doesn't

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.440 
this kind of ugly guard up here doesn't
look<00:00:43.260> very<00:00:43.350> nice<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.940> actually<00:00:45.120> kick

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
look very nice you can actually kick

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.270 
look very nice you can actually kick
that<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.559> doesn't<00:00:46.590> support<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that off because it doesn't support the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.170 
that off because it doesn't support the
aquarium<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.789> any<00:00:47.969> way<00:00:49.370> but<00:00:50.370> there's<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.789> glass

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
aquarium in any way but there's a glass

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.119 
aquarium in any way but there's a glass
guard<00:00:51.539> there<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.289> actually<00:00:52.680> supports

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
guard there and that actually supports

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.060 
guard there and that actually supports
the<00:00:53.190> aquarium<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.739> take<00:00:55.920> this

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the aquarium so if you take this

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
the aquarium so if you take this
blackguard<00:00:56.610> off<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> glass

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
blackguard off you can see the glass

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.170 
blackguard off you can see the glass
guard<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.800> there's<00:00:59.190> loads<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> silicone<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
guard and there's loads of silicone and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.750 
guard and there's loads of silicone and
stuff<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:00.719> ugly<00:01:01.460> but<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.609> this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
stuff so it's really ugly but on this

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.479 
stuff so it's really ugly but on this
tank<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.899> doesn't<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.530> any<00:01:04.799> blast<00:01:05.159> guard

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
tank it doesn't have any blast guard

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.000 
tank it doesn't have any blast guard
because<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.450> small<00:01:06.780> there's<00:01:07.409> hardly<00:01:07.860> any

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
because it's so small there's hardly any

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.580 
because it's so small there's hardly any
pressure<00:01:08.250> involved<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.110> took<00:01:10.260> them<00:01:10.439> off

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
pressure involved so just took them off

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.219 
pressure involved so just took them off
and<00:01:11.210> because<00:01:12.210> they<00:01:12.330> don't<00:01:12.479> support<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.960> tank

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and because they don't support the tank

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.450 
and because they don't support the tank
in<00:01:13.350> any<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.100> gonna<00:01:14.220> make<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
in any way it's not gonna make a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.480 
in any way it's not gonna make a
difference<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.560> I've<00:01:16.560> got<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> nice<00:01:17.009> rimless

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
difference so I've got a nice rimless

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.440 
difference so I've got a nice rimless
tank<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.830> two<00:01:19.830> four<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.130> five<00:01:20.310> gallon<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
tank and two four or five gallon so it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.270 
tank and two four or five gallon so it
should<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.720> okay<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.259> fightin<00:01:22.560> fish<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.320 

yeah<00:01:26.280> I'm<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.610> looking<00:01:26.759> forward<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
seeing how LT in those for the substrate

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.030 
seeing how LT in those for the substrate
I'm<00:01:31.500> using<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:33.890> akadama<00:01:35.030> bonsai<00:01:36.030> soil<00:01:36.329> and

washing<00:02:11.580> out<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> waters<00:02:12.480> went<00:02:12.690> quite

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
washing out and the waters went quite

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.240 
washing out and the waters went quite
and<00:02:13.769> put<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.489> filter<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:15.719> tank<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.769> be<00:02:16.920> using

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
and put a filter of a tank and be using

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.380 
and put a filter of a tank and be using
this<00:02:17.370> filter<00:02:17.930> it's<00:02:18.930> got<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> little<00:02:19.439> spray<00:02:19.709> bar

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
this filter it's got a little spray bar

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.929 
this filter it's got a little spray bar
bit<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.510> media<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:21.959> say<00:02:22.200> there<00:02:22.469> and<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:23.670> 300

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
bit of media and say there and it's 300

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.970 
bit of media and say there and it's 300
liters<00:02:24.599> per<00:02:24.780> hour<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.319> not<00:02:25.469> too<00:02:25.680> strong

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
liters per hour so it's not too strong

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.399 
liters per hour so it's not too strong
and<00:02:26.849> hopefully<00:02:27.329> that<00:02:27.480> spray<00:02:27.810> bar<00:02:28.079> should

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
and hopefully that spray bar should

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.759 
and hopefully that spray bar should
diffuse<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.040> floor<00:02:29.250> for<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.549> fighting<00:02:29.760> fish

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
diffuse the floor for the fighting fish

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.990 
diffuse the floor for the fighting fish
this<00:02:31.769> is<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.069> main<00:02:32.250> piece<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.640> wood<00:02:32.819> that's

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
this is the main piece of wood that's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.220 
this is the main piece of wood that's
going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.269> go<00:02:33.359> into<00:02:33.510> tanks<00:02:33.689> um<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.079> might

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
going to go into tanks um you might

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.599 
going to go into tanks um you might
remember<00:02:34.409> that<00:02:36.109> my<00:02:37.109> room<00:02:37.379> is<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.189> bit<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.430> a

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
remember that my room is in a bit of a

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.020 
remember that my room is in a bit of a
mess<00:02:38.879> at<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.239> minute<00:02:39.650> but<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.700> tell<00:02:41.909> you

that up alright so once again today I'll

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.449 
that up alright so once again today I'll
just<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:46.109> putting<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.709> substrate<00:02:47.159> in<00:02:47.250> here

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
just be putting the substrate in here

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.240 
just be putting the substrate in here
and<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:48.030> little<00:02:48.269> branch<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:49.560> won't<00:02:49.709> be<00:02:49.829> plant<00:02:50.159> in

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
and a little branch it won't be plant in

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.490 
and a little branch it won't be plant in
the<00:02:50.310> tank<00:02:50.549> today<00:02:51.230> because<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.349> haven't

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
the tank today because I haven't

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.440 
the tank today because I haven't
actually<00:02:52.680> got<00:02:52.919> the<00:02:53.010> plans<00:02:53.220> yet<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.209> haven't

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
actually got the plans yet and I haven't

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.750 
actually got the plans yet and I haven't
got<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.689> late<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.109> tank<00:02:55.349> yet<00:02:55.760> I'm

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
got the late for the tank yet I'm

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.670 
got the late for the tank yet I'm
considering<00:02:57.329> getting<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.629> t5<00:02:58.109> so<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.349> can<00:02:58.500> get

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
considering getting the t5 so I can get

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.379 
considering getting the t5 so I can get
hair<00:02:58.919> grafts<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.720> dwarf<00:03:00.720> baby<00:03:00.900> tears<00:03:02.389> all

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
hair grafts and dwarf baby tears all

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.089 
hair grafts and dwarf baby tears all
right<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:03.720> let's<00:03:03.959> get<00:03:04.109> started<00:03:04.439> okay<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:04.799> I've

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
right so let's get started okay so I've

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.399 
right so let's get started okay so I've
got<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> substrate<00:03:05.849> in<00:03:06.000> there<00:03:06.209> now<00:03:06.389> and<00:03:06.629> the

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
got the substrate in there now and the

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.770 
got the substrate in there now and the
first<00:03:07.620> thing<00:03:07.889> you'll<00:03:08.159> notice<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.849> I<00:03:08.970> put<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> lot

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
first thing you'll notice is I put a lot

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.479 
first thing you'll notice is I put a lot
in<00:03:09.930> there

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
in there

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.220 
in there
it<00:03:11.489> actually<00:03:11.639> slopes<00:03:12.209> up<00:03:12.510> from<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.019> front

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
it actually slopes up from the front

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.619 
it actually slopes up from the front
towards<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.799> back<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:14.970> actually<00:03:15.299> really

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
towards the back it's actually really

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.449 
towards the back it's actually really
low<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.019> front<00:03:16.139> for<00:03:16.470> foreground<00:03:17.069> plants

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
low in the front for foreground plants

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.539 
low in the front for foreground plants
and<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.510> higher<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.930> back<00:03:18.959> far<00:03:19.549> longer

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
and it's higher in the back far longer

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.750 
and it's higher in the back far longer
plants<00:03:20.879> like<00:03:21.349> rotella<00:03:22.400> which<00:03:23.400> I'm<00:03:23.609> thinking

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
plants like rotella which I'm thinking

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.250 
plants like rotella which I'm thinking
about<00:03:23.940> getting<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.419> here<00:03:24.599> I'm<00:03:24.690> not<00:03:24.870> too<00:03:25.049> sure

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
about getting in here I'm not too sure

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.009 
about getting in here I'm not too sure
but<00:03:25.590> I'd<00:03:26.459> like<00:03:26.639> some<00:03:26.879> higher<00:03:27.359> plant<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
but I'd like some higher plant in the

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.819 
but I'd like some higher plant in the
back<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.750> yeah<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.229> first<00:03:31.500> time<00:03:31.680> I've

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
back so yeah this is the first time I've

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.699 
back so yeah this is the first time I've
really<00:03:31.859> had<00:03:32.220> enough<00:03:32.280> substrate<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:34.500> me<00:03:34.620> at

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
really had enough substrate and to me at

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.110 
really had enough substrate and to me at
this<00:03:34.829> type<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.069> effect<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:35.729> I<00:03:35.790> just<00:03:35.970> thought

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
this type of effect so I just thought

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.240 
this type of effect so I just thought
I'd<00:03:36.239> give<00:03:36.389> it<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.540> go<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:37.019> think<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.829> looks<00:03:37.979> quite

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
I'd give it a go I think it looks quite

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.909 
I'd give it a go I think it looks quite
nice<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.810> it's<00:03:40.019> got<00:03:40.199> a<00:03:40.229> nice<00:03:40.409> if<00:03:40.739> he

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
nice and it's got a nice if he

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.149 
nice and it's got a nice if he
collectors<00:03:41.519> soil<00:03:41.879> and<00:03:42.229> it's<00:03:43.229> lightly<00:03:43.500> red<00:03:43.889> so

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
collectors soil and it's lightly red so

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.159 
collectors soil and it's lightly red so
I<00:03:44.430> think<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.940> suggests<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.629> it's<00:03:45.989> got<00:03:46.139> a

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
I think that suggests that it's got a

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.770 
I think that suggests that it's got a
bit<00:03:46.349> of<00:03:46.470> iron<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:46.949> the<00:03:47.790> tires<00:03:48.030> got<00:03:48.239> some<00:03:48.389> iron

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
bit of iron in the tires got some iron

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.930 
bit of iron in the tires got some iron
in<00:03:48.959> then<00:03:49.199> I<00:03:49.470> should<00:03:49.739> get<00:03:49.859> nice<00:03:50.099> red<00:03:50.430> gruel<00:03:50.699> from

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
in then I should get nice red gruel from

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.680 
in then I should get nice red gruel from
the<00:03:51.030> plants<00:03:53.000> I'm<00:03:54.000> going<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.299> talk<00:03:54.419> about<00:03:54.449> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
the plants I'm going to talk about the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.679 
the plants I'm going to talk about the
supports<00:03:55.229> for<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.530> little<00:03:55.769> bit<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:57.030> it's<00:03:57.479> got

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
supports for a little bit and it's got

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.629 
supports for a little bit and it's got
some<00:03:57.870> brackets<00:03:58.349> and<00:03:58.590> then<00:03:58.709> he<00:03:58.829> one<00:03:59.129> two<00:03:59.310> three

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
some brackets and then he one two three

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.409 
some brackets and then he one two three
four<00:04:00.269> five<00:04:01.229> six<00:04:01.470> seven<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.250> it's<00:04:02.939> also<00:04:03.120> got

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
four five six seven and it's also got

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
gonna start off the ammonia source by

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.590 
gonna start off the ammonia source by
just<00:06:08.440> using<00:06:08.740> some<00:06:08.950> flake<00:06:09.220> food<00:06:09.490> or<00:06:10.419> some

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
just using some flake food or some

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.310 
just using some flake food or some
bloodworms

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
bloodworms

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.980 
bloodworms
and<00:06:11.650> I'll<00:06:11.800> put<00:06:12.010> those<00:06:12.160> in<00:06:12.780> they<00:06:13.780> should

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
and I'll put those in they should

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.860 
and I'll put those in they should
release<00:06:14.169> the<00:06:14.500> ammonia<00:06:15.120> building<00:06:16.120> a<00:06:16.210> nitrate

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
release the ammonia building a nitrate

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.110 
release the ammonia building a nitrate
and<00:06:17.169> then<00:06:17.290> a<00:06:17.320> nitrate<00:06:18.070> and<00:06:18.580> then<00:06:18.700> it<00:06:18.820> should<00:06:19.000> be

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
and then a nitrate and then it should be

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.680 
and then a nitrate and then it should be
ready<00:06:19.360> for<00:06:19.450> the<00:06:19.660> fighting<00:06:20.080> fish<00:06:21.330> I'm<00:06:22.330> gonna<00:06:22.570> be

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
ready for the fighting fish I'm gonna be

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.830 
ready for the fighting fish I'm gonna be
getting<00:06:23.020> every<00:06:23.440> taste<00:06:23.710> or<00:06:24.070> a<00:06:24.100> t5<00:06:24.520> light<00:06:24.880> gonna

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
getting every taste or a t5 light gonna

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.800 
getting every taste or a t5 light gonna
be<00:06:26.020> mounting<00:06:26.470> it<00:06:26.530> on<00:06:26.890> there<00:06:27.190> on<00:06:27.460> the<00:06:27.580> top<00:06:27.820> so<00:06:28.780> I

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
be mounting it on there on the top so I

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.070 
be mounting it on there on the top so I
can<00:06:28.960> access<00:06:29.260> the<00:06:29.650> tank<00:06:29.890> easily<00:06:30.810> I'm<00:06:31.810> thinking

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
can access the tank easily I'm thinking

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.260 
can access the tank easily I'm thinking
about<00:06:32.140> getting<00:06:32.380> some<00:06:32.650> really<00:06:33.310> ends<00:06:33.580> it's<00:06:33.970> like

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
about getting some really ends it's like

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.600 
about getting some really ends it's like
a<00:06:34.300> moss<00:06:34.690> for<00:06:35.229> this<00:06:35.380> little

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
a moss for this little

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.240 
a moss for this little
I<00:06:36.640> get<00:06:37.600> lots<00:06:37.900> of<00:06:37.990> carved<00:06:38.290> in<00:06:38.410> plants<00:06:38.800> and<00:06:39.070> maybe

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
I get lots of carved in plants and maybe

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.410 
I get lots of carved in plants and maybe
some<00:06:39.550> Rotella<00:06:40.030> in<00:06:40.150> the<00:06:40.270> back<00:06:41.460> um<00:06:42.460> so<00:06:42.880> yeah<00:06:43.090> I

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
some Rotella in the back um so yeah I

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.170 
some Rotella in the back um so yeah I
think<00:06:43.750> it's<00:06:43.990> something<00:06:44.200> really<00:06:44.500> nice<00:06:44.680> and

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
think it's something really nice and

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.670 
think it's something really nice and
they<00:06:46.180> give<00:06:46.330> you<00:06:46.390> a<00:06:46.450> few<00:06:46.720> facts<00:06:47.110> about<00:06:47.440> this

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
they give you a few facts about this

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.810 
they give you a few facts about this
clear<00:06:48.840> more<00:06:49.840> likely<00:06:50.290> is<00:06:50.590> found<00:06:50.980> three<00:06:51.400> meters

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:51.820 
clear more likely is found three meters

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.870 
clear more likely is found three meters
deep<00:06:52.080> below<00:06:53.080> Japanese<00:06:53.710> forests<00:06:54.400> although

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
deep below Japanese forests although

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.770 
deep below Japanese forests although
this<00:06:55.180> one's<00:06:55.480> taken<00:06:55.900> from<00:06:56.020> European<00:06:56.620> forests

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
this one's taken from European forests

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.930 
this one's taken from European forests
and<00:06:58.780> then<00:06:59.320> dig<00:06:59.710> it<00:06:59.860> out<00:06:59.980> it's<00:07:00.370> free<00:07:00.580> meters

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 
and then dig it out it's free meters

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.190 
and then dig it out it's free meters
below<00:07:01.530> the<00:07:02.530> dry<00:07:03.130> it<00:07:03.190> out<00:07:03.460> the<00:07:04.030> then<00:07:04.210> bake<00:07:04.510> it<00:07:04.780> to

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.200 
below the dry it out the then bake it to

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.130 
below the dry it out the then bake it to
kill<00:07:05.380> off<00:07:05.500> any<00:07:05.650> diseases<00:07:06.160> and<00:07:06.490> parasites

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
kill off any diseases and parasites

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.710 
kill off any diseases and parasites
they're<00:07:08.140> also<00:07:08.320> hardens<00:07:08.920> it<00:07:09.270> and<00:07:10.270> then<00:07:10.420> break

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
they're also hardens it and then break

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.590 
they're also hardens it and then break
it<00:07:10.870> up<00:07:10.990> in<00:07:11.080> small<00:07:11.440> pieces<00:07:11.970> and<00:07:12.970> it<00:07:13.150> goes<00:07:13.300> for

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:13.600 
it up in small pieces and it goes for

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.990 
it up in small pieces and it goes for
sale<00:07:13.810> so<00:07:14.350> that's<00:07:14.830> basically<00:07:15.220> it<00:07:15.430> it's<00:07:15.730> packed

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
sale so that's basically it it's packed

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.890 
sale so that's basically it it's packed
full<00:07:16.180> of<00:07:16.240> nutrients<00:07:16.720> and<00:07:18.300> it<00:07:19.300> actually<00:07:19.630> pulls

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
full of nutrients and it actually pulls

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.290 
full of nutrients and it actually pulls
in<00:07:20.050> you<00:07:20.140> inside<00:07:20.500> the<00:07:20.620> water<00:07:20.830> color<00:07:21.160> it's<00:07:22.150> not

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
in you inside the water color it's not

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.450 
in you inside the water color it's not
ideal<00:07:22.480> for<00:07:22.900> plants<00:07:23.230> like<00:07:23.350> Java<00:07:23.650> fin<00:07:23.980> or

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460 
ideal for plants like Java fin or

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.730 
ideal for plants like Java fin or
anubias<00:07:25.270> that<00:07:25.510> rely<00:07:25.810> on<00:07:25.840> nutrients<00:07:26.410> from<00:07:26.560> the

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.740 
anubias that rely on nutrients from the

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.760 
anubias that rely on nutrients from the
water<00:07:26.770> column<00:07:27.190> and<00:07:28.170> it<00:07:29.170> absorbs<00:07:29.320> those

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.770 
water column and it absorbs those

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.730 
water column and it absorbs those
nutrients<00:07:30.340> I<00:07:30.960> make<00:07:31.960> them<00:07:32.140> available<00:07:32.440> for

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740 
nutrients I make them available for

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.790 
nutrients I make them available for
