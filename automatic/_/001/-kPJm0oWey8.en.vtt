00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
Gorilla Glass and actually I prefer the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.710 
Gorilla Glass and actually I prefer the
Quattro<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.229> having<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.060> center<00:01:24.060> physical

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
Quattro not having the center physical

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.690 
Quattro not having the center physical
button<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.619> see<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> does<00:01:26.070> not<00:01:26.310> have

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
button as you can see it does not have

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.420 
button as you can see it does not have
an<00:01:26.880> actual<00:01:27.330> physical<00:01:27.509> button<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> phone

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
an actual physical button on the phone

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.090 
an actual physical button on the phone
whereas<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.960> note<00:01:30.960> 2<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> believe<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:32.040> should

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
whereas the note 2 I believe it should

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.010 
whereas the note 2 I believe it should
should<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.329> built<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.869> way

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
should not have built it that way

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.749 
should not have built it that way
because<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.860> know<00:01:34.979> what<00:01:35.130> happens<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.579> drop

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
because we know what happens if a drop

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.420 
because we know what happens if a drop
of<00:01:35.820> water<00:01:36.000> runs<00:01:36.509> down<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.990> screening<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.979> can

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
of water runs down that screening it can

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.359 
of water runs down that screening it can
get<00:01:39.210> into<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.630> button<00:01:40.250> sooner<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.280> later

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
get into that button sooner or later

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.530 
get into that button sooner or later
they<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.970> stick<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.630> you're<00:01:42.750> not<00:01:42.869> careful<00:01:44.540> and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
they can stick if you're not careful and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.350 
they can stick if you're not careful and
both<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.930> these<00:01:46.170> will<00:01:46.560> work<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.100> on

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
both of these will work really well on

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.760 
both of these will work really well on
