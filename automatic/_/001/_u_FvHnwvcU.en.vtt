00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.700
 Celta Vigo and Real Betis 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.080
 they faced in balaídos in the duel in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.940
 which also debuted as new 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.789
 Betis coach this man gaby 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.800
 gabriel humberto calderón the third 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.510
 Andalusian coach in 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.179
 that goes season after the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.590
 dismissal of Juan Carlos Garrido after 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.420
 the defeat against Real Madrid in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.280
 last day a garrido that for his 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.770
 part had already replaced pepe mel 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.530
 began with a lot of intention the betis 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.760
 in search of the goal 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.230
 and in fact it was very close to 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.850
 get it in this action where they 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.550
 Rubén Castro out of play 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.860
 but the one that was ahead is ama 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.350
 since he does not participate in the action 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.390
 that was going to end in goal of saves 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.700
 seville after the first rejection of joel 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.590
 did not go up to the score that much but 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.080
 would this play by the band 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.430
 right center of juanfran goal of rubén 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.320
 Castro and scored his second league goal 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.090
 a Castro castro that had not gotten 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.850
 score from the first match 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.940
 back precisely in front of the Celtic in 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.550
 the benito villamarín here got his 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.650
 second so much in the league bbva to put 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.650
 ahead to the bético picture 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.520
 he was facing the game in his 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.100
 debut as coach of the Andalusians 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.869
 Gaby Calderón but I was going to react 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.360
 fulminant form the Celtic still in 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.680
 this first goal goal from 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.560
 orellana for the tie one put it on 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.240
 has directed in the head rafinha with 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.240
 a sensational assistance 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.200
 in this way he tied the Celtic 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.200
 there we see the assistance of rafinha 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.710
 and the goal of orellana 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.630
 has a similar action would arrive on 2 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.899
 to 1 the grape center may the goal of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.270
 Charles and the Celtic who had started 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.700
 from behind he turned the marker 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.700
 to get ahead with that 2 to 1 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.270
 eighth goal of charles that returned to 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.619
 team after missing the match 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.110
 against the espanyol of the previous 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.110
 day because of a colitis 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.800
 and I return with goal the Brazilian 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.659
 so the reaction was CENTA that 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.489
 even before reaching the time of 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.400
 rest would get a third both the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.870
 picture directed by luis enrique would be 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.629
 this action 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.750
 rafinha unfold again from hugo mallo 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.519
 the center of the lateral rejection bad of 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.010
 juanfran that hits the body of paulao 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.530
 and ends up solving the orellana play 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.880
 to score his second goal 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.880
 the third for the Celtic 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.900
 it was celebrated by the fans of the group 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.180
 Galician in the stands of balaídos los 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.490
 three points were very important too 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.380
 for the local team 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.990
 the betis with so much needed 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.990
 only 11 in the table very far from the 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.830
 salvation to 8 points but also the 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.560
 Celtic wanted the victory to catch a 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.320
 little air in that fight to get out of 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.670
 the compromised area of the table before 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.320
 from the end of the first half he had it to 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.280
 mesh with this auction that would end 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.209
 deflecting a Celtic defender 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.580
 there we see the action is not right the 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.110
 Galician defense when throwing the 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.630
 out of play and at the end to point was 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.860
 to take advantage of it amaya paulao retired 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.520
 injured at the end of the first part 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.470
 had to replace it jordi figueras in 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.780
 the start of the second also entered 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.600
 nolito in that second half and it would be 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.160
 leading scorer for the Celtic after 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.500
 this shot of throwing him bounced on the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.360
 The body of Figueres was about 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.920
 scoring the room for his team had just 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.920
 patting to corner guille sahara 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.180
 the play 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.569
 I would end 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.940
 with that good intervention from 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.940
 goalkeeper of betis 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.230
 and in this action the charge returned to 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.390
 Celtic and here he would reach the goal after 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.060
 the rejection of juanfran puts her back 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.460
 in the area girl charles and nolito not 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.980
 fails in 72 to put the 4-1 in the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.720
 marker that already left definitively 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.970
 has sentenced the duel in the absence of 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.270
 little more than a quarter of an hour for 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.270
 gone 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.200
 scored nolito 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.490
 the goal that brings tranquility 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.550
 definitely to the bleachers of balaídos 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.230
 even though in this action I would cut 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.529
 again distance to rubén castro for 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.269
 the betis with 42 in 77 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:55.920
 the betis that leads to have some 

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:59.129
 occasion to get the 43 what 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.639
 I would have installed the nerves again 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.710
 in balaídos and Celtic 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.030
 sometimes like this lack served by 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.139
 verdú that happens very close to the stick 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.729
 left of the goal of it he 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.729
 or later d 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.569
 jorgé molina and rubén castro to the center of 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.279
 save seville in any case 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.830
 it was not going to endanger the victory for the 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.779
 Celtic finally and more after the 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.960
 direct red cedric excursion 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:28.850
 this very hard entry on rapine 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.770
 and in addition to spectacular durability which 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.370
 He also influenced the decision 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.349
 the referee Hernandez Hernandez 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.360
 it was with 10 the betis the party 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.949
 ended in balaídos and in the end what 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.990
 did with the victory of the Celtic 42 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.990
 against the real betis football
