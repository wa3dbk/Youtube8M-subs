clean<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:40.219> because<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.340> know<00:00:41.399> there's<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
clean it because I know there's a lot of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.560 
clean it because I know there's a lot of
ash<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.989> back<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:44.000> do<00:00:45.000> want<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> save

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
ash in the back here I do want to save

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.940 
ash in the back here I do want to save
this<00:00:45.809> stuff<00:00:47.030> I'm<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.950> 20-hour

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
this stuff I'm going to do a 20-hour

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.580 
this stuff I'm going to do a 20-hour
smoked<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:51.390> why<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> want<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.050> make<00:00:52.559> sure

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
smoked so that's why I want to make sure

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.549 
smoked so that's why I want to make sure
that<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.670> ashes<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.260> before<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.289> start

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that all the ashes out before I start

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.639 
that all the ashes out before I start
that<00:00:55.590> smoke<00:00:56.030> because<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.750> airflow<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.199> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that smoke because the airflow is is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.549 
that smoke because the airflow is is
really<00:00:59.190> important<00:00:59.910> when<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.719> fill<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.350> up

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
really important when you fill this up

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.710 
really important when you fill this up
with<00:01:02.690> wood<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.769> charcoal<00:01:05.150> it<00:01:06.150> really<00:01:06.420> needs<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
with wood and charcoal it really needs a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
with wood and charcoal it really needs a
lot<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.900> airflow<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.860> stay<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:09.119> 20

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
lot of airflow to to stay going for 20

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.780 
lot of airflow to to stay going for 20
hours<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.320> don't<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> digi-fuse

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
hours that is I don't have a digi-fuse

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.789 
hours that is I don't have a digi-fuse
so<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:13.790> watch<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.060> temperature<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:16.530> my

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
so I have to watch the temperature on my

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
so I have to watch the temperature on my
own<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.189> adjust<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.210> manually<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.180> first<00:01:21.180> I'm

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
own and adjust it manually so first I'm

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
own and adjust it manually so first I'm
gonna<00:01:21.570> start<00:01:21.840> by<00:01:22.020> taking<00:01:22.500> out<00:01:22.710> all<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.950> good

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
gonna start by taking out all this good

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280 
gonna start by taking out all this good
charcoal<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.390> putting<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
charcoal and just putting that to the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:35.200 
charcoal and just putting that to the
side

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.640 

all<00:01:36.210> right<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.450> got<00:01:36.600> most<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> big<00:01:37.290> chunks

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
all right I got most of the big chunks

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:48.100 
all right I got most of the big chunks
out<00:01:37.770> I'm<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.060> ring

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.660 

I'm<00:01:48.560> going<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.770> take<00:01:48.890> out<00:01:49.010> the<00:01:49.100> great<00:01:49.370> that's

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
I'm going to take out the great that's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:57.520 
I'm going to take out the great that's
inside<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.120> there<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:53.710> man<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.930> last<00:01:57.170> piece

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
inside of there a man the last piece

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.990 
inside of there a man the last piece
here<00:01:59.110> so<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.200> can<00:02:00.350> see<00:02:00.560> where<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.860> holes

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
here so you can see where the holes

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.790 
here so you can see where the holes
build<00:02:02.000> up<00:02:02.150> ash<00:02:02.590> around<00:02:03.590> there<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:05.620> got<00:02:06.620> to<00:02:06.650> get

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
build up ash around there and got to get

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.690 
build up ash around there and got to get
that<00:02:06.950> cleaned<00:02:07.250> up<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:08.660> what<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.869> use<00:02:09.520> to<00:02:10.520> take

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
that cleaned up so what I use to take

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:49.320 
that cleaned up so what I use to take
care<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.390> just<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.870> shot<00:02:12.080> back

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.470 

so<00:02:50.330> that's<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.780> it's<00:02:51.710> really<00:02:52.550> actually

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
so that's that it's really actually

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.210 
so that's that it's really actually
extremely<00:02:54.290> easy<00:02:59.590> seems<00:03:00.590> like<00:03:00.800> it's<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.040> lot<00:03:01.160> of

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
extremely easy seems like it's a lot of

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:11.290 
extremely easy seems like it's a lot of
work<00:03:01.430> but<00:03:01.640> it's<00:03:01.820> not<00:03:09.700> put<00:03:10.700> everything<00:03:10.940> back

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
work but it's not put everything back

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.580 
work but it's not put everything back
where<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.660> goes

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.150 

migrate<00:03:15.590> back<00:03:15.770> in<00:03:16.040> there<00:03:17.470> my<00:03:18.470> charcoal<00:03:18.890> back

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
migrate back in there my charcoal back

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:33.430 
migrate back in there my charcoal back
in<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:27.310> little<00:03:28.310> bit<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:32.750> now<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.170> have<00:03:33.200> the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
in a little bit so now that I have the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.229 
in a little bit so now that I have the
charcoal<00:03:33.800> in<00:03:33.980> I'm<00:03:34.489> going<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.790> show<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.030> how<00:03:35.180> to

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
charcoal in I'm going to show you how to

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.620 
charcoal in I'm going to show you how to
