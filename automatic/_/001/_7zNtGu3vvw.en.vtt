00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.960
 Want to know what will happen to Masha new 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.579
 ultra modern ultra beautiful wheelbarrow 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.480
 after you get to it 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.989
 Yaroslavl 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.989
 Well 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.359
 but 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.280
 so long ago I waited while we have a blog 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.659
 finally there will be a powerful machines not 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:17.540
 year volkswagen tiguan with us today 211 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.540
 horsepower engine capacity 2 liters 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.590
 the speed she gains is simple i even 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.630
 I do not press hard on the pedal that is it 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.520
 unrealizable speed to me it seems 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.600
 laughs there is a long time I think that I already 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.980
 picked up speed before the car went 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.080
 is in a sleepy state 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.060
 and makes fun of the girl behind the wheel 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.010
 because she wants much more than 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.010
 now she shows me 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.620
 give 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.590
 trick number one is auto dimming 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.230
 rearview mirror 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.370
 to all sorts of jeeps which are very 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.370
 high lights did not set foot at night true 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.170
 very often when the opposite car well 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.460
 like domestic in which very 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.920
 weak lights 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.080
 they do not see the curve chip number 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.510
 two is automatic maintenance 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.100
 pedals or auto hold click on 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.050
 brake machines dwell on the impurities 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.940
 fore you don't need to hold the pedal and 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.610
 the machine itself automatically and and keeps 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.320
 very cool chips that counter tumanki 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.209
 highlight turns depending on 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.730
 which way to turn the steering wheel to 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.200
 fog shines brighter and illuminate 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.470
 direction of rotation in which you 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.470
 come in 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.030
 passenger seat way much 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.550
 more convenient than the driver is very disappointing 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.060
 that passengers cheated 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.310
 ethical seat adjustment can you 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.020
 not very clearly visible here such 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.510
 lever 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.340
 which must be hand pumped Why should he 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.489
 not very low drops 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.500
 drivers have a super cool e 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.670
 adjustment which must be said 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.670
 works superbly 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.450
 and
