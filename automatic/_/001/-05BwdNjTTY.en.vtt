00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:45.190
 milk at the head of the cardboard without

 worry about the side when it comes to 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.530
 bars you must decide of height goes 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:56.890
 become the ballast of the rohde cribs to

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.910
 so on the other two bars 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:27.810
 that when attaching the sides and

 screws fix the grid on the 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.050
 headboards 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:50.700

 produced with the highest quality and 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:33.310
