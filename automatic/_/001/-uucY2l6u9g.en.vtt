00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
inside now you want to spin it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.810 
inside now you want to spin it
counterclockwise<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.739> separate<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.789> two

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
counterclockwise and separate the two

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.509 
counterclockwise and separate the two
halves<00:00:41.260> so<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.379> can<00:00:42.530> get<00:00:42.649> to<00:00:42.769> the<00:00:42.890> internals

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.130 

first<00:00:46.519> you'll<00:00:47.059> want<00:00:47.239> to<00:00:47.300> check<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.809> battery

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
first you'll want to check the battery

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.630 
first you'll want to check the battery
terminals<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.829> make<00:00:48.980> sure<00:00:49.160> if<00:00:49.250> they're<00:00:49.429> still

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
terminals to make sure if they're still

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.479 
terminals to make sure if they're still
holding<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.030> batteries<00:00:50.420> in<00:00:50.660> tightly<00:00:51.649> to<00:00:52.339> do

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
holding the batteries in tightly to do

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.669 
holding the batteries in tightly to do
this<00:00:52.670> turn<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.510> top<00:00:53.690> half<00:00:53.929> upside<00:00:54.320> down<00:00:54.499> and

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
this turn the top half upside down and

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.529 
this turn the top half upside down and
shake<00:00:54.890> if<00:00:55.280> your<00:00:55.460> battery<00:00:55.760> stay<00:00:56.059> in<00:00:56.239> they're

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
shake if your battery stay in they're

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.750 
shake if your battery stay in they're
still<00:00:56.809> tight<00:01:00.010> secondly<00:01:01.010> you'll<00:01:01.489> want<00:01:01.699> to

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
still tight secondly you'll want to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.330 
still tight secondly you'll want to
check<00:01:01.940> these<00:01:02.149> metal<00:01:02.600> terminals<00:01:03.340> connecting

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.340 
check these metal terminals connecting

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.130 
check these metal terminals connecting
the<00:01:04.430> two<00:01:04.580> halves<00:01:04.760> of<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.000> light<00:01:05.210> sometimes

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
the two halves of the light sometimes

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.410

best<00:01:06.470> your<00:01:06.680> grind<00:01:06.920> gets<00:01:07.670> onto<00:01:07.970> these<00:01:08.120> and

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
best your grind gets onto these and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.150 
best your grind gets onto these and
inhibits<00:01:09.020> electricity<00:01:09.590> from<00:01:09.740> passing

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
inhibits electricity from passing

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.460 
inhibits electricity from passing
through<00:01:10.370> so<00:01:11.300> just<00:01:11.510> wipe<00:01:11.660> them<00:01:11.870> off<00:01:12.080> with<00:01:12.320> your
