00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
for Windows 7 machines and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.360 
for Windows 7 machines and
one<00:02:12.700> server<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.480> starts<00:02:14.020> kicking<00:02:14.350> in<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.860> KMS

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
one server it starts kicking in the KMS

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.470 
one server it starts kicking in the KMS
it<00:02:15.580> starts<00:02:15.850> activating<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:18.210> there's<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.300> couple

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
it starts activating so there's a couple

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.390 
it starts activating so there's a couple
of<00:02:19.660> tricks<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.230> want<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.860> show<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.100> guys

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
of tricks that I want to show you guys

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.180 
of tricks that I want to show you guys
and<00:02:21.700> again<00:02:22.150> I'm<00:02:22.720> using<00:02:22.780> my<00:02:23.230> little<00:02:23.770> cheat

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
and again I'm using my little cheat

guys<00:02:29.140> can<00:02:29.410> check<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.680> out<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.200> Windows

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
guys can check it out I have a Windows

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.030 
guys can check it out I have a Windows
2008<00:02:33.790> machine<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:36.700> machine<00:02:36.760> is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
2008 machine and this machine is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.040 
2008 machine and this machine is
enterprise<00:02:39.040> 2008<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:40.090> added<00:02:40.450> into<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:40.840> domain

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
enterprise 2008 I added into this domain

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.540 
enterprise 2008 I added into this domain
controller<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.800> know<00:02:41.920> it's<00:02:42.190> not<00:02:42.340> best

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
controller you know it's not best

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.640 
controller you know it's not best
practice<00:02:43.000> but<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.180> have<00:02:43.420> my<00:02:43.600> kms<00:02:44.140> with<00:02:44.440> my

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
practice but I have my kms with my

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.170 
practice but I have my kms with my
domain<00:02:44.950> controller<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.430> know<00:02:45.580> it's<00:02:45.850> not<00:02:45.970> best

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
domain controller I know it's not best

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.660 
domain controller I know it's not best
practice<00:02:46.630> so<00:02:47.590> let's<00:02:47.800> go<00:02:47.950> into<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.190> machine

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
practice so let's go into that machine

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.570 
practice so let's go into that machine
and<00:02:48.910> as<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.050> can<00:02:50.170> see<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.500> machine<00:02:50.830> this

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
and as you can see in the machine this

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.240 
and as you can see in the machine this
is<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.970> computer<00:02:52.270> name<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.980> try<00:02:54.220> to

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
is the computer name and I try to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.330 
is the computer name and I try to
activate<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.910> but<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.390> problem<00:02:55.989> has<00:02:56.140> occurred

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
activate it but a problem has occurred

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.920 
activate it but a problem has occurred
windows<00:02:57.340> try<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.640> activate<00:02:58.180> what's<00:02:58.450> what's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
windows try to activate what's what's

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.690 
windows try to activate what's what's
the<00:02:59.020> deal<00:02:59.290> now<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.160> gotta<00:03:00.370> take<00:03:00.550> in

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
the deal now you gotta take in

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.370 
the deal now you gotta take in
consideration<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.630> machine<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.050> part

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
consideration that this machine is part

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.280 
consideration that this machine is part
of<00:03:02.500> my<00:03:02.590> network<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.280> trying<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:04.290> authenticate

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
of my network is trying to authenticate

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.400 
of my network is trying to authenticate
itself<00:03:05.560> or<00:03:06.190> retrieve<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> license<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:07.780> my

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
network on my kms server before it goes

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.560 
network on my kms server before it goes
and<00:03:11.500> reaches<00:03:11.860> out<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.880> Windows<00:03:13.300> Server

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
and reaches out to the Windows Server

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.720 
and reaches out to the Windows Server
and<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.800> reason<00:03:15.100> why<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.250> receive

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
and this is the reason why I receive

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.199 
and this is the reason why I receive
this<00:03:15.970> now<00:03:16.739> there's<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:17.890> command<00:03:18.640> line<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:18.880> you

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
this now there's a command line that you

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.759 
this now there's a command line that you
can<00:03:19.360> actually<00:03:19.709> go<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.870> enter<00:03:22.870> inside<00:03:23.440> your

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
can actually go and enter inside your

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.100 
can actually go and enter inside your
client<00:03:24.430> machine<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.630> this<00:03:25.810> right<00:03:25.989> here

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
client machine and it's this right here

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.300 
client machine and it's this right here
again<00:03:26.350> I'm<00:03:26.440> going<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.620> be<00:03:26.739> providing<00:03:27.220> the

again I'm going to be providing the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.680 
again I'm going to be providing the

so when you enter for this this right
here<00:03:31.660> will<00:03:31.900> let<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.230> know<00:03:32.410> whether<00:03:32.830> or<00:03:33.100> not

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
here will let you know whether or not

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.030 
here will let you know whether or not
your<00:03:33.730> computer<00:03:34.330> is<00:03:34.720> talking<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.290> your<00:03:35.440> DNS<00:03:35.860> or

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
your computer is talking to your DNS or

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.560 
your computer is talking to your DNS or
is<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.310> talking<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:38.130> record<00:03:39.130> within<00:03:39.730> DNS<00:03:40.239> I

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
is it talking to the record within DNS I

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.050 
is it talking to the record within DNS I
think<00:03:41.560> I've<00:03:41.680> been<00:03:41.769> having<00:03:42.070> issues<00:03:42.220> with<00:03:42.610> this

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
think I've been having issues with this

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.390 
think I've been having issues with this
command<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:44.230> reason<00:03:44.830> why<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:44.980> because<00:03:45.130> I'm

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
command the reason why is because I'm

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.890 
command the reason why is because I'm
doing<00:03:45.519> everything<00:03:45.820> as<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.060> virtual<00:03:46.450> machine<00:03:46.720> so

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
doing everything as a virtual machine so

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.820 
doing everything as a virtual machine so
I<00:03:46.930> don't<00:03:47.230> really<00:03:47.470> have<00:03:47.769> an<00:03:48.310> active<00:03:48.880> DNS

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
I don't really have an active DNS

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.130 
I don't really have an active DNS
configure<00:03:50.830> correctly<00:03:51.370> or<00:03:51.580> DHCP<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.930> most

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
configure correctly or DHCP so most

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.380 
configure correctly or DHCP so most
likely<00:03:53.530> if<00:03:53.709> your<00:03:54.459> machine<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:54.850> part<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.269> a

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
likely if your machine is part of a

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.470 
likely if your machine is part of a
domain<00:03:55.690> controller<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:57.430> could<00:03:57.940> reach<00:03:58.209> to

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
domain controller and it could reach to

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.130 
domain controller and it could reach to
mind<00:03:58.660> can<00:03:59.290> reach<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.769> your<00:03:59.890> DNS<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:01.720> shouldn't

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
mind can reach to your DNS you shouldn't

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.460 
mind can reach to your DNS you shouldn't
have<00:04:02.410> any<00:04:02.799> problems<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:04.200> another<00:04:05.200> cool

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
have any problems so another cool

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.970 
have any problems so another cool
command<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:06.940> could<00:04:07.150> try<00:04:07.390> out<00:04:07.420> is

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
command that you could try out is

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.710
