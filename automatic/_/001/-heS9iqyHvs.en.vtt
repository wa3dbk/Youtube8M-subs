00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.620
 then their assembly is a 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.599
 combination of lightness of impulse and 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.980
 engagement of the hindquarters and facing 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.450
 this look all the horses are 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.279
 not equal to take the example of george 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.449
 hill is long enough he's pretty sporty 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.310
 it is closer to the model of a 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.660
 thoroughbred than a Spanish horse or 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.460
 German who are often more affluent 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.529
 facing this pace, we see who is 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.970
 still longer and the aluminum 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.240
 rubbish assembly is going to be more complicated 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.240
 for him 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.500
 to go to collect the first he 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.180
 must stretch his horse is what I have 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 started doing in my relaxation and 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.050
 after I start to include some 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.840
 transitions advancing by resuming 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.949
 to solicit the posteriors and 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.000
 the horse team me it's 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.949
 mainly what I'm looking for 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.059
 poster engagement that goes hand in hand 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.339
 with the lowering of the hips 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:06.700
 so here I 'm extending the time I 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.009
 recovers the energy to lengthen Slavic 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.450
 converted to the top 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.170
 I try to have a horse that gets 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.149
 rectifies he stepped counted the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.800
 smaller strides obviously I do not 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.289
 I'm not here yet but it is this work 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.509
 that I do at the three paces that me 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.220
 allows to progressively access their 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.490
 assembly sas gets in several 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.490
 years 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.500
 now I'm going to do the same thing 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.030
 trotting but I trot out 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.860
 because it's already something 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.880
 difficult is again for him so 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.079
 it's not worth adding all 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.670
 the difficulties the time I sit 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.289
 on his back they may open it to me 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.390
 I want to keep a strong top line 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.189
 and rounded that allows precisely this 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.600
 rounded off to end with the commitment of 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.700
 posterior who come back under the body 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.560
 of the horse which allows the horse to 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.560
 support and to be alone 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.660
 I want you first I hunt a little 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.120
 hips with my inner leg 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.940
 play back a little bit that looks and 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.229
 then after I bring them inside that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.060
 would mobilize horse landreau he 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.390
 can not set this imbalance 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.740
 do this 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.390
 he is obliged to support himself for 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.670
 to be able to do that movement and osiris 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.500
 in the assembly quietly must 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.540
 be careful when looking for them 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.709
 assembled to not get shriveled due 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.920
 gather gather always with 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.920
 pulse 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.730
 now i'm going to go on the bars 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:33.720
 on the ground to gain a little bit of 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.950
 rebounds that's better on that side I'm 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.959
 on the bars the horse i swing a little 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.730
 little more bouncing he is recovering 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.630
 this is what seeks to 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.630
 get it here 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.110
 first gallop of work I settle 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.690
 could start to straighten up stand 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.120
 but inspires me my bust and asked 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.319
 my horse to do like the engine of the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.670
 horse is the posters r no what we 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.680
 wants us if you see a real 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.420
 activity of the hinders that allow 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.019
 to the horse of this elevated and not to 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.019
 to project forward 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.580
 there he passed me behind suddenly yes 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.709
 a heel strike saying no no it's not 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.920
 slow down has gathered a real 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.920
 difference 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.950
 and well run out because of being a 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.470
 real forum there we really saw the horse 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.910
 who dropped his hips 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.770
 I will surrender she will support my bust 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.700
 my hands my horse separated in his 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.700
 neckline we see that she gets up 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.070
 obviously I always start with the 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.330
 strongest hand 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.470
 but still there to give him 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.440
 of ease in something that 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.570
 discover all opa is difficult and and 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.050
 discourage more especially I do not do that 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.850
 everyday 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:06.230
 this is the terrain I'm doing this three 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:07.220
 times a week and other good ones but 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.480
 it was rather beneficial these two 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.350
 gather sessions with george I 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.510
 believe he worked well 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.940
 so we saw anyway it's later 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.260
 who gets under under the effort that 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.910
 do like a little do pumps 1 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.709
 for the horse as we equivalent 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.450
 pumps so that's part of the 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.890
 building his musculature and everything 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.200
 that's going to increase the balance 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.970
 the impulse finally it's really some 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.980
 something that will be beneficial for all 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.240
 my disciplines especially in dressage where 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.040
 i'm going i'm going to need this 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.690
 look it allows me to be a desire more 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.520
 raised and jumping so that 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.720
 the horse is able to jump from 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.190
 to propel oneself to recover 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.530
 and all that to turn faster have 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.810
 more mobility is faster and 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.810
 or a win again
