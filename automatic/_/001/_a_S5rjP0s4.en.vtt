00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
no back to what I say so I noticed

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.219 
no back to what I say so I noticed
enemies<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.240> big<00:01:27.509> hooks

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.580 
enemies like that one with the big hooks
for<00:01:28.530> hands<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> flytrap<00:01:30.060> mouth<00:01:30.590> those

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
for hands in like a flytrap mouth those

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.390 
for hands in like a flytrap mouth those
enemies<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.430> faster<00:01:33.380> really<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.189> just

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
enemies are faster really it is not just

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.429 
enemies are faster really it is not just
because<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:36.030> move<00:01:36.180> backwards<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> shoot

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
because I can move backwards and shoot

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.940 
because I can move backwards and shoot
they're<00:01:38.360> technically<00:01:39.360> faster<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.140> tech<00:01:40.439> so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
they're technically faster so tech so

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.090 
they're technically faster so tech so
you<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.820> how<00:01:41.939> you're<00:01:42.119> able<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.570> UM<00:01:42.780> run<00:01:43.649> like

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you know how you're able to UM run like

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800 
you know how you're able to UM run like
move<00:01:44.310> backwards<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.030> shoot<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.390> lot<00:01:45.540> right

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
move backwards and shoot a lot right

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.840 
move backwards and shoot a lot right
with<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> circle<00:01:47.250> pad<00:01:47.280> pro<00:01:48.110> but<00:01:49.640> even<00:01:50.640> though

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
with the circle pad pro but even though

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.429 
with the circle pad pro but even though
doing<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.810> would<00:01:51.930> think<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.200> would<00:01:52.320> make

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
doing that you would think it would make

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.889 
doing that you would think it would make
the<00:01:52.590> game<00:01:52.740> feel<00:01:52.920> easier<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.270> characters

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the game feel easier but the characters

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.560 
the game feel easier but the characters
are<00:01:54.930> tweaked<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.890> bit<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.340> they<00:01:56.850> move<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.390> little

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
are tweaked a bit so they move a little

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
are tweaked a bit so they move a little
bit<00:01:57.659> faster<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.490> whoa

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
bit faster so I was just like whoa

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.429 
bit faster so I was just like whoa
what's<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.570> guy<00:02:00.780> he's<00:02:00.960> moving

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
what's up with this guy he's moving

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.800 
what's up with this guy he's moving
faster<00:02:01.890> I'm<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.369> hell<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.939> then

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
faster I'm like what the hell and then

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.990 
faster I'm like what the hell and then
in<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.140> part<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.770> exploding<00:02:05.490> guy<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
in this part with the exploding guy and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.999 
in this part with the exploding guy and
the<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.210> guy<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.930> fight<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.560> then<00:02:07.950> he

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the one guy that you fight and then he

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.650 
the one guy that you fight and then he
scanned<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.459> dead<00:02:08.640> body<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.360> then<00:02:09.569> you

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
scanned a dead body right and then you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.680 
scanned a dead body right and then you
go<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.020> guy<00:02:10.970> another<00:02:11.970> guy<00:02:12.090> jumped<00:02:12.599> from

go to that guy another guy jumped from

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.640 
go to that guy another guy jumped from
the<00:02:12.870> ceiling<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.290> was<00:02:13.379> like

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the ceiling I was like

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.860 
the ceiling I was like
what<00:02:13.920> there's<00:02:14.250> no<00:02:14.370> three<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.819> these<00:02:14.909> guys<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.840> I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
what there's no three of these guys so I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.009 
what there's no three of these guys so I
killed<00:02:16.230> them<00:02:16.379> right<00:02:16.970> everything<00:02:17.970> oh<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:21.019> the

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
killed them right everything oh so the

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.039 
killed them right everything oh so the
circle<00:02:22.379> pad<00:02:22.409> pro<00:02:22.560> actually<00:02:23.280> adds<00:02:23.519> more<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> it

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
circle pad pro actually adds more to it

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.059 
circle pad pro actually adds more to it
than<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.640> controls<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:28.500> actually<00:02:28.709> adds

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
than just the controls it actually adds

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.330 
than just the controls it actually adds
like<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:30.000> makes<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.329> game<00:02:30.480> harder<00:02:30.989> well<00:02:31.890> not

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
like it makes the game harder well not

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.660 
like it makes the game harder well not
saying<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.500> harder<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.920> control<00:02:35.189> it

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
saying that it's harder to control it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.179 
saying that it's harder to control it
I'm<00:02:35.879> saying<00:02:36.209> harder<00:02:36.720> as<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.379> adds<00:02:37.650> maybe<00:02:38.069> a

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
I'm saying harder as in it adds maybe a

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.059 
I'm saying harder as in it adds maybe a
couple<00:02:38.430> enemies<00:02:39.049> characters<00:02:40.049> get<00:02:40.290> speed

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
couple enemies characters get speed

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.009 
couple enemies characters get speed
boost<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.790> can't<00:02:42.030> believe<00:02:42.120> no<00:02:42.390> one<00:02:42.510> has<00:02:42.659> like

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
boost I can't believe no one has like

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
that I'd probably do it just to make

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.039 
that I'd probably do it just to make
like<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.669> enemies<00:03:21.060> harder<00:03:21.389> if<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.629> find<00:03:21.870> out

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
like the enemies harder if I find out

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.809 
like the enemies harder if I find out
that<00:03:22.109> feels<00:03:22.590> kind<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:22.980> like<00:03:23.040> sluggish<00:03:23.639> like

that feels kind of like sluggish like
there's<00:03:24.329> not<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.510> many<00:03:24.810> things<00:03:25.739> trying<00:03:26.069> to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
there's not that many things trying to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.490 
there's not that many things trying to
attack<00:03:26.430> me<00:03:26.459> it's<00:03:26.730> pop<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.449> in<00:03:27.599> get<00:03:27.959> some<00:03:28.139> faster

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
attack me it's pop it in get some faster

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.780 
attack me it's pop it in get some faster
enemies<00:03:30.949> yeah<00:03:31.949> but<00:03:32.220> uh<00:03:33.319> the<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:35.220> works<00:03:35.549> through

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
enemies yeah but uh the it works through

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.240 
enemies yeah but uh the it works through
infrared<00:03:36.389> right<00:03:36.629> which<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.290> noticed<00:03:37.769> off<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
infrared right which I noticed off the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.869 
infrared right which I noticed off the
bat<00:03:38.430> right<00:03:38.989> so<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.500> would<00:03:40.620> think<00:03:40.769> maybe<00:03:41.159> you

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
bat right so you would think maybe you

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.399 
bat right so you would think maybe you
know<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.120> might<00:03:42.299> be<00:03:42.419> a<00:03:42.449> little<00:03:42.659> bit<00:03:42.840> slow<00:03:43.139> on

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
know it might be a little bit slow on

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.409 
know it might be a little bit slow on
picking<00:03:43.979> up<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.280> movements<00:03:44.819> of<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.090> circle

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
picking up the movements of the circle

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.789 
picking up the movements of the circle
pad<00:03:45.449> pro<00:03:45.949> but<00:03:46.949> it<00:03:47.159> is<00:03:47.459> it's<00:03:48.419> nice<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:49.260> does<00:03:49.590> not

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
pad pro but it is it's nice it does not

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.449 
pad pro but it is it's nice it does not
lag<00:03:50.310> at<00:03:50.609> all<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:51.510> buttons<00:03:51.870> are<00:03:52.049> okay<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:53.069> a

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
you just hop into it you it'll be

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.220 
you just hop into it you it'll be
natural<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:51.090> but<00:04:51.600> since<00:04:51.750> i<00:04:51.900> played<00:04:52.110> the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
natural to you but since i played the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.410 
natural to you but since i played the
demo<00:04:52.380> like<00:04:52.740> five<00:04:53.400> times<00:04:53.670> or<00:04:53.970> something<00:04:54.300> before

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
demo like five times or something before

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.910 
demo like five times or something before
the<00:04:54.930> game<00:04:55.110> even<00:04:55.140> came<00:04:55.560> out<00:04:56.150> i<00:04:57.680> usually<00:04:58.680> use

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
the game even came out i usually use

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.850 
the game even came out i usually use
this<00:04:59.280> button<00:04:59.520> right<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.750> played<00:05:01.590> more<00:05:01.830> than

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
this button right I played more than

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.310 
this button right I played more than
five<00:05:02.160> times<00:05:02.190> but<00:05:02.760> it<00:05:03.090> only<00:05:03.330> shows<00:05:03.780> that<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.050> play

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
five times but it only shows that I play

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.830 
five times but it only shows that I play
25<00:05:04.560> times<00:05:04.800> because<00:05:05.040> it<00:05:05.580> only<00:05:06.000> lets<00:05:06.390> you<00:05:06.510> launch

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
25 times because it only lets you launch

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.140 
25 times because it only lets you launch
it<00:05:07.080> 30<00:05:07.320> times<00:05:07.440> right<00:05:07.920> but<00:05:08.160> you<00:05:08.700> can<00:05:08.850> play<00:05:09.000> as

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
it 30 times right but you can play as

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.450 
it 30 times right but you can play as
many<00:05:09.300> times<00:05:09.630> in<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.080> demo<00:05:10.290> as<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.620> want<00:05:10.860> so<00:05:11.190> I

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
many times in the demo as you want so I

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.610 
many times in the demo as you want so I
could<00:05:11.730> just<00:05:11.880> go<00:05:12.030> into<00:05:12.300> normal<00:05:12.630> again<00:05:12.900> like

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
could just go into normal again like

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.610 
could just go into normal again like
maybe<00:05:13.890> six<00:05:14.310> times<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.210> it<00:05:15.780> won't<00:05:15.810> even<00:05:16.080> know<00:05:16.350> I

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
maybe six times and it won't even know I

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.100 
maybe six times and it won't even know I
think<00:05:16.980> they<00:05:17.100> should<00:05:17.280> fix<00:05:17.520> that<00:05:17.930> because<00:05:18.930> then

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
think they should fix that because then

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.750 
think they should fix that because then
it<00:05:19.200> will<00:05:19.290> actually<00:05:19.530> get<00:05:20.040> deleted<00:05:20.400> when<00:05:20.640> it

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
it will actually get deleted when it

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.080 
it will actually get deleted when it
should<00:05:21.000> be<00:05:21.180> right<00:05:22.490> my<00:05:23.490> school<00:05:23.700> they<00:05:23.850> have<00:05:23.970> the

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
should be right my school they have the

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.910 
should be right my school they have the
demo<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.420> could<00:05:24.630> show<00:05:24.780> my<00:05:24.930> friends<00:05:25.320> it<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:25.650> then

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
demo I could show my friends it and then

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.090 
demo I could show my friends it and then
not<00:05:26.220> have<00:05:26.460> them<00:05:26.670> play<00:05:26.880> my<00:05:27.060> file<00:05:27.420> I<00:05:27.660> hate

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
not have them play my file I hate

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.240 
not have them play my file I hate
