00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.090 
basically just drawing a straight line
from<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.270> end<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.899> your<00:01:52.290> nail<00:01:52.590> where<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.979> meets

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
from the end of your nail where it meets

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.060 
from the end of your nail where it meets
the<00:01:53.369> skin<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> highest<00:01:55.229> point<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
the skin up to the highest point in the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.680 
the skin up to the highest point in the
middle<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.340> your

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
middle of your

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.670 
middle of your
I<00:01:56.720> don't<00:01:56.900> know<00:01:56.960> if<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.140> makes<00:01:57.290> sense<00:01:57.500> that

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
I don't know if that makes sense that

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.070 
I don't know if that makes sense that
you're<00:01:57.800> just<00:01:57.980> basically<00:01:58.520> making<00:01:58.850> two<00:01:59.570> points

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
you're just basically making two points

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.830 
you're just basically making two points
as<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:00.500> can<00:02:00.830> see<00:02:01.010> here<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:01.630> there's<00:02:02.630> going<00:02:02.780> to

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
as you can see here and there's going to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.360 
as you can see here and there's going to
be<00:02:02.900> like<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.230> triangle<00:02:03.560> area<00:02:03.980> which<00:02:04.190> you're

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
be like a triangle area which you're

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.010 
be like a triangle area which you're
just<00:02:04.520> gonna<00:02:04.670> fill<00:02:04.910> in<00:02:05.060> with<00:02:05.240> one<00:02:05.450> quick<00:02:05.690> swipe

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
just gonna fill in with one quick swipe

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.370 
just gonna fill in with one quick swipe
and<00:02:07.000> then<00:02:08.000> again<00:02:08.270> just<00:02:08.510> cleaning<00:02:08.840> up<00:02:08.930> the<00:02:09.140> skin

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
and then again just cleaning up the skin

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.470 
and then again just cleaning up the skin
around<00:02:09.500> my<00:02:09.770> nails<00:02:09.950> all<00:02:10.820> right<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.150> let's<00:02:11.330> go

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
ahead and take a look at method number

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.580 
ahead and take a look at method number
three<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.420> for<00:02:14.630> method<00:02:14.900> number<00:02:15.140> three<00:02:15.410> I'm

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
three so for method number three I'm

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.260 
three so for method number three I'm
basically<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:16.010> doing<00:02:16.370> upward<00:02:16.760> swiping

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270
