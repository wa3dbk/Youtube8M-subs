i<00:01:07.350> don't<00:01:07.619> keep<00:01:07.830> resolutions<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:09.119> i

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
i don't keep resolutions because i

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.640 
i don't keep resolutions because i
learned<00:01:09.479> very<00:01:09.540> early<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.290> life<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.619> i

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
learned very early in my life that i

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.160 
learned very early in my life that i
couldn't<00:01:10.950> keep<00:01:11.070> them<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.240> very<00:01:12.420> difficult<00:01:12.689> so

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
couldn't keep them so very difficult so

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.760 
couldn't keep them so very difficult so
i<00:01:13.200> don't

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.499

similar<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.709> me<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.100> person<00:02:17.670> like<00:02:17.910> Veronica

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
similar to me in person like Veronica

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.340 
similar to me in person like Veronica
was<00:02:18.630> not

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
I think Veronica as a character as a

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.390 
I think Veronica as a character as a
person<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.290> very<00:02:22.470> different<00:02:22.800> from<00:02:22.890> how<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.100> am

person is very different from how I am
personally<00:02:23.940> but
