the lathe dog the workpiece would simply
stop<00:00:55.550> turning<00:00:55.880> as<00:00:56.420> soon<00:00:56.660> as<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.899> cutting<00:00:57.200> tool

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
stop turning as soon as the cutting tool

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.220 
stop turning as soon as the cutting tool
came<00:00:57.680> in<00:00:57.800> contact<00:00:58.010> with<00:00:58.370> it

turning<00:01:00.230> between<00:01:00.590> centers<00:01:01.010> has<00:01:01.220> an<00:01:01.399> advantage

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
turning between centers has an advantage

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.389 
turning between centers has an advantage
over<00:01:02.030> using<00:01:02.360> a<00:01:02.570> lathe<00:01:02.780> chuck<00:01:03.040> because<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:04.189> uses

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
over using a lathe chuck because it uses

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.670 
over using a lathe chuck because it uses
the<00:01:04.670> lathes<00:01:04.909> centerline<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.380> parts
