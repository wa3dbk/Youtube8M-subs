just a little cheaper just because they

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.749 
just a little cheaper just because they
are<00:01:16.500> cardboard<00:01:16.770> instead<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.250> being<00:01:17.400> plastic

are cardboard instead of being plastic
it<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.869> little<00:01:19.170> kind<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.830> more<00:01:20.189> difficult<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it is a little kind of more difficult to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.390 
it is a little kind of more difficult to
insert<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.470> smooth<00:01:23.070> as

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
the same thing pretty much and it is

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.500 
the same thing pretty much and it is
very<00:03:18.700> comparable<00:03:19.389> to<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.980> Tampax<00:03:21.880> radiant<00:03:21.970> I

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
very comparable to the Tampax radiant I

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.319 
very comparable to the Tampax radiant I
have<00:03:23.230> used<00:03:23.410> both<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:24.220> Tampax<00:03:24.910> pearl<00:03:25.150> and

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
have used both of the Tampax pearl and

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.309 
have used both of the Tampax pearl and
the<00:03:25.510> radiant<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.620> only<00:03:27.250> only<00:03:27.579> only

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
the radiant the only only only

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.910 
the radiant the only only only
difference<00:03:29.319> i<00:03:29.650> can<00:03:30.370> find<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.569> one<00:03:32.079> has<00:03:32.889> a

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
difference i can find is that one has a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.759 
difference i can find is that one has a
sticker<00:03:33.280> on<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.609> outside<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:35.560> other

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
sticker on the outside and the other

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.160 
sticker on the outside and the other
doesn't<00:03:36.130> so<00:03:36.519> you<00:03:36.579> open<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.000> this<00:03:37.180> way<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.810> a

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
doesn't so you open it this way and a

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.780 
doesn't so you open it this way and a
Tampax<00:03:38.590> pro<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:38.980> open<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.280> from<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.549> side

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
just push this one's a little easier to

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.470 
just push this one's a little easier to
push<00:04:59.620> out<00:04:59.800> that's<00:05:00.669> it<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:00.970> then<00:05:01.120> when<00:05:01.360> you're

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
push out that's it and then when you're

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.840 
push out that's it and then when you're
all<00:05:01.540> done<00:05:02.200> you<00:05:02.800> can<00:05:02.950> open<00:05:03.280> up<00:05:03.370> this<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.700> key

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
part again and put it in there I guess

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.700 
part again and put it in there I guess
the<00:05:07.600> insides<00:05:07.960> more<00:05:08.260> like<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:09.610> see<00:05:09.730> that<00:05:09.850> cloth

so here is the compact one it's very
very<00:05:48.100> tiny<00:05:48.870> compared<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.910> camp<00:05:51.910> axe

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
very tiny compared to the camp axe

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.350 
very tiny compared to the camp axe
radiant<00:05:52.770> it's<00:05:53.770> tiny<00:05:54.100> so<00:05:54.790> what<00:05:55.090> you<00:05:55.150> do<00:05:55.270> with

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
radiant it's tiny so what you do with

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.710 
radiant it's tiny so what you do with
this<00:05:55.450> one<00:05:55.690> it's<00:05:56.560> just<00:05:56.830> like<00:05:57.479> open<00:05:58.479> it<00:05:58.570> like
