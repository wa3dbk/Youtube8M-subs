description of the video but I'd suggest

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.240 
description of the video but I'd suggest
just<00:00:19.390> watching<00:00:20.320> it'll<00:00:20.560> be<00:00:20.650> a<00:00:20.680> lot<00:00:20.800> easier<00:00:20.860> to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
just watching it'll be a lot easier to

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.780 
just watching it'll be a lot easier to
understand<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.939> quicker<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.800> all<00:00:24.520> things

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
understand and quicker so all things

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.760 
understand and quicker so all things
crafting<00:00:25.450> are<00:00:25.599> going<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:25.899> be<00:00:25.989> done<00:00:26.200> in<00:00:26.470> one<00:00:26.500> of

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
crafting are going to be done in one of

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.069 
crafting are going to be done in one of
two<00:00:27.009> places<00:00:27.040> the<00:00:28.000> first<00:00:28.239> and<00:00:28.390> most<00:00:28.480> important

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
two places the first and most important

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.870 
two places the first and most important
is<00:00:29.230> right<00:00:29.470> here<00:00:29.770> with<00:00:29.950> a<00:00:30.040> molecular<00:00:30.460> printer

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
is right here with a molecular printer

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.090 
is right here with a molecular printer
and<00:00:31.149> the<00:00:31.599> second<00:00:32.020> is<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.200> marketplace

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
and the second is the marketplace

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.970 
and the second is the marketplace
terminal<00:00:33.930> which<00:00:34.930> can<00:00:35.110> also<00:00:35.230> be<00:00:35.350> accessed<00:00:35.590> by

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
terminal which can also be accessed by

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.660 
terminal which can also be accessed by
pressing<00:00:36.100> T<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.590> let's<00:00:38.890> start<00:00:39.100> out<00:00:39.219> with<00:00:39.250> the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
pressing T so let's start out with the

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.700 
pressing T so let's start out with the
first<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:40.570> most<00:00:40.660> important<00:00:41.170> which<00:00:41.410> is<00:00:41.559> the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
first and most important which is the

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.919 
first and most important which is the
lucky<00:00:42.280> allure<00:00:42.460> printer<00:00:42.820> when<00:00:43.660> you<00:00:43.719> press<00:00:43.899> it

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
lucky allure printer when you press it

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.200 
lucky allure printer when you press it
on<00:00:44.199> it<00:00:44.350> it'll<00:00:44.530> bring<00:00:44.710> up<00:00:44.859> three<00:00:45.129> options<00:00:45.370> you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
on it it'll bring up three options you

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
on it it'll bring up three options you
can<00:00:46.390> refine<00:00:46.899> manufacture<00:00:47.890> or<00:00:48.129> research<00:00:48.719> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
can refine manufacture or research so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.319 
can refine manufacture or research so
researching<00:00:50.920> is<00:00:51.280> pretty<00:00:51.670> important<00:00:52.120> but

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
researching is pretty important but

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.630 
researching is pretty important but
we'll<00:00:52.449> get<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.629> that<00:00:52.749> at<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.079> end<00:00:53.370> let's<00:00:54.370> start

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
we'll get to that at the end let's start

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.340 
we'll get to that at the end let's start
out<00:00:54.730> with<00:00:54.910> manufacturing<00:00:55.809> which<00:00:56.050> is<00:00:56.199> the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
out with manufacturing which is the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.860 
out with manufacturing which is the
actual<00:00:56.710> crafting<00:00:57.399> of<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.699> item<00:00:58.030> you<00:00:58.809> would
