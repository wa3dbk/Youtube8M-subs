00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
device more than anything else so you're

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.280 
device more than anything else so you're
not<00:02:51.890> really<00:02:52.160> going<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.490> need<00:02:52.790> Siri<00:02:53.690> for<00:02:54.110> this

not really going to need Siri for this
um<00:02:54.910> because<00:02:55.910> if<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.750> think<00:02:56.780> about<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.230> when

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
um because if you think about it when

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.430 
um because if you think about it when
you<00:02:57.920> use<00:02:58.010> Siri<00:02:58.370> what<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.300> imagine<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.080> don't<00:03:00.320> have

you go along with your day most likely

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.880 
you go along with your day most likely
not<00:04:07.550> so<00:04:08.150> it's<00:04:08.390> definitely<00:04:08.900> not<00:04:09.080> now<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.830> you

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
not so it's definitely not now that you

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.620 
not so it's definitely not now that you
really<00:04:10.100> think<00:04:10.310> about<00:04:10.370> it's<00:04:10.670> not<00:04:10.790> necessarily

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
really think about it's not necessarily

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.420 
really think about it's not necessarily
a<00:04:11.690> key<00:04:11.930> feature<00:04:12.140> that<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:12.830> has<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.220> have

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
a key feature that it has to have

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.550 
a key feature that it has to have
because<00:04:14.300> yes<00:04:14.660> it's<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:14.959> cool<00:04:15.230> thing<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.440> have

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
because yes it's a cool thing to have

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.460 
because yes it's a cool thing to have
and<00:04:16.010> you<00:04:16.880> know<00:04:16.910> if<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.660> I<00:04:17.690> they<00:04:18.200> weren't

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
and you know if the I they weren't

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.990 
and you know if the I they weren't
trying<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:18.769> keep<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.100> with<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.310> exclusive

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
trying to keep it with the exclusive

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.480 
trying to keep it with the exclusive
with<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.480> iphone<00:04:20.989> 4s<00:04:21.500> I<00:04:21.650> would<00:04:21.770> say<00:04:21.890> hey<00:04:22.250> just

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
with the iphone 4s I would say hey just

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.040 
with the iphone 4s I would say hey just
throw<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.729> in<00:04:22.820> there<00:04:23.000> because<00:04:23.120> we<00:04:23.720> all<00:04:23.870> know

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
throw it in there because we all know

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.870 
throw it in there because we all know
that<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.350> can<00:04:24.380> work<00:04:24.770> because<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.490> works<00:04:25.640> on<00:04:25.789> the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
that it can work because it works on the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.300 
that it can work because it works on the
iphone

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
iphone

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.850 
iphone
for<00:04:26.460> if<00:04:26.639> you<00:04:26.910> saw<00:04:27.090> my<00:04:27.150> video<00:04:27.330> before<00:04:27.680> they<00:04:28.680> had

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
for if you saw my video before they had

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.320 
for if you saw my video before they had
that<00:04:28.889> hack<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:30.060> let<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.919> iphone<00:04:31.919> 4s<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.970> mean

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
that hack that let the iphone 4s I mean

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.110 
that hack that let the iphone 4s I mean
the<00:04:33.419> iphone<00:04:33.720> 4<00:04:33.990> actually<00:04:34.440> use<00:04:34.680> Siri<00:04:35.100> now<00:04:35.639> yes

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
the iphone 4 actually use Siri now yes

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.960 
the iphone 4 actually use Siri now yes
it<00:04:36.389> would<00:04:36.750> it's<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.530> network-based<00:04:37.889> process<00:04:38.760> so

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
it would it's a network-based process so

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.430 
it would it's a network-based process so
it<00:04:39.120> would<00:04:39.270> slow<00:04:39.450> down<00:04:39.510> a<00:04:39.720> network<00:04:40.080> of<00:04:40.200> ahead

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
it would slow down a network of ahead

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.350 
it would slow down a network of ahead
more<00:04:40.800> than<00:04:40.950> one<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.340> their<00:04:41.460> devices<00:04:41.760> using<00:04:42.120> it

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
more than one of their devices using it

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.330 
more than one of their devices using it
but<00:04:42.750> yeah<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:42.960> could<00:04:43.500> definitely<00:04:43.680> see<00:04:43.980> them

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
but yeah I could definitely see them

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.600 
but yeah I could definitely see them
putting<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.540> on<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.990> ipad<00:04:46.440> if<00:04:46.740> they<00:04:46.919> needed<00:04:47.250> to

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
putting it on the ipad if they needed to

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.060 
putting it on the ipad if they needed to
but<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.210> thing<00:04:48.419> is<00:04:48.450> they<00:04:49.380> honestly<00:04:49.770> don't

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
but the thing is they honestly don't

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.659 
but the thing is they honestly don't
need<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.780> again<00:04:51.780> because<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:53.280> probably

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
need to again because you you probably

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.070 
need to again because you you probably
wouldn't<00:04:54.030> need<00:04:54.180> it<00:04:54.330> if<00:04:54.480> you<00:04:54.600> think<00:04:54.840> about<00:04:54.900> it

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
wouldn't need it if you think about it

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.290 
wouldn't need it if you think about it
you'll<00:04:55.410> say<00:04:55.590> hey<00:04:56.040> that's<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.340> cool<00:04:56.490> feature<00:04:56.850> for

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
you'll say hey that's a cool feature for

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.330 
you'll say hey that's a cool feature for
like<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.660> first<00:04:57.840> month<00:04:58.230> and<00:04:58.500> then<00:04:58.979> you'll<00:04:59.190> go

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340
