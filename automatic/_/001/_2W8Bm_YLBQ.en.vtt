00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.530
 wood is a fuel that comes back 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.239
 in force with households and 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.950
 communities for reasons 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.410
 ethical economic and 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.970
 environmental it represents 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.559
 currently two-thirds of the energies 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.559
 renewable energy consumed in the region 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.340
 but an increase in demand for 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.410
 wood becomes a major issue for the 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.780
 forest management 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.150
 the foresters of the CNFP national center 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.379
 of forest ownership works in 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.900
 Poitou Charentes for this energy 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.990
 remains renewable by popularizing 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.090
 good management practices more too 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.770
 often poor wood combustion 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.509
 causes atmospheric pollution 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.390
 and contributes to the waste of this 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.160
 noble matter the wood energy will be able 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.780
 continue to develop only with 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:26.090
 the use of combustion appliances 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:27.649
 performing for some years the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.780
 preservation of our environment is 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.420
 at the heart of the concerns exchange the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.229
 consumption patterns compared to 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.149
 fossil fuels 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.869
 the wood has all the assets to seduce 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.039
 households and communities 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.660
 firstly its cost is clearly 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.170
 lower than other energies 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.860
 such as electricity the fuel oil or the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.360
 gas the price of wood energy is very 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.990
 variable depending on the type of 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.310
 combustible 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.319
 the log the platelets or the granule 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.050
 second asset for wood is a 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.700
 local energy while the fuel 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.319
 requires to go through a few thousand 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.470
 kilometers to be routed in 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.599
 our homes with equal energy wood 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.819
 generates more local jobs with a 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:16.030
 variety of trades loggers 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.530
 longshoremen distributors 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.110
 In Poitou Charentes the forest represents 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.160
 approximately 17% of the territory it wants 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.980
 say that on 100 hectares of territory 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.380
 we have seventeen hectares of forests which 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.940
 is a region not very forest by 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.990
 compared to the rest of France since in 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.490
 average in France we reach 25 % 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.380
 but it still represents two 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.110
 million cubic meters operated annually 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.370
 on its forests and on these two million 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.260
 cubic meters we have about 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.360
 three quarters to a million and a half that's 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.090
 firewood wood energy and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.220
 so for foresters 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.980
 it was an important outlet for the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.950
 forest currently 90% of these forests 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.930
 are private and their timber earnings 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.970
 negligible weight heating for 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.890
 forest owners 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.060
 so today the energies 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.700
 renewable 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.940
 like whose wood represents roughly 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.760
 15% of our energy consumption 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.560
 region and the share of wood is the most 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.330
 important of these renewable energies 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.940
 who therefore understand the wood first 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.840
 after the wind a photovoltaic a 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.560
 little bit of hydraulics 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.120
 but it's still the wood that's the most 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.130
 important renewable energy 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.709
 today in Poitou Charentes and the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.989
 share of the wood keeps increasing 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.280
 since there is a particular demand in 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.680
 shredded wood that increase 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.420
 regularly producing wood 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.580
 energy and as said jean marc 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.630
 very important but you have to of course 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.220
 know that as part of a management 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.989
 sustainable energy production is 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.310
 not an end in itself it is necessary to 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.950
 stand improvement like 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.599
 like the to drive them to the 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.319
 long-term lumber production 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:53.080
 but in a sustainable and 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.640
 reasoned 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.890
 the production of wood energy must 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.840
 not be a priority should not be 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.700
 principal from a heritage point of view 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.830
 already it's more interesting for a 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.750
 owner to have to have some 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.910
 high quality standing stands 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 as these stands there will become 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.510
 in a few years 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.210
 it's also more important from a point of 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.000
 ecological view because the forest allows for 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.450
 set the carbon a tree on average its 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.769
 150 years of growth on foot 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.210
 during his one hundred and fifty years he goes 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.520
 fix the carbon and once used in 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.280
 lumber it will not be consumed will be 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.050
 So not burn carbon boisne 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.550
 will remain fixed in the in the material 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.070
 wood in the beams in the furniture 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.690
 and will not be discharging into the atmosphere 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.310
 right after after 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:44.080
 wood consumption in the chimney or 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:46.180
 in the boiler despite all the forest 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.830
 will always produce energy wood because 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.540
 we can not produce wood 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.940
 without producing energy wood 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.380
 wood energy is essential when 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.870
 improvements in the thinnings 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.110
 for the use of crowns of 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.090
 yayi sap branches can not be valued 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.680
 than wood energy so this share 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.630
 important wood will always be 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.630
 for the firewood market 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.650
 wood is mainly made of 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.919
 carbon and hydrogen taken from 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.110
 the atmosphere the soil and the water when it 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.480
 is burned it re releases carbon under 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.910
 form of carbon dioxide responsible for 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.900
 the greenhouse effect told me that a forest 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.700
 managed sustainably 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.539
 when you do not use more wood 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.039
 that she is capable of producing 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.629
 the wood is classified among the energies 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.569
 renewable in the same way as the 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.139
 solar wind power since in fact a 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:40.889
 tree is a solar collector 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:42.389
 powered by the sun's energy and in 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.919
 the leaves is happening a phenomenon that 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.979
 calls photosynthesis actually which is 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.139
 the extraction of carbon from the atmosphere 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.120
 so carbon dioxide is contained in 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.219
 the atmosphere is associated carbon 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.819
 with oxygen the carbon is extracted from 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:58.469
 the atmosphere and in the form of wood this 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.819
 carbon is deposited in different 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.219
 parts of the tree the branches the trunk 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.889
 the roots and then when we roll 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.870
 after exploitation this wood in fact we do not 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.849
 does that re release the carbon we 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.060
 had extracted that the tree extracted in 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.560
 the atmosphere and as such it is said that the 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.949
 wood is a renewable energy 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.569
 but against this energy will be 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.520
 renewable only if managed 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.659
 correctly the forest and that's the 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.210
 the work of foresters or 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:27.150
 forest managers who have to 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.409
 to ensure that no more than 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.180
 wood in the forest that she can 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:33.089
 produce and ensure renewal 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.500
 plots as and when they 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:38.339
 exploitation so-called management 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.719
 sustainable forest energy 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:40.439
 renewable is not always a 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.949
 clean energy 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:45.779
 a badly burned wood and paul ouin it releases 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:48.110
 carcinogenic dust in quantities 

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:52.819
 important and chemical compounds 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:55.919
 tar carbon monoxide bunsen etc 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:58.289
 What is a badly burned wood? 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.969
 combustion with a lack of oxygen by 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.979
 example in a wood stove or a 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:02.310
 insert so that the fire lasts longer 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:04.860
 long time 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:08.189
 we reduce the oxygen supply by closing 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.569
 the combustion draw is idling 

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:11.569
 but hot seat then incomplete 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.419
 if we summarize the wood is an energy 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.280
 at low cost to heat it's a 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:21.120
 local energy that favor the 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.220
 job development 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.600
 it's a renewable energy to 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.520
 condition that the amount of wood 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.770
 taken does not impede the regeneration of 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.150
 the forest resource the production of 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.620
 firewood is not a priority 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.509
 of forest management 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.310
 however, it is an outlet for 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:37.229
 value the by-products and the small 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.820
 wood energy wood pollute less 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:40.820
 when the combustion is complete
