00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
dirt with my mouse hid the one key

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.950 
dirt with my mouse hid the one key
switches<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.399> over<00:01:02.640> everything<00:01:03.539> looks<00:01:03.780> good

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
but then diamonds

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.270 
but then diamonds
strange<00:01:08.920> very<00:01:09.700> strange<00:01:10.620> it<00:01:11.620> works<00:01:11.890> with<00:01:12.040> rails

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
strange very strange it works with rails

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.400 
strange very strange it works with rails
to<00:01:12.640> so<00:01:13.570> try<00:01:13.870> and<00:01:13.990> place<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.410> rail<00:01:14.910> diamonds

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
to so try and place the rail diamonds

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.620 
to so try and place the rail diamonds
minecarts<00:01:19.230> diamonds<00:01:20.230> it<00:01:20.470> can<00:01:21.130> be<00:01:21.310> any<00:01:21.760> slot<00:01:22.360> to

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
minecarts diamonds it can be any slot to

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.630 
minecarts diamonds it can be any slot to
it's<00:01:22.870> not<00:01:23.050> just<00:01:23.440> slot<00:01:23.680> number<00:01:23.860> one<00:01:24.220> so<00:01:24.490> we<00:01:24.610> can

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
it's not just slot number one so we can

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:34.730 
it's not just slot number one so we can
even<00:01:24.970> turn<00:01:25.150> these<00:01:25.420> diamonds<00:01:26.310> into<00:01:32.100> class

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
even turn these diamonds into class

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.170 
even turn these diamonds into class
pretty<00:01:35.740> cool<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.580> it<00:01:36.700> does<00:01:36.850> work<00:01:37.030> with

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
pretty cool and it does work with

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:45.030 
pretty cool and it does work with
potions<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:39.660> we<00:01:40.660> can<00:01:40.900> do<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:43.590> try<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.710> use<00:01:44.860> it

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
potions so we can do this try and use it

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.270 
potions so we can do this try and use it
turns<00:01:45.400> into<00:01:45.580> glass<00:01:46.500> splash<00:01:47.500> potion

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
turns into glass splash potion

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.890 
turns into glass splash potion
turns<00:01:50.280> into<00:01:50.460> glass<00:01:50.730> eye<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.900> ender<00:01:55.250> diamond

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
turns into glass eye of ender diamond

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.500 
turns into glass eye of ender diamond
so<00:01:58.550> yeah<00:01:59.550> it's<00:01:59.910> just<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.180> weird<00:02:00.330> little

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
so yeah it's just a weird little

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.000 
so yeah it's just a weird little
