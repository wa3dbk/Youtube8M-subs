hurt sparking a bit okay so now what
we're<00:01:17.240> going<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.479> do<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:17.780> we're<00:01:17.960> going<00:01:18.110> to

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.040 
we're going to do is we're going to
continue<00:01:18.440> I<00:01:19.060> usually<00:01:20.060> start<00:01:20.479> with<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.810> two

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
continue I usually start with the two

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.960 
continue I usually start with the two
middle<00:01:21.380> toes<00:01:21.770> because<00:01:22.220> those<00:01:22.729> are<00:01:22.940> the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
middle toes because those are the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.450 
middle toes because those are the
easiest<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.690> start<00:01:23.960> with<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.259> when<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:25.250> go<00:01:25.430> to

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
easiest to start with it when I go to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.280 
easiest to start with it when I go to
the<00:01:25.729> sides<00:01:26.000> afterwards<00:01:27.820> okay<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.210> like<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.229> said

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
the sides afterwards okay so like I said

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.100 
the sides afterwards okay so like I said
just<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.369> tip<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.759> don't<00:01:32.270> do<00:01:32.720> this<00:01:32.869> too

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.130 
just the tip and don't do this too
quickly<00:01:33.850> I'm<00:01:34.850> trying<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.330> take<00:01:35.509> my<00:01:35.690> time<00:01:35.720> here

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
sometimes you can let them grow out

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.220 
sometimes you can let them grow out
pretty<00:03:37.730> long<00:03:37.999> and<00:03:38.269> then<00:03:38.390> clip<00:03:38.629> them<00:03:38.900> but<00:03:39.140> I

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
pretty long and then clip them but I

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.110 
pretty long and then clip them but I
like<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.799> keep<00:03:39.980> them<00:03:40.189> pretty<00:03:40.489> short<00:03:40.849> so<00:03:40.969> that

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
like to keep them pretty short so that

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.599 
like to keep them pretty short so that
the<00:03:41.389> quick<00:03:41.659> doesn't<00:03:42.049> grow<00:03:42.230> up<00:03:42.409> too<00:03:42.680> much<00:03:44.170> okay

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
the quick doesn't grow up too much okay

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.750 
the quick doesn't grow up too much okay
and<00:03:46.609> a<00:03:47.359> guinea<00:03:47.569> pig<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:48.469> groups<00:03:48.760> sometimes

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
and a guinea pig the groups sometimes

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.119 
and a guinea pig the groups sometimes
they<00:03:50.150> jerk<00:03:50.359> their<00:03:50.569> feet<00:03:50.749> away<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:51.590> no<00:03:51.709> worries

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
they jerk their feet away but no worries

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.490 
they jerk their feet away but no worries
because<00:03:52.670> if<00:03:52.909> you<00:03:53.239> only<00:03:53.480> click<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.109> tip<00:03:54.319> off

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
because if you only click the tip off

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.319 
because if you only click the tip off
then<00:03:54.799> you<00:03:54.920> know<00:03:55.069> that<00:03:55.099> you<00:03:55.489> that<00:03:55.879> you're<00:03:56.060> in<00:03:56.180> no

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
then you know that you that you're in no

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.009 
then you know that you that you're in no
danger<00:03:56.359> of<00:03:56.870> making<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.709> male<00:03:57.889> lead<00:03:58.719> if<00:03:59.719> the

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
danger of making the male lead if the

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.770 
danger of making the male lead if the
nail<00:04:00.170> does<00:04:00.560> bleed<00:04:00.859> however<00:04:01.419> what<00:04:02.419> you<00:04:02.540> want<00:04:02.719> to

they'll be just fine okay so now we're

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.629 
they'll be just fine okay so now we're
going<00:04:20.449> to<00:04:20.539> work<00:04:20.780> on<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> back<00:04:21.199> feet<00:04:21.530> a<00:04:21.799> guinea

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
going to work on the back feet a guinea

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.330 
going to work on the back feet a guinea
pig<00:04:22.729> has<00:04:23.120> four<00:04:23.479> toes<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:23.930> front<00:04:24.259> feet<00:04:24.530> and

it<00:04:46.970> is<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.120> little<00:04:47.420> harder<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:47.960> hold<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.380> back

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
it is a little harder to hold the back

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.360 
it is a little harder to hold the back
feet<00:04:49.810> but<00:04:50.810> once<00:04:51.230> you<00:04:51.440> get<00:04:51.620> them<00:04:51.830> then<00:04:52.130> it's

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
feet but once you get them then it's

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:59.170 
feet but once you get them then it's
fine<00:04:52.900> okay<00:04:53.980> there<00:04:54.980> we<00:04:55.130> go<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:56.120> see<00:04:57.040> okay<00:04:58.180> now

fine okay there we go you see okay now

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.940 
fine okay there we go you see okay now
you<00:04:59.240> see<00:04:59.420> his<00:05:00.080> back<00:05:00.320> feet<00:05:00.530> again<00:05:00.920> are<00:05:01.220> black<00:05:01.550> so

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
you see his back feet again are black so

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.770 
you see his back feet again are black so
it's<00:05:03.950> going<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.340> be<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.550> little<00:05:04.880> tricky<00:05:05.360> as<00:05:05.540> well

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
it's going to be a little tricky as well

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.710 
it's going to be a little tricky as well
so<00:05:06.680> just<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:07.190> back<00:05:07.400> toes<00:05:07.730> tend<00:05:08.150> to<00:05:08.300> be<00:05:08.420> a<00:05:08.450> lot

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
so just the back toes tend to be a lot

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.030 
so just the back toes tend to be a lot
thicker<00:05:09.200> on<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.250> front<00:05:10.490> toes<00:05:10.900> so<00:05:11.900> it's<00:05:12.140> i<00:05:12.770> find

sometimes you think oh if I clip it
twice<00:07:20.009> then<00:07:20.430> you<00:07:20.850> know<00:07:20.940> because<00:07:21.210> it's<00:07:21.360> still

twice then you know because it's still
too<00:07:21.690> long<00:07:21.840> but<00:07:22.110> sometimes<00:07:22.530> you<00:07:22.710> can<00:07:22.889> actually

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:23.449
