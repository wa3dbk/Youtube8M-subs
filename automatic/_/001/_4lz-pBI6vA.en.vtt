00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.049
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.630
 online pond school video 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.220
 to the second part of the odyssey and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.449
 vortex of the filter co look out there 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.970
 enters the water the water is sucked 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.710
 from this pump this pump is like a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 pool pump but a little bit more 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.260
 advanced already of continuous use and so on 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.640
 this is called multi cyclones this is a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.920
 particle separator also the same 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.320
 what does this red ball do that is the same 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.199
 ball that have the benzines have 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.539
 pool or may know that recognize 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.160
 lever for the filtered washing the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.090
 rinse 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.710
 the emptying and everything then sucks the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.270
 pond water out there through the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.309
 I congratulate you to teach to do 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.290
 solution to this engine that you have in your 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.780
 basket for large particles passes 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.449
 by the multi cyclones of the multi cyclones 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.129
 by this tube enters the big ball 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.660
 red carrying a load of glass that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.840
 not sand that is much more effective 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.979
 come through there for the boom you see that it has 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.509
 put under it the entrance passes through the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:23.550
 leaves the v enters another v this is 72 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.650
 Watts is 36 and a part passes 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.220
 this is it and that already stays as a filter 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.630
 biological we already have filter filters 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.580
 mechanical than the mechanical situation in 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.950
 the multi cyclone class is a small 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.450
 part is made by the engine and another great part 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 it does the appearance of the neck 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.869
 and for the most part it's this this 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.310
 red and then on the biological penetration 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.500
 so does black with sponges 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.360
 what is your true role and not what 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.250
 I was doing it is a bit crushed 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.840
 because my puppies are super friendly 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.670
 and they are dedicated to stealing the corners 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.069
 then how do you have the spare of everything 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.049
 I'm going to buy you at least new stage 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.490
 so that it is perfect they have put a 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.770
 Special silicone gasket so you do not 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.170
 return the water enter everything 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.149
 out and that's how the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.360
 little room in this room and everything always 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.099
 in quotes of the filter with this 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.290
 fourth is two and a half meters wide 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.440
 and even then I will have little space to 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.840
 move inside this is the fourth of 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.940
 pond machines 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.099
 then take three bombs or base like this 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.709
 that what they do will each under 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.330
 each river footbridge and what they do is 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.340
 catch water by the shell this 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.849
 you see and drop a powerful jet of water 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.069
 by the cuff this in that way what 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.340
 let's do is create a stream in 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.660
 the river you fuck is going to catch the water 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.879
 the water will come out here because it is 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.090
 charge the and others that are going to put here 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.549
 down very close to the surface to 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.860
 that boosts water up 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:58.800
 I not an oxygenator also an aerator 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.870
 and here under this one 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.790
 passarella goes to a bomb that goes 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.920
 boosting water in this direction 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.540
 over there around here 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.540
 right here below this one 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.560
 here under this footbridge goes another 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.050
 pump that drives the water there 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.319
 and here below this walkway a 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:27.160
 third drive pump that moves the 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.930
 water to there the water will run runs the 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.709
 slide will run look that in two bonuses 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.250
 water lily will run to where the 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.319
 This is going to be the solution for 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.989
 here for the box that is already submerged and 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.540
 takes these flexible tubes that go to 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.190
 entering here in reality is much more 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.440
 simple of what seems to me costs me 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.010
 I swear that it costs me I felt 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.200
 super ready when with a muff that 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.330
 it's a rubber tube there are some 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.330
 connections get it out 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:07.600
 and there's my attention deficit I got 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.069
 remove from suction pumps 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.810
 the water connection to the filter 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.310
 pass it on the ub all that I felt 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.500
 super smart to say goodbye what good 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.440
 I am not only I am handsome also soloist already 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.910
 I have everything but the truth is that this 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.709
 is the time I'm amazing then the 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.120
 programming of the device this me the 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.490
 they have to do and I have to 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.140
 explain very well because as it was 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.000
 all with solar panels in the hour in 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.430
 the hours of the day that has more sunshine 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.480
 they work at full capacity and then 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.700
 that program so that performance 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.260
 go down and go for example half of 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.990
 speed during the night so you do not 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.780
 discharge the batteries too much so 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.289
 well let's go for here I 'm not going to ask 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.719
 still because surely 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.789
 surely surely today I do not know if 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:51.490
 the good filter is determined to see 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:55.360
 what's up this is a little manic like that 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.279
 What I will ask the builder is to focus 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.219
 I saw it there we will paint it and what 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:05.460
 we will put super monkey obviously 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:05.460
 the roof we will put tomorrow
