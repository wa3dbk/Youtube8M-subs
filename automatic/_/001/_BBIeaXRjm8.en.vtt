I'm gonna be using a set of 370z wheels
a<00:00:06.000> change<00:00:06.899> wheels<00:00:08.179> on<00:00:09.179> my<00:00:10.370> 2002<00:00:11.370> Nissan<00:00:11.580> Maxima

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
but I noticed I think it's all wheels

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.310 
but I noticed I think it's all wheels
but<00:00:16.440> mainly<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.039> front<00:00:17.369> ones<00:00:17.750> they<00:00:18.750> get<00:00:18.930> stuck

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
but mainly the front ones they get stuck

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.700 
but mainly the front ones they get stuck
so<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.779> really<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> hard<00:00:22.289> time<00:00:22.500> getting

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
so you really have a hard time getting

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.660 
so you really have a hard time getting
them<00:00:22.949> out<00:00:23.119> this<00:00:24.119> part<00:00:24.420> right<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:25.310> get<00:00:26.310> stuck

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
them out this part right here get stuck

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.679 
them out this part right here get stuck
in<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.420> car<00:00:28.849> like<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.420> perfect

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
in the car like it's not the perfect

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.819 
in the car like it's not the perfect
size<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.540> gonna<00:00:33.660> show<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:33.960> how<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> not

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
then this part right here the very edge

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.840 
then this part right here the very edge
here<00:00:48.860> you're<00:00:49.860> gonna<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> work<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
here you're gonna have to work it out a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.590 
here you're gonna have to work it out a
little<00:00:51.300> bit<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.289> tiny<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:52.920> bit<00:00:53.600> just

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
little bit just a tiny little bit just

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.869 
little bit just a tiny little bit just
be<00:00:54.750> careful<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.520> these<00:00:56.520> things<00:00:56.699> are

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
be careful because these things are

00:00:56.879 --> 00:02:27.030 
be careful because these things are
dangers

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.740 

all<00:02:28.040> right<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:33.069> worked<00:02:34.069> out<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.760> edge<00:02:34.970> of

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
all right so I worked out the edge of

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.990 
all right so I worked out the edge of
this<00:02:36.290> thing<00:02:36.680> right<00:02:36.920> here<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:42.140> now<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.470> wheel

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
this thing right here so now that wheel

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.360 
this thing right here so now that wheel
won't<00:02:44.000> get<00:02:44.239> stuck<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.290> already<00:02:45.770> tried<00:02:46.250> it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
won't get stuck and I already tried it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.320 
won't get stuck and I already tried it
in<00:02:46.489> my<00:02:46.790> other<00:02:46.970> side<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.940> think<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.090> worked

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
in my other side and I think it worked

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.589 
in my other side and I think it worked
because<00:02:50.540> when<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.530> put<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.390> could<00:02:53.390> really

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
because when I put it in I could really

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.070 
because when I put it in I could really
push<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.230> all<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.410> way<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:56.239> two

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
push it all the way in so this two

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.320 
push it all the way in so this two
things<00:02:57.440> I'm<00:02:58.100> in<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.430> wheel<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.090> base

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
things I'm in the wheel and the base

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.880
