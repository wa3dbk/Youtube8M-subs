00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.760
 Hello everyone, you are not a coward, and today I 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.800
 decided to record a video about how 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.430
 install air because there are so many 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.340
 it was asking for the type of video like it 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.000
 set okay I'm not in principle 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.190
 vs 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.440
 so now we will now show 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.930
 to download 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.369
 this is probably the most difficult on 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.169
 my opinion seemed to me 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:35.309
 I decided to download everything because 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:39.430
 it is not clear what and where to go here 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.210
 Now here is the theme of the official moda 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.730
 I inserted it in the description of the previous one 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.180
 minecraft videos but this 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.399
 I will insert a video in the description so this 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.100
 official theme that's all of it and it is necessary 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.579
 downloads scroll down find this 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.030
 here is the installation manual 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.509
 here is all the mods here is a list of all the mods 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.060
 you need to work 

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:09.969
 broadcast here this link to the company and I do not 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:15.880
 I will download because with my mega 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:18.310
 speed i think so okay 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 proceed to install I will 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.609
 install on a clean client so 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.619
 I will update now because I am there 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:30.819
 there is a version 102 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:41.770
 the ether seriously starts there for a long time 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:44.950
 the game does not need so perfect yes thanks I 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.229
 I am glad to wait until I get the update 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.539
 I think it will boost the jump no I 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.319
 was wrong it will be just like 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:56.459
 jump 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:02:00.170
 so you can even pour into the folder 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:03.619
 butt butt butt 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.640
 and dad data roaming minecraft. 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.399
 maynkravt even spring so cult 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:17.420
 appeared 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:19.160
 so let's wait for all mikroft in principle 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.130
 it is updated now a clean client 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.670
 completely nothing there are no mods 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.620
 additions well let's start in principle 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.440
 installation of the mod itself 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.260
 directly here I decided here in 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.880
 daddy broadcast everything to put 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.200
 it is clear well somewhere else is however 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.380
 no matter usually all the time starts 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.100
 Could hole setting all madof so 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.630
 that it will be quite logical strata that 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.630
 wore the freedom of a servant of God 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.650
 so but just throw everything in 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.920
 archives in the file minekravt. jar and all 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.829
 from hell and the first thing you need is a folder 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.840
 meta-inf remove flippers to work 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.590
 because otherwise there will be either a black screen 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.700
 or will crash with an error 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:19.160
 something from 2 I came across this and 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.049
 Minecraft did not know anything now 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:29.329
 This is already a modloader 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:32.480
 the installation goes where the folder is like this further 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:35.630
 show like audio one do not pay 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.100
 note that the folders are the same here 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:45.920
 just throw the mic. jar 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:50.240
 and further player intestines is also all 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.640
 here with api 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:59.900
 and here from the bin folder everything is 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:03.590
 maykravt. jar file folder with arch not 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.110
 touch this source is generally not needed 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.760
 I do not know why they were added to this archive 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.710
 some kind of nonsense just like that but in 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.350
 principle install all plugins 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.220
 basic finished don't know what its 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:23.420
 the problem of whom it certainly arose well 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.470
 let's start the installation from the very ether 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.100
 daddy jar 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:32.090
 This is in the file mikroft. jar need 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.920
 throw it all now i'm very 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.420
 closed early but also all alternative 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.930
 previous installations of other plugins 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.910
 just copy and paste into minecraft 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.750
 . jar 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:53.420
 yes it will take a long time no 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:55.430
 I was wrong for the second time so wait 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.520
 wait wait well that's one hundred 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:04.270
 percent is remarkably simple and 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:06.950
 from the resources folder of the daddy mod in 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.880
 own resources here there is a folder. 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.590
 minecraft out there is a folder resources have 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.770
 folder could i think and you can even delete 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.560
 because there is no need but ether 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.700
 set so well that's it 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.510
 great in principle everything is setup 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.430
 finished let's check that yes how am i 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:34.560
 I think everything will be perfect 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:36.840
 now it remains only to wait for hell 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.720
 for today the main bottom those who 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.730
 Pirate there just put a tick 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.270
 do not press the license but that's all 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:48.780
 installation is completed in principle everything 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.480
 It works perfectly. 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.750
 went under your main world course 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.030
 glare with a knife 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:01.170
 ok, it's not so important well, I think 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:04.920
 here everything will be clear so that everything 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:07.620
 I think on this you can even finish 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.900
 how to do not in mykraft gray 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.720
 beggar 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:17.430
 I hope the video will be mikroft coming 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.850
 2-3 days like this hoped to do okay 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.580
 Thank you for watching 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:27.350
 who did not understand write in comments there than 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.350
 I can help all the luck
