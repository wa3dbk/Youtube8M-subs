state-of-the-art high school like
they're<00:00:54.690> building<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.320> other<00:00:55.949> communities

facility<00:01:18.140> but<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.220> problem<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.939> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
facility but so my problem is this is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.950 
facility but so my problem is this is
that<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.200> are<00:01:22.320> replacing<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:23.009> state<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
that they are replacing a state a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.200 
that they are replacing a state a
perfectly<00:01:24.960> good<00:01:24.990> building<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:26.640> only<00:01:26.880> needs

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
perfectly good building that only needs

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.539 
perfectly good building that only needs
to<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.689> upgraded<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:29.420> renovated<00:01:30.420> with<00:01:31.549> this

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to be upgraded and renovated with this

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.420 
to be upgraded and renovated with this
really<00:01:32.970> cheaply<00:01:33.600> constructed<00:01:34.970> cinderblock

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
really cheaply constructed cinderblock

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.990

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.789 
building with no character or
distinction<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.909> wanted<00:01:45.689> to

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
distinction to it so I just wanted to

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.280 
distinction to it so I just wanted to
point<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.430> people<00:01:47.579> could<00:01:47.850> see

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
point that out so people could see

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.970 
point that out so people could see
