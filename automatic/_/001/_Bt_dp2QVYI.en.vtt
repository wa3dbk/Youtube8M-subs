looks like it isn't going to be so easy
after<00:02:13.660> all<00:02:13.990> maybe<00:02:14.530> we<00:02:14.710> could<00:02:15.040> use<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> disguise

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.280 

and<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.670> cleverly<00:02:24.150> disguised<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.960> pair<00:02:25.170> of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290

vicious<00:02:27.660> pirate<00:02:28.230> crew<00:02:30.740> Crusader<00:02:31.740> made<00:02:31.950> it

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
vicious pirate crew Crusader made it

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.860 
vicious pirate crew Crusader made it
without<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.370> mishap<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:35.340> his<00:02:35.520> usual<00:02:36.030> rags<00:02:36.540> and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
without a mishap but his usual rags and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:57.970 
without a mishap but his usual rags and
his<00:02:36.990> thoughts<00:02:37.260> had<00:02:37.530> strayed<00:02:37.890> along<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> way

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.260 

garlic<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.160> think<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.760> could<00:02:59.940> have<00:03:00.030> won<00:03:00.239> that

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
garlic I think I could have won that

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.589 
garlic I think I could have won that
hand<00:03:00.780> if<00:03:00.959> I'd<00:03:01.110> played<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.470> smart

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.140 

and<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.920> crusader<00:03:06.400> was<00:03:06.609> forced<00:03:06.909> to<00:03:06.969> take

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
and so a crusader was forced to take

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.150 
and so a crusader was forced to take
matters<00:03:07.420> into<00:03:07.719> his<00:03:07.870> own<00:03:08.019> hands

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
now at last they were within striking

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.500 
now at last they were within striking
distance<00:03:16.280> with<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> silence<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.000> shadow<00:03:18.270> or
