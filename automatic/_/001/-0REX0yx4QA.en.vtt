00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.733
- It is almost 80 degrees
in Los Angeles right now,

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.400
and it's about 10 degrees
in Indianapolis, Indiana,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.600
so I thought, "What better place
to send Jeannie?"

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.900
Jeannie is outside of
the Delta Gamma House

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.033
at Butler University.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.166
Oh, Jeannie, hi.

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.366
How are you?

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.833
- I'm a little cold, Ellen,
but doing well.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:18.433
- All right, good.
You'll be inside soon.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.266
We received an email
from Alexa, a senior,

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.333
who told us what big fans
everyone in the house is.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.666
They think
they're about to Skype

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.733
with a producer from ellentube,
but we lied to them.

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.466
So I am gonna Skype with them
in just a minute,

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.233
and we're gonna give them
a task to complete.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:32.700
If they finish
by the end of the show,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.100
we're gonna give
Delta Gamma House

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.366
one of everything
that we gave away for 12 Days.

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.366
[cheers and applause]

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:41.566
All right, here we go.

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.300
[laughter]
Ready?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.133
Hi, everybody.

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.233
Is everybody there?

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:51.300
Hi.
[women screaming]

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm doing that.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:00.966
It's hard to do.

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:05.233
That's the salute.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.966
Hi, everybody.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.166
It sounds like a lot of people

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.366
'cause there's, like,
100 people there.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.366
Hey.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.366
[chuckles]

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.866
Which one of you--

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:20.600
that's the Delta Gamma salute,
so I'm saluting them.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600
[laughter]

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
It's very hard.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.066
[women chanting "Ellen"]

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.066
Which--

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.066
[chanting]
People, people.

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:33.033
Hey.

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:34.133
Hold on one second.

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.466
We don't have a whole lot
of time.

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.700
- Hey, quiet down.
- Hey.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.866
[women shushing]

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.933
- Which one is Alexa?

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.500
- Hi. I'm right here.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.966
- Hi, Alexa. Hi.

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.300
So I read your email...

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.733
- [shushing]

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:46.733
- You read my email?

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:47.733
- I read your email.

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.700
[women exclaiming]

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.233
And I wanted to see
how rush week is going.

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:54.233
And I sent something
to the sorority.

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:55.333
It should be at your door.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.666
Is there something
at your door right now?

00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.666
[women screaming]

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:02.233
[laughter]

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.433
- Hi, you guys!
Please let me in.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:09.733
- [chuckles]
"Please let me in."

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.000
Go inside.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.366
[women squealing]

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.333
[laughter]

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:18.333
[women screaming]

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:26.933
Okay, so listen.

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:28.600
I have a--
- [shushing]

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.133
- I have a challenge
for everyone there.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:35.600
When I say "go," I want you
to do something for me.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.366
I hid our mascot--
our 12 Days mascot, Dancer,

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:40.633
somewhere around there.

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:42.366
And he's traveled to Indiana.

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:44.300
He's on your campus.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.333
When you find him,
bring him back to the house.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.233
You have to carry him inside.
Don't let him walk.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:51.233
You have to carry Dancer inside.

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:54.000
And once you get Dancer
in there,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.966
then I have a big surprise,

00:02:56.966 --> 00:02:58.533
something for the whole
Delta Gammas--

00:02:58.533 --> 00:02:59.533
all the Gammas of you.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:02.000
- Find Dancer, okay?
[laughter]

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.800
When Ellen says "go,"
you find him.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.000
- Go find Dancer. Go.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.200
- All right, let's go!

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.000
[women cheering]

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.600
- Put jackets on.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.666
Put a jacket on.

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:15.666
Put jackets on.

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.666
[women shouting]

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:19.666
- Go, go, go!

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.600
- Get a scarf.
- Go!

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.600
Go, go, go!

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.300
- A hat. Something.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.300
It's freezing there.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.400
We'll be back.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.400
[upbeat music]

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:36.166
You found Dancer.

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:37.966
It's time for me to tell you
what you've won.

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:40.000
Are you ready?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.133
[women cheering]

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:44.333
Well, I hope you like sharing,

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:46.800
because we're gonna give
Delta Gamma House

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.100
