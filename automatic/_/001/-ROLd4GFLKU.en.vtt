00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.160
 - Hi, my name is Jakob, and welcome to Christmas in Unisport, - 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.860
 - where it has been December 6, - 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.740
 - and today the launches of brand new colors continue for the Adidas boots, - 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.780
 - And today I have .... 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.340
 - the all-new Adidas Adipure 11pro in a black and white / green color variant, - 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.760
 - I don't know about you, but I think it's a really cool and simple alternative, - 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.500
 - for the rather daring and shiny Samba Package launch in purple, - 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.660
 - It's more classic Adipure for me. - 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.980
 - But it's a matter of taste and pleasure, - 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.340
 - As you probably know, Adidas Adipure 11pro is designed to give you the comfortable and classic feel when you play, - 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.860
 - and therefore it is with the Taurus leather upper and the brand new comfort frame without the MiCoach compatibility, - 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.340
 - and a larger and wide heel, - 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.060
 - to give you a more comfortable and safe locking effect, - 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.220
 - But how is the boot to play with? I've tried it a couple of times, and it does it quite okay, - 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.220
 - a lot better than the previous Adipure, - 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.880
 - But let's see how it really does when Joltter reviews the boot in the new year. - 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.220
 - This color variant is pretty cool and a good alternative to all of you out there - 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.720
 - who likes a more classic look. - 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.600
 - But today is not just about the new colors. - 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.240
 - We also have a competition on the program. - 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.620
 - So Adipure, we'll see later. - 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.060
 - The Merchandise competition. - 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.120
 - Today's competition becomes a fun little one, - 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.700
 - This is the merchandise competition. - 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.640
 - But as usual, I'm not going to do it alone. - 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.840
 - It would be pretty stupid. - 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.740
 - So Joltter? ... Yes - 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.800
 - There you are. - 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.020
 - Dressed in a Chelsea shirt, nice. - 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.160
 - The Merchandise competition tells what it's about. - 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.680
 - The rules are extremely simple, you and I are going to take merchandise from our favorite team. - 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.540
 - Chelsea, Manchester United, - 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.440
 - definitely. - 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.900
 - Every time we take a piece of merchandise, we get one point. - 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.200
 - The one who gets the most points wins of course. - 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.100
 - But today is not about the winner, because today we have something special for the loser. - 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.840
 - This time we have to lose the honor of wearing a piece of merchandise from the other's club, 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.580
 - The next time one of us makes an edition of Christmas in Unisport, - 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.740
 - so you might have Manchester United equipment on and I might be wearing Chelsea equipment. - 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.400
 - Are you ready? Let's do it. - 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.220
 - I also have a yellow one. - 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.700
 - I never broke yellow. - 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.780
 - Now it's time to officially get into the Christmas spirit. - 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.080
 - Do I look good? - 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.220
 - It is hard earned points. - 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.740
 - Don't you like it? - 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.260
 - Finally. - 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.040
 - It's something that only a Manchester United fan would do. - 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.960
 - I withdraw my words. - 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.880
 - Joltter, what is the position? - 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.000
 - For some reason you seem to have more points than I have, - 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.640
 - but you clearly look much more stupid than I do. - 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.440
 - This is the merchandise competition. - 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.580
 - I think I won! - 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.860
 - Did I win? Did I really win? - 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.820
 - Well, Joltter, let's see. You don't have glasses so you can't have them here. - 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.420
 - I think you should wear ... no. - 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.820
 - ... No. - 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.880
 - Yeah. - 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.880
 - No, no, no .. Not yet. - 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:05.340
 - First in the next episode of Christmas in Unisport. Not yet. - 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.080
 - I look forward to it, - 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.600
 - so enjoy your blue colors for next time ... - 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.460
 - Yes, - 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.540
 - Well, Joltter, it was a good competition here in Christmas at Unisport, - 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.080
 - And that was all we had today. - 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.860
 - But we're back tomorrow with another game of Christmas in Unisport. - 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.880
 - And yet another good thing about tomorrow is that we are once again a step closer to Christmas Eve. - 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.200
 - #Unisportlife, I behave nicely. -
