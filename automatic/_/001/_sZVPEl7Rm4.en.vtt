 Ship moves very nice and quiet 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.680

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.090

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.030
 harbor 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.430
 what was that feeling for hamburg 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.550
 Sleeping is always nice as a person 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.020
 waving and honking and so on 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.300

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.060
 times in a port enters to the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.390
 Of course, tradition is part of the tradition 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.610

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.319

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.119

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.260

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.790

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.810
 For the first time a German port 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.030
 underway 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.790
 what is that feeling so if you are 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.920
 quite right then it was 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.270
 Of course not the first German port 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.100
 because we were in Wilhelmshaven 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.050
 but only for testing 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.820
 exclusion of the public are now 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.530
 we in hamburg this is our more or 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.080
 less heimathafen there sits the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.850
 that's a great feeling 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.330

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.860

 Do you already have a personal one? 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.610
 favorite place on the team 3 yes 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.220
 I think that few have 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.050
 discovered so far that is on deck 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.040
 I believe 16 if that's the case 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.730
 can denote 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.680
 behind the chimney of the kitchen where 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.080
 namely the binoculars is attached 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.300
 thank you mr bird love spectator 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.950

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.020
