00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:10.690
 well a moment ago I do not know or this 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:12.969
 magnificent club but neither of rd 2 751 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.230
 what is a food tracer that 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.660
 sold in amazon 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.270
 if you notice the price goes up and down a lot 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.630
 but good in principle it has enough 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.630
 good look 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.500
 and we are going to make a small boxing 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.360
 this thing 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.940
 although it's not a graphics card or something 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.290
 so very impressive the box is pretty 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.940
 pretty 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.710
 looks pretty good 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.890
 so let's see what is there 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.890
 inside 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.550
 and what such 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.130
 a zeal that presents them and another that uses 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.910
 a cutter in some areas to the image and 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.910
 we have you let's cut this 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.910
 and we should be able to open them let's see 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.430
 falling down 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.360
 as you see content nothing surprising 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.360
 simply this the pileup 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.140
 languages very basic instructions 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.049
 we'll see 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.020
 service instruction so it's in 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.020
 Spanish also what I wanted to see 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.260
 as it will put times of times of 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.480
 drying of food and all that 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.770
 we go to the pretty big pots 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.509
 occupies all that box for him 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.580
 to me cork is nothing inside goes 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.270
 directly 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.270
 to the machine 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.870
 for this 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.020
 I have a complicated focus 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.070
 for plastic 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.720
 we make mini cut we would remove the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.780
 plastic to the touch that has this is 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.880
 quite 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.860
 flimsy has been in two countries for 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.140
 plastic of this quite cheap but 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.170
 good for a price that has sent me 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.520
 cost 31 euros is not bad although it does 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.760
 one time I was even a little bit older 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.330
 cheap but good let's see how it 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.330
 open this 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.020
 for are soldier trays this towards 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.220
 above 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.220
 in the picture this appears 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.220
 touch him 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.660
 as if cascaded do not know if 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.660
 is a 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.470
 normal that is like a small 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.470
 license 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.840
 a small artistic license because 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:27.459
 that I know that this can not be 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:31.769
 put on one side already so that is every 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.769
 tray separately 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.570
 and it is already 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.570
 there's no more we're going to remove them 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.470
 the normal bottom part and now we're going to 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.470
 give a 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.890
 this one has like a few small samples 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.890
 to fit well 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.049
 4 droid 5 trays 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.510
 5 trays and the lid so we can 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.390
 see this is simply an engine 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.610
 of drying that will remain to dry 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:32.139
 food that we kill inside 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.560
 and that's it, I do not think they do things 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.560
 more thing 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.569
 cut out some food inside and 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:51.249
 seeing as how we 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:55.849
 this is the weird number chronic to see 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:59.479
 the gender chronicle 751 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:01.659
 buy in amazon I just plugged in the 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.659
 light 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.360
 to see what noise this thing does 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.010
 this is the super power button is 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.010
 very big and see what you do 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.259
 as mind we adore 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:24.100
 as not to go hot 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:26.430
 but here comes a little 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.850
 of air is already 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.710
 on the sides you do not notice anything 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.870
 simply the air is up here 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.220
 a dried price makes by heat 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.220
 through I'm going 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.240
 as he will pose a little too 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.610
 no more than anything else 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.610
 because I liked it
