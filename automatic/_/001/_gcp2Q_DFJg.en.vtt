anymore<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.410> bit<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.649> life<00:00:55.860> works<00:00:56.550> out

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
anymore a little bit more life works out

well<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.239> player<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.480> Archer<00:00:57.899> although<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
well for a player like Archer although I

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.619 
well for a player like Archer although I
thought<00:00:59.129> he's<00:00:59.340> more<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> keep<00:01:00.120> away<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
thought he's more like a keep away and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.119 
thought he's more like a keep away and
is<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> keep<00:01:01.170> away<00:01:01.379> player<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
is a keep away player but you know you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.759 
is a keep away player but you know you
can't<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.180> hit<00:01:03.480> forever<00:01:03.870> yeah<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.650> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.390 
can't not get hit forever yeah in this
game<00:01:04.979> yeah<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> uh<00:01:06.659> not<00:01:07.439> having<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
game yeah so uh not having some of the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
game yeah so uh not having some of the
greatest<00:01:08.610> reactions<00:01:09.180> admittedly<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
