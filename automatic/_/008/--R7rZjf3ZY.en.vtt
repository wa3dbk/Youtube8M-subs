so I've been looking for a way to fasten

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.360 
so I've been looking for a way to fasten
down<00:00:06.580> the<00:00:06.819> plastic<00:00:07.390> at<00:00:08.200> the<00:00:08.260> Bob<00:00:09.030> as<00:00:10.030> I<00:00:10.059> said

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
down the plastic at the Bob as I said

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.490 
down the plastic at the Bob as I said
the<00:00:12.370> plastic<00:00:12.850> is<00:00:12.940> made<00:00:13.090> to<00:00:13.360> be<00:00:13.390> rolled<00:00:13.720> up<00:00:13.960> but

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
the plastic is made to be rolled up but

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.820 
the plastic is made to be rolled up but
during<00:00:15.309> the<00:00:15.400> winter<00:00:15.519> months<00:00:16.359> which<00:00:16.830> puff

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
during the winter months which puff

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.630 
during the winter months which puff
today<00:00:18.699> it's<00:00:18.910> not<00:00:19.090> necessary<00:00:19.570> but<00:00:20.550> when<00:00:21.550> it

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
today it's not necessary but when it

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.249 
today it's not necessary but when it
gets<00:00:21.789> colder<00:00:22.119> we're<00:00:22.300> going<00:00:22.480> to<00:00:22.659> need<00:00:22.810> to<00:00:23.050> keep

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
gets colder we're going to need to keep

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.210 
gets colder we're going to need to keep
this<00:00:23.470> down<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.720> I<00:00:25.779> finally<00:00:26.050> came<00:00:26.319> across<00:00:26.560> a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
this down so I finally came across a

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.929 
this down so I finally came across a
site<00:00:28.029> on<00:00:28.869> YouTube

LDS prepper you have this really cool
inexpensive<00:00:36.449> very<00:00:37.449> effective<00:00:38.079> way<00:00:38.289> to<00:00:39.449> keep

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
inexpensive very effective way to keep

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:49.079 
inexpensive very effective way to keep
plastic<00:00:41.140> in<00:00:42.070> place<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:45.250> basically<00:00:47.940> how<00:00:48.940> it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
plastic in place so basically how it

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:58.369 
plastic in place so basically how it
works<00:00:49.120> is<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:51.449> use<00:00:52.649> 3/4<00:00:53.649> inch<00:00:54.420> thin<00:00:55.420> wall<00:00:56.039> PVC

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
works is you use 3/4 inch thin wall PVC

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.979 
works is you use 3/4 inch thin wall PVC
and<00:00:59.460> you<00:01:00.780> cut<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:03.550> quite<00:01:03.850> in<00:01:04.030> half<00:01:04.300> just<00:01:04.870> a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
and you cut it not quite in half just a

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.160 
and you cut it not quite in half just a
little<00:01:05.230> little<00:01:05.670> more<00:01:06.670> than<00:01:06.970> half<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.510> little

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
little little more than half a little

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.370 
little little more than half a little
less<00:01:08.320> than<00:01:08.530> half<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.660> you'll<00:01:10.660> take<00:01:10.870> a<00:01:10.930> half

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
less than half and you'll take a half

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.650 
less than half and you'll take a half
inch<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.970> go<00:01:13.120> to<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.300> 40<00:01:13.630> PVC<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:16.450> reason

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
inch just go to a 40 PVC and the reason

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.090 
inch just go to a 40 PVC and the reason
you<00:01:16.720> use<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.840> thin<00:01:17.140> wall<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:17.470> because<00:01:17.800> it'll<00:01:17.980> be

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
you use a thin wall is because it'll be

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.220 
you use a thin wall is because it'll be
flexible<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.890> put<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.250> plastic<00:01:21.490> you'll

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
flexible and you put the plastic you'll

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.690 
flexible and you put the plastic you'll
screw<00:01:23.230> this<00:01:23.380> into<00:01:23.980> you<00:01:24.480> your<00:01:25.480> base<00:01:26.610> bring<00:01:27.610> the

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
screw this into you your base bring the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.780 
screw this into you your base bring the
plastic<00:01:27.940> over<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:29.190> snap<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.890> half<00:01:33.100> inch<00:01:33.370> pipe

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
plastic over and snap the half inch pipe

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.480 
plastic over and snap the half inch pipe
into<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:35.020> other<00:01:35.350> into<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:35.890> three-quarter

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
into the other into the three-quarter

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.970 
into the other into the three-quarter
inch<00:01:36.670> pipe

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
inch pipe

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.040
