00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
but it does work quite well for this

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.440 
but it does work quite well for this
kind<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.430> look<00:04:42.610> because<00:04:42.790> it's<00:04:43.060> all<00:04:43.270> about

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
kind of look because it's all about

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.030 
kind of look because it's all about
length<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:46.030> just<00:04:46.240> need<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.690> kind<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:47.010> use<00:04:48.010> a

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
length so you just need to kind of use a

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.640 
length so you just need to kind of use a
very<00:04:48.430> lengthening<00:04:49.120> mascara<00:04:51.390> nothing<00:04:52.390> to

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
volumizing or dent because that kind of

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:07.320 
volumizing or dent because that kind of
I<00:04:57.460> need<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.120> mirror<00:04:58.450> for<00:04:58.750> bet<00:04:58.960> on<00:05:06.120> thing<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.270> you

volumizing or dense like I said because

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.010

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
that kind of sometimes can have the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.630 
that kind of sometimes can have the
opposite<00:05:11.290> effect<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:12.130> doesn't<00:05:12.430> make<00:05:12.490> your

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
eyes look nicer but it kind of doesn't

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:25.970 
eyes look nicer but it kind of doesn't
open<00:05:14.620> them<00:05:14.800> up<00:05:14.890> as<00:05:15.190> much

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
and pretty it and if you grow only to

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.070 
and pretty it and if you grow only to
take<00:06:06.000> a<00:06:06.030> couple<00:06:06.330> of<00:06:06.510> things<00:06:06.540> from<00:06:06.900> this

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
take a couple of things from this

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.330 
take a couple of things from this
tutorial<00:06:07.650> then<00:06:07.860> I<00:06:07.950> think<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.250> would

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
tutorial then I think it would

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.090 
tutorial then I think it would
definitely<00:06:08.520> be<00:06:08.820> use<00:06:09.780> a<00:06:10.020> shimmery<00:06:10.230> shade<00:06:10.770> in

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
definitely be use a shimmery shade in

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.280 
definitely be use a shimmery shade in
the<00:06:11.220> inner<00:06:11.490> corners<00:06:11.880> of<00:06:11.970> your<00:06:12.120> eye<00:06:12.180> and<00:06:12.860> also

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
the inner corners of your eye and also

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.380 
the inner corners of your eye and also
