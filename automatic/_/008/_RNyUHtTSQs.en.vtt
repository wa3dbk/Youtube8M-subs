00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
we're actually freely ahead inside the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.740 
we're actually freely ahead inside the
trading<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> wholesaler<00:00:42.149> title<00:00:42.600> we

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
trading for for the wholesaler title we

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.869 
trading for for the wholesaler title we

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
are at fifty seven or sixty nine percent
what<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> think<00:00:48.120> I'll<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.440> all

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
what I think I'll do here is that all

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.600 
what I think I'll do here is that all
jump<00:00:50.280> back<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> strategy<00:00:51.899> parry<00:00:52.199> tear

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
jump back up to the strategy parry tear

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
jump back up to the strategy parry tear
everything<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.270> our<00:00:54.600> our<00:00:55.020> merchant<00:00:55.410> ship

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
everything up like our our merchant ship

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.060 
everything up like our our merchant ship
is<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> wet<00:00:56.940> goods<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:58.079> gonna<00:00:58.350> put<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
is like a wet goods so we gonna put that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340 
is like a wet goods so we gonna put that
on<00:00:59.329> buying<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.570> hundred<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.050> twenty<00:01:01.230> percent

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
on buying a hundred and twenty percent

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.429 
on buying a hundred and twenty percent
again<00:01:02.149> one<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> things<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.809> think<00:01:03.930> we

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
again one of the things that I think we

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.609 
again one of the things that I think we
get<00:01:04.769> from<00:01:05.189> advancing<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.930> league's<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
get from advancing up in the league's is

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.679 
get from advancing up in the league's is
I<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.460> apparently<00:01:08.970> don't<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> free

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
I know we apparently don't get a free

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.800 
I know we apparently don't get a free
ship<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.430> case<00:01:11.700> we'll<00:01:12.360> build<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> ship

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
ship so in that case we'll build a ship

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.880 
ship so in that case we'll build a ship
now

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
now

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
now
it's<00:01:14.100> always<00:01:14.250> nice<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> expand<00:01:15.150> our<00:01:15.420> little

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it's always nice to expand our little

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.440 
it's always nice to expand our little
Navy<00:01:16.650> fleet<00:01:17.130> sold<00:01:17.580> by<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.900> sloop<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.070> guess<00:01:20.450> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
Navy fleet sold by a a sloop I guess and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.770 
Navy fleet sold by a a sloop I guess and
these<00:01:21.630> loops<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.860> starter<00:01:23.400> ships<00:01:23.780> so

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
these loops are the starter ships so

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
these loops are the starter ships so
these<00:01:25.140> things<00:01:25.409> should<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.860> these<00:01:26.610> things

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
these things should be these things

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
these things should be these things
should<00:01:27.180> automatically<00:01:27.720> start<00:01:27.810> building<00:01:28.409> if

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
should automatically start building if

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.660 
should automatically start building if
there<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.479> if<00:01:30.479> there<00:01:30.630> isn't<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.990> free<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.670> so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
there is if there isn't a free one so

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.160 
there is if there isn't a free one so
we're<00:01:32.880> gonna<00:01:33.000> buy<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.360> ship<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
we're gonna buy that ship go to the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.530 
we're gonna buy that ship go to the
harbor<00:01:34.530> master<00:01:34.979> go<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> ships<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.270> we

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
harbor master go to ships and then we

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.620 
harbor master go to ships and then we
can<00:01:36.780> make<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.259> new<00:01:37.680> fleet<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.450> with<00:01:39.450> these

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
can make a new fleet and with these

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
can make a new fleet and with these
fleets<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.350> actually<00:01:40.500> assign<00:01:40.950> captain's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
fleets you can actually assign captain's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.080 
fleets you can actually assign captain's
to<00:01:41.700> them<00:01:42.020> so<00:01:43.020> our<00:01:43.350> uncle<00:01:43.710> Marco<00:01:44.250> apparently<00:01:44.909> is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
to them so our uncle Marco apparently is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.350 
to them so our uncle Marco apparently is
a<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.020> captain<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.189> he's<00:01:47.399> eligible<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.180> he

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
a is a captain so he's eligible and he

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.649 
a is a captain so he's eligible and he
is<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.689> level<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.909> trader<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.240> level<00:01:51.450> five

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
is a level one trader in the level five

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.960 
is a level one trader in the level five
navigators<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.649> he'll<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:53.100> able<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.430> sail

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
navigators so he'll be able to sail

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
navigators so he'll be able to sail
around<00:01:54.090> quite<00:01:54.600> fast<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.409> he<00:01:55.500> doesn't<00:01:55.829> have

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
around quite fast but he doesn't have

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.850 
around quite fast but he doesn't have
for<00:01:56.430> trading<00:01:57.299> skills<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.409> we're<00:01:58.530> gonna<00:01:58.619> take

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
for trading skills so we're gonna take

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.950 
for trading skills so we're gonna take
him<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> what<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.360> I'd<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.810> do

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
him and what I like what I'd like to do

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.149 
him and what I like what I'd like to do
inside<00:02:01.290> these<00:02:01.500> games<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:01.920> I'll

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
inside these games is that I'll
