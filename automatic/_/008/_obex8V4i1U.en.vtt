00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:16.970
 well we are here trying to change a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.980
 power patch top was 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.410
 here we take away we take away some 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.650
 tensioners is important to go avoiding 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.109
 Tensioners are facing each other 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.019
 as a matter of tension therefore when 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.730
 one is taking it out but that's how it is 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.280
 important to go making the habit for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.680
 do not go pulling one by one more when 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.270
 it's rather your case to end 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.970
 to go changing the attention and 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.570
 usually to check one side 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.640
 more your cases the other one and that's going to 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.640
 bother quite when they leave 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.470
 we are doing 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.470
 plus 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.089
 they are called tensors are a little more 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.909
 great in different types but good 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.909
 these are the ones who get here I have 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.399
 21 of this type and this one else works 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.399
 exactly the same 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.240
 let's talk 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 the patch that we are going to use 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.830
 there are drummers that work for them 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.270
 white patches like more 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.270
 white countries to my particular 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.180
 the steel shot patch on the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.180
 shots 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.210
 as there are can see there is a series of 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.320
 old rags that serve to go 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.600
 making him 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.110
 in the sound 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.110
 yes no 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.400
 same 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:06.320
 the patch is placed again 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.320
 the patch is not an oil patch 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.520
 will know how to put the hoop 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.360
 and now if it starts 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.290
 the placement of the placing 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.290
 the sensors 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.270
 always as in one versus the other 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.319
 it is not recommended one by one because 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.950
 when one is touching of course the 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.250
 patch be the east 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.590
 thinking more than one side is good to have 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.069
 that question of uncovering the first 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.069
 feel 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.170
 the tensioners 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.520
 everyone 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.850
 start playing not too much because 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.180
 still you have to look for the sound 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.180
 true 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.459
 to time 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.300
 well what is left here then nothing 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.120
 more is d 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.660
 to prove it 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.330
 particular 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.330
 each drummer gives his touch 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.180
 Augustine well 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.360
 the taste of the person out of tune 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.360
 so 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.360
 ah 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.590
 for example 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.200
 ah 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:12.220
 it's a decent sound a little bit a little 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.430
 touched then forms 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.489
 taking away your attention 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.889
 some parts 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.709
 with that we had been looking for 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.620
 uniform shape 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.280
 then it is a public hospital of 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.280
 tensions 

00:04:42.609 --> 00:04:46.779
 basically, change the patch
