00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
all ps2 games and consoles it's got an

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.430 
all ps2 games and consoles it's got an
ergonomic<00:00:33.360> design<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.960> got<00:00:34.110> great

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
ergonomic design it's got great

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.880 
ergonomic design it's got great
vibration<00:00:35.309> feedback<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.350> it<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> really

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
vibration feedback and it is really

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.660 
vibration feedback and it is really
quite<00:00:38.160> similar<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.420> actual<00:00:39.570> controller

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
quite similar to the actual controller

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.760 
quite similar to the actual controller
there<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> few<00:00:42.450> minor<00:00:42.750> differences<00:00:43.500> though

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
there are a few minor differences though

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830 
there are a few minor differences though
so<00:00:44.100> I'll<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.700> go<00:00:44.879> over<00:00:45.030> those<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.719> get

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
so I'll just go over those as we get

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.860 
so I'll just go over those as we get
into<00:00:46.020> more<00:00:46.320> detail<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.360> gonna<00:00:48.480> pull

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
into more detail so I'm just gonna pull

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
into more detail so I'm just gonna pull
it<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.110> give<00:00:49.829> us<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> second

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it out give us a second

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.209 
it out give us a second
so<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.420> I've<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.289> pulled<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.010> box

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
so here I've just pulled it out the box

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.799 
so here I've just pulled it out the box
and<00:00:54.710> as<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.190> already<00:00:56.670> there's<00:00:57.539> sort

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and as you can see already there's sort

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.349 
and as you can see already there's sort
of<00:00:57.930> patent<00:00:59.359> shapes<00:01:00.359> instead<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.820> just<00:01:02.820> normal

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
of patent shapes instead of just normal

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.039 
of patent shapes instead of just normal
shapes<00:01:04.100> they're<00:01:05.100> sort<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.549> patterns<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.780> on

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
shapes they're sort of in patterns so on

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.950 
shapes they're sort of in patterns so on
the<00:01:07.200> back<00:01:07.380> first<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> little<00:01:08.460> bit<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
the back first we have a little bit of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
the back first we have a little bit of
legal<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:11.369> shapes<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:12.710> patent<00:01:13.970> my

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
legal and the shapes are patent my

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.230 
legal and the shapes are patent my
camera<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.630> needs<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.290> focus<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.240> yeah

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
camera really needs to focus but yeah

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.999 
camera really needs to focus but yeah
here<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.200> pattern<00:01:19.619> shapes

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
here you go so the pattern shapes

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.570 
here you go so the pattern shapes
instead<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> normal<00:01:21.799> shapes<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
instead of the normal shapes and the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.090 
instead of the normal shapes and the
Select<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.240> start<00:01:24.330> buttons<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:25.409> exactly<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
Select and start buttons are exactly the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.630 
Select and start buttons are exactly the
same<00:01:26.360> there's<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> power<00:01:27.770> LED<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.369> mode

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
same there's a power LED and the mode

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.910 
same there's a power LED and the mode
LED<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.710> back<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:34.820> it's<00:01:35.820> also<00:01:36.590> quite<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
LED on the back and it's also quite a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.910 
LED on the back and it's also quite a
decent<00:01:38.490> controller<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.659> feels<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.439> lot<00:01:40.619> like

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
decent controller it feels a lot like

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.039 
decent controller it feels a lot like
the<00:01:41.220> original<00:01:41.250> thing<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.270> I've<00:01:42.780> actually

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the original thing and I've actually

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.940 
the original thing and I've actually
used<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:43.950> quite<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.520> now<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.950> it's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
used it for quite a bit now and it's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.929 
used it for quite a bit now and it's
very<00:01:47.640> good<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.329> there's<00:01:48.689> no<00:01:48.990> lag<00:01:49.409> whatsoever

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
very good and there's no lag whatsoever

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.780 
very good and there's no lag whatsoever
which<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.149> would<00:01:51.299> expect<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.340> says<00:01:53.610> on

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
which you would expect but as it says on

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.139 
which you would expect but as it says on
the<00:01:54.390> actual<00:01:54.780> product<00:01:55.200> page<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.770> Amazon<00:01:56.149> it

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the actual product page on Amazon it

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.840 
the actual product page on Amazon it
promises<00:01:57.840> no<00:01:58.200> lag<00:01:58.469> because<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.130> 2.4

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
promises no lag because it's 2.4

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.980 
promises no lag because it's 2.4
gigahertz<00:02:01.310> there's<00:02:02.310> also<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:03.360> which<00:02:03.780> is

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
gigahertz there's also this which is

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.810 
gigahertz there's also this which is
what<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.320> plug<00:02:04.649> into<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.070> PlayStation<00:02:05.790> 2

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
what you plug into the PlayStation 2

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.900 
what you plug into the PlayStation 2
it's<00:02:06.299> very<00:02:06.719> simple<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> set<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.280> plug<00:02:08.610> that

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
it's very simple to set up you plug that

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.400 
it's very simple to set up you plug that
in<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.690> turn<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.379> switch<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> bottom

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
in you turn on the switch on the bottom

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.310 
in you turn on the switch on the bottom
the<00:02:11.560> controller<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:13.140> there<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.260> have<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.470> so

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
the controller and there you have it so

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.270 
the controller and there you have it so
here<00:02:17.320> is<00:02:17.680> an<00:02:18.490> actual<00:02:18.940> Sony<00:02:19.600> controller<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.680> so

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
here is an actual Sony controller and so

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.130 
here is an actual Sony controller and so
just<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.820> show<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.300> differences<00:02:22.870> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
just to show you the differences the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.640 
just to show you the differences the
game<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.730> pattern<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.720> there<00:02:26.110> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
game the pattern is there the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.230 
game the pattern is there the
PlayStation<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:27.580> Sony<00:02:28.090> logos<00:02:28.480> are<00:02:28.720> not<00:02:28.870> there

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
PlayStation and Sony logos are not there

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.170 
PlayStation and Sony logos are not there
but<00:02:31.320> it's<00:02:32.320> really<00:02:33.040> really<00:02:33.820> very<00:02:34.060> very<00:02:34.780> similar

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
but it's really really very very similar

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.950 
but it's really really very very similar
so<00:02:37.180> there<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.480> go<00:02:37.720> those<00:02:37.990> two<00:02:38.350> together<00:02:39.960> also

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
so there you go those two together also

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.020 
so there you go those two together also
it's<00:02:41.260> important<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.040> note<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.820> the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
it's important to note that on the
