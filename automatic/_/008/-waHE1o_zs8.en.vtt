retracted<00:00:47.250> retracts<00:00:48.089> alright<00:00:48.449> you<00:00:48.600> make<00:00:48.839> this

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
retracted retracts alright you make this

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.959 
retracted retracts alright you make this
a<00:00:48.989> basically<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.469> full<00:00:49.739> six<00:00:50.190> channel<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.850> know

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
a basically a full six channel you know

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.169 
a basically a full six channel you know
park<00:00:51.390> park<00:00:52.079> jets<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.249> it<00:00:53.550> really<00:00:53.760> opens<00:00:54.089> up

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
park park jets and it really opens up

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.520 
park park jets and it really opens up
the<00:00:54.329> envelope<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.809> mean<00:00:54.929> the<00:00:54.989> flaps<00:00:55.230> allow<00:00:55.469> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the envelope I mean the flaps allow you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.500 
the envelope I mean the flaps allow you
to<00:00:55.620> come<00:00:55.769> in<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.890> lot<00:00:56.039> slower<00:00:56.280> take<00:00:56.969> off<00:00:57.149> slower

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
to come in a lot slower take off slower

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.660 
to come in a lot slower take off slower
and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:58.199> retracts<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.710> course<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:59.280> just

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and then retracts of course are just

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.639 
and then retracts of course are just
amazing<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.539> expands<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> performance

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
amazing it just expands the performance

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.110 
amazing it just expands the performance
of<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:02.010> day<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> enjoy<00:01:02.609> ability<00:01:03.030> of
