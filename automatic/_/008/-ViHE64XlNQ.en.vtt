millimeter<00:01:02.070> socket<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> after<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> get<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
millimeter socket so after I get the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.570 
millimeter socket so after I get the
wheel<00:01:06.240> off<00:01:06.270> I'd<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:07.500> ahead<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.010> get<00:01:08.189> something

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
wheel off I'd go ahead and get something

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.870 
wheel off I'd go ahead and get something
and<00:01:08.700> tap<00:01:09.210> these<00:01:09.860> ten<00:01:11.270> level<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:13.049> both<00:01:13.880> upper

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880

and tap these ten level on both upper
and<00:01:14.909> lower<00:01:15.210> pin<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.369> gets<00:01:17.670> those

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and lower pin here and that gets those

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.109 
and lower pin here and that gets those
pins<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.920> start<00:01:19.920> coming<00:01:20.280> out<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> backside

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
pins just start coming out the backside

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.830 
pins just start coming out the backside
so<00:01:21.920> if<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.130> need<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.939> drop<00:01:24.240> these<00:01:24.540> pins

out<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:26.690> now<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.989> get<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.260> pads<00:02:28.500> out

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
out so now that I get the pads out

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.400 
out so now that I get the pads out
I<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.340> inspect<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> boots<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:31.140> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
I want to inspect the boots on the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.339 
I want to inspect the boots on the
caliper<00:02:31.769> make<00:02:32.670> sure<00:02:32.880> they're<00:02:33.060> intact<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.810> I

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
caliper make sure they're intact and I

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.110 
caliper make sure they're intact and I
want<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.620> put<00:02:34.829> something<00:02:35.099> in<00:02:35.310> there<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:37.880> like<00:02:38.880> a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
want to put something in there in like a

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.280 
want to put something in there in like a
clamp<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.290> compress<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.519> piston<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.269> on<00:02:43.049> both

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
clamp and compress the piston in on both

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.550 
clamp and compress the piston in on both
sides<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.069> rear<00:02:44.310> has<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.510> Pistons<00:02:45.989> on<00:02:46.230> both

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
sides the rear has the Pistons on both

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.330 
sides the rear has the Pistons on both
sides<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.220> think<00:02:47.880> these<00:02:48.030> are<00:02:48.090> 18<00:02:48.660> calipers<00:02:49.410> if

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
sides I think these are 18 calipers if

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.130 
sides I think these are 18 calipers if
they're<00:02:50.700> not<00:02:50.819> this<00:02:51.090> kind<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> same<00:02:51.870> as<00:02:52.049> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
they're not this kind of the same as the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.830 
they're not this kind of the same as the
front<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:53.010> front<00:02:53.040> procedures<00:02:53.849> we'll<00:02:54.660> get

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
front and the front procedures we'll get

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.949 
front and the front procedures we'll get
these<00:02:55.019> things<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.549> so<00:02:56.549> go<00:02:56.730> ahead<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.269> would

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
these things out so go ahead I would

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.800 
these things out so go ahead I would
break<00:02:58.170> loose<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.799> bleeder<00:02:59.130> nut<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.810> compress

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
break loose the bleeder nut and compress

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.410 
break loose the bleeder nut and compress
the<00:03:01.220> Pistons<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.459> trying<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.000> get<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.269> new

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
the Pistons in trying to get the new

the Pistons in trying to get the new
pads<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:03.900> there<00:03:04.730> now<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.790> don't<00:03:06.180> want<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.540> pry

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
pads in there now you don't want to pry

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.360 
pads in there now you don't want to pry
on<00:03:07.380> those<00:03:08.090> Pistons<00:03:09.090> with<00:03:09.959> anything<00:03:10.530> against

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
on those Pistons with anything against

on those Pistons with anything against
these<00:03:11.579> rotors<00:03:12.329> because<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.049> don't<00:03:13.200> want<00:03:13.380> to

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
these rotors because you don't want to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.059 
these rotors because you don't want to
bend<00:03:13.650> or<00:03:13.829> work<00:03:14.010> your<00:03:14.220> rotors<00:03:15.620> now<00:03:16.620> on<00:03:16.889> these

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
bend or work your rotors now on these

bend or work your rotors now on these
rear<00:03:17.280> pads<00:03:17.670> as<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.299> see<00:03:18.510> they<00:03:18.840> have<00:03:19.049> this

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
rear pads as you can see they have this

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.229 
rear pads as you can see they have this
little<00:03:19.560> metal<00:03:19.739> thing<00:03:20.069> on<00:03:20.250> there<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.519> those

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
little metal thing on there and those

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.819 
little metal thing on there and those
are<00:03:21.420> normally<00:03:21.870> shims<00:03:22.340> shim<00:03:23.450> squeal<00:03:24.450> pads<00:03:24.829> so

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
are normally shims shim squeal pads so

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.819 
are normally shims shim squeal pads so
you<00:03:25.889> want<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.340> take<00:03:26.880> these<00:03:27.150> if<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.410> new<00:03:28.560> pads

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
you want to take these if the new pads

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.729 
you want to take these if the new pads
don't<00:03:29.100> come<00:03:29.310> with<00:03:29.519> them<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.440> lubricate<00:03:31.440> them

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
don't come with them and lubricate them

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.030 
don't come with them and lubricate them
with<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.400> brake<00:03:32.639> grease<00:03:33.079> to<00:03:34.079> help<00:03:34.319> reduce<00:03:34.739> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
with the brake grease to help reduce the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.360 
with the brake grease to help reduce the
chances<00:03:35.549> of<00:03:35.730> them<00:03:36.299> squealing<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.069> as<00:03:38.069> you<00:03:38.190> can

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
chances of them squealing and as you can

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.430 
chances of them squealing and as you can
see<00:03:38.519> these<00:03:38.700> pads<00:03:39.090> are<00:03:39.299> in<00:03:39.450> good<00:03:39.810> shape

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
see these pads are in good shape

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.479 
see these pads are in good shape
I<00:03:40.470> wouldn't<00:03:41.180> consider<00:03:42.180> replacing<00:03:42.780> these<00:03:43.079> pads

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
I wouldn't consider replacing these pads

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.490 
I wouldn't consider replacing these pads
until<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.700> groove<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.630> worn<00:03:46.019> all<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.380> way

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
until this groove is worn all the way

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.800 
until this groove is worn all the way
down<00:03:46.739> on<00:03:47.010> them<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:47.849> that's<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.269> where<00:03:48.480> groove

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
down on them so that's the where groove

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.129 
down on them so that's the where groove
on<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.290> rear<00:03:49.470> brake<00:03:49.769> pads<00:03:50.069> so<00:03:51.030> go<00:03:51.599> ahead<00:03:51.840> and

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
on the rear brake pads so go ahead and

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.460 
on the rear brake pads so go ahead and
lubricate<00:03:53.000> those<00:03:54.000> shim<00:03:54.359> pads<00:03:54.690> on<00:03:54.930> both<00:03:55.139> sides

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
lubricate those shim pads on both sides

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.839 
lubricate those shim pads on both sides
and<00:03:55.829> slide<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.700> pads<00:03:56.970> back<00:03:57.239> in<00:03:58.459> okay<00:03:59.459> once<00:03:59.730> you

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
and slide the pads back in okay once you

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.240 
and slide the pads back in okay once you
get<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.150> new<00:04:00.180> pads<00:04:00.569> in<00:04:00.780> place<00:04:00.859> you<00:04:01.859> want<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.099> go
