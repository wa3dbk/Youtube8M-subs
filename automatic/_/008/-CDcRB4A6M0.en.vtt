today I'm gonna do another video in my
breakage<00:00:05.580> series<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.420> I'm<00:00:07.109> going<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.440> show

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
breakage series and I'm going to show

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.150 
breakage series and I'm going to show
you<00:00:07.710> how<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.280> do<00:00:08.639> tangle<00:00:09.360> my<00:00:09.480> hair<00:00:09.809> with<00:00:10.380> minimum

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
you how I do tangle my hair with minimum

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.410 
you how I do tangle my hair with minimum
effort<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.500> with<00:00:13.500> minimum<00:00:14.130> breakage<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
effort and with minimum breakage so I

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.240 
effort and with minimum breakage so I
deep<00:00:16.230> condition<00:00:16.500> my<00:00:16.890> hair<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.990> do<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
deep condition my hair and I do have a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.029 
deep condition my hair and I do have a
carrier<00:00:20.939> bag<00:00:21.150> over<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.960> which<00:00:22.619> I'm<00:00:22.830> using

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
carrier bag over it which I'm using

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.660 
carrier bag over it which I'm using
instead<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.970> shower<00:00:24.210> cap<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.920> put<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
instead of a shower cap and I just put a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.210 
instead of a shower cap and I just put a
headscarf<00:00:27.449> over<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.320> while<00:00:28.650> I'm<00:00:28.890> deep

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
headscarf over that while I'm deep

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.120 
headscarf over that while I'm deep
conditioning<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.530> my<00:00:34.620> hair<00:00:34.860> it's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
conditioning and this is my hair it's

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.639 
conditioning and this is my hair it's
known<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.550> deep<00:00:36.030> conditioner<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.559> is

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
known as deep conditioner so this is

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.010 
known as deep conditioner so this is
what<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.420> use<00:00:39.420> my<00:00:39.450> fingers<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
what I do I just use my fingers and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.319 
what I do I just use my fingers and
start<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> bottom<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.149> gradually<00:00:42.149> work

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
start at the bottom and gradually work

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.410 
start at the bottom and gradually work
my<00:00:42.780> way<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:42.989> detangling<00:00:43.860> my<00:00:43.920> hair<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
my way up detangling my hair and I do a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.910 
my way up detangling my hair and I do a
side<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:46.440> hair<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.550> time<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.710> I<00:00:49.710> actually

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
side of my hair at a time and I actually

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.330 
side of my hair at a time and I actually
use<00:00:50.550> an<00:00:50.969> outside-in<00:00:51.960> detangling<00:00:52.920> method<00:00:53.250> as

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
use an outside-in detangling method as

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
use an outside-in detangling method as
well<00:00:53.489> those<00:00:54.149> are<00:00:54.360> particularly<00:00:54.690> helpful<00:00:54.960> when

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
well those are particularly helpful when

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.160 
well those are particularly helpful when
I<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> roots<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.809> put<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:57.899> fingers

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
I get to the roots and I put my fingers

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
I get to the roots and I put my fingers
in<00:00:58.260> there<00:00:58.440> I'll<00:00:58.680> find<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:59.070> big<00:00:59.879> amount<00:01:00.090> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
in there I'll find a big amount of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.119 
in there I'll find a big amount of
tangles<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.770> she<00:01:01.920> cannot

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
tangles like this and then it she cannot

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.670 
tangles like this and then it she cannot
move<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.940> I'll<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.239> start<00:01:03.480> within<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.260> bit

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
move so I'll actually start within a bit

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.550 
move so I'll actually start within a bit
of<00:01:04.830> hair<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.400> outside<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> I'll<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.780> go

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
of hair on the outside so I'll just go

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.750 
of hair on the outside so I'll just go
in<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:09.200> basically<00:01:10.200> try<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.760> detangle

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
in and and basically try and detangle

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.990 
in and and basically try and detangle
from<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> outside<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.960> more<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.970> then

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
from the outside a bit more and then

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.260 
from the outside a bit more and then
work<00:01:15.420> my<00:01:15.450> way<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.250> depth<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.759> my<00:01:18.000> hair

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
work my way in to the depth of my hair

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.499 
work my way in to the depth of my hair
and<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:19.409> doing<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.820> detangle<00:01:21.390> my<00:01:21.479> hair

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and in doing this I can detangle my hair

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.620 
and in doing this I can detangle my hair
a<00:01:21.810> lot<00:01:22.020> quicker<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.580> ended<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.909> losing<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
a lot quicker and I ended up losing a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.320 
a lot quicker and I ended up losing a
lot<00:01:24.869> less<00:01:25.380> hair<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.460> live<00:01:26.610> off<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.119> try

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
lot less hair to live off this to try

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.609 
lot less hair to live off this to try
and<00:01:27.920> just<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:30.079> because<00:01:31.079> I'd<00:01:31.380> always

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and just go in there because I'd always

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.490 
and just go in there because I'd always
be<00:01:32.009> horrified<00:01:32.820> by<00:01:32.850> how<00:01:33.630> much<00:01:33.869> hair<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.409> would

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
be horrified by how much hair I would

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.640 
be horrified by how much hair I would
lose<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> was<00:01:36.270> detangling<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.439> when<00:01:37.530> I

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
lose when I was detangling it and when I

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.060 
lose when I was detangling it and when I
was<00:01:38.090> conditioning<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> always<00:01:40.650> use<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
was conditioning it so I always use the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
was conditioning it so I always use the
bottom-to-top<00:01:41.369> method<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> felt<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
bottom-to-top method but I felt like it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620 
bottom-to-top method but I felt like it
wasn't<00:01:43.350> doing<00:01:43.740> enough<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.180> developed

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
wasn't doing enough and then I developed

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.970 
wasn't doing enough and then I developed
this<00:01:45.689> outside<00:01:46.229> investor<00:01:46.770> died

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
this outside investor died

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.250 
this outside investor died
the<00:01:48.100> dramatic<00:01:48.640> improvement<00:01:49.360> in<00:01:49.420> math<00:01:49.660> had<00:01:49.990> I

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
the dramatic improvement in math had I

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.710 
the dramatic improvement in math had I
lost<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.890> I<00:01:51.280> really<00:01:51.970> didn't<00:01:52.210> lose<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.360> much

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
lost and I really didn't lose that much

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.220 
lost and I really didn't lose that much
hair<00:01:53.020> breakage<00:01:53.800> at<00:01:54.280> all

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
hair breakage at all

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.320 
hair breakage at all
I'm<00:01:56.230> just<00:01:56.470> fast-forwarding<00:01:57.220> here<00:01:57.520> through

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
I'm just fast-forwarding here through

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.320 
I'm just fast-forwarding here through
all<00:01:58.690> of<00:01:58.750> my<00:01:59.080> detangling<00:01:59.770> I've<00:02:00.400> worked<00:02:00.790> my<00:02:01.060> way

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
all of my detangling I've worked my way

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.870 
all of my detangling I've worked my way
through<00:02:01.360> out<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.290> left<00:02:02.710> side<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:03.130> my<00:02:03.280> head<00:02:03.610> and

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
through out the left side of my head and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.360 
through out the left side of my head and
I'll<00:02:04.540> just<00:02:04.750> show<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.020> how<00:02:05.380> much<00:02:05.620> hair<00:02:06.070> I've

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
I'll just show you how much hair I've

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.420 
I'll just show you how much hair I've
lost<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:07.030> total<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:08.200> here<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.680> it's<00:02:09.040> really

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
lost in total so here it is it's really

head<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:20.710> you<00:02:20.800> just<00:02:20.980> basically<00:02:21.130> times<00:02:21.730> that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
head so you just basically times that

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.270 
head so you just basically times that
whitey<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.960> that's<00:02:23.110> how<00:02:23.290> much<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.620> lose<00:02:23.770> my

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.250 
whitey and that's how much I lose my
whole<00:02:24.520> head<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.820> hair<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:25.960> four

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
whole head of hair and that it's four

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.020 
whole head of hair and that it's four
days<00:02:26.470> shed<00:02:26.830> hair<00:02:27.040> as<00:02:27.160> well<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.520> really<00:02:27.850> don't

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
days shed hair as well so I really don't

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.550 
days shed hair as well so I really don't
think<00:02:28.090> that's<00:02:28.390> bad<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.750> think<00:02:29.140> used<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.380> lose<00:02:29.530> a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
think that's bad I think used to lose a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.740 
think that's bad I think used to lose a
lot<00:02:29.830> more<00:02:30.100> hair<00:02:30.310> than<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.730> before<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.390> use

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
lot more hair than that before I use

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.550 
lot more hair than that before I use
this<00:02:31.960> outside-in<00:02:32.890> method<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:34.390> then<00:02:35.020> I<00:02:35.170> go<00:02:35.380> on

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
this outside-in method so then I go on

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.160 
this outside-in method so then I go on
and<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.890> use<00:02:36.160> my<00:02:36.370> seamless<00:02:37.000> kind<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.930> a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
and I use my seamless kind so this is a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.770 
and I use my seamless kind so this is a
magic<00:02:39.100> star<00:02:39.370> comb<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.060> by<00:02:41.760> Hercules

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
really wide teeth and it's seamless so

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.000 
really wide teeth and it's seamless so
we<00:02:47.830> have<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:47.980> lot<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.190> normal<00:02:48.400> combs<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:50.010> when

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
we have a lot of normal combs and when

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.220 
we have a lot of normal combs and when
you're<00:02:51.130> combing<00:02:51.310> your<00:02:51.430> hair<00:02:51.550> there<00:02:51.880> seems<00:02:52.230> in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
over time so that's why I've invested in
