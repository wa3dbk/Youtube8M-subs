00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.440
 improving visual acuity and 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.890
 of the perception of contrasts by the 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.730
 software revitalizes y in eurovision 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.390
 marketed in France by the company 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.160
 voice is based on two notions 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.810
 the organization of the visual cerebral cortex 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.630
 described by the Nobel Prize 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.090
 hubbell and vl on the one hand and secondly 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.100
 on the notion of brain plasticity 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.610
 this is the one that we explain will have 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.319
 in this short film ppe-of organs of the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.879
 human body are as complex and 

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.829
 delicate that the functioning of the 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.079
 brain that's why science 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.949
 increases its commitment to unravel its 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.809
 mysteries until the 50s the 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.370
 brain of the adult and is considered 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.350
 like a network of cables in the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.809
 connections the neural circuits 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.179
 were fixed and immutable 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.859
 discoveries made from such 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.229
 that how the brain grows and gets 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.429
 develop are surprising is 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.949
 impressive 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.829
 current research shows that the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.920
 brain and plastics and dynamics and this 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.750
 throughout life its development 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.090
 results not only from the nature of 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.549
 these tissues but is also a function of the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.939
 quality and quantity of stimuli 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.979
 that he receives neuroplasticity and this 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.109
 ability of the brain to modify its 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.950
 structures based on experiences 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:23.890
 experienced 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.840
 every new learning requires 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.409
 brain to reorganize 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.240
 thus creating new connections these 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.039
 new experiences are then 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.750
 incorporated into the memory of the individual 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.149
 the quality of the image depends both 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.549
 of the image perceived by the eye and 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.280
 process then operating in the cortex 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.329
 visual 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.820
 considering this context of 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.789
 neuroplasticity a new treatment has 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.039
 been elaborated it relies on perception 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.229
 visual improvement and 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.740
 neural connections responsible for the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.039
 vision 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:05.789
 this software used and the technology 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.789
 correctives revitalizes ion neuro vision 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.780
 neuro vision requires a computer 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.940
 connected to the internet 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.340
 it offers exercise sessions 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.070
 using a set of 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.250
 specific stimuli for each patient 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.620
 based on gap tasks or these 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.380
 church the sensitivity to contrasts and 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.880
 the visual acknowledgment as described by paula 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.740
 it's about 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.110
 the science behind eurovision is 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.630
 a neuro adaptation that promotes 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.850
 spatial interactions between neurons 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:46.190
 specific no revision was approved 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.810
 by the fda US federal agency 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.080
 food products and 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.570
 medicated in 2001 for treatment 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.800
 from English to the worst until then considered 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.590
 as irreversible 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.840
 after nine years of clinical trials have 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.840
 been since realized for cases of 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.180
 myopia presbyopia not surged refractive 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.120
 improvements in the function 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.550
 visual and permanent results have 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.890
 extended its use to patients 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.400
 after cataract surgery with 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.040
 a multifocal plan of cornea rings 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.030
 intras too badly as well as for cases 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.019
 of retinal degeneration 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.810
 the equipment used to measure 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:31.610
 visual acuity and sensitivity to 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.410
 contrasts and the optech 6500 studies 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.989
 have shown that a patient with a 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.850
 restaurent +4 had good acuity 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:43.070
 visual uncorrected from near and far 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.600
 however in some cases the vision 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.190
 intermediate and is unsatisfactory 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.930
 in these cases we measured a 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.660
 reduced sensitivity to 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.549
 contrasts 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.640
 we decided to submit 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.489
 five patients who had been implanted 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.220
 a restaurent plus four to twenty 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.000
 neuro vision sessions over a period 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.000
 five weeks 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.570
 uncorrected visual acuity is 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.600
 improved from 8 tenths to 10/10 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.530
 while visual acuity 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.070
 intermediate of 5 10 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.990
 m to six tenths in addition the 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.460
 contrast sensitivity after 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.770
 treatment had returned to normalcy 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.380
 patients have postponed a 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.580
 decreased glare and a 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.639
 improved night vision at the 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.250
 end of treatment he was satisfied the 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.919
 patients with a keratoconus who had a 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.110
 implant intras too bad complain 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.930
 usually night vision 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.850
 imperfect and egotistical years despite 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.660
 improvement of visual acuity 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.660
 correct 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.820
 after Eurovision visual acuity 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.610
 corrected went from 6 tenths to eight 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.900
 tenths 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:12.330
 improvement in the quality of their 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.530
 vision was remarkable reviewing the 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.759
 patients with retinitis 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.370
 pigment 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.560
 we found that their acuity 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.680
 visual with the best correction 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.039
 was 6 tenths in the conditions 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.889
 pic pic with good lighting and 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:32.389
 four tenths in conditions but 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.389
 aupic low lighting 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.660
 this allowed us to confirm the 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.150
 difficulties of his patients in vision 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.009
 nocturne 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.349
 after twenty-three session acuity 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.729
 visual in conditions but aupic 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:49.380
 improved from four tenths to 8/10 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.630
 a noticeable improvement in 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.750
 sensitivity to contrasts and the 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.389
 night vision have made a lot more 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.650
 on activities such as driving or 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.650
 to walk at night 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.210
 the results so far 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.669
 are encouraging 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.940
 in all the cases we followed 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.860
 average visual acuity sensitivity 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.830
 to contrasts and settings 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:21.300
 functional all have increased 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:24.389
 significantly of the studies 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.720
 subsequent ones with more sampling 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:30.630
 wide and longer follow-up confirmed 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.130
 The obtained results 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.710
 the revolutionary aspect of 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.550
 perceptual visual learning is 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:40.139
 relating to the fact that disturbed visions 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.810
 requiring complex resolutions 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.389
 have been standardized through the creation 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.270
 new connections and trails 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.479
 still unexplored within the cortex 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.479
 visual 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.970
 this new technique very 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.130
 promising represents a change 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.770
 conceptual in the near many 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.210
 eye diseases 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.060
 today the key in order to 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.530
 improving visual function 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.310
 lies in the brain and not only 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.770
 in the eye 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.260
 a later step in the quest 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.889
 continuous of the man is to have a view 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.889
 better
