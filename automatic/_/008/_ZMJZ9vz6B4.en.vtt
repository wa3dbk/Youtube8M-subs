00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello backstage hello from the computex 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.420
 in taipei we are here at the end 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.150
 the press conference and what I am here 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.470
 hold in hand this is an alko nia 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.970
 tablet iconia speaks windows sb3 and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.769
 this is quite the case for many reasons 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.039
 exciting because on the one hand we have here 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.199
 an 8 inch device with intel processor and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.809
 windows 8 so no windows nt but 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.610
 real windows 8 on the all programs 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.489
 They usually go down too 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.110
 Windows run and that too 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.260
 a pretty interesting price 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.730
 namely from 329 euro it should be in july 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.289
 in Germany and what is now 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.590
 exactly are we watching us now times 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.410
 on 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.890
 on the front we have a 8 1 inch 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.420
 large display with a resolution of 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.820
 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:03.870
 Thus, according to ACER , SW 3 is the first and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.619
 the first one-hand full-fledged computer 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.850
 Somehow that's the name of a hand 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.560
 restricted applies one can it 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.280
 easily hold in one hand and one 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.520
 It can also be imaginative 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.170
 serve 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.390
 but it's really fun, though 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.850
 of course not on besides it is then 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.970
 relatively shaky and insecure in hand and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.590
 therefore relatively many employees stand 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.369
 Let me continue with two 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.840
 fingers on before it falls off me what 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.720
 pretty good is really good to me 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.880
 likes it reacts very fast for it 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.900
 Of course, it is also the clear trend 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 responsible 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.280
 So that works really well 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.470
 microsoft office is preinstalled the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.479
 usual windows of applications are 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.549
 preinstalled and we heard earlier 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.860
 have now found 70,000 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.090
 also use in the windows marketplace 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.320
 Unfortunately, not all of them are touch 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.210
 but optimized at least 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.490
 you can work with it and abo 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.280
 work your 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.880
 there is an optional keyboard for that 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.820
 iconia w3 and I can do that too 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.799
 actually correct potter the device to 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.200
 can log in my office programs 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.620
 start and write on the keyboard 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.019
 as if it were a notebook 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.550
 Conveniently, the 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.650
 product developers from acer also thought 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.510
 made a point what most 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.250
 other colleagues the optional 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.230
 Unfortunately, keyboards do not offer 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.940
 because maybe I can 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.470
 tablet with a lot of fantasy just so in 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.269
 the one pocket rise the keyboard 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.930
 but not guaranteed in the other 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.390
 and that's why you better have the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.880
 loudspeaker on the side of the device 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.549
 a bit indented finally that can 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.769
 tablet middle display side forward 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.120
 here it is, but it is stable in there 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.850
 the display is protected 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.510
 the price for this is the keyboard itself 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.250
 not protected 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.590
 the keys will probably come on 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.450
 backpack a little bit off whether they 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.910
 you have to endure that someday 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.770
 try out the practice 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.390
 The idea is great 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.770
 maybe it would be different 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.290
 can solve this on the buttons 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.820
 protected but so at least I fall 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.260
 now not quite at the moment 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.760
 how that can go the falls again 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.310
 to look in detail 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.130
 it comes in two versions and 32 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.140
 and 64 GB of RAM are 2 GB RAM 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.040
 always about the 32 gigabyte version 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.730
 fits the mentioned 329 euro the 64th 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.490
 gb version costs 50 euros more 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.310
 we have the stereo speakers here 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.620
 the charging socket for charging the battery 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.960
 the battery should by the way at a 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.360
 Playback of 720p videos eight hours 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.200
 It's also a very tough one 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.210
 decent value 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.330
 the jack to connect from 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:49.440
 headphones on the top of the micro 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.850
 sd memory card slot for 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.840
 memory cards when we speak internally 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.570
 no longer sufficient the two buttons to 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.280
 Regulation of the volume one out 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.460
 key here snaps the usb and lures 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.500
 behind 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.700
 Overall, the iconia w3 makes real 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.890
 very good impression 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.230
 but of course, it also has a bit 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.150
 his hard and one of them 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.670
 at the price must be saved and 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.910
 that's what it has done for example in the display 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.910
 the display is sufficiently sharp 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.240
 But the angles could definitely be 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.490
 be better 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.930
 that is, if I from that of the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.910
 page from pure group I can indeed 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.620
 still reading everything but the details 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.449
 and especially the colors go completely 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.639
 flutes if I can watch from here 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.040
 only a maximum guess that we here 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.810
 have a green background and the 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.000
 Details that are exactly there are somewhere 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.020
 Kringel down there in the background the 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.389
 you can not even recognize it 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.460
 and secondly, you have to look at the small one 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.040
 version with 32 GB memory also a 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.040
 take care of windows 8 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.590
 just needs a lot of memory and it 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.090
 are just 10 gb free the users 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.800
 can still use itself 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.840
 Although there is the micro sd 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.400
 memory card slot on the top of the 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.229
 Memory cards are usually but 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.120
 much slower than the internal one 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.220
 memory and just installing from 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.440
 extensive applications and so on 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.169
 that makes less fun then 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.030
 nevertheless, it is under the dash 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.220
 maybe a great alternative 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.660
 for those who are between tablet 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.169
 and notebook have to decide or 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.330
 want 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.950
 because most tablets can 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.300
 not a computer completely 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.070
 say I can not speak 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.729
 just a quick digicam via usb 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.889
 connect 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.240
 prefer copying the photos by e-mail 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.889
 stuck or maybe short 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.770
 I can work with this 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.610
 tablet already and that too 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:45.220
 that I compromise on without too much 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.610
 lying on the sofa and resting in the internet 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.610
 can surf
