00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.770
 the past week 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.330
 We talk in the kitchen. 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.410
 I think everybody already heard it already 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.520
 You know here is a famous stage party . 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.010

 that fast food has a little bit I am 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.020
 in love then we decided 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.680
 experience and 70 to reach a stage 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:24.490
 similar to what we could but 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.490
 exploded the whole kitchen first robot 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:37.229
 I know it's not that game said that the 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.359
 people created them are very similar to 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.520
 those of the organization were also a 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.829
 daughter inside and the droplets of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.069
 chocolate goes out like we do not have anything 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.939
 fat in our government put the 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.939
 chocolate 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.649
 the noise of dogs then 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.689
 We need to have a good time. 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.200
 forever 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:10.679
 In this magical battle has chocolate james 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:14.310
 the most delicious Belgian chocolate 8 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.650
 chocolate then you will follow the step 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.650
 while we catch our mouths more 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.230
 let's go to the bench Braga will start 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.349
 jot down the ingredients we go 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.659
 need the type of wheat flour 3 4 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.349
 cup of Mexican brown sugar 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.870
 sugar 1 cup of chocolate drops 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.120
 chocolate or much chopped chocolate one 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.209
 coffee spoon of baking soda and 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.950
 is not the cafe is half a lemon carbonate 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.510
 two people 169 of unsalted wood standing 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.829
 in an electric mixer and starts 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.750
 if you do not have one. 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.519
 mixer you can do on hand goes 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.019
 take a little longer on my arm but 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.660
 it will not be the same 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.480
 then you will put butter in the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.730
 brown sugar the common sugar and I think 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.459
 placed pilot would hit next 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.730
 add the two eggs and beat one more 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.730
 turn 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.470
 put the flour and knock again 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.100
 Add the baking soda to the 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.800
 a little bit and then put the 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.020
 lemon juice brother goes from August to 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.510
 our mass the bicarbonate it has a 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.310
 very important role in what is now 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.140
 you ask me what it is I will not 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.090
 know to answer if you do not put the 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.910
 baking it will not work 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.580
 then put the chocolate as much as you 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.560
 you want and put the dough in the 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.410
 refrigerator for a timing until she stays 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.080
 firmer with the preheated oven in 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.090
 130 causes from the biscuit by 20 turns 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.260
 not worth more than 20 minutes of 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.360
 business will take 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.770
 Another recommendation is based on this 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.470
 any of butter 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.930
 you can not let many of them 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.700
 because it opens quite a while - 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.710
 you put farther better and 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.530
 more beautiful will always run out 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.980
 the risk of visibility 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.980
 the end 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:27.160
 the pea pickles chocolate has not yet 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:38.479
 takes the chocolate nobody wants to discuss 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:41.229
 regulation that is not clear and 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.229
 its clear 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.760
 OK 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:16.150
 the band 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:18.490
 It soon gets better, it 's done now. 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.540

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.570
 normal 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.120
 I think we 'll have a house of 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.010
 quite so, who is not even talking 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.850
 Do you have any idea that because of the cup I am 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:21.580
 talking to a person accompany in 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.530
 blue and pull a little bit of the base always 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.000
 leaving this quiet lateral space 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.280
 because this is what will give the impression of 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.240
 I 'll be a little flatter going 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.260
 do that 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.260
 the corners of the world
