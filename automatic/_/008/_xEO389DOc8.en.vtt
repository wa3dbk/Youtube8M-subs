hold down the basically this hold down
bracket<00:00:43.500> over<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.460> battery<00:00:45.090> right<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.420> so

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
bracket over the battery right here so

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.830 
bracket over the battery right here so
you<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.530> undo<00:00:46.980> these<00:00:47.190> two<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.940> then<00:00:48.420> undo

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you just undo these two and then undo

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.290 
you just undo these two and then undo
the<00:00:48.870> two<00:00:49.640> 10<00:00:50.640> millimeter<00:00:53.120> positive<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the two 10 millimeter positive and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.819 
the two 10 millimeter positive and
negative<00:00:54.660> first<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> negative<00:00:55.379> first

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
negative first do the negative first

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.490 
negative first do the negative first
that<00:00:56.129> comes<00:00:56.340> off<00:00:56.489> first<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.059> positive<00:00:57.629> but

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that comes off first and positive but

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
that comes off first and positive but
you're<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.489> using<00:00:59.850> simple<00:01:00.030> tools<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you're just using simple tools like this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.060 
you're just using simple tools like this
ten<00:01:01.170> millimeter<00:01:02.059> flat<00:01:03.059> wrench<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.830> you<00:01:04.830> could

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
ten millimeter flat wrench and you could

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.960 
ten millimeter flat wrench and you could
use<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.670> ten<00:01:06.420> millimeter<00:01:06.630> deep<00:01:07.400> in<00:01:08.400> order<00:01:08.850> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
use a ten millimeter deep in order to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.399 
use a ten millimeter deep in order to
get<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.409> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
get to this one this one here and you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
get to this one this one here and you
don't<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.770> tighten<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.130> too<00:01:14.280> tight<00:01:14.549> so

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
don't have to tighten it too tight so

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.550 
don't have to tighten it too tight so
anyway<00:01:15.509> I'll<00:01:15.630> show<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.900> how<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
anyway I'll show you how to do that and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.880 
anyway I'll show you how to do that and
once<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.890> remove<00:01:17.189> them<00:01:17.689> all<00:01:18.689> right<00:01:18.930> batteries

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
once I remove them all right batteries

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920 
once I remove them all right batteries
typically<00:01:20.400> last<00:01:20.729> about<00:01:20.880> four<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.420> five<00:01:21.450> years

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
typically last about four to five years

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.810 
typically last about four to five years
if<00:01:22.170> yours<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.619> about<00:01:22.860> four<00:01:23.189> years<00:01:23.310> old<00:01:23.580> which

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
if yours is about four years old which

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.570 
if yours is about four years old which
this<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.860> recommend<00:01:25.860> changing<00:01:26.070> amount

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
this one is I recommend changing amount

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.010 
this one is I recommend changing amount
you<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.330> stuck<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
you don't want to be stuck out on the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.300 
you don't want to be stuck out on the
road<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> dead<00:01:29.369> battery<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> once<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.159> get

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
road with a dead battery so once you get

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.670 
road with a dead battery so once you get
this<00:01:32.490> ten<00:01:32.759> millimeter<00:01:34.430> nut<00:01:35.430> I'm<00:01:35.640> done<00:01:36.680> this

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
this ten millimeter nut I'm done this

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.469 
this ten millimeter nut I'm done this
bracket<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.189> basically<00:01:38.759> fall<00:01:39.030> away

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
bracket will basically fall away

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.630 
bracket will basically fall away
just<00:01:39.900> remember<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.530> anchoring<00:01:41.070> points<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
just remember the anchoring points that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.190 
just remember the anchoring points that
you<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> end<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:43.790> there<00:01:45.200> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you have at the end of this there you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.630 
you have at the end of this there you
can't<00:01:46.439> really<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:46.979> real<00:01:47.189> well<00:01:47.399> but

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
can't really see them real well but

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.760 
can't really see them real well but
there<00:01:47.820> are<00:01:47.970> anchor<00:01:48.329> points<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.899> remind

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
there are anchor points just remind

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.679 
there are anchor points just remind
yourself<00:01:50.130> where<00:01:50.310> those<00:01:50.460> are<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:51.540> when

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
yourself where those are and then when

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
yourself where those are and then when
you<00:01:51.780> put<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> new<00:01:52.290> battery<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.770> always<00:01:53.310> note

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
you put the new battery in always note

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.690 
you put the new battery in always note
the<00:01:53.939> notation<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.409> orientation<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the notation or the orientation of the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.550 
the notation or the orientation of the
positive<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.540> negative<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> positives

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
positive and negative so the positives

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.310 
positive and negative so the positives
here<00:01:58.890> negative<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.479> side<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.020> your

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
here negative is on this side so your

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.590 
here negative is on this side so your
new<00:02:01.439> battery<00:02:01.799> will<00:02:02.009> drop<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.549> exactly<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
new battery will drop in exactly the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.130 
new battery will drop in exactly the
same<00:02:03.810> spot<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.950> again<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:06.479> bracket<00:02:06.899> just

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
same spot so again the bracket just

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.600 
same spot so again the bracket just
comes<00:02:07.680> away<00:02:07.799> like<00:02:08.099> this

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.839 

again<00:02:11.610> remember<00:02:12.060> those<00:02:12.209> anchor<00:02:12.599> points<00:02:12.769> below

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
again remember those anchor points below

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.369 
again remember those anchor points below
put<00:02:14.849> those<00:02:14.970> off<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.360> side<00:02:15.629> take<00:02:16.019> off<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
put those off to the side take off the

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.970 
put those off to the side take off the
negative<00:02:16.739> like<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:18.379> positive<00:02:19.379> like<00:02:19.680> this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
negative like this positive like this

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:30.080 
negative like this positive like this
and<00:02:25.790> your<00:02:26.790> battery<00:02:27.150> cover<00:02:27.980> them<00:02:28.980> up<00:02:29.069> just<00:02:29.940> like

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and your battery cover them up just like

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.210 
and your battery cover them up just like
that<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:31.970> then<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.150> grab<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.660> battery

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
that and then you just grab the battery

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.990 
that and then you just grab the battery
and<00:02:35.220> out<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.330> comes<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.549> tray<00:02:41.760> below

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
and out it comes so in the tray below

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720 
and out it comes so in the tray below
that's<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.079> be<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> lot<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.440> debris<00:02:43.829> just

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
that's going to be a lot of debris just

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.839 
that's going to be a lot of debris just
pull<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> tray<00:02:45.329> out<00:02:46.130> either<00:02:47.130> vacuum<00:02:47.340> clean<00:02:47.730> it

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
pull the tray out either vacuum clean it

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.100 
pull the tray out either vacuum clean it
out<00:02:47.940> or<00:02:48.829> or<00:02:50.000> wash<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.390> dry<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.019> then

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
out or or wash it and dry it and then

out or or wash it and dry it and then
put<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.799> back<00:02:52.829> in<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.400> same<00:02:53.610> spot

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.229 

okay<00:02:57.209> these<00:02:57.510> batteries<00:02:58.079> installed<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:59.239> marked

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
okay these batteries installed I marked

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.650 
okay these batteries installed I marked
the<00:03:00.599> month<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.769> year<00:03:01.799> that<00:03:02.660> I'm

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
the month and the year that I'm

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.309 
the month and the year that I'm
replacing<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.440> battery<00:03:05.930> had<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.959> little<00:03:07.170> bit

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
replacing this battery had a little bit

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.750 
replacing this battery had a little bit
of<00:03:07.349> corrosion<00:03:07.650> underneath<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.310> positive

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
of corrosion underneath the positive

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.440 
of corrosion underneath the positive
terminals<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.450> put<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.690> little<00:03:09.930> bit<00:03:10.049> of

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
terminals so I put a little bit of

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.590 
terminals so I put a little bit of
anti-corrosion<00:03:12.470> liquid<00:03:13.670> just<00:03:14.670> behind<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
anti-corrosion liquid just behind the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.360 
anti-corrosion liquid just behind the
terminal<00:03:16.019> as<00:03:16.170> well<00:03:16.650> as<00:03:16.769> underneath<00:03:17.069> it

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
terminal as well as underneath it

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.520 
terminal as well as underneath it
underneath<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.180> positive<00:03:18.600> terminal<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.109> now

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
underneath the positive terminal so now

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.129 
underneath the positive terminal so now
we<00:03:19.590> put<00:03:19.859> on<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.250> cover<00:03:20.790> over<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.660> battery

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:37.010 

open<00:03:25.139> side<00:03:25.349> goes<00:03:25.590> towards<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:25.980> front

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.600 

sits<00:03:38.020> in<00:03:38.200> like<00:03:38.380> such<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:39.040> then<00:03:39.220> put<00:03:39.460> the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
sits in like such and then put the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:04:37.650 
sits in like such and then put the
bracket<00:03:40.000> over<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.390> top

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.450 

make<00:04:38.660> sure<00:04:38.870> it's<00:04:39.080> hooked<00:04:39.230> in<00:04:39.500> at<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:40.130> bottom

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
make sure it's hooked in at the bottom

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.340 
make sure it's hooked in at the bottom
or<00:04:40.640> at<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.940> base<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.420> those<00:04:41.990> hooks<00:04:42.230> and<00:04:42.640> then

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
or at the base of those hooks and then

00:04:44.350 --> 00:05:07.750 
or at the base of those hooks and then
tighten<00:04:45.350> it<00:04:45.410> so<00:04:45.740> that<00:04:45.890> it's<00:04:46.040> slow<00:05:06.670> tighten<00:05:07.670> it

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
tighten it so that it's slow tighten it

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.260 
tighten it so that it's slow tighten it
so<00:05:07.940> it's<00:05:08.060> snug<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.450> doesn't<00:05:08.720> move<00:05:10.090> look<00:05:11.090> at

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
so it's snug and doesn't move look at

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:20.380 
so it's snug and doesn't move look at
the<00:05:11.540> positive<00:05:12.440> side<00:05:12.470> first<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:20.180> your

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
the positive side first and your

00:05:20.390 --> 00:06:12.730 
the positive side first and your
negative<00:05:20.510> terminal

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.530 

so<00:06:13.740> you<00:06:13.830> want<00:06:13.980> to<00:06:14.070> get<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.310> snug<00:06:14.670> so<00:06:15.270> that<00:06:15.420> they

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
so you want to get the snug so that they

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:26.310 
so you want to get the snug so that they
don't<00:06:15.750> move

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.400 

and<00:06:26.620> then<00:06:27.070> you're<00:06:27.250> done
