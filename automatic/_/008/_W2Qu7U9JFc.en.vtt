since<00:02:32.520> 1846<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.959> think<00:02:34.959> when<00:02:35.080> people<00:02:35.110> have<00:02:35.470> come

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
since 1846 I think when people have come

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.470 
since 1846 I think when people have come
to<00:02:35.740> Niagara<00:02:35.950> Falls<00:02:36.130> they<00:02:36.700> come<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.180> see<00:02:37.360> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
to Niagara Falls they come to see the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.390 
to Niagara Falls they come to see the
Falls<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:38.170> they<00:02:38.350> want<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.650> see<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.920> from<00:02:39.070> every

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
Falls and they want to see it from every

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.550 
Falls and they want to see it from every
angle<00:02:39.430> possible<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:41.050> certainly<00:02:41.260> get<00:02:41.530> a

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
angle possible and you certainly get a

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.900 
angle possible and you certainly get a
different<00:02:41.950> perspective<00:02:42.070> when<00:02:42.640> you're<00:02:42.730> down

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
here looking up all right so this is why

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.210 
here looking up all right so this is why
they<00:02:46.300> call<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.540> mate<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.050> Mist<00:02:47.380> it's
