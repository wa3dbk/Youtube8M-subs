 hi paw cat friends tv in this 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.800
 occasion we want to share a 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.640
 way to prepare this traditional 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.119
 dessert that is easy and delicious 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.119
 come with us please 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.140
 we're going to need a cup or 200 grams 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.200
 of sugar 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.270
 two bars of cream cheese in 190 grams 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.579
 each 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.710
 a tablespoon and a half of vanilla 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.730
 10 eggs 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.470
 two cans of condensed milk 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.470
 and two cans of evaporated milk 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.490
 start making the candy 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.189
 melting the sugar in a pan and 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.159
 when it looks golden it pours into the mold 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.189
 that you are going to use distributing it by 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.189
 all the background be careful not to burn yourself 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.189
 because the mold is going to heat 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.189
 quickly 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.100
 Y 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.300
 while it cools it liquefies the rest of the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.170
 ingredients to integrate 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.170
 perfectly 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.710
 empty the mixture in your mold 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.799
 in this case we are using a mold 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.220
 of 3 liters but you can make it smaller 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:11.050
 or large as you wish by reducing or 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.150
 increasing all the ingredients 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.689
 cover it with aluminum foil 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.689
 i 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.610
 or 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.400
 place it in a wall container 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.879
 high and add water to bake it 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.879
 water bath 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.770
 with the oven preheated to 180 degrees 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.530
 centigrade baked approximately one 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.230
 hour for every liter and a half of mixing or 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.230
 until when inserting a knife this one 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.900
 come out clean in our case it took two 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.730
 hours to meet 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.250
 let it cool completely and 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.319
 preference refrigerates the at least one pair 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.319
 of hours before unmolding what 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.910
 and how 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.430
 this plan you can decorate with cream 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.190
