00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
in the tomato puree I select tomato

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.890

puree<00:02:32.920> versus<00:02:33.430> every<00:02:33.790> other<00:02:33.940> thing<00:02:34.240> because<00:02:34.720> I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
puree versus every other thing because I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.110 
puree versus every other thing because I
think<00:02:35.350> gives<00:02:35.650> very<00:02:36.100> smooth<00:02:36.490> flavor<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:37.090> my

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
everything together but for now we just

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.430 
everything together but for now we just
need<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:46.060> reduce<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.810> heat<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.440> simmer<00:02:48.330> so

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
need to reduce the heat to a simmer so

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.240 
need to reduce the heat to a simmer so
here<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:52.360> gonna<00:02:52.750> simmer<00:02:53.200> for<00:02:53.709> quite<00:02:54.100> a

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.410 
long time we're going to chuck it in one
hour<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.800> figure<00:02:57.370> out<00:02:57.430> if<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.940> needs<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.239> little

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
hour and figure out if it needs a little

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.840 
hour and figure out if it needs a little
bit<00:02:58.630> longer<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.230> then<00:02:59.290> we<00:02:59.800> got<00:02:59.920> curate<00:03:00.489> and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
bit longer and then we got curate and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
spiciness and we need a little bit of

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.650 
spiciness and we need a little bit of
salt<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:08.320> we<00:03:08.739> are<00:03:08.920> going<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.489> add<00:03:09.730> salt<00:03:10.090> now<00:03:10.360> and
