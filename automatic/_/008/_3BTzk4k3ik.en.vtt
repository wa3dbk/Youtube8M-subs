00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:13.240
 are and he presents his series x 85 a 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.130
 TV with 4k resolution trying 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.260
 offer the best in quality issues of 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.360
 image with a bright tree panel and a 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.180
 smrtv platform practice but not 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.699
 perfect but let's go little by little in the 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.320
 design section we find ourselves with 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.990
 a television that offers some lines 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.390
 straight and elegant very successful from 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.120
 our point of view and where a led the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.700
 lower part is next to the logo the only 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.829
 point that breaks with that continuity the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.930
 side with a full gray tone on 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:49.600
 an aesthetic that will please most 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:52.110
 of users in the back 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.070
 we found all the connections 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.149
 enough for most users 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.420
 with hdmi connectors usb m hl antenna 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.430
 optical audio connector and others more 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.920
 all located on one side too 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.020
 we found the basic keypad that we 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.060
 allows you to turn on and access the menus 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.759
 in case the command fails 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.770
 going to the subject of sound the quality is 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.290
 good but we should not ask for anything 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.409
 differentiator magnetic speakers 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.420
 fluid offer a little more power and 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.640
 a clear sound in exchange for a 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.770
 reduction in the serious ones that have less 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.110
 body so to watch programs 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.390
 contests or some movie during the 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.579
 Weekend tabletops are valid 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.429
 but to enjoy home cinema 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.409
 better an additional sound equipment 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.570
 regarding the image with 4k content 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.459
 as the demo that we have been able to reproduce 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.399
 through a hard drive that we are and 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.890
 has yielded is simply spectacular in 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.170
 scenes with lots of light we are going to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.509
 have an experience as close as 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.729
 look through a window the level 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.250
 of detail and definition is simply 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.679
 brutal but in dark scenes the thing 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.630
 changes while with clear scenes 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.750
 the viewing angles are kept very 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.090
 well in dark scenes we notice how the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.250
 blacks appear a little washed to the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.530
 move sideways by 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.870
 Of course this is not the normal position 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.850
 to see the screen but even in 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.720
 some moments for his system of 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.630
 illumination 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.610
 gillette we also see that the control of 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.680
 backlighting is not as effective 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.200
 how we would like the system 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.150
 local attenuation works fine but there 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.490
 moments when you can not turn off 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.710
 uniformly all areas of the 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.350
 screen so we suffer a bit of 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.690
 claudio this can be solved and 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.520
 minimize playing with the settings of 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.770
 lighting according to the image modes 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.140
 but you have to dedicate time to 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.210
 get that quality we look for something 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:54.730
 that for some users it will not be so 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:56.800
 simple to perform otherwise the 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.190
 fluidity and improvement of movements 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.590
 thanks to motionflow xr is appreciated but 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.510
 without being something miraculous like 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.260
 occurs with the rsc next to content 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.660
 with 1080p content, the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.150
 image with great quality but when 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.490
 reduce to 720 p or less 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.860
 we appreciate that lack of clarity that we 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.980
 forces us to move away to minimize the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.620
 effect and clear most chains 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.500
 of tdt are emitting below 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.470
 1080p so we know we 're going to be able to 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.540
 see the tdt strings but we are not going to 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.790
 enjoy the image as we would 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.840
 with other screens such as 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.840
 resolution full hd 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.980
 going to the subject of software and its 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.900
 interface we have a smrtv system that does not 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.940
 It is as complete as options 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.400
 other manufacturers but that meets 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.800
 access to basic services plus value 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.260
 added video limited or music a 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.450
 Sun limit we also have a 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.510
 capable multimedia player 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.760
 content from both usb drives and 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.160
 discs in network but the fluidity of 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.620
 system itself is not the desired the 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.990
 menu changes access to videos to the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.900
 letter as for example the two are 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.000
 quite slow and it's not a problem 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.430
 of internet connection so we can 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.200
 get to despair a bit when 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.200
 let's use these marketing options 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.000
 as with the operation of the 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.340
 cdt are and it tells us that in two seconds 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.310
 the TV must be ready to 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.970
 work but it's not like that - even if 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.699
 we have active h bbtv function 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.110
 how that feature works 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.850
 we have some minimum times that have to 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.650
 be fulfilled so that the 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.740
 content and the image starts at 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.360
 show we can turn it off and then 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.610
 if we are going to notice an improvement in 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.490
 general system fluidity but of course 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.620
 we are rejecting a feature 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.530
 that can be very useful for many 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.139
 users we also have an interface 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.110
 somewhat complicated with some menus and 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.180
 submenus that are not very clear so 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.669
 polish a bit this type of detail 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.639
 it would be something to be thankful for on the part of the sun 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.099
 more so than including a help menu that 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.380
 neither is it clear or useful enough 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:35.500
 for the user in less than experts in 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.630
 definitive the sony x 85 series is a 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.250
 great purchase option the quality of the 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.930
 image is remarkable although not 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.840
 outstanding as we would like a 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.540
 4k television guachirÃ© 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.340
 but if you turn this model into a 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.280
 exellente to consider the 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.290
 time to buy a 4k television pity 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.510
 that the usability of its software and its 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.940
 interface is not something more fluid and 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.070
 known is much simpler of all 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.470
 modes for the faithful to sonny is a 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.350
 perfect model who looks for a great 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.330
 image quality will find it 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:10.010
 although we must also be aware 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.010
 that there are points that can be improved
