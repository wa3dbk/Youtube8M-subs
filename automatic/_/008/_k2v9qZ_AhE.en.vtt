00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
very versatile cockpit to where we can

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.079 
very versatile cockpit to where we can
move<00:01:02.680> different<00:01:03.280> things<00:01:03.460> around<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:03.879> cockpit

and so I'm standing number one little

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.790 
and so I'm standing number one little
high<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.820> get<00:01:07.000> out<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.450> way<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.899> work<00:01:08.590> that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
high to get out of the way of work that

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.139 
high to get out of the way of work that
might<00:01:08.950> be<00:01:09.100> in<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.280> cockpit<00:01:09.490> or<00:01:09.820> people<00:01:10.090> who

might be in the cockpit or people who

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.580 
might be in the cockpit or people who
might<00:01:10.270> be<00:01:10.330> in<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.570> cockpit<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.259> other<00:01:11.380> thing

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
might be in the cockpit the other thing

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.410 
might be in the cockpit the other thing
I'm<00:01:11.740> standing<00:01:12.100> high<00:01:12.310> for<00:01:12.580> is<00:01:12.700> visibility<00:01:13.180> over

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
I'm standing high for is visibility over

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.719 
I'm standing high for is visibility over
the<00:01:13.750> rather<00:01:13.899> tall<00:01:14.259> pilot<00:01:14.649> house<00:01:14.770> one<00:01:15.550> of<00:01:15.580> the

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
the rather tall pilot house one of the

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.960 
the rather tall pilot house one of the
nicest<00:01:16.179> features<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.869> these<00:01:17.100> wheels<00:01:18.100> is<00:01:18.610> that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
nicest features of these wheels is that

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.480 
nicest features of these wheels is that
they<00:01:19.210> are<00:01:19.960> very<00:01:20.289> low<00:01:20.470> friction<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:21.220> they're

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
they are very low friction and they're

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.179 
they are very low friction and they're
part<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.150> secret<00:01:22.750> that<00:01:22.900> allows<00:01:23.229> this<00:01:23.890> boat

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
part of the secret that allows this boat

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.090 
part of the secret that allows this boat
to<00:01:24.400> actually<00:01:24.729> be<00:01:24.880> steered<00:01:25.240> by<00:01:25.860> children<00:01:26.860> that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
to actually be steered by children that

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.719 
to actually be steered by children that
are<00:01:27.220> twelve<00:01:27.780> older<00:01:28.780> women<00:01:29.320> older<00:01:29.770> men<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.280> so

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
are twelve older women older men and so

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.280 
are twelve older women older men and so
it's<00:01:30.909> definitely<00:01:31.360> trying<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:31.720> reduce<00:01:32.049> the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
it's definitely trying to reduce the

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.810 
it's definitely trying to reduce the
strength<00:01:32.560> required<00:01:33.009> to<00:01:33.189> enjoy<00:01:33.400> sails<00:01:33.640> see

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
strength required to enjoy sails see

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.429 
strength required to enjoy sails see
they<00:01:34.060> can<00:01:34.240> steer<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.780> boat<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:35.200> can<00:01:35.350> be

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
they can steer the boat and you can be

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.140 
they can steer the boat and you can be
able<00:01:35.500> here<00:01:35.680> like<00:01:35.829> a<00:01:35.860> co-pilot<00:01:36.280> just<00:01:36.850> get<00:01:37.000> an

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
able here like a co-pilot just get an

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.740 
able here like a co-pilot just get an
eye<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.420> things

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
eye on things

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.899 
eye on things
that's<00:01:37.930> very<00:01:38.170> true<00:01:38.500> it's<00:01:38.979> kind<00:01:39.430> of<00:01:39.520> nice<00:01:39.700> to

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
that's very true it's kind of nice to

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.850 
that's very true it's kind of nice to
have<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.270> copilot<00:01:40.869> on<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.110> other<00:01:41.259> wheel<00:01:41.530> and

definitely trying to make it light but

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.259 
definitely trying to make it light but
not<00:02:52.570> fragile<00:02:52.949> it<00:02:53.949> clearly<00:02:54.400> has<00:02:54.669> to<00:02:54.699> go<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.000> sea

not fragile it clearly has to go to sea

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.539 
not fragile it clearly has to go to sea
and<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.750> can<00:02:55.900> clearly<00:02:56.290> blow<00:02:56.590> hard<00:02:56.980> when<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.430> go

and it can clearly blow hard when you go

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.099 
and it can clearly blow hard when you go
to<00:02:57.609> sea<00:02:57.820> so<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.090> has<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.449> be<00:02:58.510> strong

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
the deck and the house we actually went

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.130 
the deck and the house we actually went
for<00:03:27.700> an<00:03:27.790> even<00:03:28.030> lighter<00:03:28.299> weight<00:03:28.599> we<00:03:28.900> weren't

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
for an even lighter weight we weren't

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.710 
for an even lighter weight we weren't
concerned<00:03:29.319> about<00:03:29.920> puncture<00:03:30.730> resistance<00:03:31.359> of

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
concerned about puncture resistance of

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.660 
concerned about puncture resistance of
hitting<00:03:32.049> things<00:03:32.260> at<00:03:32.530> sea<00:03:32.769> at<00:03:32.980> high<00:03:33.129> speed<00:03:33.489> in

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
hitting things at sea at high speed in

hitting things at sea at high speed in
the<00:03:33.760> Black<00:03:33.970> Knight<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.569> so<00:03:35.530> we<00:03:35.709> went<00:03:35.920> to

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
the Black Knight and so we went to

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.089 
the Black Knight and so we went to
carbon<00:03:37.180> fiber<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.689> this<00:03:37.840> yet<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.379> lower<00:03:38.739> weight

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
carbon fiber to this yet a lower weight

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.710 
carbon fiber to this yet a lower weight
and<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.640> mean<00:03:39.790> we've<00:03:39.939> got<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:40.329> these<00:03:40.450> high-tech

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
and I mean we've got all these high-tech

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.390 
and I mean we've got all these high-tech
materials<00:03:41.439> I'm<00:03:41.530> in<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.739> mess<00:03:41.950> cost<00:03:42.250> a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
materials I'm in this mess cost a

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.229 
materials I'm in this mess cost a
fortune<00:03:42.579> titanium<00:03:43.420> carbon<00:03:43.780> fiber<00:03:44.079> I<00:03:45.040> mean<00:03:45.849> and

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
fortune titanium carbon fiber I mean and

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.759 
fortune titanium carbon fiber I mean and
we're<00:03:46.420> doing<00:03:46.599> a<00:03:46.659> hybrid<00:03:46.810> boat<00:03:47.170> I<00:03:47.200> mean<00:03:47.290> what

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
we're doing a hybrid boat I mean what

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.050 
we're doing a hybrid boat I mean what
are<00:03:47.859> the<00:03:47.920> savings<00:03:48.190> here<00:03:48.489> we're<00:03:48.670> gonna<00:03:48.760> save

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
are the savings here we're gonna save

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.800 
are the savings here we're gonna save
money<00:03:49.269> on<00:03:49.389> the<00:03:49.629> fuel<00:03:49.870> consumption<00:03:51.629> one<00:03:52.629> of<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
many things as a design goal for this

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.920 
many things as a design goal for this
boat<00:03:55.480> was<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.230> have<00:03:56.409> it<00:03:56.440> crewed<00:03:57.040> by<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.310> small

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
boat was to have it crewed by a small

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.629 
boat was to have it crewed by a small
number<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.109> people<00:03:59.620> as<00:03:59.799> we've<00:04:00.099> talked<00:04:00.400> about<00:04:00.489> a

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
number of people as we've talked about a

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.849 
number of people as we've talked about a
little<00:04:00.790> bit<00:04:01.030> different<00:04:01.450> strengths<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:02.290> so

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
little bit different strengths and so

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.069 
little bit different strengths and so
the<00:04:03.129> high<00:04:03.280> tech<00:04:03.549> materials<00:04:03.760> just<00:04:04.510> playing<00:04:04.900> a

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
the high tech materials just playing a

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.210 
the high tech materials just playing a
part<00:04:05.319> of<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.709> mission

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
part of that mission

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.869 
part of that mission
ninety<00:04:06.609> percent<00:04:06.639> of<00:04:07.030> boat<00:04:07.239> doesn't<00:04:07.450> sanding

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
ninety percent of boat doesn't sanding

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.949 
ninety percent of boat doesn't sanding
but<00:04:09.879> absolutely<00:04:10.599> it<00:04:10.810> will<00:04:11.049> lead<00:04:11.319> to<00:04:12.329> less<00:04:13.329> use

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
but absolutely it will lead to less use

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.860 
but absolutely it will lead to less use
of<00:04:13.989> fuel<00:04:14.530> or<00:04:14.879> smaller<00:04:15.879> sails<00:04:16.299> when<00:04:16.690> you're

of fuel or smaller sails when you're

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.779 
of fuel or smaller sails when you're

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
has all the wires run through it so it's

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.260 
has all the wires run through it so it's
conduit<00:04:43.000> for<00:04:43.420> these<00:04:43.720> lights<00:04:44.080> that<00:04:44.350> are<00:04:44.620> all

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
conduit for these lights that are all

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
how suppose one thing I was just

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.800 
how suppose one thing I was just
thinking<00:05:15.700> in<00:05:15.820> terms<00:05:15.850> of<00:05:16.180> can<00:05:16.360> you<00:05:16.450> get<00:05:16.600> to<00:05:16.720> the

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
right with the automatic pilot you can

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.410 
right with the automatic pilot you can
change<00:05:32.080> course<00:05:32.410> go<00:05:32.770> five<00:05:33.280> degrees<00:05:33.730> you<00:05:34.270> know

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420

change course go five degrees you know
to<00:05:34.480> port<00:05:35.020> 5<00:05:35.320> degrees<00:05:35.350> to<00:05:35.680> starboard<00:05:36.310> okay<00:05:36.730> so

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
to port 5 degrees to starboard okay so

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:43.760 
to port 5 degrees to starboard okay so
we<00:05:36.970> put<00:05:37.000> diesel<00:05:37.540> fuel<00:05:39.930> yeah<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:41.200> keel<00:05:41.860> is<00:05:42.720> the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
we put diesel fuel yeah the keel is the

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.050 
we put diesel fuel yeah the keel is the
object<00:05:44.770> on<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.040> boat<00:05:45.220> that<00:05:45.460> looks<00:05:45.670> like<00:05:45.880> you

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
object on the boat that looks like you

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.150 
object on the boat that looks like you
might<00:05:46.270> say<00:05:46.510> the<00:05:46.660> dorsal<00:05:47.140> fin<00:05:47.350> on<00:05:47.380> a<00:05:47.530> shark<00:05:47.920> the

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
might say the dorsal fin on a shark the

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.880 
might say the dorsal fin on a shark the

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.029 
designer I mean what got you into this
hold<00:06:06.479> steel<00:06:06.810> I<00:06:06.840> mean<00:06:07.169> it's<00:06:07.319> just<00:06:07.349> amazing<00:06:07.560> what

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
hold steel I mean it's just amazing what

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.320 
hold steel I mean it's just amazing what
you're<00:06:08.219> doing<00:06:09.560> I<00:06:10.669> definitely<00:06:11.669> started<00:06:11.909> a<00:06:12.120> long

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
you're doing I definitely started a long

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.170 
you're doing I definitely started a long
time<00:06:12.360> ago<00:06:12.659> Rick<00:06:13.169> I<00:06:13.409> was<00:06:14.340> fortunate<00:06:14.639> enough<00:06:14.969> to

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
time ago Rick I was fortunate enough to

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.959 
time ago Rick I was fortunate enough to
have<00:06:15.479> great<00:06:15.870> parents<00:06:16.349> who<00:06:16.439> introduced<00:06:16.979> me<00:06:17.550> to

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:17.969 
have great parents who introduced me to

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:20.029 
have great parents who introduced me to
sailing<00:06:18.539> so<00:06:19.020> I<00:06:19.139> started<00:06:19.590> learning<00:06:19.770> how<00:06:19.949> to

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
sailing so I started learning how to

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.850 
sailing so I started learning how to
race<00:06:20.340> boat<00:06:20.639> and<00:06:20.990> after<00:06:21.990> a<00:06:22.020> while<00:06:22.229> I<00:06:22.259> started

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
race boat and after a while I started

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.969 
race boat and after a while I started
doing<00:06:23.849> advanced<00:06:24.360> ocean<00:06:24.689> racing<00:06:25.080> so<00:06:25.680> you<00:06:25.740> must

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
doing advanced ocean racing so you must

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.140 
doing advanced ocean racing so you must
have<00:06:26.069> had<00:06:26.159> the<00:06:26.310> idea<00:06:26.340> that<00:06:26.639> hey<00:06:26.849> I<00:06:26.879> can<00:06:27.120> make

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
have had the idea that hey I can make

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.119 
have had the idea that hey I can make
this<00:06:27.389> a<00:06:27.449> bigger<00:06:27.750> faster<00:06:28.139> better<00:06:28.529> boat<00:06:28.860> right

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:29.129 
this a bigger faster better boat right

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:30.950 
this a bigger faster better boat right
yeah<00:06:29.879> the<00:06:30.090> way<00:06:30.180> you<00:06:30.210> started<00:06:30.569> laying<00:06:30.719> things

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
yeah the way you started laying things

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.929 
yeah the way you started laying things
out<00:06:31.199> that<00:06:31.680> definitely<00:06:32.310> was<00:06:32.580> starting<00:06:32.909> to

00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:32.939 
out that definitely was starting to

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:34.790 
out that definitely was starting to
occur<00:06:33.240> in<00:06:33.389> the<00:06:33.479> ocean<00:06:33.840> racing<00:06:34.080> clear<00:06:34.500> days

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
occur in the ocean racing clear days

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.089 
occur in the ocean racing clear days
which<00:06:35.129> started<00:06:35.520> when<00:06:35.669> I<00:06:35.729> was<00:06:35.819> in<00:06:35.969> college<00:06:36.240> and

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
which started when I was in college and

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.469 
which started when I was in college and
you<00:06:38.099> know<00:06:38.219> went<00:06:38.460> through<00:06:38.699> my<00:06:38.879> mid<00:06:39.060> thirties

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
you know went through my mid thirties

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.159 
you know went through my mid thirties
and<00:06:40.229> by<00:06:40.979> the<00:06:41.039> time<00:06:41.490> I<00:06:41.520> was<00:06:41.849> in<00:06:41.879> my<00:06:42.180> mid-20s<00:06:42.930> I

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
and by the time I was in my mid-20s I

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.559 
and by the time I was in my mid-20s I
had<00:06:43.289> already<00:06:43.439> started<00:06:43.830> a<00:06:44.069> design<00:06:44.279> crew<00:06:44.759> as<00:06:45.330> you

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569 
had already started a design crew as you

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.570 
had already started a design crew as you
say<00:06:45.810> doing<00:06:46.050> you<00:06:46.860> know<00:06:46.949> interesting

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
say doing you know interesting

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.429 
say doing you know interesting
innovative<00:06:48.060> things<00:06:48.539> most<00:06:48.930> of<00:06:49.139> them<00:06:49.319> were

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:49.439 
innovative things most of them were

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.589 
innovative things most of them were
ocean<00:06:49.620> racing<00:06:49.979> vessels<00:06:50.550> in<00:06:50.729> those<00:06:50.879> days<00:06:51.120> but

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 
ocean racing vessels in those days but

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.010 
ocean racing vessels in those days but

Tom I
I've<00:06:52.229> seen<00:06:52.560> your<00:06:52.680> boats<00:06:52.889> all<00:06:53.129> over<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:53.490> world

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
I've seen your boats all over the world

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.249 
I've seen your boats all over the world
I<00:06:53.969> mean<00:06:54.120> is<00:06:54.270> there<00:06:54.449> a<00:06:54.479> certain<00:06:54.810> pose<00:06:55.020> that<00:06:55.199> you

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 
I mean is there a certain pose that you

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.170 
I mean is there a certain pose that you
designed<00:06:55.590> it<00:06:55.740> really<00:06:55.979> just<00:06:56.129> stand<00:06:56.550> out<00:06:56.759> the

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
designed it really just stand out the

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.119 
designed it really just stand out the
clients<00:06:57.870> that<00:06:57.930> I<00:06:58.110> have<00:06:58.259> had<00:06:58.440> tracted<00:06:58.979> are

00:06:59.119 --> 00:06:59.129 
clients that I have had tracted are

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:01.339 
clients that I have had tracted are
largely<00:06:59.460> pretty<00:06:59.909> experienced<00:07:00.539> sailors<00:07:01.080> so

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:01.349 
largely pretty experienced sailors so

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.159 
largely pretty experienced sailors so
they<00:07:01.529> kind<00:07:02.009> of<00:07:02.069> lead<00:07:02.339> the<00:07:03.210> mission<00:07:03.389> statement

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:04.169 
they kind of lead the mission statement

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:06.920 
they kind of lead the mission statement
and<00:07:05.099> hence<00:07:05.789> what<00:07:06.089> you<00:07:06.270> see<00:07:06.479> all<00:07:06.599> over<00:07:06.629> the

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
and hence what you see all over the
