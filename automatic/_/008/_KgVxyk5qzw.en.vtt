00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.509
 hello to all merdone how it all goes I hope 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.779
 well 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.039
 today I will present you a very modality 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.500
 interesting that is called quartier 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.480
 general goal of each team e 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.849
 conquer headquarters e 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.820
 defend it from the assault of the team 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.610
 enemy when defenders crack not 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.129
 re-enter the game until the quarters 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.680
 general is not conquered or 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.140
 after a certain amount of time remaining in the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.720
 hands of defenders before being 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.730
 it takes several seconds to conquer 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.410
 to make both teams 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.610
 have time to reach 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.390
 the target 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.390
 well you are ready big dick first 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.399
 I will show you how to get a qg ma 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.610
 especially how to defend oneself in a way 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.130
 excellent the capobastone as by now 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.439
 you will know is a master of defense e 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.490
 so you can do nothing but learn 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.070
 and you leave ok the first thing to do 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.990
 the game started and headed straight away 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.119
 towards the headquarters from 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.429
 conquer even if it won't be 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.909
 immediately conquerable is good 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.459
 thing 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.799
 form a defensive perimeter around 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:30.350
 to the goal but without staying close to 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.310
 it because there will come a head 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.950
 lot of grenades and bomb panettone c4 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.459
 you have seen these two balls are 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.319
 dead like assholes once 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:44.270
 conquered seek a safe place is 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.849
 not far from the lens 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.840
 sorry I was charmed to look at the 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.599
 sky 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.700
 then analyze the situation 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:55.009
 my team is covering the goal 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.109
 remaining hidden nearby 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.169
 while I cover the ascent of the 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.569
 balcony if some asshole should 

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:04.669
 manage to conquer the roof for the 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.099
 my team would be the end 

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:09.740
 in fact, whoever is above is always 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.720
 those in a few moments benefited 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.209
 enemy pigs will try to 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.670
 assault the qg but have not understood a 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.180
 fuck from the firm because i am the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.270
 master 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.060
 ok look at this shitty first kill 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.100
 my partner and immediately throws me 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.450
 a stick of c4 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.849
 fortunately I 'm faster than one 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.090
 there was and now here is the big hit from 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.000
 fucking asshole master I fucked 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.849
 without Vaseline but there are so many ways to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.040
 defend a qg we go in to see one 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.890
 among the evergreen methods that are not 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.440
 mines are never out of fashion 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.019
 electric shocks but above all the 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.660
 old and dear camper ata that does so much 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.330
 piss off the bimbiminkia look now 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.599
 as in my ass 4 lousy one behind 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.900
 the other little tip if you use the 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.150
 silencer will be much more difficult 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.280
 identified outside one forces forward the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.349
 next one 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.950
 and out two ahead 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:15.510
 do not be fooled advanced calm and 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.650
 out 3 haga gaga that stupid fuck e 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.739
 out 4 its terrible you good balls 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.840
 just by shooting at home you kill me now there 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.269
 I will explain how to get a qg 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.750
 making themselves virtually invisible to 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.170
 enemy 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.209
 best to avoid getting caught 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.459
 a missile up the ass and that of 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.470
 lie down on the ground using just whose 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.690
 g for protection 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.910
 obviously this task will be 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.670
 facilitated if your team is 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.190
 composed of people who know how to play every 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.410
 so much I happen to enter into the 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.060
 matches qg where my team 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.489
 he goes around the map 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.799
 cheerfully as if it were a fucking 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.540
 deathmatch ugly cocks incapable 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.850
 idiots fucking heads 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.010
 the qg mode is made for 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.950
 capture and defend goals 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.410
 so if your goal is that 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.660
 to wander about as stupid for the map 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.510
 select all against all 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.849
 or team deathmatch but not fouled 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.609
 these arrangements with your gross 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.190
 presence for which you are going to ruin the 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.970
 unique glimpses of tactics left in 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.550
 this game 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:28.440
 this title needs these 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.380
 how to recover 250 0 I would say 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.330
 which is a chuck norris score 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.430
 however in the qg there is not only the defense 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.830
 but also the attack 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.050
 look what I managed to do 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.920
 this is obviously only a small one 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.710
 excerpt 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.530
 lady match but summarizes very well how 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.680
 attack a qg defend it and clean up 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.660
 the area must first be 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.330
 obviously conquer it immediately afterwards 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.210
 you have to divide the tasks to cure 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.850
 different map access areas each 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.340
 team member must defend not 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.010
 only the qg but above all the others 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.040
 teammates to pick whose 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.770
 g it takes a certain amount of time instead to 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.730
 kill 1 it takes a moment you have 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.250
 seen 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.110
 it takes just one second who who 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.200
 the mona that enters 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.390
 this is my area in the upper right hand corner 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.400
 also put the killing counter 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.030
 so much to make the ganassa e 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.460
 brag about how professional I am and 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.770
 out two I enjoy it as a 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.960
 porcupine which is called a sponge for 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.970
 wash the dishes, that is we are here 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.450
 coming to more defense levels 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:42.540
 total and outside also the third but it is not 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.300
 not finished here you will see shortly in the meantime 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.250
 that I offer cover the merdone drone stands 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.340
 looking for his prey 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.400
 ops I know so much that he found her in ga ga 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.250
 ga its terrible and you where i thought of 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.770
 go and we are at 5 with a nice 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.950
 bombing available 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.440
 as you see the fuji has disappeared this 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.290
 because after a certain amount of time it changes 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.780
 automatically position with some 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.940
 practice and experience you will learn a 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.240
 understand where it will be formed from time to time 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.520
 for example wainer of lifeless that 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.550
 participated in the world tournament of 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.740
 black ops two knew in advance the 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.720
 place of the next qg going to 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.500
 occupy the area before them 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.780
 opponents 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.860
 think how dirty these are 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:34.260
 four eyes you are left without blows and 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.240
 then buy them jerk 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.280
 I seem to be the hardware store for my own 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.890
 balls look at that big ass 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.890
 recommended I hit him three times not 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.430
 a cactus has died up for 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.010
 the ass 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.470
 well I would say that the time has come 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.410
 download some shit bags on 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.510
 capocce of these poor wretches 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.790
 I pull out the tablet 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.520
 and address the crush in the points that 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.350
 I feel more crowded we hope to 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.010
 hit someone 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.690
 but where do you go ok I got one 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.340
 unfortunately, however, the asshole is still 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.800
 inside the building 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.370

 in the mouth and let's go win too 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:24.380

 madonna 250 to 60 and even my score 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:30.170
 I am very satisfied with the term score 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:33.080
 I don't mean farts but counting 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:35.690
 between kills and deaths I did a 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.300
 modest 20 11 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:41.240
 enjoy the people but greet me first 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.150
