00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.400
 a complete rome also because of 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.890
 face a team like inter 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.300
 I had to do this race so I think 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.850
 that we must face millions of ways 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.960
 and we played a very big one 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.520
 game 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.130
 run more now than when you are ten 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.880
 is from when you were a young man that I am 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.430
 well i'm fine physically 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.120
 this nobel prize and then normal that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.940
 when the team turns 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.010
 the better you allow yourself expect one 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.890
 dinner osvaldo gave him a ball 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.349
 extraordinary also because before that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.840
 the second half started, we're here 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.390
 agreed that I have him we do 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.450
 things therefore 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.390
 after he scored a very heavy goal in 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.640
 so that we needed both for us and for 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.640
 fans behind us even now
