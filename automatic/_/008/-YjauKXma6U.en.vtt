and show off people's maps I had a
castle<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.870> was<00:02:42.870> going<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.230> do<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.410> series<00:02:43.890> like

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
castle I was going to do a series like

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.570 
castle I was going to do a series like
that<00:02:44.400> with<00:02:44.580> castles<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.990> never<00:02:46.230> really

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
that with castles but that never really

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.090 
that with castles but that never really
happened<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.880> i<00:02:48.690> was<00:02:49.470> thinking<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.830> just

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
happened and i was thinking of just

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.570 
happened and i was thinking of just
making<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.820> i<00:02:50.970> could<00:02:51.030> go<00:02:51.300> around<00:02:52.370> tore<00:02:53.370> my

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
making it i could go around tore my

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.760 
making it i could go around tore my
subscribers<00:02:54.210> worlds<00:02:54.690> make<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.960> video<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.410> it

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
subscribers worlds make a video of it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.950 
subscribers worlds make a video of it
and<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.700> really<00:02:56.910> get<00:02:57.150> my<00:02:57.300> subscribers

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
and it really get my subscribers

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.680 
and it really get my subscribers
involved<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.800> i<00:02:59.240> think<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:00.360> would<00:03:00.450> just<00:03:00.510> be

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
involved and i think that would just be

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.910 
involved and i think that would just be
a<00:03:00.780> fun<00:03:01.020> way<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.200> hang<00:03:01.500> out<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:01.710> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
a fun way to hang out with the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.250 
a fun way to hang out with the
subscribers<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.850> stuff<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.300> as<00:03:04.200> well

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
subscribers and stuff like that as well

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.320 
subscribers and stuff like that as well
as<00:03:04.620> my<00:03:04.770> subscriber<00:03:05.220> world<00:03:05.490> coming<00:03:05.820> out<00:03:05.970> which

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
as my subscriber world coming out which

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.370 
as my subscriber world coming out which
also<00:03:06.660> um<00:03:08.480> sort<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.570> gives<00:03:09.720> me<00:03:09.840> an<00:03:09.930> idea<00:03:10.020> that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
