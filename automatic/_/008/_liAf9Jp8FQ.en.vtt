awesome<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.899> totally<00:00:40.140> worth<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.590> money<00:00:41.480> it's

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
awesome and totally worth the money it's

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.420 
awesome and totally worth the money it's
really<00:00:42.920> really<00:00:43.920> close<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> Gibson<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:47.100> far

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
really really close to a Gibson as far

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.130 
really really close to a Gibson as far
as<00:00:47.550> specs<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.390> mean<00:00:48.600> really<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.110> only

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
as specs go I mean really the only

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.330 
as specs go I mean really the only
difference<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> paint<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> mean<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
difference is the paint so I mean and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
difference is the paint so I mean and
you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.449> course<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> craftsmanship

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
you know of course the craftsmanship

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.930 
you know of course the craftsmanship
this<00:00:55.860> things<00:00:56.100> being<00:00:56.250> Indonesia<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.500> fry<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
this things being Indonesia and fry on a

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
this things being Indonesia and fry on a
assembly<00:00:59.940> line<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.600> thousand<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.649> maybe

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
assembly line of a thousand or maybe

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
assembly line of a thousand or maybe
more<00:01:02.510> you<00:01:03.510> know<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.750> opposed<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.140> Gibson

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
more you know as opposed to a Gibson

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
more you know as opposed to a Gibson
which<00:01:04.650> only<00:01:04.799> had<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> few<00:01:05.280> guitars<00:01:05.610> out<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> day<00:01:06.119> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
which only had a few guitars out a day I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.620 
which only had a few guitars out a day I
think<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.520> yeah<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.270> Gibson

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
think but yeah this is not really Gibson

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.490 
think but yeah this is not really Gibson
I'd<00:01:09.869> say<00:01:10.049> yeah

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
I'd say yeah

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.940 
I'd say yeah
it's<00:01:11.310> an<00:01:11.430> aftermarket<00:01:12.439> thing<00:01:13.439> right<00:01:13.799> there

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it's an aftermarket thing right there

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.170 
it's an aftermarket thing right there
but<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> old<00:01:14.760> headstock

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
but you can see that the old headstock

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
but you can see that the old headstock
didn't<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.570> any<00:01:15.810> type<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.310> laminate<00:01:17.310> or

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
didn't have any type of laminate or

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
didn't have any type of laminate or
anything<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.880> top<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.479> does<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
anything on top this one does it's the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.170

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.320 
I'm being really really really really
picky<00:01:43.960> about<00:01:44.140> this<00:01:44.470> but<00:01:44.920> um<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.210> not

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
picky about this but um it's just not

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.630 
picky about this but um it's just not
Gibson<00:01:47.170> would<00:01:47.290> not<00:01:47.500> look<00:01:47.890> like<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:50.640> as

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
Gibson would not look like that but as

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.220 
Gibson would not look like that but as
far<00:01:51.700> as<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.000> neck<00:01:52.150> radius<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.720> everything<00:01:53.080> in

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
far as the neck radius and everything in

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.190 
far as the neck radius and everything in
the<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:55.000> feel<00:01:55.300> of<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.570> I've<00:01:55.690> honed<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.960> couple

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
the the feel of it I've honed a couple

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.020 
the the feel of it I've honed a couple
of<00:01:56.260> Gibson<00:01:56.530> Thunderbirds<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.130> it's<00:01:57.580> exactly

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
of Gibson Thunderbirds and it's exactly

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.570 
of Gibson Thunderbirds and it's exactly
the<00:01:58.210> same<00:01:58.950> tapers<00:01:59.950> just<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.670> right<00:02:00.850> way<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
the same tapers just the right way and

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.090 
the same tapers just the right way and
you<00:02:03.580> know<00:02:04.510> as<00:02:04.780> opposed<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.350> much<00:02:05.740> wider

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
you know as opposed to the much wider

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.890 
you know as opposed to the much wider
but<00:02:06.550> they've<00:02:06.729> just<00:02:06.760> changed<00:02:07.300> this<00:02:07.450> on<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.780> old

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
but they've just changed this on the old

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.610 
but they've just changed this on the old
on<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.350> standard<00:02:08.950> Thunderbirds<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:11.410> neck

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
on the standard Thunderbirds the neck

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.830

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.969 
just uses Epiphone hardware basically as
far<00:04:19.699> as<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:19.910> bridge<00:04:20.090> goes<00:04:20.359> which<00:04:21.320> i<00:04:21.500> thought

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
far as the bridge goes which i thought

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.360 
far as the bridge goes which i thought
was<00:04:22.099> extremely<00:04:22.460> disappointing<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:24.370> mean

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
was extremely disappointing and I mean

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.070 
was extremely disappointing and I mean
even<00:04:25.550> if<00:04:25.759> they<00:04:25.849> are<00:04:25.970> making<00:04:26.330> it<00:04:26.539> overseas<00:04:26.930> you

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
even if they are making it overseas you

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.689 
even if they are making it overseas you
think<00:04:27.259> they<00:04:27.380> could<00:04:27.530> just<00:04:27.680> like<00:04:27.889> skip<00:04:28.490> out<00:04:28.669> on

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
think they could just like skip out on

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.700 
think they could just like skip out on
the<00:04:28.940> Epiphone<00:04:29.270> logo<00:04:29.660> underneath<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.289> bridge
