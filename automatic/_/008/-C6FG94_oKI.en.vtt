stick with your money plays well now you
just<00:00:46.150> have<00:00:46.270> gainful<00:00:46.510> you'll<00:00:46.870> have<00:00:47.020> to<00:00:47.110> worry

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
just have gainful you'll have to worry

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.600 
just have gainful you'll have to worry
about<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:47.560> anymore<00:00:47.890> you<00:00:48.130> just<00:00:48.160> hit<00:00:48.400> a<00:00:48.430> button

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
about that anymore you just hit a button

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.850 
about that anymore you just hit a button
in<00:00:48.880> between<00:00:49.420> every<00:00:49.630> play<00:00:49.810> and<00:00:50.140> it's<00:00:50.680> going<00:00:50.770> to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
in between every play and it's going to

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.260 
in between every play and it's going to
kind<00:00:51.010> of<00:00:51.100> delegate<00:00:51.490> that<00:00:51.520> off<00:00:51.820> to<00:00:51.970> the<00:00:52.000> coach

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
kind of delegate that off to the coach

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.210 
kind of delegate that off to the coach
so<00:00:52.840> it<00:00:53.020> really<00:00:53.050> speeds<00:00:53.500> up<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:53.770> game<00:00:53.950> times

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
so it really speeds up the game times

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.470 
so it really speeds up the game times
