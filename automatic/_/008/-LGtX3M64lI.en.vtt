can<00:01:08.490> absorb<00:01:08.670> chemicals<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.810> gonna

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
can absorb chemicals but it's not gonna

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.750 
can absorb chemicals but it's not gonna
absorb<00:01:10.290> much<00:01:10.530> because<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.010> hard<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.490> stick

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
absorb much because it's hard to stick

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.330

chemical<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.810> weed<00:01:13.140> with<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> waxy<00:01:14.159> leaf

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
chemical on that weed with the waxy leaf

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.370 
chemical on that weed with the waxy leaf
so<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.240> gonna<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.479> well<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:16.140> thing

brand that yellow nut sedge often
happens<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> wetter<00:01:19.200> parts<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.740> fields

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
happens in the wetter parts of fields

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.890 
happens in the wetter parts of fields
now<00:01:20.340> I've<00:01:20.520> seen<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> middle<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.720> my

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
now I've seen it out in the middle of my

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.560 
now I've seen it out in the middle of my
lawn<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.799> town<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> wet<00:01:23.880> year<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.390> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
lawn in town on a wet year like this

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.149 
lawn in town on a wet year like this
spring<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.320> wet<00:01:25.470> eyed<00:01:25.680> yellow<00:01:25.920> nut

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
spring was kind of wet eyed yellow nut

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.440 
spring was kind of wet eyed yellow nut
sedge<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> middle<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:26.880> yard<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.330> can

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
sedge in the middle of my yard so it can

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630 
sedge in the middle of my yard so it can
pop<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.720> anywhere<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.890> more<00:01:29.070> common<00:01:29.610> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
pop up anywhere but it's more common to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.270 
pop up anywhere but it's more common to
pop<00:01:29.970> up<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.450> low-lying<00:01:31.020> areas<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.829> that's<00:01:32.009> one

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
pop up in low-lying areas so that's one

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.679 
pop up in low-lying areas so that's one
spot<00:01:32.579> where<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.909> could<00:01:33.119> improve<00:01:33.450> some

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
spot where you could improve some

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.969 
spot where you could improve some
drainage<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.380> would<00:01:34.500> definitely<00:01:34.619> help

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
drainage and that would definitely help

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.200 
drainage and that would definitely help
you<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.189> weed<00:01:35.369> control<00:01:35.490> well<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> other

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
you with weed control well the other

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.490 
you with weed control well the other
thing<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.630> you've<00:01:36.840> got<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.079> make<00:01:37.200> sure<00:01:37.350> you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
thing is you've got to make sure you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740 
thing is you've got to make sure you
have<00:01:37.710> real<00:01:38.070> concentrated<00:01:38.939> droplets<00:01:39.540> when

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
have real concentrated droplets when

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.480 
have real concentrated droplets when
you're<00:01:39.900> spraying<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.380> herbicide<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.340> with

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you're spraying a herbicide so like with

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.639 
you're spraying a herbicide so like with
roundup<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.090> example<00:01:42.509> use<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.899> highest

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
roundup for example use the highest

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.069 
roundup for example use the highest
labelled<00:01:44.009> rated<00:01:44.250> roundup<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.729> use<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.630> least

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
labelled rated roundup and use the least

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.800 
labelled rated roundup and use the least
water<00:01:46.530> possible<00:01:47.430> according<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> label<00:01:48.509> if

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
water possible according to the label if

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.210 
water possible according to the label if
you<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> much<00:01:50.040> more

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you do that you have a much more

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.770 
you do that you have a much more
concentrated<00:01:50.700> droplet<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:51.540> remember

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
concentrated droplet because remember

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.780 
concentrated droplet because remember
with<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.200> waxy<00:01:52.590> leaf<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.310> too<00:01:53.610> much

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
with that waxy leaf you get too much

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.249 
with that waxy leaf you get too much
water<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:54.810> gonna<00:01:54.990> run

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
water on there and it's just gonna run

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.200 
water on there and it's just gonna run
right<00:01:55.470> off<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.460> doesn't<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> whole

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
right off so it doesn't do you a whole

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
right off so it doesn't do you a whole
lot<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.540> good<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.930> spray<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.469> very<00:01:58.770> high<00:01:58.950> rate

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
lot of good to spray a very high rate

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.200 
lot of good to spray a very high rate
around<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.700> you're<00:01:59.820> spraying<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.149> with

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
around up if you're spraying it with

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.270 
around up if you're spraying it with
twenty<00:02:00.630> gallons<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.020> water<00:02:01.140> per<00:02:01.290> acre<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.040> keep

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
twenty gallons of water per acre so keep

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.399 
twenty gallons of water per acre so keep
that<00:02:02.430> water<00:02:02.850> volume<00:02:03.360> very<00:02:03.600> low<00:02:03.840> okay<00:02:04.259> well

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
that water volume very low okay well

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.959 
that water volume very low okay well
