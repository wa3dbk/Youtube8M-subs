awful mistress sometimes it truly is the

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.029 
awful mistress sometimes it truly is the
reason<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.629> think<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.260> many<00:00:52.350> people<00:00:52.500> like

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
reason I think that so many people like

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.279 
reason I think that so many people like
Aaron<00:00:53.579> Murray<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> guy<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
Aaron Murray is because I see a guy that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.200 
Aaron Murray is because I see a guy that
started<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> few<00:00:56.340> years<00:00:56.370> at<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> major

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
started for a few years at a major

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.330 
started for a few years at a major
college<00:00:57.750> program<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.379> Georgia<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.010> best

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
college program like Georgia in the best

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
college program like Georgia in the best
conference<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.510> college<00:01:01.020> football<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
conference in college football in the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.789 
conference in college football in the
SEC<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> highly<00:01:03.000> productive<00:01:03.300> player

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
SEC and was a highly productive player

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.990 
SEC and was a highly productive player
so<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.250> some<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> some<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
so I can see some of that some of the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.270 
so I can see some of that some of the
strengths<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> his<00:01:06.930> game<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:08.040> I

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
strengths I think to his game you know I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.280 
strengths I think to his game you know I
look<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.790> his<00:01:08.970> mobility<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.780> fact<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.080> he<00:01:10.170> is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
look at his mobility the fact that he is

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.380 
look at his mobility the fact that he is
a<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.799> good<00:01:10.950> athlete<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.760> he<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.180> make

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
a really good athlete that he can make

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.179 
a really good athlete that he can make
some<00:01:12.600> place<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:12.930> his<00:01:13.080> feet<00:01:13.290> he<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.710> extend

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
some place with his feet he can extend

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.890 
some place with his feet he can extend
the<00:01:14.310> pocket<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.970> he<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.420> buy<00:01:15.600> time

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the pocket with this he can buy time

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
the pocket with this he can buy time
with<00:01:16.140> his<00:01:16.290> feet<00:01:16.470> he<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.770> throw<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.310> move

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
with his feet he can throw on the move

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370 
with his feet he can throw on the move
both<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> left<00:01:18.930> I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
both to the right and to the left I

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.260 
both to the right and to the left I
think<00:01:19.799> he<00:01:19.890> has<00:01:20.009> pretty<00:01:20.250> good<00:01:20.430> mechanics<00:01:21.119> in

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
think he has pretty good mechanics in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
think he has pretty good mechanics in
his<00:01:21.420> throwing<00:01:21.780> motion<00:01:21.930> not<00:01:22.799> an<00:01:22.950> incredibly

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
his throwing motion not an incredibly

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.179 
his throwing motion not an incredibly
long<00:01:23.640> delivery<00:01:24.180> tends<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.049> throw<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.979> good

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
long delivery tends to throw in a good

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.130 
long delivery tends to throw in a good
position<00:01:26.369> again<00:01:27.330> something<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> really

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
position again something that I really

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710 
position again something that I really
like<00:01:28.439> about<00:01:28.470> him<00:01:28.860> he<00:01:29.040> has<00:01:29.430> okay<00:01:30.060> arm<00:01:30.329> strength

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
like about him he has okay arm strength

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.450 
like about him he has okay arm strength
may<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.500> enough<00:01:31.740> arm<00:01:31.950> strength<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.340> be

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
may be just enough arm strength to be

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.190 
may be just enough arm strength to be
able<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.729> make<00:01:32.790> all<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> required<00:01:33.479> NFL<00:01:33.900> throws

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
able to make all the required NFL throws

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.610 
make all the NFL throws his accuracy is
ok<00:02:19.640> but<00:02:19.700> at<00:02:20.030> times<00:02:20.330> it's<00:02:20.720> fleeting<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.440> it's

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
ok but at times it's fleeting and it's

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.020 
ok but at times it's fleeting and it's
inconsistent<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.550> people<00:02:22.760> are<00:02:22.850> going<00:02:22.940> to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
inconsistent and people are going to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.640

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
look at that inconsistency and say is

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.290 
look at that inconsistency and say is
this<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.830> guy<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.310> we<00:02:25.430> could<00:02:25.610> come<00:02:25.850> out<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.210> a

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
this a guy that we could come out in a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.570 
this a guy that we could come out in a
consistent<00:02:26.630> basis<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.650> lead<00:02:27.830> our<00:02:27.860> team<00:02:28.040> his

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
consistent basis to lead our team his

consistent basis to lead our team his
decision-making<00:02:29.090> at<00:02:29.480> times<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.870> don't<00:02:30.080> think

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
decision-making at times I don't think

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.980 
decision-making at times I don't think
was<00:02:30.440> very<00:02:30.680> very<00:02:30.890> good<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.640> field<00:02:32.000> vision<00:02:32.420> was

okay I mean he had time to read emin
straighted<00:02:35.960> me<00:02:36.140> an<00:02:36.260> ability<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.710> go<00:02:36.890> through

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
straighted me an ability to go through

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.650 
straighted me an ability to go through
his<00:02:37.160> progressions<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.790> reads<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.330> go<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.480> his

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
his progressions and reads and go to his

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.120 
his progressions and reads and go to his
check<00:02:38.870> down<00:02:39.050> when<00:02:39.230> he<00:02:39.290> needed<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.710> but<00:02:39.830> he<00:02:39.950> also

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
check down when he needed to but he also

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.890 
check down when he needed to but he also
liked<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> lot<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.120> college<00:02:41.360> quarterbacks<00:02:41.780> had

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
liked a lot of college quarterbacks had

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.720 
liked a lot of college quarterbacks had
the<00:02:42.020> tendency<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.590> lock<00:02:42.770> onto<00:02:43.010> one<00:02:43.280> receiver

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
the tendency to lock onto one receiver

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.610 
the tendency to lock onto one receiver
and<00:02:44.000> sometimes<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:44.900> was<00:02:45.020> wondering<00:02:45.380> what<00:02:45.530> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
and sometimes I was wondering what the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.050 
and sometimes I was wondering what the
hell<00:02:45.740> he<00:02:45.830> was<00:02:45.860> seen<00:02:46.220> because<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.700> seemed<00:02:46.880> like

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
hell he was seen because it seemed like

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.790 
hell he was seen because it seemed like
his<00:02:47.240> decision-making<00:02:47.720> was<00:02:48.140> very<00:02:48.380> bad<00:02:48.560> that

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
his decision-making was very bad that

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.700 
his decision-making was very bad that
his<00:02:48.920> eyes<00:02:49.100> were<00:02:49.550> misleading<00:02:50.120> him<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.410> don't

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
his eyes were misleading him so I don't

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.600 
his eyes were misleading him so I don't
know<00:02:51.890> his<00:02:52.820> pocket<00:02:53.180> presence<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.690> ok<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:55.130> you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
know his pocket presence is ok but you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.190 
know his pocket presence is ok but you
know<00:02:55.730> again<00:02:55.910> when<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.330> talk<00:02:56.510> about<00:02:56.540> pocket

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
know again when you talk about pocket

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.020 
know again when you talk about pocket
presence<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:58.040> know<00:02:58.130> there<00:02:58.310> were<00:02:58.400> times<00:02:58.700> where

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
presence you know there were times where

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.910 
presence you know there were times where
it<00:02:59.120> seemed<00:02:59.300> like<00:02:59.450> he<00:02:59.600> understood<00:03:00.140> how<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.530> step

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
it seemed like he understood how to step

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.980 
it seemed like he understood how to step
up<00:03:01.100> in<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.250> pocket<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:02.000> buy<00:03:02.630> himself<00:03:02.810> some

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
up in the pocket and buy himself some

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.540 
up in the pocket and buy himself some
additional<00:03:03.530> time<00:03:03.740> move<00:03:04.040> around<00:03:04.280> in<00:03:04.520> the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
additional time move around in the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.220 
additional time move around in the
pocket<00:03:04.940> but<00:03:05.000> there<00:03:05.150> were<00:03:05.210> also<00:03:05.300> other<00:03:05.480> times<00:03:05.840> I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
pocket but there were also other times I

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.590 
pocket but there were also other times I
saw<00:03:06.440> him<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.710> I<00:03:06.980> was<00:03:07.100> like<00:03:07.310> he<00:03:08.090> was<00:03:08.210> awfully

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
saw him and I was like he was awfully

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.060 
saw him and I was like he was awfully
quick<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.870> get<00:03:09.080> out<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.260> pocket<00:03:09.740> there<00:03:09.890> maybe

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
quick to get out of pocket there maybe

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.860 
quick to get out of pocket there maybe
he<00:03:10.310> should<00:03:10.490> have<00:03:10.520> stood<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.880> little<00:03:11.240> taller<00:03:11.510> and

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
he should have stood a little taller and

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.810 
he should have stood a little taller and
maybe<00:03:12.590> he<00:03:12.800> should<00:03:12.980> have<00:03:13.100> hung<00:03:13.220> tough<00:03:13.550> and

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
maybe he should have hung tough and

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.250 
maybe he should have hung tough and
instead<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.180> rolling<00:03:14.330> out<00:03:14.630> maybe<00:03:14.870> he<00:03:15.110> should

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
instead of rolling out maybe he should

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.510 
instead of rolling out maybe he should
have<00:03:15.350> stepped<00:03:15.440> up<00:03:15.710> or<00:03:15.890> just<00:03:15.920> moved<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.370> little

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
have stepped up or just moved a little

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.390 
have stepped up or just moved a little
to<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.940> right<00:03:16.970> or<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.720> left<00:03:18.250> like<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.310> said

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
to the right or to the left like I said

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.620 
to the right or to the left like I said
with<00:03:19.580> Erin<00:03:19.940> Murray<00:03:20.120> it's<00:03:20.330> kind<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.540> a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
with Erin Murray it's kind of a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.330 
with Erin Murray it's kind of a
complicated<00:03:20.750> case<00:03:21.410> with<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:21.920> knee<00:03:22.100> injury

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
complicated case with the knee injury

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.480 
complicated case with the knee injury
with<00:03:23.150> his<00:03:23.390> lack<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.690> size<00:03:24.160> that's<00:03:25.160> going<00:03:25.430> to

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
with his lack of size that's going to

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.120 
with his lack of size that's going to
probably<00:03:25.730> move<00:03:26.600> him<00:03:26.870> off<00:03:27.080> of<00:03:27.140> teams<00:03:27.860> draft

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
probably move him off of teams draft

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.490 
probably move him off of teams draft
boards<00:03:28.520> entirely<00:03:29.060> in<00:03:29.240> some<00:03:29.720> teams<00:03:29.960> cases

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
boards entirely in some teams cases

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.380 
boards entirely in some teams cases
other<00:03:31.100> teams<00:03:31.430> are<00:03:31.520> going<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.700> look<00:03:31.880> at<00:03:32.090> him<00:03:32.270> and

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
other teams are going to look at him and

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.000 
other teams are going to look at him and
profile<00:03:32.840> him<00:03:33.080> as<00:03:33.170> nothing<00:03:33.380> more<00:03:33.560> than<00:03:33.770> a

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
profile him as nothing more than a

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.190 
profile him as nothing more than a
career<00:03:34.310> backup<00:03:34.610> which<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.540> what<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:35.720> think<00:03:36.080> he

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
career backup which is what I think he

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.810 
career backup which is what I think he
might<00:03:36.380> ended<00:03:36.680> up<00:03:36.800> being<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.250> that's<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.760> a

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
might ended up being and that's that a

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.040 
might ended up being and that's that a
terrible<00:03:38.060> thing<00:03:38.240> because<00:03:38.570> he<00:03:38.690> could<00:03:38.840> still

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
terrible thing because he could still

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.570 
terrible thing because he could still
have<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.200> long<00:03:39.440> NFL<00:03:39.890> career<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.310> make<00:03:40.430> himself

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
have a long NFL career and make himself

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.090 
have a long NFL career and make himself
a<00:03:40.910> decent<00:03:41.360> chunk<00:03:41.480> of<00:03:41.690> change<00:03:41.840> doing<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.440> but

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
a decent chunk of change doing that but

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.820 
a decent chunk of change doing that but
I<00:03:43.400> don't<00:03:44.000> quite<00:03:44.240> understand<00:03:44.930> where<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:45.680> many

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
I don't quite understand where so many

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.950 
I don't quite understand where so many
college<00:03:46.400> football<00:03:46.730> fans<00:03:47.000> see<00:03:47.270> this<00:03:47.450> guy<00:03:47.660> and

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
are so high on him and think he could do

are so high on him and think he could do
so<00:03:50.240> many<00:03:50.360> great<00:03:50.690> wonderful<00:03:51.140> incredible

things<00:03:52.130> he<00:03:52.730> was<00:03:52.880> more<00:03:53.060> accurate<00:03:53.660> or<00:03:53.780> if<00:03:53.870> he<00:03:53.990> had

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
things he was more accurate or if he had

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.410 
things he was more accurate or if he had
a<00:03:54.170> stronger<00:03:54.710> arm<00:03:54.950> I<00:03:55.250> would<00:03:55.550> get<00:03:55.760> that<00:03:56.000> if<00:03:56.270> his

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
a stronger arm I would get that if his

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.060 
a stronger arm I would get that if his
decision-making<00:03:56.900> was<00:03:57.290> better<00:03:57.470> i<00:03:57.680> would<00:03:57.890> get

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
decision-making was better i would get

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.010 
decision-making was better i would get
that<00:03:58.250> if<00:03:58.460> he<00:03:58.730> was<00:03:58.910> bigger<00:03:59.210> and<00:03:59.480> didn't<00:03:59.900> have

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
that if he was bigger and didn't have

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.390 
that if he was bigger and didn't have
the<00:04:00.050> injury<00:04:00.470> concerns<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.190> durability

tools<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.440> know<00:04:39.530> things<00:04:39.800> like<00:04:39.949> not<00:04:40.160> having

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
tools you know things like not having

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
the size the torn knee definitely skewed

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.529 
the size the torn knee definitely skewed
that<00:04:43.190> grade<00:04:43.400> just<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.729> little<00:04:44.030> bit<00:04:44.180> so<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.330> don't

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
that grade just a little bit so I don't

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:45.850 
that grade just a little bit so I don't
want<00:04:44.660> you<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.870> think<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.319> I'm<00:04:45.440> just<00:04:45.470> totally

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
want you to think that I'm just totally

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
ragging on the guy because you know not

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.870 
ragging on the guy because you know not
having<00:04:48.319> that<00:04:48.470> size<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.099> scoring<00:04:49.400> very<00:04:49.580> low<00:04:49.729> on

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.550 
having that size and scoring very low on
durability<00:04:50.240> definitely<00:04:51.199> brings<00:04:51.440> that

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
durability definitely brings that

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.040

Erin<00:05:13.159> Murray<00:05:13.310> ultimately<00:05:13.849> is<00:05:14.030> going<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.330> go

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
Erin Murray ultimately is going to go

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.510 
Erin Murray ultimately is going to go
undrafted<00:05:14.750> somebody<00:05:15.650> may<00:05:15.860> very<00:05:16.099> well<00:05:16.250> take<00:05:16.310> a

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
undrafted somebody may very well take a

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.580 
undrafted somebody may very well take a
shot<00:05:16.789> on<00:05:16.970> him<00:05:17.000> on<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.419> third<00:05:17.659> day<00:05:17.870> which<00:05:18.440> I

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
shot on him on the third day which I

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.140 
shot on him on the third day which I
think<00:05:18.830> would<00:05:18.949> be<00:05:19.099> a<00:05:19.130> good<00:05:19.340> thing<00:05:19.400> maybe<00:05:19.789> a<00:05:19.940> team

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
think would be a good thing maybe a team

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.700 
think would be a good thing maybe a team
like<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.449> green<00:05:20.630> bay<00:05:20.780> packers<00:05:20.810> might<00:05:21.500> utilize

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
like the green bay packers might utilize

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.860 
like the green bay packers might utilize
him<00:05:22.220> I<00:05:22.370> think<00:05:22.789> he's<00:05:22.880> going<00:05:23.150> to<00:05:23.240> have<00:05:23.360> to<00:05:23.389> stay

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
him I think he's going to have to stay

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.600 
him I think he's going to have to stay
in<00:05:24.020> some<00:05:24.199> type<00:05:24.380> of<00:05:24.409> West<00:05:24.710> Coast<00:05:24.949> system<00:05:25.400> which

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
in some type of West Coast system which

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.309 
in some type of West Coast system which
you<00:05:25.729> could<00:05:25.880> maybe<00:05:26.030> say<00:05:26.330> every<00:05:26.870> team<00:05:27.050> has<00:05:27.259> a

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
you could maybe say every team has a

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.230 
you could maybe say every team has a
version<00:05:27.680> of<00:05:27.949> a<00:05:28.069> West<00:05:28.280> Coast<00:05:28.370> system<00:05:28.880> that<00:05:29.090> may

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
version of a West Coast system that may

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.149 
version of a West Coast system that may
be<00:05:29.300> true<00:05:29.570> but<00:05:29.870> I<00:05:30.409> don't<00:05:30.680> think<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:30.919> want<00:05:31.099> to

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
be true but I don't think you want to

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:33.159 
be true but I don't think you want to
put<00:05:31.310> Aaron<00:05:31.610> Murray<00:05:31.820> in<00:05:32.060> a<00:05:32.180> system<00:05:32.599> where<00:05:33.050> he's

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
put Aaron Murray in a system where he's

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.420 
put Aaron Murray in a system where he's
going<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.380> have<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.560> stretch<00:05:34.099> the<00:05:34.310> ball

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
going to have to stretch the ball

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.010 
going to have to stretch the ball
vertically<00:05:34.909> down<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.389> field<00:05:35.599> the<00:05:35.780> time

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
vertically down the field the time

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.439 
vertically down the field the time
because<00:05:36.979> if<00:05:37.099> you<00:05:37.219> ask<00:05:37.340> do<00:05:37.669> that<00:05:37.849> I<00:05:37.880> think<00:05:38.210> what

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
because if you ask do that I think what

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.749 
because if you ask do that I think what
you're<00:05:38.690> taking<00:05:39.080> away<00:05:39.169> from<00:05:40.009> the<00:05:40.400> strength<00:05:40.639> of

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
you're taking away from the strength of

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.129 
you're taking away from the strength of
this<00:05:40.849> game<00:05:41.060> and<00:05:41.210> in<00:05:41.330> fact<00:05:41.539> you're<00:05:41.750> putting<00:05:42.050> him

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
this game and in fact you're putting him

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.980 
this game and in fact you're putting him
at<00:05:42.289> a<00:05:42.320> disadvantageous<00:05:43.219> position<00:05:43.990> Erin

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
at a disadvantageous position Erin

at a disadvantageous position Erin
Murray<00:05:45.169> again<00:05:45.590> I<00:05:45.800> see<00:05:46.310> why<00:05:46.490> a<00:05:46.520> lot<00:05:46.759> of<00:05:46.820> fans

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150
