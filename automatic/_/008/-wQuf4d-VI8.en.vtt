reviews that I gave so it's basically

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.990 
reviews that I gave so it's basically
going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> comparison<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.460> first<00:00:32.759> of

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
going to be a comparison of the first of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.569 
going to be a comparison of the first of
the<00:00:33.210> original<00:00:33.860> Japanese<00:00:34.860> self<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the original Japanese self and the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.049 
the original Japanese self and the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
English tag and then you know obviously

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.310

there's<00:00:39.360> gonna<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> little<00:00:40.079> bit

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
there's gonna be a little bit

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.510

differences<00:00:41.010> because<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.370> actually

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
differences because I'm actually

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.770

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
and since I was actually following it I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.600 
and since I was actually following it I
can<00:04:07.770> actually<00:04:08.010> understand<00:04:08.340> what<00:04:08.459> he<00:04:08.520> was

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
can actually understand what he was

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.720 
can actually understand what he was
saying<00:04:08.840> yeah<00:04:09.980> Rhyhorn<00:04:10.980> stood<00:04:11.370> up<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.580> knocked
