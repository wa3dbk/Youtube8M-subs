00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.720

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.670

 bd of angoulÃªme 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.300
 believe me it's heavy and I was 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.560
 fan right now 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.900

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.690
 he adds 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.430
 so in 1989 is low I went to 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.220
 AngoulÃªme comic festival for me 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.620

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.170
 guardians but the guards it's him 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.780
 with rorschach and there I met the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.600
 designer of the saga of the fact Rguibat 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.430
 superb dedication the superb portrait of 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.380
 redemption at the time we were in party bat 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.600
 handy the film had just come out with 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.580
 jack nicholson and julien lepers michael 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.800
 keaton chose and there were 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.300
 batman logos everywhere pubs everywhere 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.800
 we could not get rid of it 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.390
 so just to laugh I asked 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.130
 with guy bones who draws me on the 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.140
 face of rock cha instead of tasks 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.420
 usual a logo-shaped task 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.920
 of batman it's not decided the logo 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.170
 of batman but it was a good laugh 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.560
 the results I have my dedication ultra 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.560
 collector 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.680
 do you 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.970
 gold hunt was really my character 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.350
 preferred that his hand at the time and not 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.580
 so much 10 to put in the tooth 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.950
 all we could find at best 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.840
 it's small pins with the logo of 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.790
 watchmen or so here I was 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.800
 tinkering with an old frisbee with blood 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.220
 human to do a little smiley of 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.930
 watchmen 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.840
 it was not so good I did 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.850
 myself morcha with an old victim 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.470
 that was lying in the cards I was 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.120
 articulated figurines of the time all 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.769
 the boys had it turns out to be an old 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.180
 cowboy hat that I cut a 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.220
 little bit to do a little more hat 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.819
 gangster seen an old sock 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.280
 on the head 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.260
 and if the floors and that's it I had my 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.500
 rorschach it was a little pity that 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.500
 their loans 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.540
 it took until 2009 and 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.460
 film adaptation of watchmen by 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.470
 zack snyder is successful elsewhere for 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.370
 have finally had figured the law 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.370
 watchmen who take the road 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.750
 obviously dr manhattan case absolutely 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.240
 all powers the comedian kind of 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.090
 old fighter a little cynical on 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.580
 silky spectrum extremely sexy and the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.000
 owl first version amended very very 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.620
 beautiful figure 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.300
 and then I took a picture of mines 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.710
 full of 1940 that I found in a 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.720
 magazine and I 'm going to frame in a 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.460
 old frame he world can do it and that 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.950
 did a great collector of watchmen 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.080
 but the most collectible figurine is 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.520
 this one of rorschach I'm not 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.570
 the only one to adore this character I believe 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.840
 that it is the favorite character all the 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.920
 world 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.900
 and suddenly the figurine were 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.910
 extremely hard to find 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.680
 I managed to find it in 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.420
 absolutely exceptional circumstances 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.490
 it takes two players were to los 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.170
 angeles for the 3 g / t on hollywood 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.790
 boulevard and the English suite on the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.680
 virgin megastore that was closing 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.730
 definitely and who stood up all to 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.350
 least 30 40 50 60 70 % obviously I 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.090
 went shopping and 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.620
 arriving at the cashier behind the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.750
 cashier I see on a shelf 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.160
 the rorschach figurine was looking for 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.230
 for months I asked the 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.180
 cashier I can buy it he told me 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.410
 but yes of course already I almost 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.850
 to faint I realized that 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.250
 nobody before - had spotted this 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.530
 figurine and in addition the question resumes 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.930
 the figure looks at her and tells me ah in 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.250
 plus you have less 40% 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.720
 result I had to pay this figurine to 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.700
 about 3 dollars while she is 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.780
 super collector is when it was 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.780
 one of the most beautiful days of m 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.370

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.289
 to discover the watchmen 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.030

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.909

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:31.990

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.520

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.599
 warmly it's very very well written and 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.009
 very well decide even if alan moore the 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.460
 original creator is not so much 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.229
