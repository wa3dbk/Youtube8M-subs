00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.990
 physics 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:01.070
 if this is not the case you have stayed with us 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.070
 for 14 years the Nazis rule the world 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.880
 then I will find the resistance and there 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.440
 help fight dj blasco says 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.510
 I was afraid of dying 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.010
 and here she is back from the dead 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.470
 let's put things right 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.810
 we are finally strong enough to 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.570
 attacking them we will no longer be forced to 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.670
 hide the tech general like rats 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.330
 set is closer than it is 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.520
 never been 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.740
 if we eliminate the general we limit the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.940
 there is one last war machine 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.940
 what is important 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.520
 I like you you are a resistant specimen 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.319
 let me explain how it works 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.970
 now I will ask you a question 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.590
 you will answer that question so that 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.020
 I will keep it satisfactory otherwise 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.390
 they cut your head off with this thing 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.020
 you understand me if you put it to give that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.020
 binasco 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.240
 already exists in how many things have changed 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.200
 I've been away too long 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:10.000
 we were screwed with a bomb no one knows 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:10.000
 how they subdued this world 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.200
 and they took away their freedom 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.740
 destroying what took centuries 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.740
 to be built 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.760
 terrified world with their power 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.689
 enslaving millions 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.689
 people 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.550
 again 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.180
 rebellion 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.910
 that existence 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.950
 crushed 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.390
 an iron boot 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.390
 pages of history are written 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.390
 flaunting their strength 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.280
 it ends 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.569
 but if they make a big mistake 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.530
 while I was n't there 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.020
 they set this world on fire 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.440
 and more war was the creation of a 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.440
 world 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.840
 some 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.200
 abled 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.180
 and unthinkable 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.510
 they have not built 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.539
 steel armies does not have 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:02.419
 not rewriting the story sorry 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.419
 but they forgot about me 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.889
 magic
