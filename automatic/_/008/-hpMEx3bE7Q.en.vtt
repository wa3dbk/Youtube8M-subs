00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.919
 hello everyone welcome to the blog of 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.899
 the academy driver the blog where we 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.570
 learn to drive I am mounir your 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.340
 particular monitor and today I have 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.090
 the pleasure of shooting a new video 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.940
 training whose objective is how 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.620
 to be able to succeed a startup in 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:29.840
 side 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:31.850
 it's just after that so you have it 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.739
 tired of missing your hill start 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.450
 you're tired of it you want to see you 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.980
 systematically recede each time 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.120
 that you do a startup I go to 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.100
 ready i will introduce you in 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.380
 a few moments a simple method to 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.149
 follow step by step to be able to 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.130
 to make your hill start 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.410
 so the hill start there are two 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.790
 possibilities first possibility we 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.710
 done by pulling the handbrake 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.270
 second possibility to the point of 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.050
 skating what I propose you it's 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.940
 that you drive and 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.920
 immediately in order to see how 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.840
 does it happen and then be able to 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.239
 to reproduce it directly go we go there 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.129
 so I'm on a climb like you 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.389
 have seen a rise enough 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.679
 important so what will happen 

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:07.009
 is that I realized a start in 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:10.520
 side 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.109
 with the first step handbrake so 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.659
 I have the brake pedal engaged I 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:16.249
 pull my handbrake hop there my brake to 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.509
 hand and you would go I 'm going to press 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.700
 the clutch thoroughly spent my first 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.289
 speed from there I'm going to start 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.880
 to press on the accelerator we hesitate 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.990
 not to ride in the towers on a 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.009
 boot in flat terrain I you 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.509
 demand is to reach the 2000 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.770
 revolutions / minute ensures boot up hill 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.249
 hill will have to accelerate a little bit 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.529
 plus goes up between 2000 and 2500 rounds 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:35.569
 minute we give the engine speed so 

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:37.549
 I accelerate and I will pick up my point 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.109
 skating by picking my point 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.209
 skating well observes the nose of the 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.649
 car the front of the car what will 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.349
 to happen is that the front will start 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.939
 to raise slightly as soon as you 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.960
 see the nose of the car started to 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.060
 review 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.860
 really you block your point of 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.220
 skating you're blocking your foot on 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.450
 the clutch okay from there so 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.150
 I still have the accelerator pedal 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.619
 snapped the left foot on the point of 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.030
 skating that will happen is that I 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.190
 will have to release the handbrake 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.810
 but then be careful if you want it 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.530
 hand brake too early the car is going 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.729
 retreat 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.229
 if you are loosening the handbrake 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.880
 too late there is a risk that the car 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.739
 hold it in front of you so you really have to 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.380
 synchronize the thing and I invite you 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.260
 to replicate this exercise to follow this 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.730
 point by point method with your 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.350
 monitor as often as possible 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.700
 ask him to put you on a hill 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.480
 and then for 5 minutes you do the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.540
 Hill start 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.980
 so after these little explanations I 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.840
 will show you how 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.700
 how are we doing is gone 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.080
 so to make my hill start 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.660
 I am going first 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.810
 first gear started to accelerate 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.160
 pick up my skating point loosen 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.930
 my handbrake as soon as the nose of my 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.370
 car starts to rise 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.500
 I accelerate taking good point of 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.350
 skating yours overcomes and the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.519
 maneuver is over then the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.810
 hill start and handbrake 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.730
 now is no longer a problem for 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.239
 you know the method you 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.610
 must follow it step by step 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.840
 all right I do not want to hear but 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.420
 mounir I tried to do this 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.030
 method it does not work he'll have to 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.190
 practice exercising several times 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.590
 to be able to get there and be able to 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.290
 master this subtlety at the level of 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.390
 the use of commands 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.030
 it's been several years since I see my 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.110
 wife make couscous to I know 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.950
 how to do it but I am 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.230
 unable to do it 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.450
 okay and all because I do not 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.880
 do not train me so you go you 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.630
 train with your monitor so the 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.829
 Hill start 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.540
 it's a method we've seen we're going 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.959
 move on to the next start up in 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.930
 side 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.269
 without the golden handbrake it's a 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.100
 method that is substantially identical to 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.420
 the method you had with the brake 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.570
 hand except that of course there will be 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.310
 no handbrake so it requires 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.410
 to have a diesel vehicle 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.019
 most auto schools have 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.880
 diesel vehicles so it's impeccable 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.959
 if you have a gasoline car I will 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.940
 recommend that you train 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.500
 the handbrake simply until 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.549
 that you have sufficient control over your 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.829
 commands to be able to do without 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.359
 hand brake so the principle it is 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.500
 simple it's like a startup except 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.470
 that we will initially seek 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.000
 the skating point 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.470
 unlike a field start 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.660
 dish where I urge you to press 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.220
 the accelerator to be able to go up the 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.170
 skate point so there simply 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.520
 legs stiff I fully support the 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.590
 clutch pedal I spend my first 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.300
 speed i'm going to pick up my point of 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.700
 skating by looking for my point of 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.350
 skating I will feel that my foot 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.290
 right who's on the brake will start 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.330
 to shake slightly shaking slightly 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.640
 okay the nose of the car is going 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.530
 start to raise yourself slightly 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.620
 will feel that the car starts to 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.030
 want to move forward as soon as you're there 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.650
 you block your foot on the clutch 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.840
 you block me okay and then you 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.610
 go rocked with the right foot of the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.400
 pedal brake pedal 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.740
 throttle pressed on the accelerator 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.480
 more than on a normal start it goes 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.550
 have to give the diet to your engine 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.050
 from power to your engine's 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.360
 way to tow the vehicle 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.490
 which is almost a ton of agreement so 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.169
 I accelerate between 2 and 2500 rounds by 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.030
 minute 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.650
 from the moment it is 2500 rpm 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.419
 by minute ben i'll start to 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.280
 gradually go back up my order 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.140
 clutch and my car is going to get 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.070
 in motion so after giving you 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.750
 the explanations 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.990
 Well I will offer to 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.840
 it directly on 7 on this coast 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.890
 it rolls so we go there so what 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.729
 I'll do if I'm going to spend the 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.680
 first gear 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.080
 I'm going to get my skating point 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.660
 I'm going to let go and accelerate 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.120
 loudly I slowly go back up my clutch 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.460
 my car starts moving forward and I can 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.780
 stop me well and listen well 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.790
 now the hill start 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.490
 it's a method you know 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.220
 two possibilities with the handbrake 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.630
 or without the brake okay I you 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.680
 asks to be particularly 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.000
 attentive to what I'm going to tell you 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.370
 watch videos 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.310
 that's good it's born that implies that you 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.190
 be interested 1 for your training 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.570
 but if you look at them 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.890
 videos but that next you were not 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.080
 in practice with your monitor it does not 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.100
 is absolutely useless it's not in 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.169
 watching videos we will learn 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.330
 to do as I wanted said it's ten 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.760
 years that I watch my wife do the 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.070
 couscous and ben I still do not know 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.270
 do it okay ah so train yourself 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.390
 with your monitor it will be a good 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.390
 thing 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.300
 the course on hill start and 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.669
 come to an end 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.150
 if you have questions or questions 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.800

 so a little green thumb for 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.250
 enjoy the video it will give us 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.640
 courage continued thanks again for your 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:58.620
 attention i'll see you soon on the 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.930
 blog of the drive academy the blog where one 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.930
 learn to drive goodbye
