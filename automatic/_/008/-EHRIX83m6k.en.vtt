 [Music] 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello then let's make a cut of 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.629
 hair of a child in this case I kill good 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.049
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.670
 wet the hair I do with this with 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.130
 this spray- type bottle and if not 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.960
 you can wash your hair and cut it in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 wet but always always the hair is 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.130
 cut 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.869
 then we combed it well 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.720
 so that there is no knot we can 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.719
 pass the comb well and we went to cut 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.699
 with a comb the narrower it is 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.739
 you win so much better 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.199
 Well, we have combed well dividing 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.269
 hair on both sides with stripe 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.190
 medium and now what we are going to do is 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.190
 mark the length by cutting the edges 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.730
 used from the variety of the possible 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.360
 a specific scissor to cut the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.310
 hair 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.990
 I'm not going to leave it too short that 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.720
 he does not like it but yes I'm going to cut 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.070
 one centimeter or two 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.770
 I'm marking them all around 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.360
 first one side and then the other with the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.170
 Well stretched hair so it stays the same 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.170
 by all the sites 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.200
 is the forehead above the eyebrows 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.200
 up to the mouth 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.920
 and we are doing the same in the other 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.869
 yes yes in a rounded way 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.400
 Well, the fringe, as I tell you, 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.350
 I usually do just above the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.610
 eyebrows not too short because the hair 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.610
 once dry in court 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.520
 Well now we are going to be doing 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.770
 the layers and we lift the hair towards 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.230
 above we cut out this 2 centimeter that 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.640
 we need what you need 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.430
 and always in vertical 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.270
 so you do not notice the 30 26 placed it 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.250
 well and I'm cutting 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.620
 and the sides what I do is catch it 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.240
 to talk a little back 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.939
 [Music] 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.200
 always following a parallel to the 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.200
 line that we have made in the p 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.610
 from front to back 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.830
 like trimming the layers in front towards 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.480
 back and top to bottom once 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.470
 that we have the height because we take that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.470
 same hair and a little more 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.329
 I tell you I'm not going to leave it too much 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.329
 short 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.260
 who likes to talk more 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.760
 you will also notice that the tips are 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.510
 very thin when you've been without 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.510
 cut their hair 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.110
 so it's easy to know how far 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.250
 you have to find to keep the 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.150
 haircut 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.290
 [Music] 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.080
 well let's proceed once done 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.870
 lateral to the back the same 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.530
 cutting always marking the cut 12 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.070
 millimeters behind I leave you a little 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.070
 shorter 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.180
 we have one side first and then the other 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.860
 trying that we are left equal by 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.960
 supposed 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.900
 I am part of always taking several 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.760
 strands so that it mixes and does not 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.820
 let's have many earwigs 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.820
 [Music] 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.239
 now to match it with the other side 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.590
 we start in the central part taking a 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.260
 little more of the hair and measuring it with 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.140
 the previous one and so we are going down little to 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.330
 little bit 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.160
 do not 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.510
 as I always tell you backwards 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.510
 doing them a lot is not like that 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.410
 well then to do the most 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.510
 delicate that is the side of the sideburns 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.450
 we mark to where we want it to arrive 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.250
 this go taste we like shorter or 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.810
 longer and children usually do not 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.140
 they have to carry them very marked 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.690
 where we receive to what part of the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.280
 ear has to cover so to speak 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.470
 we are cutting and then we change them 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.930
 a little more 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.990
 I'm going to leave it like that and the bold 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.490
 surpass a little 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.590
 and with the bangs we're going to do what 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.450
 same the part of the rise in 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.069
 vertical 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.989
 always in this way the locks 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.209
 resign from front back do not do it 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.099
 in the other way for the dorsal to people 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.780
 so to speak, because it is going to be noticed 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.060
 much the different 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.340
 what I'm going to do is to remove 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.889
 any step that you have left and 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.480
 to download a little bit the hair is des 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.720
 equal it with this scissors that you have 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.720
 viewed 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.550
 in sitting 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.610
 and that serves for this very purpose 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.800
 parading a little hair 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.440
 and that the snips are not marked or 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.240
 fishermen 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.080
 just repeat a little bit above 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.080
 the operation 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.889
 with this also the hair acquires more 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.889
 movement 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.970
 I recommend you the hair is important to a 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.040
 child that you have entertained so that 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.810
 do not complain all the time mate now 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.780
 himself is playing with the ipad or watching 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.970
 a movie 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.470
 you give them a video game what you have or 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.420
 something to color so they are 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.940
 entertained they endure much more 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.710
 time that always seems eternal 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.340
 at least children who do not like 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.340
 haircut 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.230
 Mommy is always there when it's over 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.970
 Mommy when you finish what's missing too 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.340
 I give them a small prize at the end or a 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.270
 eurito or a chupa chups a chucha something 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.270
 so a special dessert 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.280
 so they do not give me so much good 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.440
 Well now that it's drying up we're going 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.720
 combing to check that more or less 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.850
 it will look good if while cutting and 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.530
 dry you have it like saying again with 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.540
 the spray or with the hands with a small cup 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.040
 with a wet comb 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.670
 I buy baix of people that both sides 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.670
 they are the same 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.159
 He already has a tired face but good 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.329
 I think we have gotten more or less 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.329
 It's fine I see it handsome 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:06.180
 what you liked and that goes well 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.180
