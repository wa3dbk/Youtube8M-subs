00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.360
 I think that around 25 may suffice 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.920
 let's move to the back 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:23.039
 usual control loop system against blue 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:26.189
 here too we move about 25 so 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.199
 I think it can be fine 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 now let's try to apply to ours 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.770
 faces we select them all with against 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 the mens mood maybe with two iterations 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.989
 here it is then we recover the box that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.719
 we saved before we had them 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:52.500
 hidden so let's see everything 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.210
 how here is we do this type 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.340
 of selection change color as well 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:06.890
 becomes clearer we convert it into 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:10.140
 editable polygons four windows 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.460
 because we model better on the window 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:24.290
 ready at the top level this is the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:26.549
 selection we can safely 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.549
 also select these vertices e 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:40.850
 bring them up to this point we do 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.850
 re-entering a bit these two parts is there 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.880
 small detail 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.630
 the eyes here is a pin then 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.780
 we leave the mode on the object e 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.720
 let's go to the create panel to choose 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.729
 the auto cylinder object grid because 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.950
 we want that saga indeed in this point and 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:07.450
 we realize the detail of the small hole 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:19.640
 let's go back here maybe we manage it 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:26.470
 taking advantage of these boxes we now hide the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:28.870
 map we don't need the scene anymore 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.840
 parade to render in mental mode 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.910
 ray two simple materials from the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.470
 autodesk library 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.140
 I entered a normal spot light is 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.260
 another omni of filling and finally 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.320
 click on the render icon to see 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.320
 the final result of our work 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.100
 very well this is the result I would say 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.650
 which is discreet after this long work 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.670
 it is time to go and get a 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.070
 good coffee 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.070
 appointment to the next tutorial
