00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello I am the noble and true today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.910
 I show you how the hair to the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.320
 Pick selected when you go 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.000
 you see them with me now 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.299
 just plain and know straw 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.609
 that does not look great for that 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.140
 all you need is a straightener and what 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.230
 I definitely recommend it 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.300
 is a protective spray for example 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.539
 here's something of barea I have that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.810
 now that 's just not the hair 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.859
 I have very long hair and 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.160
 the tips are already a bit 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.250
 broken because something never used but 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.649
 I use that now I do that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.430
 right after the shower and once more 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.770
 before I smooth my hair 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.579
 that's just an extra protection for 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.050
 the hair 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:56.660
 it is so much and not very nice 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:01:00.510
 have been so expensive by wally look 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.930
 first of all you can start well 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.659
 I always want to start differently 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.939
 at times back times and look like 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.390
 that just looks like one 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.970
 not just a lot of it will be yes 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.360
 even as they thin then the tracks 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.479
 it is important that this goes outward 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.430
 Turning forward is at least important to it 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.330
 really such a nice swing 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.750
 have in there 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.090
 I show it to you now even slightly 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.090
 turn and pull down 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.159
 as you can see, that's what he's been doing 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.689
 is not good that is because 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.280
 it is a warning a bit damp 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.869
 his 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.930
 but oh well we soon anyway 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.930
 isolated 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.829
 I've seen a nice one now 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.829
 cases in it 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.300
 this is what the rest of the house is doing now 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.010
 to lose weight again 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.400
 you always really know the fat 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.440
 I always decide for myself 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:11.500
 so off so really nice 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:14.790
 and also not from approach and the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.790
 Tips are very important 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.650
 so I'm back as you see 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.250
 I am almost finished it is 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.250
 not much anymore 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.320
 you finally need a lot of mistakes 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.780
 for this 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.780
 it really works wozzeck 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.000
 I think the tip extra falls with it 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.550
 The hair does not slip is a great 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.170
 Tip and are not the top people 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.620
 out then you can see how 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.620
 that's nice 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.470
 Here you will definitely see me here 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.530
 have a slight kink in it and 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.040
 the patent on the way 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.040
 that looks great 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.130
 then another blanket 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.620
 further namely thinner strands 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:18.669
 so that I can get that nice intense 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.669
 in the middle of it always looks great 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:36.890
 so there are two left 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:40.010
 So really finished and the man 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:47.090
 a little bit higher now does not look better 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:49.550
 because the bells are so big and 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.150
 Loosen up and hang out 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.880
 that is joy half know important of 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.240
 more intense in there are the third one yes 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:03.850
 as I said out here what in the 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.850
 direction and here now in the other 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.590
 is a bit slower with it 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.480
 you get a little bit more heat off 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.550
 Do not even salt on the last level 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.630
 make said recently told then 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.630
 the men ii burns 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.290
 and now a little bit more 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:56.120
 loosen up I brush that still 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.120
 once because they look messed up 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.210
 with the fingers through it 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.460
 so 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:26.780
 I get up a bit then you see 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.780
 the result 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.640
 a little house friend I have it 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.830
 me that of toft that I use already 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.930
 for years , this is the special 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.410
 edition the super coolness to 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.410
 large 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:04.370
 Yes 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:06.320
 so much for the hair and unvarnished 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.520
 I'll get ready soon 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.680
 maybe by watching this too 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.700
 nor as I then put on my makeup 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.210
 everyday look 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.210
 yes it was making a lot of fun
