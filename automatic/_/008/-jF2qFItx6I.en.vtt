well just to be able to get some of the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.770 
well just to be able to get some of the
ones<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.210> really<00:02:13.480> really<00:02:13.810> want<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.790> but

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
ones that I really really want but but

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.720 
ones that I really really want but but
uh<00:02:16.810> but<00:02:17.350> luckily<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.650> haven't<00:02:17.950> had<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.430> result

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
uh but luckily I haven't had a to result

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.610 
uh but luckily I haven't had a to result
to<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.600> doing<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.050> or<00:02:20.230> anything<00:02:20.410> like<00:02:20.560> that

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
but I think that it's your guys's choice

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.170 
but I think that it's your guys's choice
to<00:02:23.800> do<00:02:23.890> those<00:02:24.010> type<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.220> things<00:02:24.340> or<00:02:24.580> not<00:02:24.700> it's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
to do those type of things or not it's

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.540 
to do those type of things or not it's
just<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:26.230> me<00:02:26.350> morally<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:26.740> just<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.070> don't<00:02:27.400> feel

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
just for me morally I just I don't feel

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.060 
just for me morally I just I don't feel
right<00:02:28.320> kind<00:02:29.320> of<00:02:29.380> cheating<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.770> system

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
right kind of cheating the system

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.610 
right kind of cheating the system
however<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.490> Chi<00:02:31.060> if<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.600> system<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.080> exposed

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
however the Chi if the system is exposed

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.220 
however the Chi if the system is exposed
which<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.070> has<00:02:33.250> been<00:02:33.570> many<00:02:34.570> many<00:02:34.780> times<00:02:35.020> even

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
which it has been many many times even

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.120 
which it has been many many times even

it's still exposed people are going to

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.160 
it's still exposed people are going to
take<00:02:39.340> advantage<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.360> don't<00:02:40.930> really

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
take advantage of it and I don't really

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.840 
take advantage of it and I don't really
