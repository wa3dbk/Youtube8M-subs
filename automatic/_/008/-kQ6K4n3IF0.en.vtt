00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.510
 saw from another small backpack here on TB 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.130
 Also backpack to bike a backpack to 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.230
 adventure race to whom 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.270
 regularity we will speak more focused on the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.489
 truth in hydration than in the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.080
 transportation of any other object which 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.300
 will load very small objects into the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.550
 actually okay you will be able to load 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 for example gel carbohydrate gel 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.030
 bar of protein protein bar 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.000
 that kind of thing but you will not 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.370
 carry much more than that and a 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.370
 2 liter water tank 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.810
 I'm talking about hydrax at 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.060
 ok we get tiny like me 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.880
 I told you that chile is made 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.880
 specifically for the situations of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.250
 bicycle or race situations 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.619
 adventure or enduro on foot 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.090
 Come on, she's got a part here. 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.860
 water inlet 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.990
 compartment to show you the best 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.740
 then this compartment is not 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.680
 removable is this entry that covers her 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.750
 come out you have an easier cleaning 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.240
 easier, but you do not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.530
 can remove this reservoir from 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.950
 water from inside the backpack 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.440
 It's here in the front we have a 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:56.760
 smaller aperture with the vulture's zipper where 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:02.970
 you internally have another pocket 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:05.760
 And here you have another pocket with 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.000
 elastic in the mouth for you to put more 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.610
 something here on the back is already 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.200
 a reservoir of water is already the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:20.879
 water here behind you have reflective tape 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:25.310
 on the front in the details of the helmet door 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:28.110
 She has a helmet door built right in here. 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.340
 place that would be a raincoat 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.099
 It has a built- in helmet door for 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.470
 You hang the helmet here in front 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.870
 of hydrax 7 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.630
 it comes to scents with these rings 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:49.530
 tape you learn something 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:51.780
 here on the front of the backpack is a 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.520
 superimposed side 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.700
 There are two padded strips in one 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:07.800
 space in the middle forward 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:11.490
 the ventilation leaked handles is made of 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.490
 chest and with the two-sided support 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.580
 also the way that my mac is 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.770
 plus a simple barrier 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.960
 to help stabilize the backpack 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.380
 while the user's last inverse 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.060
 the carry handle and let's see now 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.690
 How does it work here? 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:35.490
 the system is a thread you open this 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.500
 thread and here you have access to fill the 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.040
 water tank of the hydrant 7 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.500
 here is an interesting detail for 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.240
 who likes to run listening to music or 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.610
 andrade there by listening to a song 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.190
 thing like that has a passage here that 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.290
 deepen ear you put it in here 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.930
 mp3 player and pass the handset cable 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.560
 heard here from this side 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.850
 This protection has come back here since 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.140
 fits 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:08.250
 you can trigger to facilitate the 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.660
 ds maintaining this water reservoir 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.520
 that accompanies the backpack 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.120
 then just put it back in place you have a 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.440
 marking there you fit in and I just think 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:24.340
 then the reservoir cap 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:28.100
 again animal 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.080
 now it was this review of hydrax 7 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.060
 trillion in June a backpack with the 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.660
 bike and for adventure racing 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.660
 or enduro on foot
