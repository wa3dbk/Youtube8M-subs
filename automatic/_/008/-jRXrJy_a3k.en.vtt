00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.250
 for the first time scared because of the other 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.569
 sound ineos hears my headset I have 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.040
 it has ever been in the video band in the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.690
 bad contact I habs finally 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.460
 managed to send that is until 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.790
 that works again I have videos here 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.529
 with my logitech camera 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.550
 at least the audio recording just got 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.529
 Sample heard sounds a bit 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.310
 differently but I think the time has come 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.720
 manageable 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.220
 but why is it today? 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 second video i just arrived 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.599
 completely relaxed in facebook and what 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.369
 the judge clash of cultures again 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 diligently distribute sneak peeks 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.149
 Today it starts not flying number 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.050
 one of the first information for the coming of the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.930
 december update 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.329
 and what had announced the inferno 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.250
 Tower was a whole new attack or 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.530
 added defense option he can 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.030
 now several goals at the same time 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.489
 he does not attack one anymore 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.120
 beam sent but three more 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.920
 info about it 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.770
 For one you see it on the picture 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 come up to 30 times flames or lasers 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.309
 in fire designer out 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 That means he can have up to three opponents 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.960
 attack but what is important on the one hand 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.940
 currently so at the tesla so that he is up 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.830
 to five seconds increased more and more 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.810
 harm do with a single on power 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.700
 such as the cool and then off 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.770
 five seconds most 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 Does this function have the detriment of the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.820
 tesla in this form no longer that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.009
 ie, when only 13 at the same applicant 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.900
 the damage remains identical 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.310
 not the longer the goals 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.189
 The whole thing attacks otherwise 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.470
 opinion too high would be another 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.090
 news that probably many the fern 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.829
 and tower owners will be pleased 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.590
 to use this function 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.049
 had to be destroyed it will indeed 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.509
 a new level gives the level 3 however 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.790
 both follow on level 1 and on 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.840
 level 2 has this function 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 I can imagine, for example 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.320
 that one because it can switch 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.540
 similar to the ixs political 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.619
 air defense and air and ground so that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.420
 I can say here maybe 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.220
 I would like to continue the function so far 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.840
 that was just a target and attacks 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.880
 Accordingly, the longer the then 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.299
 also uses more power or harm 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.799
 just that the whole thing just exists like that 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.509
 that then the classic inferno tower 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.939
 say I was abolished 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.590
 but you just have to see it like that 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.060
 The then shows in the update if then 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.069
 the option is to switch 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.720
 or maybe it still exists 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.190
 on all hurt does not visually looks 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.900
 ever really cool and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.549
 I also think 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.620
 if you are in krems or the like 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.120
 attacked and it makes sense 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.769
 doing you have to really curious 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.049
 be like the whole then in the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.900
 practice suggests otherwise it was too 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.700
 this sneak preview is the only one 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.090
 what meat upgrades announced 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.650
 has been 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.599
 that is, there was not more 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.970
 info what else could be 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.920
 because you just have the monument we have 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.780
 today Wednesday so tomorrow or 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.489
 friday certainly sneak peek 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.650
 Number two comes and then I would be 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.790
 Of course I'll see you there as well 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.920
 Keep up to date 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.420
 as far as I can do it the week 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.849
 I also on vacation that means that too 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.920
 still work well that I do well 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.379
 You can and you really have to 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:59.700
 be curious how this develops 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:03:01.680
 So I'm very curious how 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.970
 it just presumed likely to 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.319
 already voiced it has the possibility 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.659
 switch between these two modes 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.510
 So either a goal and harm 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.549
 Add or more goals and the damage 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.220
 not to remain identical so that is 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.230
 then as I already suspected 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.620
 Similar to the x-bow so that one there 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.239
 can just switch 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.530
 What do you say to the first I won from 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.359
 pretty cool you I myself have yet 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.769
 no contract but just that everyone 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.359
 This feature can also be used with 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.159
 Level 1 inferno tower I think that's great 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.340
 very nice so you do not really 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.139
 otherwise you have to invest a lot of money 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.760
 what we do not offer 1 if you do that 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.769
 always want to stay up to date then synonymous 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.989
 follow me on facebook break coc 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.599
 Of course, I would be there as soon as possible 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.340
 as far as new not announced 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.840
 they would let you know 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.199
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.199
 next time
