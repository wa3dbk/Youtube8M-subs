 there lived in the world one firm under

 was literally because in 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.239
 In 2005, this company produced

 or then still live studio lucasarts 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.720
 game on a new star wars trilogy under 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.699
 name lego star wars 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.530
 a parody of the first three seasons of the saga is very 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.570
 warmly welcomed since life titi 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.960
 games changed dramatically they became 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.310
 the main suppliers of lego games in the world 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.289
 original trilogy star wars all 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.420

 cubes the same thing happened with 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.690
 superheroes marvel universe though here 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.820
 There are several nuances of traditional 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.590
 The concept of lego games is ridiculing 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.720
 original film story but here 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.130
 the authors decided to expand the boundaries of the plot 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.170
 based on horrible tape 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.619
 fantastic four when silver 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.479

 master of the new food in the form of a planet 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.159

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 loses his mighty board on 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 which he flies through space it

 Crashed coin space cubes 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.450
 and the hunt begins with one

 hand favors nickname fury 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.380
 already caused as familiar 7 avengers 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.360
 so and the new arrivals but no less 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.200
 famous heroes like spiderman 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.270
 or wolverines 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.100
 and confronts them doctor doom collected 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.770
 under their banners various villain 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.110
 such as loki green goblin magnet and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.090
 other gameplay of the game as a whole at all 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.160
 not changed we still rush on 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.750
 levels built from Lego destroy 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.940
 we collect everything coines 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.820
 looking for secrets and solving simple puzzles 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.040
 for this we are given almost 150 heroes 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.239
 the marvel universe is where to roam 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.640
 each has its own unique 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.410
 ability spider can crawl on the walls 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.510
 and climb into hard to reach places 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.820
 a black widow can become invisible 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.709
 Captain America puts out the fire with his shield 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.690
 after the level is passed through it 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.730
 you can run through the others again 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.500
 heroes or villains to find all 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.040
 secrets and squeeze the most out of this 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.020
 locations 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.780
 and now let's move on to it 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.940
 I'll start with the main thing is mad gear disney 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.040
 its main acquisition so far 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.570
 marvel and especially the avengers after 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.430
 of how they shot that in principle 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.420
 no wonder they prepared us for them 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.040
 several years in a row 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.530
 mickey mouse and in the most shameful way 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.130
 decided to cut the dough until the franchise yet 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.130
 cushy 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.140
 immediately announced a deliberately failed 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.060
 serial chip which billed and turned out 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.010
 which was some kind of strange 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.020
 the show without any iconic heroes and 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.520
 actors other than hero coulson and then 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.230
 quickly cooked up the ultimate 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.090
 spider-man and this is a terrible series for 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.950
 schoolchildren where peter parker do not joke 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.780
 just don't fool around 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.580
 but there stuck as a camera 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.989
 all the heroes of the avengers and now also 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.300
 whether you made the game no think 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.220
 nothing bad marvel super hero done 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.019
 very high quality but just here you can see 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.180
 the very influence of disney which 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.040
 expressed in jokes jokes here I 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.780
 I come up to the second thing nuances 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.640
 that after star wars, I never 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.500
 I played one or a game and now 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.630
 such a big break visual 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.799
 the difference is huge graphics have become 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.959
 much cooler 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.580
 in fact it is already a finished film which 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.590
 By the way, lately it has become like not 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.450
 too much and according to batman did me by 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.340
 star wars series sawed down saw 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.930
 recently series and new year lego movie 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.940
 cook in the fourteenth year at 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.860
 as far as this all the similarities can be seen 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.870
 cut scenes besides the authors delivered 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.030
 wild epic sound which is not easy 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.829
 suddenly hears such a parody game 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.320
 him and in serious projects not always 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.020
 you will wait as a result of all this appeared 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.490
 quite a professional voice acting 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.710
 Lego-man his travelers here tails 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.539
 tread on a rake if you remember something 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.039
 the same star wars were famous for 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.050
 parody moments which 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.120
 played out without any voiceovers were 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.979
 just some sounds and damn with this 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.840
 it was funny right now the authors on 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.000
 absolutely serious soup with a cool 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.919
 shows sound graphics 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.630
 pathetic dialogues designed to cause 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.340
 delight and perhaps the smallest 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.789
 iron man fans and other 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.680
 heroes 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.270
 The same situation is with jokes they have 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.410
 something trite and calculated 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.210
 exclusively for children 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.800
 and it is interesting that the game is very 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.530
 qualitatively from the dark moments which 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.930
 attention happens without dialogue in the old 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.490
 Titi style games and now against this all 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.590
 the rest of the talk doesn't seem easy 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.720
 pathetic I am terribly stupid for example when 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.340
 mr fiction includes elevator cap 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.229
 asks him whether it is really 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.419
 such a quick way to donate Octavius 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.910
 to which he answers that he called this thing 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.680
 Fantasy Labor and this way faster than 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.630
 run up the stairs so funny is that 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.660
 while we activated this very fiction 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.250
 so much time has gone by now 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.050
 was a long time up the stairs 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.210
 it is clear that the developers have tried 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.220
 reach the maximum audience possible 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.930
 from fans who are passing lego games on 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.210
 one hundred percent knocking out all the coins 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.800
 characters and looking for all the secrets and to 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.450
 ordinary viewers threw a cartoon in 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.520
 which nothing else is needed except 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.710
 like a crowd and familiar superheroes in the frame 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.840
 simple mechanics of parts of lego paphos and 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.640
 primitive humor but personally I am in this 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.740
 range somehow didn't get in here like and 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.420
 full of fan service, I still break everything 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.460
 all objects at the level although I must admit 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.470
 it's not getting as fun as 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.390
 I used to earn maximum warriors and 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.160
 playing for other characters in particular 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.790
 for villains plus one more picture 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.320
 nice and music but no steba 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.330
 for example when i hear jay 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.040
 says sense he are you a doctor with 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.320
 degree may look what I have 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.630
 here and here it hurts damn well from paese 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.610
 full, I can not help it because it all 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.070
 the most important thing for lekku games because 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.080
 it is glass that distinguishes them from standard 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.550
 children's choir cuts marking four s 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.140
 plus or what's there for now 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.540
 very little ones so 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:22.080
 sorry trawler stealth but this time you 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.030
 I did not stand on it all with you 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.370
 joker specifically for the brain and channel 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.500
 subscribe to our channels and there and 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.600
 there are a lot of interesting things go on 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.380
 post like and commit 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.380
 bye everyone
