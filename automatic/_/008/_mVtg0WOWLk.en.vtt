00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 fallout 3 is one of my favorite games 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.170
 of this generation is great is 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.179
 absorbing and it's great that something that 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.980
 characterizes this game is that the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.870
 world in which it develops is in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.839
 constant movement 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.020
 nfc dies suddenly turns that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.520
 they were open suddenly they close 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.430
 usually by push and sometimes 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.730
 relevant characters die by your hand 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.400
 or not altering the course of the plot of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.369
 that way someone discovered that skirt or 3 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.950
 says a lot more than you think and this is the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.440
 reason why I could predict the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.260
 future many know that fallout 3 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.030
 contains several such radio stations 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.760
 time the most important of the game is 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 galaxy news radio many of those that are 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.629
 followers of the bad acts in the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 game they know they can kill the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.360
 traitor radio conductor when one 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.250
 it kills it is replaced by margaret the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 radio technique and that is not so 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.230
 happy with his new post what 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.930
 many do not know is that some cases 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.330
 nr becomes a station 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.040
 numbers for those who do not know 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.590
 type of station are those that emit 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.470
 coded messages in fact in life 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.600
 real exists they can search in google to 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.550
 more information nobody knows the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.780
 conditions to get the station 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.520
 of the numbers 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.040
 apparently you have to kill the traitor 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.530
 since nobody of those who heard the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.110
 station had it destroyed alive too 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.290
 you have to skip the galaxy mission news 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.960
 radio which makes the signal stronger 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.750
 of the station and what makes the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.970
 station is active is to destroy raven 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.670
 rock though most who have tried 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.100
 these three things failed to get 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.900
 the station there seems to be more 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.810
 conditions that must be taken into account 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.270
 which are unknown until the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.780
 moment if you're lucky in getting 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.090
 the station and it's in the signal range 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.430
 you will hear someone you know hurt 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.770
 Although he is dead the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.780
 voice is heard outside the character as well 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.810
 that technically would be the voice actor 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.690
 eric of who or he was a series of numbers 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.250
 in a depressive tone which arrive 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:19.690
 up to 9 or 12 characters 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:21.490
 something kind 9 379 17 20 34 all 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.030
 numbers that he mentions have only one 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.430
 that is, it comprises between 0 and 9 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.070
 the numbers are followed by a long 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.770
 morse code string followed by the 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.470
 song ay do not want to set the world 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.380
 on fire many managed to decipher the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.020
 code love easily which ones had 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.820
 several messages in English these messages 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.730
 they listened to each other mundane and sometimes 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.550
 funny like for example I just washed 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.160
 the car maybe Chinese food for dinner 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.470
 or you've seen my video on youtube 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.750
 I recorded myself by hitting a bum in the balls 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.270
 the messages went up he had nothing 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.580
 to do with the world of fallout 3 but 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.400
 that had to do with ours several 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.580
 messages were scary as the queen 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.700
 died the world cries this day we are 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.360
 British and I can not believe what 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.150
 did we miss the noise a lot no longer 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.610
 I stand noisy I have a gun in 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.950
 the attic a user of wikis 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.740
 forms realized the meaning of 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:29.140
 the numbers when he saw the message 12 055 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.380
 28 2010 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.570
 what are you talking about, you will be surprised 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.300
 which spoke of the death of Gary oldman 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.700
 and saw that the numbers on the date and the 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.040
 time of death then followed 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.670
 looking for more messages that apparently 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.550
 predicted in the future remember that the 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.530
 game is from the year 2008 the next 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:57.850
 message that he found which he left 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:04:00.610
 surprised was 9 454 20 2010 accident 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.459
 in the gulf many dead spill of 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.550
 announced oil which referred to the 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.410
 natural disaster on the part of bp this 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.180
 was granted by the convocation of the 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.360
 people to follow disciplined the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.120
 messages and pass the numbers to dates and 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.950
 hours in military form many dates 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.620
 they were after the game was 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.530
 released but several were before the game 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.530
 for example, 22 15 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.170
 15,865 he is dead and maybe he blames 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.000
 will be put in this current bowl 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.940
 I hope Johnson does not fool me with the 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.660
 payment which raised doubts about the 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.190
 official version of the lincoln murder 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.650
 according to which several users started 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.080
 to decipher the messages the moderators 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.060
 of fall of which and they began to bathe 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.520
 all the users that were put to see 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.920
 the messages and to all those who 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.020
 they read erased everything I had to 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.720
 see with the site's number station 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.030
 and they put a filter in the system to 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.320
 prevent someone else from talking about 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.630
 messages 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.910
 many users however communicate 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.520
 by mail to continue discussing about 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.430
 the messages some messages are in 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.400
 fall out which are the queen died 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:20.460
 today the world and now in days like this 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:23.830
 we are all British the 402 march 19 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.330
 2014 you have seen my video on youtube that 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.670
 I recorded kicking the balls in the bums 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.230
 24-16 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:35.030
 December 24 2012 I can not believe that 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.340
 Toast won an Oscar 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:42.380
 21 33 February 27 of the year 2023 I can not 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.720
 to believe that they did, we still need a lot 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.540
 they were warned but had to follow 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.750
 stretching the limits of science the 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.720
 noise I can not stand that noise anymore and 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.210
 the light my god and the universe is 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.240
 unravel slowly around our 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.880
 I will not wait for death I have a 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.940
 pistol in the attic this is the only 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.410
 message without numbers there is no doubt that what 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.110
 that they discovered are practically 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.540
 prophecies that told us things about 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.090
 our world that could happen in the 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.450
 future gives very great to the whistle has you 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.830
 liked to share it with everyone
