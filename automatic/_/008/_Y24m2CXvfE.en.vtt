 they have already lost their fear of making 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.870
 store in Caracas that I have another 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.250
 concept and I think I've seen it there 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.230
 stores that easy is this concept of 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.050
 like it a lot because the 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.750
 level within 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.360
 of constant public artist of 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.160
 locations is super good everything has 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.860
 advanced long before the doctors had 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.180
 have to draw your own needle and right now 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.370

 and already there comes seal sterilize 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.360
 those who run less risk than what 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.190
 I already say people who go to places 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.470
 tattoo professionals where 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.780
 they comply with all hygiene regulations 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.180
 let them see that they cover the needle 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.470
 of his presence that the studies are 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.980
 disposable then have 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.630
 see that the palette the boots 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.340
 with ink also the votes to not 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.970
 nothing remains that you see that everything 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.970
 discard it 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.100
 the suspensions were made to order 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.680
 of the day as one of the most 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.990
 awaited the event stealing the astonishment 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.850
 of more than one of those present there at 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.620
 same time that demonstrated the courage of 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.700
 many of the attendees who 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.700
 They dared to suspend 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.500
 dance music all kinds of expression 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.210
 artistic rhythm and they put heat 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.960
 one of the most anticipated events of 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.960
 venezuela and latin america 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.450
 you could also appreciate the mixed you 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.980
 it's an unconventional contest that 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.400
 contrasts with beauty pageants 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.400
 traditional 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.040
 my name is you I am not flight 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.940
 Venezuelan alternative is a model 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.290
 alternative 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.670
 true that has nothing to do with the 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:51.040
 standards necessarily imposed on you 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.370
 society 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.650
 it is no longer the stereotype 90-60-90 souza 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.660
 but beyond that, it is taken into account 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.400
 the quantity 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.670
 the answers the intelligence of the 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:09.320
 participant his domain with the public and 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:11.780
 this one that represents a new model 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.720
 to society to include people 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.600
 tattooed I think that this type of events 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.940
 opens doors is because it shows you that 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.430
 tattooed women are not criminals 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.620
 or drug addicts but many are 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.620
 women with careers business owners 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.320
 sisters mothers who simply by 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.090
 have the art on the skin 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.690
 indicates that they are less than the others 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.690
 first 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:40.380
 art ink perforations music and 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.330
 beauty are some of the words that 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.919
 we can use to define what was 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.200
 this fifth edition of the expo tatoo 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.900
 venezuela one of the most events 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.820
 expected of the year and that Avila TV 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.639
 brought to your screen in a way that 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.650
 nobody had done it 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.499
 they were greetings by ávila tv many 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:01.669
