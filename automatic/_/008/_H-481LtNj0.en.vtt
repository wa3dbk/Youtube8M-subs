00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.790
 the size sun are in full swing and it 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.269
 is slowly becoming my current time 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.000
 filming you certainly know about an old one 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.530
 model we with the rudder in 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.830
 single which is relatively difficult 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.359
 Fasten dogs is fix and me 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.180
 had now considered how to do that easily 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.680
 can do this by simply doing this 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.849
 Leitwerk doubles so firstly, there is a lot 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.430
 more stable and it also holds better me 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.260
 I already use my templates 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.250
 from the internet site knows there are 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.250
 also the exact dimensions 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.770
 I recommend real template too 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.000
 make because after the second place 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.700
 the work is thematized 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.750
 that's the old, the easier rare 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:57.310
 We had to replace that with one now 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.970
 double side fin that is in 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.600
 principle of this form only mirrored ok 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.350
 I'll show you how to do it 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.490
 But we have a white day 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:15.140
 we need a plate there we judge 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.140
 now our templates also pure 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.880
 that means the floods 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.899
 and here are two mark the two 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:02:01.220
 important therefore keep going and of course 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:02:02.929
 the support of our trainer and 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.030
 at the same time still the occasion 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.030
 hold as the double is 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:23.970
 with teachers that important and again 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:28.470
 cut that in with about me 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.110
 show the company has without the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:39.720
 incision 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:45.630
 here's the point that we bend as 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:49.440
 first time into the second makes that is the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.370
 patriots now penciled what you 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.370
 have fun cutting 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.650
 so 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.190
 what we have to do now is the animal 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.280
 two days later to background up to 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.470
 Listen mark is best you do 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.390
 not only in 2004 and in the 2 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:32.360
 very little bit so offset 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:35.330
 determined and presses I stand then 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.980
 here is something bigger gap that makes that 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.560
 stand together after what we are excited 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:49.970
 need so that is a one flies 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:54.829
 euro job or an old fan but still 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.340
 We always click to fix it 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:05.090
 once at the first mark the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:10.000
 tip come back and do it 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:15.280
 then a very small half of Munich 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.280
 century unkempt tip 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.880
 This creates a service- shaped 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:30.530
 we repeat the whole thing the same 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:36.979
 a native a black pig 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:39.490
 That's why Munich got the tip 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.310
 a huge hole is created 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:47.030
 That looks like we are stopped 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:53.150
 world, it is our weight here 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:57.229
 back and then wrap it up and ever 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.800
 Lenses family holes hold the weight 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:04.450
 or our miners exactly 1 position like that 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.450
 what you need is a bit 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:18.520
 You clip that up here 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:23.650
 and once around the pillars and back then 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:27.059
 we finish cutting the wings 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.059
 Let's go soon 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:45.470
 And that is our chief kink in the 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.470
 center 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.020
 all that has to be done now is 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.509
 here along and on mark 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.039
 he beats through both parts 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:01.639
 and then already do that 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:17.310
 land on the wings 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:19.430
 Although there is a need to sweat step 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.430
 path 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:28.740
 We are basically finished with that 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.160
 that could be glued on 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:35.720
 but not 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.720
 if we try it out like ours 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.720
 but there is our gates 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:48.240
 we need to keep you going a bit 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:50.840
 toss whether barack oh well also works 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.840
 a little winter
