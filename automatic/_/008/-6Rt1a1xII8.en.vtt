asked me what would you do well I would

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.100 
asked me what would you do well I would
say<00:00:48.790> I<00:00:48.820> was<00:00:49.059> saying<00:00:49.270> one<00:00:49.390> more<00:00:49.540> helicopter

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
say I was saying one more helicopter

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.630 
say I was saying one more helicopter
because<00:00:50.260> I've<00:00:50.470> had<00:00:50.590> one<00:00:50.830> more<00:00:50.980> helicopter<00:00:51.520> we

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
because I've had one more helicopter we

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.610 
because I've had one more helicopter we
could<00:00:51.790> have<00:00:51.879> brought<00:00:52.030> out<00:00:52.210> not<00:00:52.989> only<00:00:53.260> that<00:00:53.410> the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
could have brought out not only that the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.680 
could have brought out not only that the
52<00:00:54.250> hostages<00:00:54.820> but<00:00:55.000> also<00:00:55.180> brought<00:00:55.449> up<00:00:55.570> the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
52 hostages but also brought up the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.229 
52 hostages but also brought up the
rescue<00:00:55.870> team<00:00:56.290> and<00:00:56.500> when<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.370> failed<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:58.030> I

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
rescue team and when that failed and I

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.720 
rescue team and when that failed and I
think<00:00:58.480> that<00:00:58.600> was<00:00:58.720> a<00:00:58.750> main<00:00:59.020> factor<00:00:59.730> they'd

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
think that was a main factor they'd

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.700 
think that was a main factor they'd
brought<00:01:00.879> about<00:01:01.120> my<00:01:01.360> failure<00:01:01.809> to<00:01:01.989> be<00:01:02.140> reelected

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
brought about my failure to be reelected

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.590 
brought about my failure to be reelected
so<00:01:03.160> that's<00:01:03.399> one<00:01:03.579> thing<00:01:03.730> I<00:01:03.850> would<00:01:04.030> change<00:01:04.059> I

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
so that's one thing I would change I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.719 
so that's one thing I would change I
would<00:01:04.839> say<00:01:05.170> do<00:01:05.619> something<00:01:06.100> anything<00:01:06.369> and<00:01:06.610> he

would say do something anything and he
said<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.240> then<00:01:07.450> have<00:01:07.690> them<00:01:07.869> take<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.410> hostage

it<00:01:59.530> probably<00:01:59.920> including<00:02:00.250> our<00:02:00.429> hostages<00:02:00.910> and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
it probably including our hostages and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.249 
it probably including our hostages and
so<00:02:01.959> I<00:02:01.990> stood<00:02:02.289> up<00:02:02.440> against<00:02:02.830> all<00:02:02.979> that<00:02:03.959> all<00:02:04.959> that

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
so I stood up against all that all that

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.980 
so I stood up against all that all that
advice<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:06.009> then<00:02:06.459> eventually<00:02:06.849> my<00:02:07.630> prayers

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
advice and then eventually my prayers

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.359 
advice and then eventually my prayers
were<00:02:08.170> answered<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.560> every<00:02:08.770> hostage<00:02:09.130> came

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
were answered and every hostage came

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.990 
were answered and every hostage came
home<00:02:09.610> safe<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.690> free<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.459> think<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.849> made

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
home safe and free and so I think I made

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.550 
home safe and free and so I think I made
the<00:02:13.060> right<00:02:13.209> decision<00:02:13.270> in<00:02:13.780> retrospect<00:02:14.349> but<00:02:14.500> it

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
the right decision in retrospect but it

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.220 
the right decision in retrospect but it
was<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.739> easy<00:02:14.950> at<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.250> time<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.700> think<00:02:15.819> he<00:02:16.060> was

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
was not easy at the time I think he was

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.870 
was not easy at the time I think he was
incredibly<00:02:17.230> unfairly<00:02:17.680> judged<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.400> mean<00:02:18.610> he<00:02:18.730> was

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
incredibly unfairly judged I mean he was

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.360 
incredibly unfairly judged I mean he was
ahead<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.330> his<00:02:19.569> time<00:02:19.830> when<00:02:20.830> he<00:02:20.920> was<00:02:21.099> in<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
ahead of his time when he was in the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.220 
ahead of his time when he was in the
White<00:02:21.489> House<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.540> think<00:02:22.720> if<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.900> hadn't

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
White House and I think if it hadn't

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.020 
White House and I think if it hadn't
been<00:02:23.349> for<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.800> Iran<00:02:24.760> hostage<00:02:25.890> situation<00:02:27.030> he

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
been for the Iran hostage situation he

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.550 
been for the Iran hostage situation he
would<00:02:28.150> have<00:02:28.209> had<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> second<00:02:28.840> term<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.319> think

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
would have had a second term and I think

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.710 
would have had a second term and I think
most<00:02:30.550> likely<00:02:30.880> would<00:02:31.030> have<00:02:31.060> been<00:02:31.180> as<00:02:31.540> well

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
most likely would have been as well

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.979 
most likely would have been as well
respected<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:32.349> his<00:02:32.680> time<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:33.190> office<00:02:33.730> as<00:02:34.660> for

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
respected for his time in office as for

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.839 
respected for his time in office as for
his<00:02:35.110> time<00:02:35.319> outside<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.980> office<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.640> feel

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
his time outside the office do you feel

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.300 
his time outside the office do you feel
the<00:02:36.970> American<00:02:37.450> people<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:38.099> accepted<00:02:39.099> that

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
the American people have accepted that

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.009 
the American people have accepted that
now<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.790> was<00:02:39.969> the<00:02:40.209> right<00:02:40.420> decision<00:02:40.599> I

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
now that it was the right decision I

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.690 
now that it was the right decision I
think<00:02:41.110> increasingly<00:02:41.469> they<00:02:41.950> have<00:02:42.159> as<00:02:42.430> more

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
think increasingly they have as more

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.700 
think increasingly they have as more
facts<00:02:43.000> are<00:02:43.209> known

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
facts are known

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.520 
facts are known
people<00:02:43.950> look<00:02:44.070> back<00:02:44.280> on<00:02:44.490> those<00:02:44.640> times<00:02:45.530> but

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
people look back on those times but

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.050 
people look back on those times but
there's<00:02:46.770> still<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.980> strong<00:02:47.340> inclination<00:02:47.670> in

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
there's still a strong inclination in

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.050 
there's still a strong inclination in
our<00:02:48.150> country<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:49.680> take<00:02:49.890> military<00:02:50.700> actions

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
our country to to take military actions

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.360 
our country to to take military actions
when<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.900> think<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.440> not<00:02:52.590> necessary

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
when I think it's not necessary

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.430 
when I think it's not necessary
you<00:02:53.490> left<00:02:53.730> officer<00:02:54.510> as<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:55.020> have<00:02:55.230> said

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
you left officer as you have said

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.160 
you left officer as you have said
involuntarily<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:57.210> had<00:02:57.480> been<00:02:57.810> reelected

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
involuntarily if you had been reelected

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.540 
involuntarily if you had been reelected
what<00:02:58.590> would<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:58.980> have<00:02:59.070> liked<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.280> have

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
what would you have liked to have

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.520 
what would you have liked to have
accomplished<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.450> don't<00:03:01.020> have<00:03:01.140> any<00:03:01.290> doubt<00:03:01.500> that

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
accomplished I don't have any doubt that

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.920 
accomplished I don't have any doubt that
if<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.980> had<00:03:02.160> had<00:03:02.190> another<00:03:02.910> term<00:03:03.270> in<00:03:03.570> office<00:03:03.720> I

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
if I had had another term in office I

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.830 
if I had had another term in office I
could<00:03:03.990> have<00:03:04.230> implemented<00:03:05.040> very<00:03:05.280> firmly<00:03:05.840> the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
could have implemented very firmly the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.020 
could have implemented very firmly the
peace<00:03:07.470> agreement<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.190> negotiated<00:03:08.820> with

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
peace agreement that I negotiated with

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.960 
peace agreement that I negotiated with
Israel<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.510> its<00:03:09.690> neighbors<00:03:10.550> that<00:03:11.550> was<00:03:11.700> never

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
Israel and its neighbors that was never

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
Israel and its neighbors that was never
fully<00:03:12.600> implemented<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.620> now<00:03:14.360> 35<00:03:15.360> or<00:03:15.510> 40<00:03:15.780> years

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
fully implemented so now 35 or 40 years

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.220 
fully implemented so now 35 or 40 years
later<00:03:16.080> we<00:03:16.530> still<00:03:16.830> have<00:03:17.120> Israel<00:03:18.120> not<00:03:18.780> at<00:03:18.990> peace

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
later we still have Israel not at peace

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.350 
later we still have Israel not at peace
with<00:03:19.500> its<00:03:19.650> neighbors<00:03:19.710> but<00:03:20.580> my<00:03:20.760> successors

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
with its neighbors but my successors

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.270 
with its neighbors but my successors
were<00:03:21.600> not<00:03:21.810> very<00:03:22.020> interested<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
were not very interested in in the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.420 
were not very interested in in the
Mideast<00:03:23.520> peace<00:03:23.760> process<00:03:24.050> not<00:03:25.050> as<00:03:25.290> deeply<00:03:26.010> as<00:03:26.220> I

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
Mideast peace process not as deeply as I

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.700 
Mideast peace process not as deeply as I
was<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.060> that's<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:28.020> of<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.230> things<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.620> I

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
was and that's one of the things that I

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.220 
was and that's one of the things that I
could<00:03:28.920> have<00:03:29.010> done<00:03:29.040> differently
