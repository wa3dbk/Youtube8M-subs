00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
is still a draw because rook spawns and

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.900 
is still a draw because rook spawns and
Bishop<00:03:29.340> points<00:03:29.730> will<00:03:30.180> be<00:03:30.330> draw<00:03:30.770> if<00:03:31.770> white<00:03:32.640> King

Bishop points will be draw if white King
is<00:03:33.090> far<00:03:33.450> away<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:34.020> is<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.260> case<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.860> this

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
is far away and this is the case so this

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.780 
is far away and this is the case so this
must<00:03:35.310> be<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.520> draw<00:03:35.959> ok<00:03:36.959> but<00:03:37.140> in<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.440> position

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
must be a draw ok but in this position

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.440 
must be a draw ok but in this position
rook<00:03:38.790> takes<00:03:39.030> on<00:03:39.390> a6<00:03:39.570> is<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.230> fourth<00:03:40.530> draw<00:03:41.450> but

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.520 
rook takes on a6 is the fourth draw but

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530
