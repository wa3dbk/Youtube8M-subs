00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240 

it's<00:00:00.120> all<00:00:00.240> zoom<00:00:00.510> in<00:00:00.659> when<00:00:00.840> you're<00:00:00.960> ready<00:00:01.140> okay

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:18.070 

number<00:00:08.250> one<00:00:09.139> this<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.700> stratum<00:00:11.700> corneum

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:27.380 

and<00:00:19.080> that's<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.830> stratum<00:00:20.789> lucidum<00:00:26.180> with<00:00:27.180> all

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and that's the stratum lucidum with all

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.130 
and that's the stratum lucidum with all
the<00:00:27.689> dots<00:00:27.980> in<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> middle<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:30.090> cranial<00:00:30.570> mmm

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the dots in the middle the cranial mmm

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.240 
the dots in the middle the cranial mmm
the<00:00:31.289> granules<00:00:31.800> that's<00:00:32.550> stratum<00:00:33.180> granulosum

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
the granules that's stratum granulosum

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.979 
the granules that's stratum granulosum
question<00:00:35.250> underneath<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.530> area<00:00:38.070> is

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
question underneath that this area is

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.810 
question underneath that this area is
this<00:00:39.989> stratum<00:00:40.770> spinosum<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.430> bottom

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
this stratum spinosum and the bottom

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.389 
this stratum spinosum and the bottom
most<00:00:45.000> layer<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> epidermis<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.100> dark

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
most layer of the epidermis is this dark

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.840 
most layer of the epidermis is this dark
clear<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:48.989> called<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.800> stratum<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
clear here that's called the stratum the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.450 
clear here that's called the stratum the
south<00:00:51.260> or<00:00:52.309> stratum<00:00:53.309> germinativum<00:00:58.280> this<00:00:59.280> is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
south or stratum germinativum this is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:13.070 
south or stratum germinativum this is
the<00:00:59.609> dermis<00:01:01.190> this<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.520> here

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.180 

so<00:01:14.080> this<00:01:14.200> yellow<00:01:14.470> stuff<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.220> adipose<00:01:15.850> tissue

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
so this yellow stuff is adipose tissue

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.450 
so this yellow stuff is adipose tissue
move<00:01:18.190> on<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.640> plans<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.560> sweat<00:01:20.890> glands<00:01:21.159> they

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
move on to plans the sweat glands they

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:46.580 
move on to plans the sweat glands they
open<00:01:22.090> up<00:01:22.150> directly<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.200> surface<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:23.979> this

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.050 

part<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.830> called<00:01:51.300> which<00:01:52.300> is<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.640> surface

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
part is called which is to the surface

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.190 
part is called which is to the surface
is<00:01:55.869> called<00:01:56.289> the<00:02:00.240> further<00:02:01.240> from<00:02:01.690> that<00:02:01.720> is

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
is called the further from that is

00:02:02.200 --> 00:03:22.840 
is called the further from that is
called<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.830> cuticle

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:33.110 

these<00:03:23.850> are<00:03:24.000> responsible<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.890> remember<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
these are responsible just remember the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.690 
these are responsible just remember the
motive<00:03:33.450> secretion<00:03:33.990> for<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.920> actual<00:03:35.370> flight

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
motive secretion for the actual flight

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.820 
motive secretion for the actual flight
cleanses<00:03:36.270> apocrine<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.560> motive

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
cleanses apocrine and the motive

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.990 
cleanses apocrine and the motive
secretion<00:03:38.280> force<00:03:38.610> sebaceous<00:03:39.450> glands<00:03:41.000> and

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
secretion force sebaceous glands and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.430 
secretion force sebaceous glands and
this<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.570> the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:56.890 

and<00:03:48.440> then<00:03:48.590> it's<00:03:48.770> observers<00:03:54.340> there<00:03:55.340> also<00:03:56.090> we

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
and then it's observers there also we

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:10.260 
and then it's observers there also we
talked<00:03:57.050> about<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.290> chair<00:03:57.590> Oh<00:03:57.620> remember<00:03:58.370> the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.850 

tourists<00:04:11.270> Glenn<00:04:11.570> yeah<00:04:14.230> term<00:04:15.230> first<00:04:15.530> sweat

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
tourists Glenn yeah term first sweat

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.780 
tourists Glenn yeah term first sweat
yeah<00:04:16.370> but<00:04:17.000> it's<00:04:17.120> just<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.359> little<00:04:17.510> different
