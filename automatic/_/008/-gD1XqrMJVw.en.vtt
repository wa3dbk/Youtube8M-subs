the trailer you can to get what I'm

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.430 
the trailer you can to get what I'm
saying<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.180> near<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> end<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> trailer

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
saying and near the end of the trailer

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.869 
saying and near the end of the trailer
it<00:00:41.219> looks<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:41.579> Cole<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:43.460> biting<00:00:44.460> people's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it looks like Cole is biting people's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.290 
it looks like Cole is biting people's
necks<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:46.010> it<00:00:47.010> looks<00:00:47.280> sort<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
necks and it looks sort of like a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.779 
necks and it looks sort of like a
vampire<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.800> look<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.280> close<00:00:50.610> at

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
vampire so if you look really close at

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.170 
vampire so if you look really close at
Cole<00:00:51.059> his<00:00:51.780> eyes<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.079> red<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.789> you<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.940> looks

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
Cole his eyes are red and you just looks

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.389 
Cole his eyes are red and you just looks
really<00:00:54.449> pale<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.050> he<00:00:55.170> looks<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
really pale and he looks just like a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.299 
really pale and he looks just like a
vampire<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.410> what<00:00:58.410> I'm<00:00:58.500> guessing<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.920> it's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
vampire so what I'm guessing is it's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.680 
vampire so what I'm guessing is it's
coming<00:00:59.460> up<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.850> deal<00:01:00.059> sneeze<00:01:00.300> coming<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.600> in

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
coming up this deal sneeze coming on in

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.590 
coming up this deal sneeze coming on in
October<00:01:01.109> near<00:01:01.350> Halloween<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.449> this<00:01:03.449> is

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
October near Halloween so this is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.310 
October near Halloween so this is
probably<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.939> vampire<00:01:05.939> DLC<00:01:06.840> sort

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
or set them free you can get their

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.249 
or set them free you can get their
energy<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:59.159> it'll<00:01:59.460> kill<00:01:59.700> them<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.780> so

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
energy but it'll kill them you know so

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.749 
energy but it'll kill them you know so
in<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.680> when<00:02:02.009> he<00:02:02.189> was<00:02:02.310> biting<00:02:02.490> their

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
in this one when he was biting their

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.010 
in this one when he was biting their
necks<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.119> think<00:02:03.329> that's<00:02:03.479> how<00:02:03.600> he's<00:02:03.750> gonna<00:02:03.840> get

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
necks I think that's how he's gonna get

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.230 
necks I think that's how he's gonna get
energy<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.880> he's<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.180> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
energy and I think that he's going to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.720 
energy and I think that he's going to
use<00:02:06.420> nixes<00:02:07.079> uh<00:02:07.160> like<00:02:08.479> dark<00:02:09.500> fire<00:02:10.500> powers<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.670> I

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
use nixes uh like dark fire powers and I

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.320 
use nixes uh like dark fire powers and I
think<00:02:11.940> it'll<00:02:12.060> mix<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.629> so

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
think it'll mix with that so

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330 
think it'll mix with that so
we're<00:02:13.570> going<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.750> be<00:02:13.960> pretty<00:02:14.680> cool<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.220> can
