00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.540
 long 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.930
 Yes Yes 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.930
 let's go forward 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.809
 we do not have 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.520
 11 minutes 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.840
 relatively demanding proposals 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.440
 arrived 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.440
 slopes 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.890
 with this 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890
 ahead 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.090
 yes 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.850
 it is letting go as it is already going 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.880
 falling as possible to keep that song 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.630
 will be hung 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.630
 we go 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 straight 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.690
 but keep pulling 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.440
 for any side 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.780
 then water assumes that we have something of 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.870
 we are already on the left side 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.930
 now immediately 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.400
 the two legs and one on the head and 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.020
 assuming we have action from the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.020
 left the turn 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.390
 the tour seems to make it public and works 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.820
 something stiff 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.440
 the legs 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
 do not 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.069
 [Music] 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.579
 when 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.970
 To anybody 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.330
 on two legs 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.440
 good long marÃ­a is long 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.440
 missing Italians 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.140
 not equal with me and his forces and 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.740
 always is and always works grade 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.020
 I do not know why I'm going back forever 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.620
 from the work here 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:42.610
 with great caution for more than meekness 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.660
 with that sometimes in balls already happen I do 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.350
 this here yes 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.410
 and I make a half muzzle 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.410
 [Music] 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:58.220
 and that always down top down 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.949
 [Music] 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.510
 good 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:14.700
 when guadeloupe tells you that you 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.700
 and this is going to stop overtaking 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.230
 it's something 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.230
 flattery 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.400
 we go 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.300
 Look
