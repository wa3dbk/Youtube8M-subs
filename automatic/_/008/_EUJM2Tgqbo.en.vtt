00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.990
 Today we are going to prepare macaroni with tuna and tomato, 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.270
 but we are going to do them in a different way than we are normally used to 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.369
 eat them, we are not going to use canned tuna but natural, 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.740
 fry the slices of bonito in a drizzle of olive oil 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:36.070
 and we turn them over until they are made on both sides. 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:54.790
 When they are made we separate them while Enrique is cutting the onion, 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:13.200
 we chop it very fine and fry it in the same oil in which 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:24.000
 We made the tuna to take all its flavor peel two cloves of garlic and add them 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.400
 very minced to the pan when the onion is poached. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:02:01.210
 Grate the tomatoes while Mila goes mixing the sauce 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.510
 and we pepper to taste in our case we have different tastes 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.689
 with the spicy but as this time it's my turn to throw the pepper I'll put less. 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.160
 We peel the tuna with great care and patience, removing all the skins and thorns that 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:33.469
 may have this spine I resisted but in the end 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:40.969
 I have been able to slice and crush perfectly the 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:49.719
 tuna and add it to the sofrito, 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.290
 it's a bit more laborious than opening a can but it's really worth it, 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.599
 the taste has nothing to do and is much healthier 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:13.249
 add the skimmed milk and stir in the fire to link all the flavors. 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:18.779
 Parallel in a pot with boiling water add a tablespoon of salt 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:23.370
 a drizzle of olive oil and the whole macaroni 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.739
 with a spoon we move them from time to time so that they do not stick and are done correctly, 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.620
 the ideal is to get the point al-dente and we take them out at that moment, 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.029
 to get that point al-dente you have to do them 2 minutes less than what the 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:51.589
 manufacturer but the best is to try one and when it is to our liking we take them out. 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:04:03.439
 We put them in the pan along with the sauce and let them be done two more minutes 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:17.870
 stirring them so that they link all the flavors 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:30.360
 Y 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.650
 here is the final result and the ingredients good profit and HEALTH FOR ALL.
