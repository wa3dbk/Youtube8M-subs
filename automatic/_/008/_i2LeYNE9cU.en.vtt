00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
many of these in Australia so I was I

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.430 
many of these in Australia so I was I
was<00:02:09.829> very<00:02:09.979> happy<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.580> both<00:02:11.120> occasions<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.870> get

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
was very happy on both occasions to get

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.350 
was very happy on both occasions to get
these<00:02:12.650> two

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.850 

just<00:02:18.360> been<00:02:18.480> thinking<00:02:18.510> about<00:02:18.870> what's

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
just been thinking about what's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.839 
just been thinking about what's
happening<00:02:20.370> with<00:02:20.400> these<00:02:22.370> prices<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.519> gold<00:02:23.730> and

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
happening with these prices in gold and

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.449 
happening with these prices in gold and
silver<00:02:24.209> just<00:02:24.450> seems<00:02:24.720> like<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:26.220> gold

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
silver just seems like the the gold

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.410 
silver just seems like the the gold
silver<00:02:26.760> ratio<00:02:27.150> keeps<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.810> up<00:02:28.069> I<00:02:29.069> think<00:02:29.730> at

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
silver ratio keeps going up I think at

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.839 
silver ratio keeps going up I think at
the<00:02:30.629> moment<00:02:31.109> it's<00:02:31.260> pushing<00:02:32.040> 66<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:35.640> you

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
the moment it's pushing 66 if you

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.490 
the moment it's pushing 66 if you
remember<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.329> one<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.540> my<00:02:36.659> past<00:02:36.840> videos<00:02:37.290> I've

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
remember in one of my past videos I've

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.130 
remember in one of my past videos I've
actually<00:02:37.799> done<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.159> swap<00:02:38.489> before<00:02:38.939> from<00:02:39.870> gold

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
actually done a swap before from gold

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.800 
actually done a swap before from gold
into<00:02:40.560> silver<00:02:40.859> swapped<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.760> swapped<00:02:42.659> a

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
into silver swapped I swapped a

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.039 
into silver swapped I swapped a
Krugerrand<00:02:43.349> for<00:02:43.650> 60<00:02:44.250> ounces<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.730> silver<00:02:45.049> back

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
Krugerrand for 60 ounces of silver back

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.580 
Krugerrand for 60 ounces of silver back
when<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.500> was<00:02:46.650> under<00:02:46.889> 60<00:02:47.720> now<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:48.930> gone<00:02:49.139> even

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
when it was under 60 now it's gone even

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.339 
when it was under 60 now it's gone even
higher<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:52.609> guess<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:55.019> something<00:02:55.230> to

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
higher so I guess it's just something to

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.940 
higher so I guess it's just something to
consider<00:02:55.470> really<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:57.139> of<00:02:58.139> light<00:02:58.379> of<00:02:58.620> I've

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
consider really and of light of I've

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.110 
consider really and of light of I've
thought<00:02:59.510> that<00:03:00.510> I'd<00:03:01.129> start<00:03:02.129> getting<00:03:02.909> more

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
thought that I'd start getting more

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.819 
thought that I'd start getting more
silver<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:05.250> light<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.790> new<00:03:06.750> ratio<00:03:07.319> that

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
silver in light of the new ratio that

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.449 
silver in light of the new ratio that
we've<00:03:07.980> been<00:03:08.159> seeing<00:03:09.019> but<00:03:10.019> then<00:03:10.200> at<00:03:10.920> times<00:03:11.250> I

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
we've been seeing but then at times I

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.199 
we've been seeing but then at times I
have<00:03:11.670> thought<00:03:11.879> about<00:03:12.269> just<00:03:13.230> going<00:03:14.030> more<00:03:15.030> into

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
have thought about just going more into

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.539 
have thought about just going more into
gold<00:03:16.970> simply<00:03:17.970> because<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.599> trend<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.230> that

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
gold simply because the trend is that

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.909 
gold simply because the trend is that
rising<00:03:20.549> gold<00:03:21.120> silver<00:03:21.449> ratio<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:24.620> I've<00:03:25.620> seen

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
rising gold silver ratio and I've seen

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.939 
rising gold silver ratio and I've seen
other<00:03:26.190> people's<00:03:26.579> videos<00:03:26.760> about<00:03:27.709> why<00:03:28.709> they

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
other people's videos about why they

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.479 
other people's videos about why they
prefer<00:03:29.160> gold<00:03:29.699> or<00:03:30.060> why<00:03:30.209> they<00:03:30.389> prefer<00:03:30.540> silver

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
prefer gold or why they prefer silver

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.360 
prefer gold or why they prefer silver
seems<00:03:32.489> like<00:03:33.650> seems<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.799> both<00:03:34.980> are<00:03:35.190> pretty

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
seems like seems like both are pretty

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.899 
seems like seems like both are pretty
good<00:03:35.579> it's<00:03:35.849> just<00:03:36.440> whether<00:03:37.440> or<00:03:37.769> not<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.430> want

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
good it's just whether or not you want

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.890 
good it's just whether or not you want
to<00:03:39.090> play<00:03:39.409> the<00:03:40.409> gold<00:03:40.680> silver<00:03:41.069> ratio<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.900> trade

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
to play the gold silver ratio and trade

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.240 
to play the gold silver ratio and trade
in<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.260> out<00:03:43.379> of<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.519> two<00:03:45.919> I'd<00:03:46.919> like<00:03:47.129> to

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
in and out of of the two I'd like to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.879 
in and out of of the two I'd like to
know<00:03:47.370> what<00:03:47.609> everyone's<00:03:47.970> thinking<00:03:48.889> especially

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
know what everyone's thinking especially

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.399 
know what everyone's thinking especially
in<00:03:50.340> light<00:03:50.549> of<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:51.000> current<00:03:51.209> gold<00:03:52.019> silver

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
in light of the current gold silver

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.520 
in light of the current gold silver
ratio<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:53.790> we<00:03:53.970> have<00:03:54.269> as<00:03:54.629> well<00:03:54.870> as<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.169> the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
ratio that we have as well as the the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.360 
ratio that we have as well as the the
current<00:03:55.829> trend<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.760> ratio<00:03:57.000> going<00:03:57.659> up<00:03:58.370> of

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
current trend in that ratio going up of

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.949 
current trend in that ratio going up of
course<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.120> favor<00:04:00.419> of<00:04:00.690> gold<00:04:02.150> so<00:04:03.150> that's<00:04:03.870> about

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
course in favor of gold so that's about

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.379 
course in favor of gold so that's about
