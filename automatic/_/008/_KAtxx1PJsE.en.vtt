should<00:03:59.510> always<00:03:59.719> use<00:03:59.930> oil<00:04:00.439> and<00:04:01.090> now<00:04:02.090> I'm<00:04:02.269> just

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
should always use oil and now I'm just

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.149 
should always use oil and now I'm just
scrunching<00:04:02.959> my<00:04:03.079> hair<00:04:03.379> because<00:04:03.680> some<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.010> my

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
scrunching my hair because some of my

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.860 
scrunching my hair because some of my
curls<00:04:04.430> aren't<00:04:04.669> as<00:04:04.879> curly<00:04:05.180> as<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.450> other<00:04:05.629> ones

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
curls aren't as curly as the other ones

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.140 
curls aren't as curly as the other ones
so<00:04:06.079> this<00:04:06.200> just<00:04:06.379> makes<00:04:06.620> me<00:04:06.769> look<00:04:06.980> more<00:04:07.159> even<00:04:07.340> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
so this just makes me look more even and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.689 
so this just makes me look more even and
if<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.389> need<00:04:08.569> any<00:04:08.780> more<00:04:08.989> gel<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:10.129> put<00:04:10.400> on<00:04:10.519> your

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
if you need any more gel to put on your

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.129 
if you need any more gel to put on your
hair<00:04:10.879> at<00:04:10.969> the<00:04:11.060> end<00:04:11.239> that'll<00:04:11.599> just<00:04:11.810> make<00:04:12.019> it

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
hair at the end that'll just make it

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.699 
hair at the end that'll just make it
look<00:04:12.260> even<00:04:12.439> better

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.020 

and<00:04:18.709> while<00:04:18.889> I'm<00:04:18.949> waiting<00:04:19.010> for<00:04:19.280> my<00:04:19.400> hair<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:19.880> dry

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
and while I'm waiting for my hair to dry

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.750 
and while I'm waiting for my hair to dry
I<00:04:20.120> usually<00:04:20.570> like<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.870> do<00:04:20.989> my<00:04:21.169> makeup<00:04:21.380> or<00:04:21.889> do

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
I usually like to do my makeup or do

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.400 
I usually like to do my makeup or do
whatever<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.449> then<00:04:23.630> by<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.020> time<00:04:24.080> I'm<00:04:24.380> done

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
whatever and then by the time I'm done

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.830 
whatever and then by the time I'm done
my<00:04:24.830> hair<00:04:25.040> is<00:04:25.130> usually<00:04:25.250> almost<00:04:25.550> dry<00:04:28.690> all<00:04:29.690> right

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
my hair is usually almost dry all right

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.900 
my hair is usually almost dry all right
