transfer cases use the same fluid as the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.729 
transfer cases use the same fluid as the
the<00:00:34.800> transmission<00:00:35.800> it's<00:00:36.399> these<00:00:37.090> it's<00:00:37.739> ATF

loose<00:01:00.210> nothing's<00:01:01.210> dripping<00:01:01.359> yet<00:01:01.719> because

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
loose nothing's dripping yet because

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.820 
loose nothing's dripping yet because
there's<00:01:04.089> some<00:01:04.239> silicone<00:01:04.750> holding<00:01:05.650> it<00:01:05.710> up

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
there's some silicone holding it up

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.789 
there's some silicone holding it up
there<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.220> make<00:01:06.700> sure<00:01:06.729> you<00:01:06.939> have<00:01:07.650> those<00:01:08.650> from

there so make sure you have those from

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.830 
there so make sure you have those from
cardboard<00:01:09.130> as<00:01:09.549> well<00:01:09.790> as<00:01:09.909> a<00:01:09.970> very<00:01:10.240> large<00:01:10.390> pan

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
cardboard as well as a very large pan

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.630 
cardboard as well as a very large pan
because<00:01:11.170> this<00:01:11.380> is<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.560> messy<00:01:11.830> job<00:01:12.130> which<00:01:12.520> is

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
because this is a messy job which is

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.620 
because this is a messy job which is
probably<00:01:12.850> why<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.000> lot<00:01:13.150> of<00:01:13.240> people<00:01:13.420> don't<00:01:13.510> want

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
probably why a lot of people don't want

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.050 
probably why a lot of people don't want
to<00:01:13.750> do<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:17.470> get<00:01:17.619> yourself<00:01:18.040> a<00:01:18.340> small

in just a second okay Billy I put some
good<00:01:45.070> sealant<00:01:45.549> on<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.850> last<00:01:46.030> time<00:01:46.299> take<00:01:46.509> a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
good sealant on that last time take a

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.310 
good sealant on that last time take a
little<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:48.119> take<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.149> few<00:01:49.390> bulbs<00:01:49.750> out<00:01:49.899> and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
little I take a few bulbs out and

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.139 
little I take a few bulbs out and
general<00:01:50.799> screwdriver<00:01:51.189> in<00:01:51.399> there<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:51.729> pop<00:01:52.000> it

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
general screwdriver in there and pop it

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:59.490 
general screwdriver in there and pop it
open<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.420> little<00:01:52.450> bit<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.909> drain

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.200 

and<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:00.710> slowly<00:02:01.010> start<00:02:01.370> taking<00:02:01.550> those<00:02:01.850> screws

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
and you slowly start taking those screws

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.410 
and you slowly start taking those screws
out<00:02:03.310> there<00:02:04.310> eight<00:02:04.460> millimeter<00:02:04.880> bolts<00:02:05.240> by<00:02:05.360> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
out there eight millimeter bolts by the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:14.500 
out there eight millimeter bolts by the
way<00:02:06.159> can<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.190> tiny<00:02:07.490> ones<00:02:08.979> okay<00:02:10.150> so<00:02:11.170> now<00:02:13.510> you

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
way can you tiny ones okay so now you

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.000 
way can you tiny ones okay so now you
probably<00:02:15.140> noticed<00:02:15.530> it's<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.740> bit<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
probably noticed it's a bit of a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.230 
probably noticed it's a bit of a
balancing<00:02:16.430> act<00:02:16.550> getting<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.030> off<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.420> there

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
balancing act getting that off of there

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.550 
balancing act getting that off of there
now<00:02:20.240> you've<00:02:20.480> got<00:02:20.690> basically<00:02:20.870> hold<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:21.410> up

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
now you've got basically hold that up

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.800 
now you've got basically hold that up
with<00:02:21.680> one<00:02:21.860> hand<00:02:22.070> we're<00:02:22.400> undoing<00:02:22.790> one<00:02:23.120> bolt<00:02:23.420> at

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
with one hand we're undoing one bolt at

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.220 
with one hand we're undoing one bolt at
the<00:02:23.959> very<00:02:24.170> end<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:25.569> hopefully<00:02:26.569> most<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.110> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
the very end and hopefully most of the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.250 
the very end and hopefully most of the
fluid<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.130> drained<00:02:28.340> out<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:29.140> kind<00:02:30.140> of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
fluid is drained out and just kind of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.780 
fluid is drained out and just kind of
flip<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.830> drain<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.190> rest<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.550> oil

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
flip it and drain the rest of the oil

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.910 
flip it and drain the rest of the oil
out<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.170> want<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.380> clean<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.590> out

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
out of it so you want to clean that out

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.120 
out of it so you want to clean that out
really<00:02:34.250> well<00:02:35.140> clean<00:02:36.140> off<00:02:36.320> all<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.590> gasket

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
really well clean off all the gasket

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.870 
really well clean off all the gasket
material<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:39.050> it's<00:02:39.170> nice<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.350> clean<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.100> dry

around the holes around the holes all
the<00:04:58.450> way<00:04:58.600> around<00:04:59.340> let<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.430> sit<00:05:00.640> for<00:05:00.669> about<00:05:01.440> 5-10

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
the way around let it sit for about 5-10

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.740 
the way around let it sit for about 5-10
minutes<00:05:02.470> then<00:05:02.979> put<00:05:03.160> it<00:05:03.250> on<00:05:03.310> there<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:04.539> go

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
minutes then put it on there and go

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.320 
minutes then put it on there and go
finger<00:05:05.050> tight<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:05.729> then<00:05:06.729> you<00:05:06.850> want<00:05:07.000> to<00:05:07.060> torque

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
finger tight and then you want to torque

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.870 
finger tight and then you want to torque
it<00:05:07.450> down<00:05:08.100> and<00:05:09.100> I<00:05:09.190> have<00:05:09.310> to<00:05:09.340> look<00:05:09.550> up<00:05:09.669> what

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
it down and I have to look up what

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.540 
it down and I have to look up what
torque<00:05:10.180> spec<00:05:10.419> is<00:05:10.740> so<00:05:11.740> I'll<00:05:11.950> post<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.310> up

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
torque spec is so I'll post that up

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.980 
torque spec is so I'll post that up
there<00:05:13.350> okay<00:05:14.350> I've<00:05:14.470> got<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:14.800> silicone<00:05:15.250> on<00:05:15.990> it

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
there okay I've got the silicone on it

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.300 
there okay I've got the silicone on it
about<00:05:17.229> five<00:05:17.380> minutes<00:05:17.560> or<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:17.860> I'm<00:05:17.979> going<00:05:18.250> to

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
about five minutes or so I'm going to

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.620 
about five minutes or so I'm going to
put

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
put

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.810 
put
and<00:05:20.630> I'm<00:05:20.810> going<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:20.960> finger<00:05:21.200> tighten<00:05:21.680> it<00:05:21.820> until

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
and I'm going to finger tighten it until

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.760 
and I'm going to finger tighten it until
it<00:05:23.510> just<00:05:23.570> starts<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:24.050> squeeze<00:05:24.260> out<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.530> little

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
it just starts to squeeze out a little

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.930 
it just starts to squeeze out a little
bit<00:05:24.950> and<00:05:25.220> I'm<00:05:26.150> going<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.300> wait<00:05:26.510> one<00:05:27.200> hour<00:05:27.940> and

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
bit and I'm going to wait one hour and

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.970 
bit and I'm going to wait one hour and
then<00:05:29.120> I'm<00:05:29.240> going<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:29.480> torque<00:05:29.780> it<00:05:29.930> to<00:05:30.140> eleven

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
then I'm going to torque it to eleven

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.760 
then I'm going to torque it to eleven
point<00:05:31.370> eight<00:05:31.580> Newton<00:05:32.450> meters<00:05:32.950> or<00:05:33.950> 105<00:05:34.790> inch

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
pounds not foot pounds but inch pounds

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.620 
pounds not foot pounds but inch pounds
then<00:05:42.380> they<00:05:42.590> with<00:05:43.550> this<00:05:43.730> ultra<00:05:44.030> black<00:05:44.240> they<00:05:44.420> say

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
then they with this ultra black they say

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.750 
then they with this ultra black they say
to<00:05:44.690> wait<00:05:44.930> 24<00:05:45.410> hours<00:05:45.440> before<00:05:45.740> you<00:05:46.250> fill<00:05:46.640> it<00:05:46.730> with

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
to wait 24 hours before you fill it with

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.700 
to wait 24 hours before you fill it with
fluids<00:05:47.380> I<00:05:48.380> have<00:05:48.980> not<00:05:49.280> done<00:05:49.550> that<00:05:49.610> before

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
fluids I have not done that before

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.580 
fluids I have not done that before
but<00:05:52.580> wait<00:05:52.970> as<00:05:53.120> long<00:05:53.300> as<00:05:53.420> you<00:05:53.510> can<00:05:53.720> to<00:05:54.440> put
