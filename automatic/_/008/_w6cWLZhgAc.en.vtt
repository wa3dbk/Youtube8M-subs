00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.449
 Questions we do 

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.220
 the endless helpless a question 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.319
 the red ones are the outrageous prices issues greens are the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.880
 harmless you can you maybe even see the nursery is it 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.879
 yes, especially with her forehand 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.189
 Walter Grath 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.359
 I did not have to 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.409
 Ramsey 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.089
 JPY 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.389
 they have their career end in the US only their Techtelmechtel with 

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:31.179
 Hollywood the ladder will owe 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.670
 percent 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.340
 so when I did in the office these leaders can not go otherwise 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.880
 I can not really say that 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.010
 No 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.920
 Norma one more question remains why hot water side effects are also difficult 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.680
 Best of all, before we enter the world, we must realize that agreements and will 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.680
 also rather casually he 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.050
 maybe they will even question you 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.830
 because they are the only ones prescribed for the book for fitness 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.739
 athletic type or the mustache 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.110
 maybe both so instead of otherwise I would not have been able to do the book 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.190
 So while I was doing the book together, I did a trainer cursor because I did 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.900
 I think I'm in sports muffle and also need motivation but that has me 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.120
 Finally, when did he see 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.040
 is a sports enthusiast and 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.170
 they are a picture that can go on 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.819
 Although each voice makes one if Helmut a Greens 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.830
 So far, the three girls are missing from the gas station 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 because of her so bad 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.700
 for Sunday still change 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.880
 No 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 with his last films it was in question after a short search earthquake 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.190
 expired 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.190
 Percent of revenue 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.990
 Well yes I already wanted to ask the question how do you do it that way 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.650
 to be disciplined after exhausting re sports 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.679
 Eyes closed and wet 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.849
 or do little tricks or sometimes just do not say today 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:14.989
 Not 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.239
 but I think regularity is important so even if you only have two 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.539
 times a week that one trains in this one 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:21.509
 Emma 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.259
 but I do that now Monday and Thursday that one says a dealer 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.689
 Eggler if you start to shit yourself then that's the beginning 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.829
 from the end if you are yourself and no one was there if I am 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.009
 promise says 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.129
 So tomorrow morning I'm not ready in time 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.350
 and do not do it 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.169
 yes, then 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.919
 All this is the point where you really have to say now I'm not doing it 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.400
 I've promised that I have to surrender because there is no reason at all 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:45.740
 it does not do anything to everyone 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.090
 I always say that because I myself am the parent of twelve children and teachers 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.549
 he will be there 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.559
 that is the last case of the cases 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:57.519
 Actually, shit yes, there's always I want to be in the game 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.799
 Bohrunfall is so happy when the exams are at the university 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.430
 there is no time where the apartment is so clean and tidy from the 11th 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.549
 after that should 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.610
 you have to do that in extended things but you make it special 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.620
 thoroughly discussed 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.400
 a true master in her notebook always so I do that for example if Lord 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.890
 Wendt year way the investigators that you no sense if you say you hang 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.819
 her mother Mandy the chancellor years ago 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.859
 After all, Maren Matthes Würzburg succeeds in playing good music on this 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.089
 I'll always say I'm just going to pay and when I get it 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:33.399
 I can find shit after ten minutes again 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:35.999
 and that's one way to get the pressure off the track a bit and I can do it 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.209
 Also, no sanction for the first time sports shoe to make extreme music a bit 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.779
 on normal window 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:45.119
 and again a little bit when I realize it's really not that 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:49.090
 is back after five minutes with her honestly I would be 1 80 percent 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:52.029
 if you start then you do what I think so 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:54.979
 so you can not kick your ass a bit yourself 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:59.779
 Percentage per year so outsmarting the shoes on context side 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.889
 Heller then put on stress with my blanket 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.119
 what in the manual Euro so André Erkau times 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:08.509
 You can spend a stop here around the 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.229
 Choose right music or something 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.919
 Not at all so they just won 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.219
 Just look at it the most when you start then you are already there 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:20.219
 So you do not think so too, everybody has such a certainty 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.069
 Small ambitious was when inside to find out how to live 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.460
 and that can become 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.270
 that was so Berger announcement no 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.669
 many thanks francs 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:33.569
