00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
lid switch here the contact that we show

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.300 
lid switch here the contact that we show
that<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.380> good<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.220> from<00:02:54.120> blue<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.630> yellow<00:02:54.660> its

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
that is good is from blue to yellow its

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.550 
that is good is from blue to yellow its
opening<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.400> closing<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.440> sending<00:02:58.440> the

opening and closing and sending the
power<00:02:59.209> but<00:03:00.209> there's<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.260> other<00:03:01.400> contact<00:03:02.400> in

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
power but there's the other contact in

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.050 
power but there's the other contact in
here<00:03:03.150> which<00:03:03.540> goes<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:05.370> timer<00:03:06.269> itself

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
here which goes to the timer itself

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.310 
here which goes to the timer itself
which<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.269> between<00:03:10.160> black<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.930> blue<00:03:12.930> which

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
which is between black and blue which

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.620 
which is between black and blue which
we're<00:03:13.590> not<00:03:13.769> getting<00:03:15.440> continuity<00:03:16.440> through<00:03:17.630> so

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
we're not getting continuity through so

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.060 
we're not getting continuity through so
we're<00:03:18.780> suspecting<00:03:19.380> at<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.650> point<00:03:19.920> that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
we're suspecting at this point that

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.490 
we're suspecting at this point that
we've<00:03:20.190> got<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> bad<00:03:20.730> lid<00:03:21.090> switch<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:22.290> what<00:03:22.380> we're

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
we've got a bad lid switch so what we're

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.960 
we've got a bad lid switch so what we're
going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.680> do<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:22.980> go<00:03:23.160> ahead<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.549> put<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> new

going to do is go ahead and put a new

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.720 
going to do is go ahead and put a new
lid<00:03:24.209> switch<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.470> see<00:03:26.370> where<00:03:26.549> we're<00:03:26.700> at

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
lid switch in and see where we're at

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.640 
lid switch in and see where we're at
with<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:27.989> what<00:03:28.109> you're<00:03:28.260> going<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.440> want<00:03:28.620> to

with it so what you're going to want to

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.349 
with it so what you're going to want to
do<00:03:28.769> is<00:03:28.890> just<00:03:29.040> sort<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.340> push<00:03:29.579> forward<00:03:30.060> on<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
do is just sort of push forward on the

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.560 
do is just sort of push forward on the
lid<00:03:30.540> switch<00:03:30.810> with<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.350> lid<00:03:31.560> up<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.329> just<00:03:33.329> pops

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
lid switch with the lid up and just pops

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.830 
lid switch with the lid up and just pops
out<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.959> its<00:03:34.109> position<00:03:34.320> there<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:36.269> just

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
out of its position there and just

00:03:36.840 --> 00:04:02.860 
out of its position there and just
remove<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.290> connector

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:30.020 

reconnect<00:04:03.870> your<00:04:03.990> harness<00:04:26.450> okay<00:04:28.370> okay<00:04:29.370> ah<00:04:29.520> so

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
we put the new lid switch in now what

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.450 
we put the new lid switch in now what
we're<00:04:33.300> going<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.630> do<00:04:34.050> is<00:04:34.290> just<00:04:34.530> just<00:04:35.010> test<00:04:35.280> it

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
we're going to do is just just test it

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.940 
we're going to do is just just test it
out<00:04:35.660> so<00:04:36.660> make<00:04:36.840> sure<00:04:36.870> you're<00:04:37.260> not<00:04:37.380> touching<00:04:37.650> any

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
out so make sure you're not touching any

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.180 
out so make sure you're not touching any
wires<00:04:38.280> or<00:04:38.580> anything<00:04:38.820> plug<00:04:39.480> it<00:04:39.600> back<00:04:39.630> in<00:04:40.190> and

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
wires or anything plug it back in and

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.600 
wires or anything plug it back in and
we're<00:04:41.760> just<00:04:41.850> going<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.090> go<00:04:42.240> ahead<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:43.580> turn<00:04:44.580> it

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
we're just going to go ahead and turn it

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.510 
we're just going to go ahead and turn it
to<00:04:44.820> like<00:04:45.000> an<00:04:45.150> agitation<00:04:45.630> setting<00:04:49.340> pull<00:04:50.340> the

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
to like an agitation setting pull the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.180 
to like an agitation setting pull the
timer<00:04:50.760> out

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.070 

and<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.790> is<00:04:54.940> agitating<00:04:57.630> when<00:04:58.630> you<00:04:58.720> open<00:04:58.990> the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
and it is agitating when you open the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.200 
and it is agitating when you open the
lid<00:04:59.110> it<00:04:59.410> stops

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.810 

now<00:05:06.210> we<00:05:06.270> are<00:05:06.690> going<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.020> check<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.410> spin

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
now we are going to check the spin

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.550 
now we are going to check the spin
because<00:05:08.820> there<00:05:09.120> is<00:05:09.240> multiple<00:05:09.480> contacts<00:05:10.320> on

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
because there is multiple contacts on

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.020 
because there is multiple contacts on
this<00:05:10.920> particular<00:05:11.610> lid<00:05:11.850> switch<00:05:13.550> not<00:05:14.550> all<00:05:14.790> lid

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
this particular lid switch not all lid

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.970 
this particular lid switch not all lid
switches<00:05:15.450> will<00:05:15.630> stop<00:05:15.870> agitation<00:05:16.680> when<00:05:16.860> the

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
switches will stop agitation when the

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:24.880 
switches will stop agitation when the
lid<00:05:17.130> is<00:05:17.160> up<00:05:22.070> this<00:05:23.070> is<00:05:23.310> bending<00:05:23.670> and<00:05:23.790> draining

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
lid is up this is bending and draining

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:35.230 
lid is up this is bending and draining
and<00:05:25.890> it's<00:05:26.310> stopping<00:05:26.610> when<00:05:27.120> we<00:05:27.330> open<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.720> lid

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.370 

okay<00:05:36.240> so<00:05:36.570> now<00:05:36.720> at<00:05:36.810> this<00:05:36.900> point<00:05:37.199> we're<00:05:37.350> just

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
okay so now at this point we're just

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.629 
okay so now at this point we're just
gonna<00:05:38.660> shut<00:05:39.660> it<00:05:39.690> off

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
gonna shut it off

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.900 
gonna shut it off
unplug<00:05:41.639> it<00:05:41.790> and<00:05:42.060> put<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:42.960> all<00:05:43.080> back<00:05:43.260> together

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
unplug it and put it all back together
