00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.560
 show them how to play super mario bros 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.820
 and old games like an emulator in a 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.570
 ipad ipod iphone with good grass what 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.970
 first we have to do 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.900
 Primarily is having installed the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.900
 jailbreak 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.280
 we can have the site 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.050
 why 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.200
 in the seconds it is 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.570
 come to cydia to see if well and go to 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.040
 Edit 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.079
 so what we have to do is 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.329
 begin to add these two sources that 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.329
 You can leave the inspection seriously 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:53.510
 point x 15 62 felix 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.600
 along with the next one on the campus 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.960
 to arrive we are all adding the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.960
 points 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.210
 you can play your primary bros 231 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.830
 let's see if we add the other source 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.659
 then I will leave you the subscription that is 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.820
 from ww 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.390
 point 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.390
 without full 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.280
 to soler 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.590
 it's the iphone and ipod puntocom balear 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.420
 campus 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.360
 this we are going to give him every day 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.700
 then in the different size could 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.759
 say of game packs 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.149
 so when we have added these 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:51.979
 two sources we are going to look for and 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.360
 we write we believe them and we get these 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.360
 here then we have to select the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.060
 last one is the crack that does not matter 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.890
 that you do not leave any sign of 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.720
 interrogation because it might be that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.460
 see that he receives a position at a rhythm but 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.050
 is that it is believed that we are going to 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.400
 install 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.400
 we wait for it to download 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.209
 Once downloaded, we wait for it to be 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.330
 install and let's go back decided let's 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.810
 see again backwards we will leave them 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.700
 we do not write rum in a space like 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.410
 arms are the packets that pack 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.880
 we have to play I have tried it the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.690
 first that works very well let's go 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.410
 to the first we give to install 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.410
 we hope they are downloaded 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.620
 when they have already downloaded what 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.560
 we have to do is wait for it 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.569
 install and we give to brasilia then 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.819
 we go out, decide 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.000
 and we're going to see in the second part that 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.960
 This is a tab of our ipad iphone 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.300
 ipod happen we got into that 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.880
 this is here these games are the ones that 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.700
 they come out having installed in this rum 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.410
 pack so let's die 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.480
 and as you can see we have entered the game 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.819
 we can go down we can not go down 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.390
 connect we continue 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.390
 day 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.390

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.390
 sorry 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.150

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.110

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.440
