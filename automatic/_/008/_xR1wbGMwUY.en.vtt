00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
interviewing and I think a lot of times

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.409 
interviewing and I think a lot of times
it's<00:05:32.990> gonna<00:05:33.140> draw<00:05:33.440> people<00:05:33.890> to<00:05:34.130> you<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:34.640> there's

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
it's gonna draw people to you so there's

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.000 
it's gonna draw people to you so there's
gonna<00:05:35.630> be<00:05:35.810> a<00:05:35.840> little<00:05:36.050> fear<00:05:36.290> in<00:05:36.320> that<00:05:36.590> but<00:05:36.860> just

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
gonna be a little fear in that but just

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.210 
gonna be a little fear in that but just
stay<00:05:37.310> confident<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.620> bring<00:05:39.620> that<00:05:39.860> through

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
stay confident and bring that through

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.130
