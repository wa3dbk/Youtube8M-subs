excellent<00:00:38.820> series<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.510> micro<00:00:40.489> just<00:00:41.489> really

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
excellent series of micro just really

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.330 
excellent series of micro just really
did<00:00:43.020> what<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.290> needed<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:43.770> when<00:00:43.980> he<00:00:44.070> needed

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
to do it excellent decision really I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.170 
to do it excellent decision really I
think<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.739> what's<00:00:47.010> key<00:00:47.399> whenever<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.969> see

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
think that's what's key whenever you see

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.479 
think that's what's key whenever you see
those<00:00:48.420> plays<00:00:48.809> he<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.739> has<00:00:50.160> very

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
those plays he just really has very

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.270 
those plays he just really has very
precise<00:00:51.149> gameplay<00:00:51.660> he<00:00:52.469> knows<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:52.860> notes<00:00:53.070> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
precise gameplay he knows what notes to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.000 
precise gameplay he knows what notes to
be<00:00:53.370> done<00:00:53.550> when<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.329> he<00:00:54.390> gets<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.719> done<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.860> map

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
be done when and he gets it done the map

be done when and he gets it done the map
is<00:00:56.039> Python<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.050> favorite<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
is Python I know it's a favorite of

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.650 
is Python I know it's a favorite of
class<00:00:58.800> arts<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.640> kind<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> ambivalent

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
class arts I'm kind of ambivalent

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389 
class arts I'm kind of ambivalent
towards<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.620> don't<00:01:01.739> feel<00:01:01.980> one<00:01:02.280> way

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
towards it I really don't feel one way

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.490 
towards it I really don't feel one way
or<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> other<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:03.359> does<00:01:03.539> make<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.989> decently

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
or the other it does make a decently

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.929 
or the other it does make a decently
interesting<00:01:04.920> maps<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.430> don't<00:01:05.640> feel<00:01:05.790> like

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
interesting maps but I don't feel like

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730 
interesting maps but I don't feel like
it<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.299> makes<00:01:06.600> interesting<00:01:06.990> maps<00:01:07.380> over

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it really makes interesting maps over

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
it really makes interesting maps over
any<00:01:07.920> other<00:01:08.159> maps<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.909> mean<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> definite<00:01:09.479> rule

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
any other maps I mean a definite rule

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.240 
any other maps I mean a definite rule
makes<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.110> interesting<00:01:10.560> maps<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.950> terran

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
makes more interesting maps the terran

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.820 
makes more interesting maps the terran
vs<00:01:11.490> terran<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.240> Monty<00:01:12.540> Hall<00:01:12.830> where

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
vs terran on say like Monty Hall where

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.950 
vs terran on say like Monty Hall where
you<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.540> protected<00:01:15.540> resources

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you have the protected resources

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.920 
you have the protected resources
basically<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.659> artifacts<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
basically because of artifacts on the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.490 
basically because of artifacts on the
map<00:01:19.340> this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.880> pretty<00:01:21.299> standard<00:01:21.659> one

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
map this is it's a pretty standard one

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.570 
map this is it's a pretty standard one
ramp<00:01:23.310> map<00:01:23.939> there's<00:01:24.750> obviously<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.950> other<00:01:26.369> two

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
ramp map there's obviously the other two

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.730 
ramp map there's obviously the other two
starting<00:01:26.909> positions<00:01:27.299> are<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> right

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

on<00:01:29.700> northern<00:01:30.479> part<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.179 
southern base just left any eight
o'clock<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.159> also<00:01:35.729> kind<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.780> two<00:01:37.049> o'clock<00:01:37.409> /

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
o'clock and also kind of two o'clock /

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.030 
o'clock and also kind of two o'clock /
you<00:01:38.549> know<00:01:38.640> 130<00:01:39.060> position<00:01:39.509> looks<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.590> both

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you know 130 position looks like both

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.969 
you know 130 position looks like both
are<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> standard<00:01:42.750> early<00:01:43.680> barrack

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
are going for a standard early barrack

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
are going for a standard early barrack
build<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.840> take<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> barrack<00:01:46.439> take

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
build and I just take the barrack take

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.200 
build and I just take the barrack take
the<00:01:46.770> gas<00:01:46.950> doesn't<00:01:47.369> look<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.729> either<00:01:47.880> one's

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the gas doesn't look like either one's

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.569 
the gas doesn't look like either one's
going<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.710> proxy<00:01:49.710> brush<00:01:49.799> again<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.340> looks

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
going for proxy brush again it looks

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.830 
going for proxy brush again it looks
like<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> standard<00:01:51.630> Terran

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
like it's going to be a standard Terran

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.100 
like it's going to be a standard Terran

there's<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.310> major<00:01:59.610> race

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
there's not going to be a major race

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.800 
there's not going to be a major race
advantage<00:02:00.390> with<00:02:00.600> terran<00:02:00.960> vs<00:02:01.500> everyone<00:02:02.130> else

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.760 
advantage with terran vs everyone else
stickley<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.200> think<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.500> something<00:02:04.649> like

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
stickley I think it's something like

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.150 
stickley I think it's something like
6040<00:02:05.549> there<00:02:06.450> Tara<00:02:06.930> me<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.170> come<00:02:07.439> out<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.740> top<00:02:07.920> I

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
6040 there Tara me on come out on top I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520 
6040 there Tara me on come out on top I
think<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:09.000> because<00:02:09.259> Python<00:02:10.259> more

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
think that's just because Python more

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
think that's just because Python more
than<00:02:10.649> other<00:02:10.800> maps<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:12.800> favors<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.130> Terran

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
than other maps really favors the Terran

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.370 
than other maps really favors the Terran
standard<00:02:15.000> ground<00:02:15.209> there's<00:02:15.599> lots<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.020> ridges

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
standard ground there's lots of ridges

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.150 
standard ground there's lots of ridges
for<00:02:16.709> GC<00:02:17.220> tank<00:02:17.489> place<00:02:17.730> maybe<00:02:17.970> there's<00:02:18.980> lots<00:02:19.980> of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
for GC tank place maybe there's lots of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.550 
for GC tank place maybe there's lots of
open<00:02:20.430> territory<00:02:20.700> middle<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:21.630> some<00:02:22.140> some

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
open territory middle for some some

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.680 
open territory middle for some some
terror<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.099> basically<00:02:23.940> Terran<00:02:24.209> can<00:02:24.360> create

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
terror so basically Terran can create

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.440 
terror so basically Terran can create
nice<00:02:25.250> long<00:02:26.250> holding<00:02:27.209> mines<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.110> siege<00:02:28.530> tanks

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
nice long holding mines the siege tanks

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.660 
nice long holding mines the siege tanks
and<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.750> create<00:02:30.930> some<00:02:31.400> territorial<00:02:32.400> control

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
and just create some territorial control

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.240 
and just create some territorial control
points<00:02:33.239> where<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:33.959> other<00:02:34.319> races<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.860> really

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
points where the other races just really

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.830 
points where the other races just really
don't<00:02:35.459> have<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.760> because<00:02:36.120> they<00:02:36.630> don't<00:02:36.780> have

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
don't have that because they don't have

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.150 
don't have that because they don't have
siege<00:02:37.200> tanks<00:02:38.360> looks<00:02:39.360> like<00:02:39.540> right<00:02:39.720> now<00:02:40.160> yeah

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
siege tanks looks like right now yeah

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.640

expansion it looks like also looks like

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.879 
expansion it looks like also looks like
we<00:03:45.450> got<00:03:45.600> mere<00:03:45.810> builds<00:03:46.139> thus<00:03:46.290> far<00:03:46.500> as<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.769> was

we got mere builds thus far as I was
also<00:03:47.160> going<00:03:47.310> for<00:03:47.609> that<00:03:47.700> second<00:03:47.970> expansion

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
also going for that second expansion

lomo<00:06:51.250> is<00:06:51.490> it<00:06:52.000> was<00:06:52.120> breaking<00:06:52.510> off<00:06:52.780> from<00:06:52.840> the

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
lomo is it was breaking off from the

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.810 
lomo is it was breaking off from the
mirror<00:06:53.500> image<00:06:53.680> he's<00:06:54.040> building<00:06:54.490> a<00:06:54.580> third

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
mirror image he's building a third

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.970 
mirror image he's building a third
expansion<00:06:55.180> going<00:06:56.170> third<00:06:56.440> early<00:06:56.680> expansion

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
expansion going third early expansion

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.330 
expansion going third early expansion
but<00:06:57.960> it<00:06:58.960> also<00:06:59.140> looks<00:06:59.440> like<00:06:59.650> Zelos<00:07:00.010> might<00:07:00.220> be

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
but it also looks like Zelos might be

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.370 
but it also looks like Zelos might be
doing<00:07:00.580> the<00:07:00.640> same<00:07:00.670> in<00:07:01.030> his<00:07:01.210> expansion<00:07:02.110> to<00:07:02.350> the

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
doing the same in his expansion to the

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.020 
doing the same in his expansion to the
right<00:07:02.970> but<00:07:03.970> i<00:07:04.000> can't<00:07:04.330> tell<00:07:04.570> us<00:07:04.750> or<00:07:04.870> not
