00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
online and this is a tutorial a really

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.240 
online and this is a tutorial a really
cool<00:00:11.730> turtle<00:00:12.000> actually<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.720> think<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:13.260> how<00:00:14.190> to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
cool turtle actually I think on how to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.890 
cool turtle actually I think on how to
get<00:00:14.639> easy<00:00:15.330> access<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:16.340> and<00:00:17.539> maverick<00:00:18.539> I

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
get easy access to and maverick I

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.130 
get easy access to and maverick I
believe<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.030> you're<00:00:21.270> stranded<00:00:21.660> it's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
believe it so if you're stranded it's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.930 
believe it so if you're stranded it's
really<00:00:22.380> good<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.620> those<00:00:22.790> situations<00:00:23.790> where

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940

really good in those situations where
you<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.360> need<00:00:24.510> an<00:00:24.660> escape<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:26.310> other

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you really need an escape and the other

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.480 
you really need an escape and the other
