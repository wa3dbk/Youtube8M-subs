there for 30 inches of grinding and
we're<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:14.010> ahead<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.430> turn<00:01:14.610> this

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
we're going to go ahead and turn this

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.580 
we're going to go ahead and turn this
unit<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:18.780> is

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.860 

traversing<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:26.330> it's<00:01:27.330> doing<00:01:27.690> this

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
traversing and it's doing this

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.430 
traversing and it's doing this
completely<00:01:28.640> automatically<00:01:29.930> at<00:01:30.930> least<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
completely automatically at least the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.890 
completely automatically at least the
back-and-forth<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.610> then<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.180> reset<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
back-and-forth and then I just reset the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:42.140 
back-and-forth and then I just reset the
depth<00:01:34.460> after<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.640> grinding<00:01:36.120> goes<00:01:36.300> down<00:01:41.150> real

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
depth after the grinding goes down real

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.220 
depth after the grinding goes down real
simple<00:01:42.690> operation<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:45.030> doesn't<00:01:45.450> take<00:01:45.660> much<00:01:45.960> I

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
simple operation it doesn't take much I

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.050 
simple operation it doesn't take much I
do<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.620> an<00:01:46.740> exhaust<00:01:47.130> fan<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.730> makes<00:01:47.910> too

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
do have an exhaust fan but it makes too

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.590 
do have an exhaust fan but it makes too
much<00:01:48.210> noise<00:01:48.270> they<00:01:48.900> turn<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.440> right<00:01:49.710> now

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.370 

and<00:01:54.590> here's<00:01:55.370> the<00:01:56.180> switch<00:01:58.659> watch<00:01:59.659> this<00:02:00.050> come<00:02:00.350> on

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
and here's the switch watch this come on

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:09.609 
and here's the switch watch this come on
down<00:02:00.800> now

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:18.770 

see<00:02:10.160> now<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:14.500> switches<00:02:15.500> motor<00:02:15.890> back

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.770 

then<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.770> motor<00:02:20.550> will<00:02:20.850> go<00:02:21.000> down<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.660> other

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
then the motor will go down to the other

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.830 
then the motor will go down to the other
end<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.790> will<00:02:23.910> pull<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.150> switch<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
end and it will pull the switch the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
end and it will pull the switch the
other<00:02:24.959> direction

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.830 

we're<00:02:33.860> doing<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.310> large<00:02:34.580> job<00:02:35.060> like<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:35.570> this

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
we're doing a large job like this this

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.990 
we're doing a large job like this this
has<00:02:36.020> been<00:02:36.200> great<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.890> allows<00:02:37.280> me<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.580> do<00:02:37.820> other

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
has been great it allows me to do other
