00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
possible because I

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.580 
possible because I
that<00:02:13.420> tends<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.720> be<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:13.990> best<00:02:14.140> thing<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.500> I've

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
the hardest game I've had to play I

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.870 
the hardest game I've had to play I
guess<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:47.440> guy<00:02:47.650> was<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.950> good<00:02:48.310> player<00:02:48.610> he

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
guess and this guy was a good player he

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.550 
guess and this guy was a good player he
knew<00:02:49.090> how<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.300> word<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.780> ball<00:02:49.990> and<00:02:50.230> he<00:02:50.320> gets<00:02:50.350> a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
knew how to word the ball and he gets a

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.290 
knew how to word the ball and he gets a
really<00:02:50.710> nice<00:02:50.950> well<00:02:51.190> worked<00:02:51.430> past<00:02:51.670> goal<00:02:52.060> there

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
really nice well worked past goal there

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.680 
really nice well worked past goal there
and<00:02:52.540> deserved<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.710> actually<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.160> do<00:02:54.520> think<00:02:54.850> he

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
and deserved it actually I do think he

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.330 
and deserved it actually I do think he
did<00:02:55.900> deserve<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.530> know<00:02:56.650> an<00:02:56.800> ultimate<00:02:57.190> team

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
did deserve it you know an ultimate team

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.830 
did deserve it you know an ultimate team
a<00:02:57.550> lot<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:57.880> time<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.420> get<00:02:58.570> goals

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
a lot of the time that you get goals

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.660 
a lot of the time that you get goals
that<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.200> probably<00:02:59.680> don't<00:03:00.070> deserve<00:03:00.190> but<00:03:00.490> this

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
that you probably don't deserve but this

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.030 
that you probably don't deserve but this
guy<00:03:00.850> he<00:03:01.480> deserved<00:03:01.870> definitely<00:03:02.380> for<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:02.770> and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
guy he deserved definitely for this and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.890 
guy he deserved definitely for this and
he<00:03:03.370> does<00:03:03.400> go<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.760> nil<00:03:04.240> up<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.600> that<00:03:04.720> was<00:03:04.870> a

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
he does go to nil up and that was a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.570 
he does go to nil up and that was a
great<00:03:05.080> little<00:03:05.350> back<00:03:05.590> he'll<00:03:05.830> pass<00:03:06.070> probably

using the RBA button but he had a sort
of<00:03:09.850> Spanish<00:03:10.270> team<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.890> he<00:03:11.890> was<00:03:12.070> silly<00:03:12.310> enough

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
of Spanish team and he was silly enough

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.340 
of Spanish team and he was silly enough
he<00:03:12.730> brought<00:03:13.000> me<00:03:13.180> down<00:03:13.330> inside<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.960> box<00:03:14.170> and

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
he brought me down inside the box and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.630 
he brought me down inside the box and
that<00:03:14.470> gave<00:03:14.650> me<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.860> nice<00:03:15.040> little<00:03:15.250> head<00:03:15.490> start

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
that gave me a nice little head start

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.850 
that gave me a nice little head start
but<00:03:16.030> there<00:03:16.600> was<00:03:16.690> no<00:03:16.840> doubt<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.320> was<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
but there was no doubt that this was the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.220 
but there was no doubt that this was the
hardest<00:03:18.070> game<00:03:18.430> i<00:03:18.850> have<00:03:18.880> played<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.510> if<00:03:20.110> it
