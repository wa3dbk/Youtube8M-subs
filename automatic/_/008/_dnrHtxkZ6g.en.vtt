00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.880
 more time has passed the day I am 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.640
 my first dinghy 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.769
 I had picked up the teddy message 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.269
 a disabled boy 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.020
 we had become real friends eight months 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.210
 is that you have a little freedom 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.430
 I managed to come and see him 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.990
 he wore some races 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.940
 he often told me about the first visit he had been made 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.940
 he imitates little things that he had been given 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.120
 I felt that these visits 3 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 was not enough to give him the morale of society 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.330
 it was necessary for teddy 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.800
 at nontron company 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.890
 which is most often 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.160
 his companion 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 hazard and place it on me 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.170
 for a whole population throws itself on the roads 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.440
 it's called the holidays 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.840
 and it does not suffer any hindrance 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 we sacrifice everything to the madness of departure 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.510
 or the road 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.940
 for 48 hours 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.450
 and let the torch pass 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.570
 so I had to the players my attache port 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.860
 waiting for the end of this exodus 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.900
 and to kill a little time 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.010
 it was going to walk in the countryside 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.100
 that's where I found 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.180
 it's a poor little crazy dog 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.860
 a slut that bastards 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 with sins a tree a fire girl 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.430
 relive history 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.300
 crowded cars 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.840
 and the little animal that had wanted at all costs 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.750
 maybe he too of the party 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.700
 it had been rejected once twice 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.770
 and then in front of his stubbornness 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.640
 we had given so much to abandon it 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.280
 loosely a few miles away 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.670
 for the first time that m 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.349
 he had struggled without twisting years in the movie 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.319
 at the point of his year deeply the points 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.239
 he described screaming 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.469
 one for all for 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.589
 those who eat lunch with forgetting 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:20.559
 lying on the side 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.559
 it was just a poor little ball of bloody hairs 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.019
 that's why I stay 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.939
 I was approaching the decline 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.239
 and slowly 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.039
 precautions 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.749
 I managed to deliver them from his property 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:38.619
 first she bit me said 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:42.009
 and then there are the chollima with gratitude 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:43.899
 bring it back to the trucks 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:47.159
 be treated my best 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.299
 seeing his little dog hobble on three legs 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.709
 that his company of yesterday is a cigar 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.359
 the click 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.309
 he was there the everyday companion 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:58.709
 every hour 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.059
 hurt like him 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.949
 lonely like him 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.829
 it would be enough then of misfortune 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.829
 and that's true 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.839
 as a radio-phone game 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:13.149
 balotelli father 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:14.999
 four were released 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:16.549
 to note that I know what 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.449
 he quotes a friend the road 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:19.809
 listen to cities 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.669
 I will come to see tomorrow 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.589
 no no i can not say it's a surprise 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:27.959
 good evening teddy 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.679
 In the evening 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:32.199
 I will make a general call to friends 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.419
 finally hung three or four 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.359
 want to explain the earth 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.059
 he promised me all to be 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.989
 castanet little bit of trouble on the table 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.989
 I knocked in my nature 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:49.579
 the next day for the most beautiful 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.579
 they have since dropped more than expected 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.429
 he had managed in the night 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:57.639
 to do something for the post 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.749
 spanc who had built a niche 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.299
 with boards 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.269
 another collared mistress 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.779
 and a drop to celebrate ten 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.089
 mighty but not your faith their walk 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.199
 when he walks 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.429
 so called roulette wheels 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.499
 because he drives a refrigerator truck of an industrial deli 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.569
 are you going the reach of the meat 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:18.719
 for a whole menagerie 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.029
 when we pushed the door of the little house 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.029
 I believed for a moment that dedicated the wishes of his bed these markets 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:26.400
 he passed hands 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.639
 we sat him in his chair 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.249
 and we put by his faith 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:33.249
 on these films the filmmaker 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.689
 tight against his heart 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.550
 they put their tears of joy 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.499
 I saw right away that it was won 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:44.710
 and it would stick well both 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.979
 we do not have these famous days 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.809
 and when it was necessary to leave 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:52.610
 even the pen that will soon release the steering wheel 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.960
 we really had 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.139
 the impression of being seven years old 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.939
 for the first time 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:00.580
 but if we remembered 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.300
 a few kilometers more 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.509
 first we did not hear anything 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.740
 by listening well 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.909
 we collected non-contributory 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.830
 which are mingled with big sobs of children 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.819
 this summer 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.249
 he told us 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.460
 thanks to you guys 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.990
 you have been great 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.469
 you gave me 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.740
 the greatest joy of my life 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.740
 even if the doctor walked 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.349
 to not dare to stand out 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.889
 to equip yourself 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.449
 without knowing how to apply 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.529
 we will take it 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:44.439
 a stroke of old
