writing that came off as a surprise
grant<00:02:05.810> morrison<00:02:06.140> could<00:02:06.290> even<00:02:06.410> bother<00:02:06.620> doing

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
grant morrison could even bother doing

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.279 
grant morrison could even bother doing
the<00:02:06.920> writing<00:02:07.100> for<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.400> one<00:02:07.780> now<00:02:08.780> he's<00:02:09.019> given

his<00:02:09.409> creative<00:02:10.399> partner<00:02:10.819> an<00:02:11.060> opportunity<00:02:11.870> I

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
his creative partner an opportunity I

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.890 
his creative partner an opportunity I
guess<00:02:12.769> that<00:02:12.920> explains<00:02:13.040> why<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:14.150> storyline<00:02:14.659> is

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
guess that explains why the storyline is

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.670 
guess that explains why the storyline is
all<00:02:15.470> about<00:02:16.010> Japan<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.239> it<00:02:18.230> seems<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.530> this

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
all about Japan and it seems that this

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.619 
all about Japan and it seems that this
storyline<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.370> going<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.610> have<00:02:19.730> no<00:02:20.000> impact<00:02:20.390> on

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
storyline is going to have no impact on

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.490 
storyline is going to have no impact on
the<00:02:20.810> conclusion<00:02:21.350> no<00:02:21.620> none<00:02:22.550> whatsoever<00:02:22.580> I

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the conclusion no none whatsoever I

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.350 
the conclusion no none whatsoever I
don't<00:02:24.500> know<00:02:24.560> if<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.740> like<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.220> or<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.460> find

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
don't know if I like it or I find

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.560 
don't know if I like it or I find
even<00:02:26.960> more<00:02:27.830> annoying<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:29.060> in<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.450> beginning

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
even more annoying that in the beginning

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.780 
even more annoying that in the beginning
and<00:02:30.050> at<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.140> end<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:30.770> kind<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.130> have<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.340> sort

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
and at the end they kind of have a sort

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.610 
and at the end they kind of have a sort
of<00:02:31.880> knowledge<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.110> fact<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.410> they're

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
of knowledge that the fact that they're

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.050 
of knowledge that the fact that they're
doing<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.160> interlude<00:02:34.550> it's<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:34.940> know

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
