00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.799
 that comes the cheers 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.119
 Sharif broke 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.779
 bigger at heights 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.300
 on the condition of already a few percent possibly very much taken 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.949
 we offer this draws 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.650
 Roder watch outright for money setters 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 so gives me from the FC St 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.830
 but everyone can do that 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.900
 to survive the situation 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.250
 among the people 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.330
 set afterwards 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
 Ulrich Thielemann 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.820
 Kawasumi power from the election on the bike went completely right 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.110
 Tuesday 7th 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.110
 Often, here are looking to loosen the trailer 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760
 also break again warning 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.119
 MBM was there to do that 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.379
 Kamal El Amrani 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.839
 Put Flori 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.349
 by Ingmar Otto 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.349
 his father grew up the weapon in Germany 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.239
 the number of beats 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.239
 to run for a minute 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:56.879
 In many places everything out again 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.879
 He reminded that is still a lot 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.879
 he just gets full again 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.879
 clearly visible with a camera 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.000
 Calgary Flames work there on the Martian surface 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.609
 underline that 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.069
 right now it looks like this 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.059
 it may well have been good for Kamal El Amrani here 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:42.739
 and thus 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.129
 the super league games first Â«superstarÂ» 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.940
 because it is this Kamal El Amrani class as he did that he fixed 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:55.569
 he has used his technician the good boxer ITGI class footwork and 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.260
 Of course the titles never come back well 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.879
 the shooter Gundis who has had the difficult seconds he has good 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.299
 then survived the 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.349
 tactical route through the box to the end and held in front of everyone 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.239
 Things against you as I said 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.689
 very very strong very seldom can one be moved by what he is doing and 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.439
 how he does it 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.289
 in the truest sense of the word hand and foot and on it 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.509
 pop singer 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.509
 what has boxing places to a very special degree 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:24.590
 so 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.800
 Rezes kick again which must have their weaknesses 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.610
 og of boxing then with her good farsighted 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.090
 whitewash 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.080
 that is not the case of everything 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.620
 Fact is also in New Jersey here is where everyone in the team practicing splurge 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.370
 the judgment 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.580
 Hugo myth 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.979
 the margins clearly 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.460
 unanimously one 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.460
 "But you can relieve him from them 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.839
 give polite applause for Jon 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.240
 ee the first 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.370
 definitely 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.879
 a superstar 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:13.619
 a bit embarrassing
