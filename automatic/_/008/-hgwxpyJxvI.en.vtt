make it last all day and also be a
softer<00:00:16.080> smoother<00:00:16.500> finish<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.190> think<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:17.850> tend

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
softer smoother finish I think we tend

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.560 
softer smoother finish I think we tend
to<00:00:18.740> throw<00:00:19.740> our<00:00:20.039> hair<00:00:20.250> up<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.760> put<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
to throw our hair up and put all the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.500 
to throw our hair up and put all the
curls<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.350> then<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.560> think<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:23.510> hold

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
curls in and then we think about hold

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.380 
curls in and then we think about hold
and<00:00:25.160> keeping<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> shiny<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.699> smooth<00:00:27.090> at<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and keeping it shiny and smooth at the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.599 
and keeping it shiny and smooth at the
end<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.439> better<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.830> kind<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.070> build<00:00:29.400> up

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
