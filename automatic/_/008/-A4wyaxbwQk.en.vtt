00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
what is the pressure flip first of all

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.060 
what is the pressure flip first of all
freshman<00:00:09.870> flips<00:00:10.080> aren't<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> most<00:00:10.590> commonly

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.249 
freshman flips aren't the most commonly
known<00:00:11.250> tricks<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.880> we<00:00:12.630> put<00:00:12.960> think<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
known tricks and we put think it's a

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.049 
known tricks and we put think it's a
kickflip<00:00:13.590> with<00:00:13.740> your<00:00:13.860> back<00:00:13.980> finger<00:00:14.190> but<00:00:14.549> it's

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
kickflip with your back finger but it's

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.540 
kickflip with your back finger but it's
actually<00:00:15.480> an<00:00:15.599> inward<00:00:16.049> heel<00:00:16.230> flip<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:17.520> your

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
actually an inward heel flip with your

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.840 
actually an inward heel flip with your
back<00:00:17.880> finger<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.080> it'd<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.350> like<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.850> it's

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
back finger so it'd be like this it's

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.170 
back finger so it'd be like this it's
looking<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.880> you<00:00:23.880> don't<00:00:24.000> really

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
looking like that and you don't really

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.939 
looking like that and you don't really
need<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.630> know<00:00:24.660> any<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> tricks<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:25.890> a

need to know any of the tricks for a

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.349 
need to know any of the tricks for a
pressure<00:00:26.189> flip<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:27.000> beginner

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
pressure flip so it's a really beginner

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.150 
pressure flip so it's a really beginner
trick<00:00:27.660> there's<00:00:28.260> no<00:00:28.380> tricks<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.800> really<00:00:28.980> need

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
trick there's no tricks you really need

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.099 
trick there's no tricks you really need
to<00:00:29.250> know<00:00:29.460> or<00:00:29.730> master<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.449> order<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.900> able<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
to know or master in order to be able to

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.380 
to know or master in order to be able to
do<00:00:31.289> pressure<00:00:31.529> flips<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.460> advisable<00:00:32.910> if<00:00:33.300> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
do pressure flips it's advisable if you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
do pressure flips it's advisable if you
have<00:00:33.540> shove<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.140> down<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.610> really

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
have shove it's down but it's not really

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.900 
have shove it's down but it's not really
a<00:00:35.969> necessity<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.860> pressure<00:00:38.070> flip<00:00:38.430> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
a necessity because the pressure flip it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.479 
a necessity because the pressure flip it
has<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> little<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.629> more<00:00:40.190> there's<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.280> little

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
has a little bit more there's a little

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.400 
has a little bit more there's a little
more<00:00:41.640> play<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.360> because<00:00:42.750> when<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.200> pop

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
more play to it because when you do pop

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.260 
more play to it because when you do pop
shove-its<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.040> shoveling<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
shove-its it's shoveling but if you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.790 
shove-its it's shoveling but if you
don't<00:00:45.420> conscious<00:00:45.780> lips<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.140> also<00:00:46.289> flipping

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
don't conscious lips it's also flipping

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.279 
don't conscious lips it's also flipping
so<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.730> could<00:00:47.940> pop<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.390> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.719> harder

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
so you could pop it a little bit harder

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.869 
so you could pop it a little bit harder
and<00:00:49.410> there's<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.710> little<00:00:49.920> more<00:00:50.070> leeway<00:00:50.280> in

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
and there's a little more leeway in

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
and there's a little more leeway in
pressure<00:00:51.239> previously<00:00:51.750> okay<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.350> standard

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
pressure previously okay you standard

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.439 
pressure previously okay you standard
Ollie<00:00:52.980> position<00:00:53.250> would<00:00:53.760> be<00:00:53.789> right<00:00:54.090> behind<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
Ollie position would be right behind the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
Ollie position would be right behind the
front<00:00:54.660> bolts<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.110> right<00:00:55.289> over<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> tail

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
front bolts and right over that tail

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.029 
front bolts and right over that tail
like<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:57.180> ollie

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
like that for ollie

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.290 
like that for ollie
senator<00:00:59.039> shove<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.370> position<00:00:59.520> or<00:00:59.969> see<00:01:00.120> about

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
senator shove it position or see about

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.020 
senator shove it position or see about
the<00:01:00.420> same<00:01:00.680> but<00:01:01.680> for<00:01:02.309> practical<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.879> it's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the same but for practical up it's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.219 
the same but for practical up it's
almost<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> same<00:01:03.480> thing<00:01:03.780> except<00:01:04.080> it's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
almost the same thing except it's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.710 
almost the same thing except it's
something<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.739> little<00:01:05.010> bit<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.720> you're

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
something in a little bit and you're

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.149 
something in a little bit and you're
only<00:01:06.869> doing<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.530> could<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.920> your

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
only doing this so you could have your

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.030 
only doing this so you could have your
back<00:01:08.369> finger<00:01:08.610> curl<00:01:09.030> over<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.140> tail<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
back finger curl over the tail like that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.210 
back finger curl over the tail like that
it<00:01:12.000> has<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.420> curl<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.010> pop

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it has to be curl because when you pop

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940 
it has to be curl because when you pop
it's<00:01:14.520> gonna<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.820> straight<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:16.229> go<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.650> that

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it's gonna be straight and go like that

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.460 
it's gonna be straight and go like that
it's<00:01:17.729> good<00:01:20.450> first<00:01:21.450> step<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.930> passion<00:01:22.320> flip

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
it's good first step for a passion flip

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.840 
it's good first step for a passion flip
you<00:01:22.590> wanna<00:01:22.740> ride<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> get

you wanna ride up and you want to get

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.249 
you wanna ride up and you want to get
your<00:01:23.970> fingers<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.540> bow<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:24.900> your<00:01:25.020> finger

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
your fingers in the bow for your finger

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.219 
your fingers in the bow for your finger
positioning<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.200> where<00:01:28.200> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
positioning just like that and where I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.310 
positioning just like that and where I
up<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.159> wanna<00:01:29.310> pop<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.869> crucial<00:01:31.110> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
up you wanna pop and it's crucial that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.899 
up you wanna pop and it's crucial that
your<00:01:31.590> fingers<00:01:31.890> kind<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.220> curl<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.640> straight

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
your fingers kind of curl them straight

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
your fingers kind of curl them straight
because<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> was<00:01:34.020> flat<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:35.009> would<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.280> end

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
because if it was flat it would just end

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.880 
because if it was flat it would just end
up<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.270> flood<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.530> straight

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
up here with the flood if it's straight

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.090 
up here with the flood if it's straight
it'll<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.670> down<00:01:38.850> like

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
it'll just go down like

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.250 
it'll just go down like
flip<00:01:41.100> perfectly<00:01:41.690> now<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:45.120> to<00:01:45.420> you

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
flip perfectly now you it's up to you

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.930 
flip perfectly now you it's up to you
know<00:01:46.380> each<00:01:46.530> person<00:01:47.010> it<00:01:47.310> has<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.670> apply<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
know each person it has to apply a

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.130 
know each person it has to apply a
different<00:01:48.210> amount<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.600> force<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.080> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
different amount of force for the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.720 
different amount of force for the
pressure<00:01:49.350> flip<00:01:49.620> because<00:01:49.950> certain<00:01:50.700> people

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
pressure flip because certain people

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.180 
pressure flip because certain people
have<00:01:51.210> stronger<00:01:51.960> fingers<00:01:52.260> and<00:01:52.770> some<00:01:52.920> people

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
have stronger fingers and some people

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.820 
have stronger fingers and some people
just<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:53.940> more<00:01:54.210> control<00:01:54.600> than<00:01:54.750> others<00:01:55.110> so

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
just have more control than others so

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.410 
just have more control than others so
there's<00:01:56.040> no<00:01:56.130> specific<00:01:56.310> set<00:01:56.880> amount<00:01:57.120> but<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
there's no specific set amount but you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.080 
there's no specific set amount but you
can<00:01:57.600> press<00:01:58.560> your<00:01:58.590> foot<00:01:58.800> foot<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.580> personally

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
can press your foot foot but personally

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.670 
can press your foot foot but personally
I<00:02:00.120> use<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.900> little<00:02:01.140> bit<00:02:01.260> more<00:02:01.410> pressure

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
I use just a little bit more pressure

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.760 
I use just a little bit more pressure
than<00:02:02.160> I<00:02:02.220> would<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> shove<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.290> but<00:02:04.290> not<00:02:04.560> too

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
than I would with a shove it but not too

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.770 
than I would with a shove it but not too
much<00:02:04.800> like<00:02:05.460> Holly<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.330> would<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.600> way<00:02:06.750> too

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
much like Holly that would be way too

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.770 
much like Holly that would be way too
much<00:02:07.050> pressure<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.130> just<00:02:08.340> kind<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.780> gently

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
much pressure you just kind of gently

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.670 
much pressure you just kind of gently
click<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.340> makes<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.000> flip<00:02:12.870> around<00:02:13.170> just

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
click so it makes that flip around just

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.150 
click so it makes that flip around just
like<00:02:13.800> that

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.400 

at<00:02:18.030> first<00:02:18.420> you'll<00:02:18.660> find<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.290> pressure

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
at first you'll find that the pressure

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.370 
at first you'll find that the pressure
flip<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> lot<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.580> luck<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:21.300> lot<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.930> luck<00:02:22.080> is

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
flip is a lot of luck a lot of luck is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.650 
flip is a lot of luck a lot of luck is
involved<00:02:22.740> but<00:02:23.040> once<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.120> get<00:02:24.300> used<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
involved but once you just get used to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.660 
involved but once you just get used to
it<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.080> get<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.620> much<00:02:25.860> copy<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.460> PUD

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
it you get you so much copy of the PUD

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.480 
it you get you so much copy of the PUD
you<00:02:27.420> get<00:02:27.600> used<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.980> exactly<00:02:28.980> where<00:02:29.340> your

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
you get used to exactly where your

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.250 
you get used to exactly where your
finger<00:02:29.760> should<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:30.060> every<00:02:30.270> time<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:31.050> should

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
finger should be every time you should

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.550 
finger should be every time you should
be<00:02:31.380> getting<00:02:31.500> pressure<00:02:31.830> for<00:02:32.130> something<00:02:32.490> I

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
be getting pressure for something I

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.480 
be getting pressure for something I
would<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.770> say<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> most<00:02:35.370> common

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
would have to say that the most common

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.580 
would have to say that the most common
bottle<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.150> pressure<00:02:36.420> flips<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.900> misjudgment

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
bottle of pressure flips is misjudgment

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.590 
bottle of pressure flips is misjudgment
you<00:02:38.280> don't<00:02:38.700> put<00:02:38.850> your<00:02:38.910> fingers<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.450> right

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
you don't put your fingers in the right

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.110 
you don't put your fingers in the right
place<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.770> put<00:02:41.280> your<00:02:41.430> back<00:02:41.580> finger<00:02:41.790> too

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
place like you put your back finger too

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.000 
place like you put your back finger too
much<00:02:42.330> on<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.690> square<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.170> tail<00:02:43.380> not<00:02:43.830> on

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
much on the square of the tail not on

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.280 
much on the square of the tail not on
the<00:02:44.130> edge<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.580> much<00:02:44.820> like<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.780> little<00:02:46.110> dip

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the edge so much like in this little dip

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.940 
the edge so much like in this little dip
here<00:02:46.970> another<00:02:47.970> common<00:02:48.360> problem<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.950> you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
here another common problem is you

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.980 
here another common problem is you
putting<00:02:50.310> too<00:02:50.460> much<00:02:50.580> pop<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.480> put<00:02:51.810> too<00:02:51.900> much

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
putting too much pop and put too much

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.920 
putting too much pop and put too much
pop<00:02:52.310> like<00:02:53.310> double<00:02:53.700> flip<00:02:53.940> like<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.330> that's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
pop like double flip like that that's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.410 
pop like double flip like that that's
kind<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.230> weird<00:02:55.980> lucky<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:57.030> not<00:02:57.090> gonna<00:02:57.300> be

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
kind of weird lucky it's not gonna be

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.060 
kind of weird lucky it's not gonna be
much<00:02:57.540> higher<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.230> put<00:02:58.290> more<00:02:58.560> pop<00:02:58.800> in<00:02:58.980> it

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
much higher if you put more pop in it

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.550 
much higher if you put more pop in it
but<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.060> pressure<00:03:00.750> flip<00:03:01.020> is<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.200> very<00:03:01.350> gentle

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
but the pressure flip is a very gentle

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.880 
but the pressure flip is a very gentle
trick<00:03:02.720> once<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.810> get<00:03:03.960> pressure<00:03:04.200> cuffs<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.710> you

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
trick once you get pressure cuffs on you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.340 
trick once you get pressure cuffs on you
can<00:03:05.010> try<00:03:05.160> different<00:03:05.310> variations<00:03:05.490> like<00:03:06.350> 360

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
can try different variations like 360

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.510 
can try different variations like 360
pressure<00:03:07.590> flips<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.920> can<00:03:11.100> also<00:03:11.280> try

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
pressure flips and you can also try

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.010 
pressure flips and you can also try
pressure<00:03:11.910> flips<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.330> two<00:03:12.450> different<00:03:12.570> types<00:03:12.870> of

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
pressure flips in two different types of

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:23.280 
pressure flips in two different types of
manuals<00:03:14.960> or<00:03:15.960> you<00:03:16.020> can<00:03:16.170> try<00:03:16.320> them<00:03:16.440> down<00:03:16.620> get

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290
