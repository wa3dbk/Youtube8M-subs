00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the other retro ones they've been coming

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.190 
the other retro ones they've been coming
out<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.370> recently<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.719> other<00:00:36.840> ones<00:00:37.050> have

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
out with recently the other ones have

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.690 
out with recently the other ones have
much<00:00:37.469> stiffer<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.370> grain<00:00:38.550> leather<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.379> I

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
much stiffer of a grain leather and I

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.290 
much stiffer of a grain leather and I
think<00:00:41.700> these<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.120> more

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
think these are a little more

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.790 
think these are a little more
comfortable<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.140> honest<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.649> these

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
comfortable to be honest with you these

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.420 
comfortable to be honest with you these
don't<00:00:44.070> quite<00:00:44.370> meet<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.500> band<00:00:46.500> One<00:00:46.829> standards

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
don't quite meet the band One standards

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.770 
don't quite meet the band One standards
but<00:00:47.730> they're<00:00:48.000> definitely<00:00:48.149> an<00:00:48.510> improvement

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
but they're definitely an improvement

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.229 
but they're definitely an improvement
from<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.559> Jordan<00:00:50.399> ones<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.879> we've<00:00:51.000> seen

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
from the Jordan ones that we've seen
