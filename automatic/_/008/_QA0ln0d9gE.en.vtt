00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.670
 saba all the boys and welcome 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.679
 today to this new video I am 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.509
 always the coasts 90 100 the video game that 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.849
 you are seeing right now is the 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.080
 metal gear rising greve gens while 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.580
 there I was wondering if they didn't have 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.169
 could make a more intricate title than 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.150
 This maybe a little longer 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.710
 some other word in little middle 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.899
 perfect so you never know anymore 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.160
 managed to pronounce it took this off 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.020
 this today I am here even now 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.550
 propose this video thanks also to 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.469
 halifax halifax who it is first 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.850
 maybe some will hear this word 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.690
 maybe they have already heard it I don't know 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.879
 what it is 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.350
 halifax distributor of some of the 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.010
 video games that come out here precisely in 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.050
 Italy 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.940
 among these there is precisely metal gear rising 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.320
 it is just houses that I go out to do this 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.260
 gameplay so it seems appropriate 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.210
 also remind you that to make up cuts 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.859
 a facebook page if it had nothing 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.480
 to do in the next few minutes let us a 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.340
 jump and if you liked but you can 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.780
 put a like since they succeed 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.430
 maybe even some news related to 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.540
 games like the ones that are about to come out 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.460
 as turn right 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.140
 in short it is a page where protected is a 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.490
 bit of everything but in short the link in 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.380
 description I think the eyes there 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.930
 you have it, so I think you can 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.090
 to look at alone is therefore said 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.159
 this from the facebook page of halifax 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.780
 italy now we can focus on 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.650
 metal gear rising metal gear rising is 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.079
 come out of little here is a game that or yes 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.020
 love or hate well surely maybe here 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.600
 let's say let's say the novelty 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.250
 they see metal gear rising a little like a 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.110
 total involvement of what for 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.030
 their metals has however also to be said that 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.070
 this is a spin off and acting as 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.770
 spin off very little to do 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.189
 in quotes with the gameplay that you 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.920
 had in the metals succeeded over the years 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.110
 earlier here is this upset 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.790
 maybe the plans pay a little bit 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.619
 the idea and ask people they had of 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.610
 metal gear but honestly I like it 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.409
 so 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.610
 this video game that I like because 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.399
 because I am a person who plays 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.229
 even games like darksiders devil may 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.610
 cry these short action games 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.890
 in which 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.240
 at the base of everything there is a sequence of 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.120
 combo sets of parades to chain these together 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.280
 I like playing a lot here 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.960
 see it transposed in a metal way 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.210
 copper that there is a lot here and above all 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.460
 knowing that just a spin off of 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.500
 front I know I have a little game maybe 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.420
 different from the usual always linked to 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.670
 what the history of metal gear but 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.780
 a complete gaming experience 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.090
 new and here for example taken as an example 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.530
 here for example you are seeing a boss 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.650
 forwarded to the beginning one of the first in the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.000
 video game and it's moments like these 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.430
 that you case a lot with the game is 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.780
 very pretty here we say that maybe 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.400
 compared to the demo I don't know why I have 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.010
 had the impression that graphically if 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.200
 it was better but then it will be 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.580
 a personal impression on me anyway 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.810
 especially like these bosses a lot 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.880
 which give you great gratification 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.700
 this this ping here 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.430
 rather the name as you can see e 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.940
 we like little ones like that 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.290
 however cazzutissime in ryder 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.520
 we will be able to defeat or better 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.500
 watch the video maybe later 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.560
 end I die and make terrible files 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.900
 however these are those situations in 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.700
 referred to in the network game houses because you 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.290
 with your sword and you will go out to 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.450
 face an enemy like this then 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.280
 in the course of the video game like everyone 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.959
 what action games are present 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.280
 there are numerous bosses of facts 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.350
 I think that finally there will also be 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.769
 an opportunity to return a little to do 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.269
 some videos on secular boss no and others 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.350
 moments like these in this video game 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.400
 make me in my opinion make you render me 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.989
 make it clear that we say more 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.370
 simply how spectacular the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.319
 game 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.390
 often when we saw and played with 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.459
 example while the 4 we were ryden 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.560
 appear suddenly and make 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.110
 hallucinating things we can finally do 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.659
 do us too 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.650
 maybe now I talked about ryder one of the 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.840
 characters that I really like 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.940
 precisely of metals and why I a little in 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.799
 Heretical way I started playing 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.450
 at 2 when one is small , I have one 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.819
 played but without understanding anything of facts 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.440
 but nobody played later instead 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.909
 played in the 2nd most thorough manner is 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.739
 the first character I met 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.739
 of metals and it was ride and then me 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.239
 I'm fond of it but it's a pleasure 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.160
 however precisely 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.840
 the only flaw point that is connected 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.360
 were to the raid story and 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.360
 fact that I would have liked this 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.800
 videogame set after 2 capendo 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.889
 because rai becomes a 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.120
 cazzutissimo cyborg sure ok when I have it 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.550
 I saw a lot of cyborgs 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.350
 then I thought it was 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.060
 parliament and killed destroyed minced 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.970
 so maybe had to fall back on a 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.669
 synthetic body to survive instead 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.510
 anyway why why diet you 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.370
 you know why I do n't know yet 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.840
 unfolded bent every night not sleeping 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.490
 every time anyway when I think about it 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.830
 I ask why and would have liked it 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.200
 that this spin off spin off was not 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.479
 after 4 but sooner or better after 2 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.310
 before 4 then to understand why rai 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.690
 well become a side this is one 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.940
 question that everyone makes is that nobody 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.760
 has an answer but moving forward 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.020
 still talking about the game almost now 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.150
 another one of those sequences that me 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.950
 they really like these action games 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.320
 perhaps make their own fortune in 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.090
 these moments because in the cost of 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.560
 I objectively play the games on these 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.620
 games are monotonous games and devil may 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.300
 cry games a darksider take a sword but 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.570
 knows that all ends of the story 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.070
 but what allows you to continue 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.229
 play a game like this or better yes 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.360
 it gives the stimulus of playing more and more 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.490
 what else are these sequences? 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.289
 these cinematic sequences or 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.970
 as you saw the first repayments challenge 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.770
 bosses are always a new challenge because 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.210
 because each time they will be different each 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.889
 once there will be a boss that we will have to 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.870
 had to face a certain way 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.340
 of the different combos will have 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.050
 completely different attitudes e 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.940
 especially going forward in the 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.800
 facing the boss is not known for which 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.240
 reason the more we hurt him the more 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.219
 we are in crisis almost when 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.289
 never paid becomes stronger and stronger 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:54.620
 practically when i each bag at a 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.840
 centimeter better 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.430
 mm of life that we do not put mm anyway 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.410
 a spit of life suddenly 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.330
 they become immortal they kill you the facts 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.820
 in these games I often don't know about you 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.570
 when I count bosses 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.250
 then little and then you die that is the only one 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.110
 when will he take over the 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.610
 finest ray and then get off the ball that 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.020
 he goes down from the balcony to say I don't jump 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.820
 because that is, in the stairs go to 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.199
 gather control in the garden that 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.940
 maybe the dog took it buried by 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.290
 some part therefore with this image 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.580
 probably my memory every time 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.110
 not to do it 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.030
 anyway guys then this video 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.919
 in short, this is metal 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.380
 gear rising raven james a title 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.240
 very aggressive were many 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.570
 r I really like me press 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.240
 pronounced damn platinum games that 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.830
 you have created a title like this but 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.630
 I think there is nothing else to add 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.570
 for this occasion coming soon 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.280
 I'll come back with this game because if you are 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.870
 metal gear fans can't help but 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.729
 maybe you won't play metal gear 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.430
 as you know it but it is still 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.850
 re metals and therefore you will like it at least 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.940
 I hope 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.979
 and now seeing that we are at the end of 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.810
 this video I ask you as usual 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.550
 guess your account 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.289
 current no no this I can't yet 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.060
 but if he were so kind I accept it 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:06.979
 I gladly ask you for your pressures 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.539
 on this title for whoever it was 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.710
 passionate about the saga
