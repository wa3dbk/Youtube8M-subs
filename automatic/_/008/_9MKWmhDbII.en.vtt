00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 in 18 there are more for Siri 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.270
 I would like to add commands in this video 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.270
 show which are that 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.880
 siri will be a new one at 18 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.680
 gain scope of functions 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.760
 including, for example, the following 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.939
 hey simi the figure is in it right now 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.939
 Berlin 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:48.300
 so we can see new orders 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:51.210
 So I get with the hey simi too 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.410
 I can virtually thank you I can quasi 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.420
 re request this with me 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.449
 to give an inquiry that is only possible 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.910
 if siri to the power connection 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.970
 will have connected the loads the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.670
 Other cool is then the following 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.670
 jury what's the name of the season 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.010
 I think so anyway 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.880
 so you see now that siri too 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.200
 directly recognizes what you have for music 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.400
 and of course you can now too 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:43.930
 Buy directly and say hey simi buy 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:49.149
 Of course, this song is not 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:52.200
 Also new is the following desiree other 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.200
 a facebook status 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.240
 So I can almost by siri on 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.520
 facebook post something new as well 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.000
 counts this feature among the innovations 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.000
 The light switched off at Siri 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.190
 so and you see so I have now stop 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.630
 here home kia is not connected 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.530
 not even that we have to first 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.980
 be developed 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.870
 but see that it is already integrated here 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.480
 that is you are also the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.540
 can then tell the light from theory 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.440
 and then she does not matter and that 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.690
 I think that's pretty cool 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.850
 those are things that I had on me 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.440
 the philips if i maybe the in 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.110
 future times get somewhere if 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.750
 I really cool but also other 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.030
 Things could be done with it 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.070
 thermostats or all sorts though 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.000
 are the temperature or the light color 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.800
 change depending on 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.230
 you can still see everything like that 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.180
 can do that and I really like that 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.340
 very 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.180
 also it is possible tweets quasi 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.610
 by watching 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.410
 Generally it is so in English is a lot 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.900
 possible and much more can be used indoors 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.040
 then, for example, you do bills 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.200
 You can ask about certain times 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.360
 Can in English after the cinema directly 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.780
 ask it much much more than 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.090
 here 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.160
 that's a pity in general 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.799
 I think it's very cool with what 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.350
 siri can do and she is advised too 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:33.030
 unlike google a bit 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.829
 Extensive I do not know if yourself 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.900
 google was updated to 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.989
 Nevertheless, for example you can do it in 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.090
 see another video 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.600
 not possible with google so much 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.740
 do 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.100
 I also find her calling 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.940
 he answered a lot from the language 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.160
 much nicer and friendlier and this one 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.810
 Features are great but of course you have to 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.580
 say it's funny then with his 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.980
 Talking on the phone it is probably that 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.600
 biggest problem in america less 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.750
 problems here in germany is one 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.410
 The video has massive massive physical 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.080
 like 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.730
 I think it's great, too 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.730
 features to pay
