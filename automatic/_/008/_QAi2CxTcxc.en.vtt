00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.639 
are pretty soon we're going from 38 39 I
mean<00:01:55.149> 39<00:01:55.479> just<00:01:55.689> another<00:01:55.840> past<00:01:56.109> I<00:01:56.289> know<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.469> can

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
mean 39 just another past I know I can

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.779

get<00:01:56.740> through<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:56.950> just<00:01:57.039> a<00:01:57.189> little<00:01:57.250> bit<00:01:57.369> shorter

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
get through it just a little bit shorter

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.380 
get through it just a little bit shorter
41<00:01:58.750> it's<00:01:59.079> a<00:01:59.200> big<00:01:59.380> step<00:01:59.649> but<00:02:00.159> that's<00:02:00.969> going<00:02:01.329> to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
41 it's a big step but that's going to

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.080 
41 it's a big step but that's going to
be<00:02:01.450> strong<00:02:01.780> gonna<00:02:02.140> be<00:02:02.259> patient<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:03.090> load

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
be strong gonna be patient and load

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.809 
be strong gonna be patient and load
behind<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.509> boat<00:02:04.659> but<00:02:05.319> big<00:02:06.099> things<00:02:06.340> patience

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819

behind the boat but big things patience
and<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:06.969> parent<00:02:07.240> lettuce<00:02:07.450> he'd<00:02:07.599> come<00:02:07.780> around

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
and the parent lettuce he'd come around

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.610 
and the parent lettuce he'd come around
being<00:02:09.069> strong<00:02:09.340> in<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.640> last<00:02:09.789> it's<00:02:10.629> less<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:11.349> was

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
being strong in the last it's less I was

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.900 
being strong in the last it's less I was
working<00:02:11.829> on<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> gate<00:02:12.129> try<00:02:12.579> and<00:02:12.670> nail<00:02:12.790> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
gate just right going down the middle

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.440 
gate just right going down the middle
and<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:15.519> said<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.790> felt<00:02:16.030> really<00:02:16.150> good<00:02:16.299> with

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
and this said I felt really good with

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.420 
and this said I felt really good with
that<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.709> you're<00:02:17.860> sitting<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.310> water

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
that so you're sitting in the water

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.050 
that so you're sitting in the water
you've<00:02:19.060> run<00:02:19.329> your<00:02:19.590> 38:41<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:21.040> what<00:02:21.940> are<00:02:22.000> you

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
you've run your 38:41 and what are you

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.729 
you've run your 38:41 and what are you
thinking<00:02:22.090> about<00:02:22.360> coming<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:22.900> at<00:02:22.989> 43<00:02:23.440> well<00:02:23.709> I

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
thinking about coming in at 43 well I

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.229 
thinking about coming in at 43 well I
sit<00:02:24.129> down<00:02:24.220> at<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.400> water<00:02:24.579> I'm<00:02:24.730> looking<00:02:25.030> back<00:02:25.180> I

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
sit down at the water I'm looking back I

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.550 
sit down at the water I'm looking back I
knew<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.569> had<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> little<00:02:25.930> bit<00:02:26.049> tailwind<00:02:26.410> at<00:02:26.470> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
knew I had a little bit tailwind at the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.930 
knew I had a little bit tailwind at the
41<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.280> was<00:02:27.400> looking<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:27.640> see<00:02:27.730> where<00:02:27.849> that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
41 so I was looking to see where that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.729 
41 so I was looking to see where that
was<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.450> first<00:02:28.720> round<00:02:29.019> I<00:02:29.260> had<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> bit<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.680> a

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
was the first round I had a bit of a

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.280 
was the first round I had a bit of a
headwind<00:02:30.069> at<00:02:30.370> 43<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.599> I<00:02:31.660> got<00:02:31.780> sucked<00:02:31.989> into<00:02:32.200> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
headwind at 43 and I got sucked into the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.650 
headwind at 43 and I got sucked into the
gate<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.709> was<00:02:32.829> narrow<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:34.120> one<00:02:34.299> I<00:02:34.359> felt<00:02:34.569> the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
gate it was narrow this one I felt the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.880 
gate it was narrow this one I felt the
same<00:02:34.840> thing<00:02:35.049> so<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.200> was<00:02:35.290> looking<00:02:35.500> back<00:02:35.530> and

same thing so I was looking back and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.339 
same thing so I was looking back and
made<00:02:36.010> sure<00:02:36.040> state-wide<00:02:36.609> gate<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.299> got<00:02:38.109> sucked

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
made sure state-wide gate and got sucked

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.750 
made sure state-wide gate and got sucked
in<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.530> little<00:02:38.769> bit<00:02:38.920> had<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.220> work<00:02:39.340> my<00:02:39.489> way<00:02:39.579> back
