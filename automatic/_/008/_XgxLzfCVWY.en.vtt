there<00:03:51.049> I<00:03:51.229> just<00:03:51.799> need<00:03:52.389> making<00:03:53.389> about<00:03:54.370> two

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
there I just need making about two

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.449 
there I just need making about two
millimeters<00:03:55.609> each<00:03:56.060> side<00:03:56.650> bigger<00:03:57.650> just<00:03:58.069> to

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
millimeters each side bigger just to

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.140 
millimeters each side bigger just to
make<00:03:59.389> room<00:03:59.629> for<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:01.040> new<00:04:01.189> larger<00:04:01.699> thermal

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
make room for the new larger thermal

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.270 
make room for the new larger thermal
fuse<00:04:02.419> the<00:04:02.720> seaweed<00:04:03.049> fuse<00:04:03.349> is<00:04:03.530> now<00:04:03.709> larger

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
fuse the seaweed fuse is now larger

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.020 
fuse the seaweed fuse is now larger
because<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:06.530> has<00:04:06.859> a<00:04:07.099> great<00:04:07.340> set<00:04:07.669> of<00:04:07.699> thermal

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
because it has a great set of thermal

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.530 
because it has a great set of thermal
cutoff<00:04:08.530> suffered<00:04:09.530> around<00:04:10.239> 240<00:04:11.239> degrees

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540
