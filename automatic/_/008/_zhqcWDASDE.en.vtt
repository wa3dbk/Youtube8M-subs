00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.440
 Welcome to Modest Taste Cuisine 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.480
 in this section we will share a traditional purÃ©e recipe 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.200
 "Spinach Puree" 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.480
 but let's take a look at the list of materials before 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.200
 1 small mean spinach (about half a kilo) 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.480
 1 tbsp butter 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.760
 1 tablespoon flour 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720
 1 glass of water Milk 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 and 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.920
 After the list of ingredients, chopping spinach ... 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.160
 we can proceed to the production of mash 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.640
 After we wash our spinach, 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.680
 with stems, very finely chopped 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 yes we chopped all the spinach 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.200
 we are now transferring to the pot 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.280
 we don't add anything on 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.320
 we cover the door, with its own mite in a very low fire ... 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.720
 we cook until soft 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.960
 the spinach was placed in a low fire for 20 minutes ... 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.160
 as you see it shrunk 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.440
 to cook almost, to cook a little more 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 We're now cooked for a short while. 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.520
 move to other operations 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.400
 Our pot; 1 tablespoon of butter ... 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.920
 We added 1 tablespoon flour 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 Now we're roasting, it will be easier when it gets a little warm 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.320
 butter began to melt, let's add some salt 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.560
 and 1 - 2 minutes. 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.320
 very nice roasted, the smell of flour went 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.080
 now we add our cold milk on 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.400
 cooking up 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.880
 we obtained a mixture of bechamel sauce with a slightly thicker consistency 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.200
 Let's take it for a while now, put the spinach we cooked 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.320
 and pour the mixture we prepared on 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.360
 now we are confusing with a simple hand clair 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.200
 We can now boil for 1-2 minutes 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.760
 Spinach mashed ready 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.880

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.960
 We have prepared "Spinach Puree" 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.720
