hey guys I just wanted to make this

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.650 
hey guys I just wanted to make this
really<00:00:07.560> quick<00:00:07.830> video<00:00:08.099> my<00:00:08.849> playstation<00:00:09.300> today

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
really quick video my playstation today

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.350 
really quick video my playstation today
stopped<00:00:10.260> working<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.910> started<00:00:11.910> blinking<00:00:12.059> red

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
stopped working and started blinking red

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.140 
stopped working and started blinking red
and<00:00:13.009> I<00:00:14.009> didn't<00:00:14.340> really<00:00:14.519> know<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.759> what<00:00:15.089> that

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
and I didn't really know that what that

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.630 
and I didn't really know that what that
was<00:00:15.599> until<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.139> went<00:00:16.289> online<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.890> checked<00:00:17.490> it

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
was until I went online and checked it

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.090 
was until I went online and checked it
and<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:18.060> figured<00:00:18.539> out<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:19.500> generally<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and I figured out it's generally a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.359 
and I figured out it's generally a
malfunction<00:00:20.960> warning<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.859> not<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.250> other

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
malfunction warning it's not the other

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.340 
malfunction warning it's not the other
light<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.760> death<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.539> there's<00:00:24.900> something

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
light of death but there's something

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.290 
light of death but there's something
wrong<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:25.800> your<00:00:25.980> machine<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.609> generally

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
wrong with your machine and generally

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.980 
wrong with your machine and generally
one<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.630> these<00:00:27.810> things<00:00:28.140> would<00:00:28.619> probably<00:00:28.680> bleed

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
one of these things would probably bleed

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.590 
one of these things would probably bleed
overheating<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.460> watched<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> tutorial

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
overheating so I watched the tutorial

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.709 
overheating so I watched the tutorial
online<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.790> completely<00:00:35.790> disassemble<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
online and completely disassemble the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.900 
online and completely disassemble the
entire<00:00:37.730> PlayStation<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:40.610> came<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.760> these

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
entire PlayStation and came to these

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.200 
entire PlayStation and came to these
guys<00:00:42.239> which<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.140> CPU<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> GPU<00:00:44.210> which

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
guys which is the CPU and the GPU which

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.200 
guys which is the CPU and the GPU which
had<00:00:45.450> thermal<00:00:46.020> cream<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.850> I've<00:00:47.850> taken

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
had thermal cream on it and I've taken

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.520 
had thermal cream on it and I've taken
that<00:00:48.390> off<00:00:48.719> using<00:00:49.200> some<00:00:49.800> spirits<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.110> went

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that off using some spirits and I went

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.080 
that off using some spirits and I went
to<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> Radio<00:00:53.250> Shack<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.910> our<00:00:54.059> case

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
to a Radio Shack or in our case

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.229 
to a Radio Shack or in our case
technique<00:00:54.930> magazine<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.910> got<00:00:56.910> some<00:00:57.120> new

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
technique magazine and got some new

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.529 
technique magazine and got some new
thermal<00:00:57.629> paste<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.879> saw<00:00:59.879> something<00:01:00.329> very

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
thermal paste and I saw something very

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.959 
thermal paste and I saw something very
interesting<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.469> thermal<00:01:01.829> paste<00:01:02.160> package

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
interesting on the thermal paste package

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.789 
interesting on the thermal paste package
and<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.280> has<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:06.799> durability

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and that is that this has a durability

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.740 
and that is that this has a durability
of<00:01:07.830> about<00:01:08.220> eight<00:01:08.460> years<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
of about eight years which is

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.109 
of about eight years which is
interesting<00:01:10.229> because<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.130> PlayStation<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
interesting because the PlayStation is

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.149 
interesting because the PlayStation is
about<00:01:12.689> eight<00:01:12.930> years<00:01:13.140> old<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
about eight years old this is like the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.120 
about eight years old this is like the
first<00:01:14.930> version<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.439> PlayStation<00:01:16.619> 3

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
first version of the PlayStation 3

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.289 
first version of the PlayStation 3
released<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.790> Europe<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.270> a

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
released in Europe and so if you have a

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.899 
released in Europe and so if you have a
PlayStation<00:01:21.900> 3<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.229> first<00:01:22.619> edition<00:01:23.369> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
PlayStation 3 the first edition that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.950 
PlayStation 3 the first edition that
came<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.810> November<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.380> 2007<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.960> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
came out in November of 2007 and it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.499 
came out in November of 2007 and it
stopped<00:01:28.290> working<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.850> probably<00:01:29.850> need<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
stopped working you probably need to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.710 
stopped working you probably need to
change<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:31.710> thermal<00:01:32.159> paste<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:33.210> doesn't

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
change your thermal paste it doesn't

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.690 
change your thermal paste it doesn't
mean<00:01:33.810> your<00:01:33.960> PlayStation<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.590> broken<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.490> your

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
mean your PlayStation is broken but your

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.390 
mean your PlayStation is broken but your
thermal<00:01:36.030> paste<00:01:36.210> needs<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.840> replaced<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.950> go

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
thermal paste needs to be replaced so go

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.789 
thermal paste needs to be replaced so go
to<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.759> Radio<00:01:39.090> Shack<00:01:39.360> or<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:40.229> technique

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
to your Radio Shack or to your technique

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.330 
to your Radio Shack or to your technique
magazine<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.600> get<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:42.750> new<00:01:42.869> thermal<00:01:43.140> paste

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
magazine and get some new thermal paste

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.920

on<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> tutorial<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.210> by<00:01:48.210> Rob<00:01:48.689> Paulo<00:01:49.439> who<00:01:50.189> goes

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
on a tutorial of by Rob Paulo who goes

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.950 
on a tutorial of by Rob Paulo who goes
very<00:01:50.939> thoroughly<00:01:51.299> through<00:01:51.630> how<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
very thoroughly through how to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.710 
very thoroughly through how to
disassemble<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:53.070> thing<00:01:53.479> he's<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.659> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
disassemble this thing he's going to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
disassemble this thing he's going to
show<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.930> how<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.079> disassemble<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.369> 40-gig

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
show you how to disassemble the 40-gig

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.880 
show you how to disassemble the 40-gig
but<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.750> pretty<00:01:58.049> much<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> same<00:01:58.500> thing

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
but it's pretty much the same thing

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.139 
but it's pretty much the same thing
you've<00:01:59.040> got<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> few<00:01:59.369> extra<00:01:59.520> confidence<00:02:00.060> that

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
you've got a few extra confidence that

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.670 
you've got a few extra confidence that
you<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> screw<00:02:00.750> out<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> few<00:02:01.200> extra<00:02:01.229> screws

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you have to screw out a few extra screws

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.499 
you have to screw out a few extra screws
here<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.250> some<00:02:02.490> very<00:02:03.030> subtle

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
here and there and some very subtle

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.420 
here and there and some very subtle
differences<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> general<00:02:05.159> idea<00:02:05.189> is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
differences but the general idea is

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.789 
differences but the general idea is
still<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> same<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.689> I'm<00:02:07.320> going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.590> try<00:02:07.740> this

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
still the same so I'm going to try this

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.529 
still the same so I'm going to try this
and

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
and

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.729 
and
I'm<00:02:08.569> going<00:02:08.689> to<00:02:08.780> give<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:08.929> an<00:02:09.019> update<00:02:09.140> if<00:02:09.469> it

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
I'm going to give you an update if it

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.199 
I'm going to give you an update if it
works<00:02:09.950> or<00:02:10.189> not<00:02:12.280> ok<00:02:13.280> let's<00:02:13.579> see<00:02:13.909> how<00:02:14.030> this

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
works or not ok let's see how this

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.349 
works or not ok let's see how this
worked<00:02:16.510> now<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.629> course<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:18.049> replacing<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
worked now of course just replacing the

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.899 
worked now of course just replacing the
thermal<00:02:20.359> paste<00:02:20.569> will<00:02:21.379> not<00:02:21.530> be<00:02:21.680> enough<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.400> make

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
thermal paste will not be enough to make

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.940 
thermal paste will not be enough to make
your<00:02:23.180> PlayStation<00:02:23.780> work<00:02:24.019> again<00:02:24.349> I<00:02:24.530> actually

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
your PlayStation work again I actually

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.890 
your PlayStation work again I actually
had<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.310> do<00:02:25.459> this<00:02:25.579> twice<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.269> first<00:02:26.420> time<00:02:26.720> I

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
had to do this twice the first time I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.500 
had to do this twice the first time I
did<00:02:27.379> do<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.950> warming<00:02:28.400> up<00:02:28.549> of<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.060> motherboard

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
did do the warming up of the motherboard

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.479 
did do the warming up of the motherboard
but<00:02:29.659> I<00:02:29.720> didn't<00:02:30.109> do<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.349> enough<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.189> see<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
but I didn't do it enough you see the

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.580 
but I didn't do it enough you see the
thing<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:32.689> actually<00:02:32.840> have<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.260> heat<00:02:33.560> up

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
thing is you actually have to heat up

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.860 
thing is you actually have to heat up
your<00:02:33.739> motherboard<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.090> point<00:02:35.359> where

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
your motherboard to the point where

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.619 
your motherboard to the point where
actually<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.409> soldering<00:02:36.799> zhh<00:02:37.359> slightly<00:02:38.359> melt

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
actually the soldering zhh slightly melt

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.780 
actually the soldering zhh slightly melt
so<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.349> fix<00:02:39.650> up<00:02:39.799> all<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.040> connections<00:02:40.430> this

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
so you fix up all the connections this

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.559 
so you fix up all the connections this
seems<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.180> bit<00:02:41.329> dangerous<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.549> probably<00:02:43.849> if

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
seems a bit dangerous and it probably if

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.960 
seems a bit dangerous and it probably if
you<00:02:44.780> go<00:02:45.139> too<00:02:45.200> hard<00:02:45.709> on<00:02:45.829> it<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.099> might<00:02:46.370> be<00:02:46.430> too

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
you go too hard on it it might be too

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.289 
you go too hard on it it might be too
dangerous<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.659> it's<00:02:48.139> actually<00:02:48.709> quite<00:02:49.299> weird

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
dangerous but it's actually quite weird

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.619 
dangerous but it's actually quite weird
how<00:02:50.659> warm<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.439> have<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.739> get<00:02:51.919> this<00:02:52.159> up<00:02:52.629> now

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
how warm you have to get this up now

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.979 
how warm you have to get this up now
what<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.810> did<00:02:54.139> was<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:55.549> go<00:02:55.579> in<00:02:55.909> and<00:02:56.150> change<00:02:56.840> the

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
what I did was to go in and change the

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.050 
what I did was to go in and change the
thermal<00:02:57.500> paste<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.980> I've<00:02:58.129> warmed<00:02:58.489> up<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
thermal paste and I've warmed up the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.349 
thermal paste and I've warmed up the
motherboard<00:02:59.510> with<00:02:59.689> a<00:02:59.720> heat<00:02:59.959> gun<00:03:00.169> and

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
motherboard with a heat gun and

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.080 
motherboard with a heat gun and
apparently<00:03:02.359> I<00:03:02.480> was<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.810> bit<00:03:03.079> too<00:03:04.549> about

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
apparently I was a bit too about

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.690 
apparently I was a bit too about
it<00:03:05.329> so<00:03:05.689> it<00:03:06.049> wasn't<00:03:06.379> really<00:03:06.859> that<00:03:06.889> hot<00:03:07.159> and<00:03:07.340> it

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
it so it wasn't really that hot and it

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.240 
it so it wasn't really that hot and it
didn't<00:03:07.879> really<00:03:08.060> help<00:03:08.709> but<00:03:09.709> instead<00:03:10.129> of

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
didn't really help but instead of

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.460 
didn't really help but instead of
opening<00:03:10.579> up<00:03:10.700> again<00:03:10.849> I<00:03:11.120> used<00:03:11.480> another<00:03:11.720> tutorial

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
opening up again I used another tutorial

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.399 
opening up again I used another tutorial
of<00:03:12.889> somebody<00:03:13.250> who'd<00:03:13.430> done<00:03:13.669> a<00:03:13.699> quick<00:03:13.909> fix<00:03:14.409> just

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
of somebody who'd done a quick fix just

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.890 
of somebody who'd done a quick fix just
using<00:03:15.829> a<00:03:16.129> normal<00:03:16.459> hair<00:03:16.790> dryer<00:03:17.030> in<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.540> vents

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
using a normal hair dryer in the vents

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.830 
using a normal hair dryer in the vents
of<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.079> PlayStation<00:03:18.680> for<00:03:18.949> 15<00:03:19.340> minutes<00:03:19.669> and<00:03:19.879> I

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
of the PlayStation for 15 minutes and I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.110 
of the PlayStation for 15 minutes and I
did<00:03:21.019> this<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:22.340> PlayStation<00:03:22.790> turned

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
did this the PlayStation turned

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.800 
did this the PlayStation turned
extremely<00:03:23.750> hot<00:03:24.970> which<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.090> thought<00:03:26.419> like<00:03:26.659> this

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
extremely hot which I thought like this

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.420 
extremely hot which I thought like this
is<00:03:26.870> going<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.109> ruin<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.379> but<00:03:27.590> still<00:03:27.859> and<00:03:28.099> gotta

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
is going to ruin it but still and gotta

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.619 
is going to ruin it but still and gotta
give<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:28.669> a<00:03:28.699> try<00:03:28.849> because<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.209> haven't<00:03:29.449> gotten

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
give it a try because I haven't gotten

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.080 
give it a try because I haven't gotten
to<00:03:29.750> work<00:03:29.900> yet<00:03:30.139> and<00:03:30.260> lo<00:03:31.129> and<00:03:31.280> behold<00:03:31.370> now<00:03:31.940> it

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
to work yet and lo and behold now it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.240 
to work yet and lo and behold now it
works<00:03:32.269> in<00:03:33.019> other<00:03:33.229> words<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:33.799> don't<00:03:34.069> need<00:03:34.220> a

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
works in other words you don't need a

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.640 
works in other words you don't need a
heat<00:03:34.459> gun<00:03:34.669> to<00:03:34.879> fix<00:03:35.269> PlayStation<00:03:36.049> but<00:03:36.349> you<00:03:36.440> do

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
heat gun to fix PlayStation but you do

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.349 
heat gun to fix PlayStation but you do
need<00:03:36.919> a<00:03:36.979> thermal<00:03:37.430> paste<00:03:37.609> if<00:03:37.819> you<00:03:37.909> want<00:03:38.120> this

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
need a thermal paste if you want this

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.379 
need a thermal paste if you want this
fix<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.440> last<00:03:39.680> I've<00:03:40.579> heard<00:03:40.879> all<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.030> people

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
fix to last I've heard all the people

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:42.879 
fix to last I've heard all the people
saying<00:03:41.599> that<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:41.930> won't<00:03:42.260> last<00:03:42.500> no<00:03:42.739> matter

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
saying that this won't last no matter

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.490 
saying that this won't last no matter
what<00:03:43.159> you<00:03:43.310> do<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.639> so<00:03:44.599> you<00:03:44.659> might<00:03:44.989> also<00:03:45.229> want<00:03:45.440> to

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
what you do is so you might also want to

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.259 
what you do is so you might also want to
backup<00:03:45.769> your<00:03:46.010> PlayStation<00:03:46.669> when<00:03:46.790> they<00:03:46.909> starts

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
backup your PlayStation when they starts

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.089 
backup your PlayStation when they starts
happening<00:03:47.720> because<00:03:48.079> sooner<00:03:48.470> or<00:03:48.500> later<00:03:48.590> you

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
happening because sooner or later you

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.469 
happening because sooner or later you
won't<00:03:49.190> be<00:03:49.340> able<00:03:49.519> to<00:03:49.579> start<00:03:49.729> it<00:03:49.849> up<00:03:49.909> again<00:03:50.000> this

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:50.479 
won't be able to start it up again this

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.759 
won't be able to start it up again this
is<00:03:50.599> probably<00:03:50.840> going<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.079> happen<00:03:51.199> to<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.500> lot<00:03:51.650> of

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
is probably going to happen to a lot of

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.550 
is probably going to happen to a lot of
people<00:03:52.069> now<00:03:52.659> around<00:03:53.659> this<00:03:53.810> time<00:03:54.079> because<00:03:54.409> the

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560
