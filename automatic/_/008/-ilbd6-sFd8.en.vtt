00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.610
 third my dear today will show you 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.619
 as many as four ways you can 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.660
 apply blush also notice 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.490
 the difference between them for this us 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.520
 will need some rouge as well 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.930
 fluffy beveled tassel first 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.700
 The method of applying blush is 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.800
 horizontal apply not that is, we 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.260
 put our and blush on apples counter 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.540
 it's just a great option for 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.430
 to apply blush on a very long 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.190
 face because it is capable of visually 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.170
 reduce your face also such ways 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.390
 application looks very natural and 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.100
 very girlish lovely option for 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.289
 schoolgirls for young girls 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.300
 these with this option you will always 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.350
 look a little more fun and also very 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.420
 Naturally the next method of application 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.329
 Rouge is a triangle application 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.309
 narrowed down that is the closer to the lips 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.740
 and you are guided by your triangle and 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.530
 it becomes already for this we put 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.320
 wider line near our school 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.750
 run fishing line and narrow and and closer to the cube 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.370
 making it light strokes 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.040
 and then it was a little distribute 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.260
 this way is just perfect for those 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.110
 whose face is round he is able to visually 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.180
 its a little about the limit also looks site 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.370
 way a little more serious that is if 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.920
 you need to sing mounts serious 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.070
 girls and women then this option for 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 you 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.580
 thanks to this method can be true 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.980
 visually slightly lengthen the face and this 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.540
 which is very noticeable in the photos here 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.800
 just flow is pushed around helpful 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.690
 the next method of applying blush 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.180
 this is a triangle that will narrow 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.940
 it is to your sheet that is, the closer 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.780
 will guide him to the temples by whom he 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.480
 will be already 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.220
 and less noticeable this way is fine 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.840
 for those who have a square face, he 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.360
 able to make it visually more 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.850
 round for this cause very 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.030
 rich blush closer to the lips as well as to 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.890
 nose and distribute them to press the temples not 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.420
 This method is also pleasant because 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.250
 true visually the face becomes 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.000
 slightly longer and also it becomes 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.130
 more rounded next application method 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.550
 Blush would be perfect for traction 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.010
 already 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.170
 lateral there are problems with the slope that is 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.120
 I will try to emphasize them a little and 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.460
 instead of rubbing I'll use dark ones 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.940
 blush at the place highlighter lighter 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.670
 rouge 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.160
 this under our zygoma more 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.010
 dark blush on top and apply more 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.989
 light can also make 100 the opposite 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.239
 that is, if you have a diamond-shaped face 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.150
 Oskola too pronounced you can 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.030
 do just the opposite causing darker 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.400
 blush on your cheekbones and lighter under 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.900
 zygomatic area such a method of application 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.000
 blush in two petals 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.980
 you can call him that great stick 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.750
 in order for some zones to be slightly 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.850
 highlight a little bit pull forward and 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.880
 on the contrary darken those areas that you have 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.650
 too much noticeable this is quite 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.900
 an interesting way of applying blush 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.820
 so experiment me and colors 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.400
 one different not shine brighter 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.810
 top of the second time darker think 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.070
 which one of these ways you will like 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.750
 I hope you have everything 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.180
 liked such interesting ways 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.750
 applying blush leave a comment and 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.750
 bye everyone
