 two fundamental things that make the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.049
 things quickly sad

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.160
 he's happy to tell you he's not the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.160

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:50.170

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.170
 I do not know how to get rid of the illusion of ice 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.050
 your partner with the person who is 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.730
 imagine opening years some two 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.390

 I already love you 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.440
 we have something present inside everything 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.680
 this study that did dona flor and her 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.980
 two husbands and I saw her 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.980
 all right 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.599
 in a scenario 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:04:00.530
 well clique of the technique had only 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.190
 to be totally in a part way 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.620
 of the choreography and he also put me a 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.290
 very thick cloth tape so that I do not 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.220
 touch nothing nothing and also apart in the 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.760
 moment of life I was squeezing the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.760
 knees 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.710
 so I cut out is a towel and it's 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.380
 stuck with the disc and it made me look like 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.380
 several saw the adhesive tape 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:57.680
 but I feel it's good so that it does not 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:57.680
 nothing left 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.460
 It is very professional, both because 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.460
 we saw the work and fantastic state 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.950
 once 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.920
 how many novels of how many couples 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.240
 in a work now 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.980
 also a friendship me that I 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.980
 we share dressing room to room 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.449
 it really has to do with time 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.430
 that I shared my song two or three times 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:57.080
 well I have the privacy that I have with 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.080
 she that I do not have some friends 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.639
 the third day I was doing everything 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.550
 that gives me confidence 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.830
 arm yourself that I hate the mother with all my 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.830
 soul 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:35.699

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:42.419

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:44.249
 definitive is so good we should also 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:46.050
 and we argue about what happens in the 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:47.909
 television and we have the encounter between 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.509
