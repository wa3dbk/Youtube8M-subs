look at me like I'm the hoarder of

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.620 
look at me like I'm the hoarder of
hoarders<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:21.760> uh<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.270> was<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> first

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
hoarders but uh but it was the first

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.290 
hoarders but uh but it was the first
instance<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.260> ever<00:02:23.590> knew<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.920> somebody<00:02:24.580> doing

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
instance I ever knew of somebody doing

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.420 
instance I ever knew of somebody doing
that<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.319> was<00:02:26.350> all<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.040> shoe<00:02:27.250> and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
that and it was all for this shoe and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.280 
that and it was all for this shoe and
and<00:02:27.610> again<00:02:27.760> he<00:02:28.000> got<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.209> for<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.630> great<00:02:29.080> price

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
and again he got it for a great price

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.680 
and again he got it for a great price
$39.99<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:31.030> made<00:02:31.150> sense<00:02:31.330> because<00:02:31.480> he's

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
$39.99 and it made sense because he's

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.670 
$39.99 and it made sense because he's
like<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.020> know<00:02:32.110> what<00:02:32.200> if<00:02:32.290> they<00:02:32.380> don't<00:02:32.470> ever

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
like you know what if they don't ever

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.449 
like you know what if they don't ever
come<00:02:32.890> out<00:02:32.920> again<00:02:33.220> or<00:02:34.170> if<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.319> buy<00:02:35.500> him<00:02:35.650> like<00:02:36.310> I'll

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
come out again or if I buy him like I'll

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.830 
come out again or if I buy him like I'll
at<00:02:36.580> least<00:02:36.610> I'll<00:02:36.819> have<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:36.970> couple<00:02:37.480> extra<00:02:37.540> ones

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
at least I'll have a couple extra ones

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.750 
at least I'll have a couple extra ones
that<00:02:38.230> I'll<00:02:38.350> have<00:02:38.530> available<00:02:38.950> for<00:02:39.010> later<00:02:39.640> when

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
that I'll have available for later when

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.250 
that I'll have available for later when
these<00:02:40.000> ones<00:02:40.180> get<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.690> know<00:02:40.780> beat<00:02:40.989> up<00:02:41.110> or

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
these ones get you know beat up or

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.170 
these ones get you know beat up or
whatever<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:42.130> was<00:02:42.610> like<00:02:42.670> yeah<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:42.850> did<00:02:43.060> I

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
whatever and so I was like yeah I did I

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.580 
whatever and so I was like yeah I did I
guess<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.450> makes<00:02:43.630> sense

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
guess that makes sense

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.140 
guess that makes sense

so<00:03:21.579> I'm<00:03:21.670> not<00:03:21.700> sure<00:03:21.880> if<00:03:22.239> they<00:03:22.690> improve<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.110> grip

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
so I'm not sure if they improve the grip

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.630 
so I'm not sure if they improve the grip
on<00:03:23.410> these<00:03:23.680> ones<00:03:23.890> or<00:03:24.040> if<00:03:24.070> it's<00:03:24.250> pretty<00:03:24.549> much

that's what's talking about for this
it's<00:03:49.989> kind<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.260> like<00:03:50.410> an<00:03:50.530> exoskeleton

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
it's kind of like an exoskeleton
