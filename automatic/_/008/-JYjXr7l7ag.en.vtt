00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.580 
up anyway but there you go
pogo<00:01:05.070> stick<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.479> they've<00:01:06.810> actually<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
pogo stick and they've actually the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.950 
pogo stick and they've actually the
individual<00:01:08.430> who<00:01:08.610> made<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:09.060> fix<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.869> because

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
individual who made this fix it because

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
individual who made this fix it because
before<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.470> were<00:01:10.590> sitting<00:01:10.979> down<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.460> least<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
before you were sitting down at least I

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
before you were sitting down at least I
think<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> haven't<00:01:12.600> even<00:01:12.689> actually<00:01:13.110> tested

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
think so I haven't even actually tested

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.140 
think so I haven't even actually tested
this<00:01:13.560> out<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.070> place<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> pogo<00:01:14.909> stick

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
this out but you place the pogo stick

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.749 
this out but you place the pogo stick
down<00:01:15.470> I'm<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.650> creative<00:01:16.860> mode<00:01:17.070> maybe<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.549> should

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
down I'm in creative mode maybe I should

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.039 
down I'm in creative mode maybe I should
get<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.299> well<00:01:18.450> first<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.810> won't

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
get out of it and well first I won't

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.050 
get out of it and well first I won't
because<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.680> I'm<00:01:19.860> not<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.759> there's

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
because if I'm not I think there's

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.370 
because if I'm not I think there's
actually<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.360> bit<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> damage<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.170> take

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
actually a bit of damage that you take

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.230 
actually a bit of damage that you take
so<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.430> right-click<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:23.970> next

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
so all you do is right-click on it next

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.010 
so all you do is right-click on it next
thing<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.600> doing<00:01:25.439> doing<00:01:26.250> let<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:27.330> so

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
thing you know doing doing let go so

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.600 
thing you know doing doing let go so
before<00:01:28.470> he<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:28.740> actually<00:01:28.890> sitting<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
before he was actually sitting on it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.039 
before he was actually sitting on it
which<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.030> wouldn't<00:01:30.420> do<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.659> pogo<00:01:30.900> stick

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
which you wouldn't do on a pogo stick

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.840 
which you wouldn't do on a pogo stick
because<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.530> would<00:01:31.680> hurt<00:01:31.890> well<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.759> would

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
because that would hurt well it would

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.819 
because that would hurt well it would
