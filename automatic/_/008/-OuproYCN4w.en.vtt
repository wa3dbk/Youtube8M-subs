00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.470
 and hello everyone with you quadriga 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.840
 as you know there were only two 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.020
 options to declare the first place of torment either 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.240
 some very cool blogger lebanese 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.930
 but since the channel is still my choice 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.070
 obvious so friends first place is 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.840
 just unexpected unexpected finale 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.690
 totally unpredictable turns this 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.400
 but of course yes the guardians of the galaxy guys 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:47.060
 here without options 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:51.290
 let's go here as if to talk 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.210
 just no guard of the guard of the galaxy has become 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.610
 one of the few films that me 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.440
 really liked this year 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.719
 for even though positive 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.149
 reviews are not from all films i 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.879
 went out with high spirits more 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.830
 personally for me not in terms of review 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.229
 reviews and weighted reviews 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.479
 films namely emotionally in 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.430
 tone with what feeling did not leave the cinema 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.200
 Most of the movies I've seen in 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.810
 I got a feeling this year 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.670
 disappointment if not a sell 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 out of the hall shrugged and 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.520
 said yes movie good to fans 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.950
 like it but did I like this movie 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.060
 no of course not and this movie is not 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.380
 managed to catch me but all this 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.689
 absolutely not relevant to the guardians 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.930
 galaxies repeat except for just 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.580
 one detail on which I will say at the end 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.860
 custody is almost the only film 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.290
 this year who fully justified 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.030
 my expectations rather exceeded 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.500
 because extreme fear was 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.960
 next feeling well yes okay narmul not 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.329
 I have already said that generally I miss the genre 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.700
 space adventure but only guards 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.380
 have exposed this gaping wound deep 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.270
 childhood I somehow looked cartoon 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.880
 star patrol and he hit my 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.460
 childish heart then I saw the stars 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.250
 wars star trek and some part of me 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.290
 forever loved the idea of ​​distant 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.450
 space outposts 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.549
 bizarre anthropomorphic aliens and 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.010
 so on then I am for many years 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.780
 carried away by fantasy then they are we then on 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.450
 a few years plunged into the world of music 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.830
 Now I'm interested in comics, but 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.050
 exactly what space adventure 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.360
 very lacked and all for the same 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.330
 the simple reason for science fiction movies 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.130
 of this kind is criminal little 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.440
 in literary form I prefer 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.200
 several different genres and now with the release 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.840
 the guards with sudden clarity felt that 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.210
 here it is something that I lacked 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.880
 humor adventure alien worlds 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.790
 filled with bright juicy colors it's all 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.340
 the guardians of the galaxy think if you would 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.380
 the opportunity to sit down and look together with 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.120
 a dozen films about the adventures of this 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.280
 Kompashki arrange yourself so to speak 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.110
 a marathon for several days but how is it 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.110
 can be made for the old track soap 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.850
 like stories i would love to 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.040
 implemented this opportunity fun 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.500
 carefree world with a minimum of pathos and 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.810
 maximum fooling me personally for 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.150
 me he became just a balm for the soul 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.550
 anyway but we are used to movies 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.650
 marvel and how good they would be 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.870
 nor was it a certain style and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.180
 a certain direction as guards 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.760
 managed it well so dilute and 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.290
 shake if need urgently 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.420
 enter the cinematic universe 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.340
 more and more infinity stones then 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.010
 guards I think could 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.700
 open up even brighter but because I will 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.970
 frank 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.709
 I am very stressed evil and villains well then 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.100
 there is when i hear from characters that he 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.959
 wants to destroy thousands of planets and this 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.150
 says the character I am in the eyes 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.310
 I did not see and I do not know him, and I even 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.070
 Do not explain what he wants 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.750
 destroy thousands of particular planets from 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.370
 I will not quote which came off 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.680
 Let me call Amelia 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.989
 long to explain though it would be cool 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.400
 If only the sister of Omarro will dump soda 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.170
 it certainly would be very strange and 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.420
 female name but the set would be 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.019
 cool up attack me soda and 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.269
 gomorrah 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.209
 I would immediately surrender to capitulate without 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.610
 note bane questions so here are the evil villains 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.280
 cause me a persistent toothache yes 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.049
 such that I want to break my face so 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.510
 what a big question did we need 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.729
 just such a villain as ronan in 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.740
 this form was necessary from the point 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.810
 view of the cinema-universe, but did 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.180
 so clichéd definitely want 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.400
 colorful villain guards again 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.540
 the big question but otherwise it's full 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.940
 delight 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.250
 all the characters I think 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.889
 implemented as well as 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.659
 at all 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.999
 I could be if there were 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:48.639
 claims gruta and I know exactly how he would 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:50.919
 answered yes that's right I did not understand 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.080
 why so offended Drax pretty slow 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.999
 him physical strength and aykyu 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.620
 and why gamora for the most part leads 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:58.810
 themselves not the knights not how 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.949
 nun but I just got to know 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.050
 comics about the guards 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.120
 and never really read it so much 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.759
 maybe some aspects of her behavior i 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.770
 just overlooked by the way i'm at the beginning 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:11.080
 talked about a certain aspect of the guard which 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.120
 I was a little upset so when 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.129
 the division left immediately rushed 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.310
 watching a movie like some of mine 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.870
 friends and we found quite 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.210
 low rez watchability and 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.340
 that is , there are films that I watched 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.770
 a hundred times and they were all to me 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.590
 interesting but with the guards re 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.539
 viewing at home pitch wouldn't 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.520
 holiday on which I expected and 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.110
 the third time I will hardly reconsider 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.300
 the film unless before the release of the second 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.520
 parts but it is exceptionally taste 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.460
 which should not interfere with viewing or 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.550
 movie ratings overall okay 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.680
 the results of the guardians of the galaxy is an excellent film and 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.870
 his first place he earned with 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.000
 a huge margin from captain america 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.750
 six and eight percent of the votes have days 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.149
 the past of the future 16 and the guards 43 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.240
 that is, of the nine films offered 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:05.430
 43 percent viewers best comics 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.050
 screen versions of 2014 chose him 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.560
 guardians of the galaxy and this is definitely 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.020
 deservedly guard the galaxy bright peppy 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.930
 positively charged movie and they tell me 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.789
 really have something to say but it's time 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.639
 and it would be an honor to know, especially since 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:24.219
 year we still do not say goodbye 31 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.169
 December I will upload a small video upload 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.899
 about the future plans of the channel new 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.879
 projects and the like but what's 

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:32.620
 so here we have a top by 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:34.810
 viewers voting results 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.689
 my personal lineup would be different 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.550
 places likely yes but the guards for sure 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.830
 would be in first place among the comics 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.199
 screenings by the way funny city of sins 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.849
 entrenched in sixth place true 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.590
 Now I'm with him for several reasons 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.510
 covered up 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.910
 these are the details so for the week that came out 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.580
 top city of sins managed to gain votes and 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.090
 overtake 300 spartans ie go out on 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.310
 fifth place are such miracles 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.810
 well for today is all this 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.750
 New Year's marathon was extremely 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.910
 fascinating though I will not hide the exhausting 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.520
 but the most important thing is to make you happy 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.650
 so put the likes to emotionally 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.870
 support the project and me personally 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.480
 tell your friends about the video 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:18.360
 of course subscribe to the channel if more 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.630
 not signed with you was quadriga all 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.630
 until 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.259
 food 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:35.210
 I take the rap that I watch the sides of what 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:38.410
 then there is no one there are no people when me 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.410
 already released from here 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.130
 I want to eat
