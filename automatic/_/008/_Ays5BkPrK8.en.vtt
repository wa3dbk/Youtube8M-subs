00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
how our monocytes and macrophages

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.370 
how our monocytes and macrophages
respond<00:00:25.970> during<00:00:26.270> infection<00:00:27.170> and

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
respond during infection and

inflammation and that's what we'll be

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.310 
inflammation and that's what we'll be
having<00:00:30.500> a<00:00:30.740> brief<00:00:31.010> look<00:00:31.310> at<00:00:31.490> in<00:00:31.670> this<00:00:31.940> video<00:00:32.320> how

and inflammation now our story begins

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.819 
and inflammation now our story begins
with<00:00:40.609> a<00:00:40.670> break<00:00:40.999> in<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.329> skin<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:42.620> most
