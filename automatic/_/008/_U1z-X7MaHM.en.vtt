00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.390 
option there's three film cameras I
could<00:00:16.670> have<00:00:16.790> gone<00:00:16.940> like<00:00:17.150> a<00:00:17.300> 90s<00:00:18.110> alcan<00:00:18.770> adan<00:00:19.040> 90

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
could have gone like a 90s alcan adan 90

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.120 
could have gone like a 90s alcan adan 90
style<00:00:19.700> d<00:00:19.970> hun<00:00:20.390> but<00:00:21.230> I<00:00:21.260> decided<00:00:21.650> to<00:00:21.860> go<00:00:21.950> a<00:00:21.980> little

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
style d hun but I decided to go a little

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.880 
style d hun but I decided to go a little
bit<00:00:22.310> old<00:00:22.580> and<00:00:22.850> get<00:00:23.060> um<00:00:23.480> a<00:00:24.520> see<00:00:25.520> as<00:00:25.730> KS<00:00:26.660> super<00:00:27.619> to

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
bit old and get um a see as KS super to

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.019 
bit old and get um a see as KS super to
all<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:28.970> reason<00:00:29.210> why<00:00:29.510> I<00:00:29.900> went<00:00:30.289> with<00:00:30.590> this<00:00:31.460> type

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
all the reason why I went with this type

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.490 
all the reason why I went with this type
of<00:00:32.060> camera<00:00:32.660> is<00:00:33.110> that<00:00:33.200> it<00:00:34.160> uses<00:00:34.960> contact<00:00:35.960> lenses

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
of camera is that it uses contact lenses

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.720 
of camera is that it uses contact lenses
and<00:00:37.010> tax<00:00:38.500> as<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:39.649> can<00:00:39.800> see<00:00:41.560> pentax<00:00:42.560> lenses<00:00:43.460> are

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
and tax as you can see pentax lenses are

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.150 
and tax as you can see pentax lenses are
hundred<00:00:44.149> percent<00:00:44.480> compatible<00:00:45.140> all<00:00:45.770> of<00:00:46.040> them

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
hundred percent compatible all of them

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.209 
hundred percent compatible all of them
from<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.730> old<00:00:48.160> film<00:00:49.160> range<00:00:49.399> to<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.920> 90s<00:00:51.920> film

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
from the old film range to the 90s film

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:59.190 
from the old film range to the 90s film
to<00:00:52.670> even<00:00:53.059> now<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.329> digital<00:00:54.320> cam<00:00:55.190> do<00:00:55.430> solarz

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.110 

another<00:01:00.200> reason<00:01:00.590> why<00:01:00.710> I<00:01:00.739> want<00:01:01.010> with<00:01:01.160> that<00:01:01.190> is

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
another reason why I want with that is

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.719 
another reason why I want with that is
because<00:01:03.280> most<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.429> the<00:01:05.079> 50<00:01:06.340> millimeter<00:01:07.340> or

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
because most of the 50 millimeter or

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.109 
because most of the 50 millimeter or
nifty<00:01:08.179> fifties<00:01:08.569> we<00:01:09.200> call<00:01:09.409> them<00:01:09.670> have<00:01:10.670> very

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
nifty fifties we call them have very

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.190 
nifty fifties we call them have very

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
and then needlessly like that another

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.480 
and then needlessly like that another
reason<00:01:24.950> why<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.369> want<00:01:25.969> with<00:01:26.179> such<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.630> lenses
