 Today we want to show you one of the 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.160
 first tablets that have come out with the 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.160
 operating system windows 8 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.320
 is a 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:27.480
 asus is the model asus vivo are you rt 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 definition, this would be 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.500
 so on the one hand the tablet will see more 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.500
 determined mind and good then 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.760

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.760
 a small chamois to clean it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.489
 the guarantee card 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.329

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.890
 and User Guide 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.250
 On the other hand we have the data cable 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:15.400
 it would be this 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.400
 the transformer and the cable 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.969
 and then another small one comes to us 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.969
 adapter 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 to connect on the tablet and that we 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.270
 serve the usb port 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.509
 already good to connect a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.000
 a portable hard drive or also 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.409
 we want to test and then you 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.670
 we'll say in another video with a usb modem 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.770
 if we can also access the internet 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.149
 with him since this tablet only 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.409
 take wifi then in another test 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.080
 we'll see if we can with a modem 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.680
 connect 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.680
 OK 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.140
 let's take the plastic 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:15.840
 of model like he's only wi-fi 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.840
 the memories of 32 gb 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.020
 the screen is 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.980
 ips 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.410
 and the front camera are 2 megapixels 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.740
 what it takes and on the other hand we have the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.640
 rear camera that would be 8 megapixels 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.110
 with flash 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.680
 we have the null 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.030
 3.5 headphone buttons upload 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.350
 and lower the volume 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.350
 to understand the table 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.580
 take another slot here for a connection 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.580
 micro hdmi 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.890
 to put it in a memory card 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.890
 microsd and to block it stable 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.840
 and below is where the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.840
 connector where load 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.530
 on this side 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.510
 and then hector those products holes 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.980
 are the anchors for the keyboard a 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.980
 keyboard that can be obtained separately 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.870
 we turn it on 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.940
 the weight the price is 125 grams 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.030
 and the processor also that then what 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.870
 put here in the description this gr 3 and 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.390
 it's a quad core 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.930
 Battery life puts us up to 9 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.930
 hours of autonomy 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.900
 is starting 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.810
 and I would be 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.240
 note the almost nothing to turn on and good 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.570
 this would be the main menu of the 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.570
 tablet 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.600
 OK 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.120
 and well, this would be all 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.010
 we have to prepare a video too 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.170
 of the operation 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.670
 and so we can see a little bit how 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.250
 works windows 8 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.540
 it's worth nothing else 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.150
 I leave 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.150
 and thank you very much for a greeting
