it's<00:00:39.740> funny<00:00:40.040> little<00:00:41.440> reflector<00:00:42.440> looking

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
it's funny little reflector looking

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
it's funny little reflector looking
things<00:00:43.040> that<00:00:43.250> are<00:00:43.370> supposed<00:00:43.640> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.470 

make<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.620> wind<00:00:46.890> or<00:00:47.160> something<00:00:47.579> come<00:00:47.910> off<00:00:48.180> for

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
make the wind or something come off for

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.680 
make the wind or something come off for
your<00:00:48.660> struck<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.350> around<00:00:49.620> your<00:00:49.980> truck

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
your struck or around your truck

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.950 
your struck or around your truck
in<00:00:52.109> a<00:00:52.320> better<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.960> increases

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
in a better way so that it increases

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.590 
in a better way so that it increases
your<00:00:55.309> aerodynamic<00:00:56.600> ability

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
your aerodynamic ability

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.720 
your aerodynamic ability
thus<00:01:00.230> increasing<00:01:00.980> your<00:01:01.100> fuel<00:01:01.460> mileage

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.940 

i<00:01:04.820> don't<00:01:05.510> know<00:01:05.570> i<00:01:05.600> don't<00:01:05.810> mean<00:01:06.170> imagine<00:01:06.650> they

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
i don't know i don't mean imagine they

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.620 
i don't know i don't mean imagine they
work

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
work

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.279 
work
but<00:01:09.229> are<00:01:09.350> they<00:01:09.469> I<00:01:09.740> mean<00:01:09.979> how<00:01:10.130> much<00:01:10.869> would<00:01:11.869> I

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
but are they I mean how much would I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:23.320 
but are they I mean how much would I
guess<00:01:12.469> what<00:01:12.619> my<00:01:19.570> opinion<00:01:20.570> up

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.690 

good<00:01:23.960> over<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.380> short<00:01:24.740> enough<00:01:24.980> period<00:01:25.310> of<00:01:25.490> time

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
good over a short enough period of time

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.570 
good over a short enough period of time
to<00:01:26.000> make<00:01:26.750> them<00:01:26.990> make<00:01:27.260> it<00:01:28.240> cost-effective

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.920 

and<00:01:32.580> then<00:01:32.730> I've<00:01:32.880> seen<00:01:33.150> these<00:01:33.330> things<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and then I've seen these things on the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.610 
and then I've seen these things on the
back<00:01:34.140> of

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
back of

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.020 
back of
like<00:01:36.190> box<00:01:36.520> trailers

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
like box trailers

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.940 
like box trailers
that<00:01:39.630> basically<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.470> they<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.920> stick<00:01:41.430> out

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
that basically all they do is stick out

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.840 
that basically all they do is stick out
about<00:01:43.729> four<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.270> half<00:01:44.299> feet<00:01:45.189> off<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.250> back

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
about four and a half feet off the back

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.810 
about four and a half feet off the back
of<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.719> trailer<00:01:48.460> which<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.610> don't

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
of it of the trailer which I don't

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.330 
of it of the trailer which I don't
understand<00:01:50.270> how<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:50.479> would<00:01:50.869> work<00:01:50.899> at<00:01:51.289> all<00:01:51.469> I

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.940 

mean<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:55.490> make<00:01:56.179> your<00:01:56.360> truck<00:01:56.659> 500<00:01:57.469> feet<00:01:57.679> long

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
mean I make your truck 500 feet long

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.029 
mean I make your truck 500 feet long
it's<00:01:58.670> still<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.179> shape<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.659> truck<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:01.009> I

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
it's still the shape of the truck so I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.060 
it's still the shape of the truck so I
don't<00:02:01.310> understand

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
don't understand

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.730 
don't understand
I<00:02:03.750> understand<00:02:04.750> how<00:02:04.900> that<00:02:05.110> would<00:02:05.229> work<00:02:05.260> at<00:02:05.590> all

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
I understand how that would work at all

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.320 
I understand how that would work at all
but<00:02:06.070> apparently<00:02:06.550> I've<00:02:06.670> been<00:02:06.820> seeing<00:02:06.970> more<00:02:07.300> and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
but apparently I've been seeing more and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.740 
but apparently I've been seeing more and
more<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.570> them<00:02:07.810> now<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.500> ones<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:10.360> see<00:02:10.570> that<00:02:10.720> a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
more of them now the ones you see that a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.500 
more of them now the ones you see that a
lot<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.290> them<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.709> is<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.130> most<00:02:12.300> common<00:02:13.300> one

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
lot of them that is the most common one

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.610 
lot of them that is the most common one
that<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.810> see

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
that you see

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.160 
that you see
is<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.610> Aerodyne<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.959> are

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
is that like the Aerodyne that are

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.430 
is that like the Aerodyne that are
underneath<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:20.409> box<00:02:21.409> trucks

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
underneath the box trucks

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.710 
underneath the box trucks
yeah<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:23.950> mean<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.370> closed<00:02:24.610> off<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.210> landing

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
yeah I mean it closed off the landing

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.500 
yeah I mean it closed off the landing
gear<00:02:26.610> keep<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.850> air<00:02:28.180> from<00:02:28.210> getting

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
gear keep the air from getting

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.490 
gear keep the air from getting
underneath<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.350> trailer<00:02:30.870> now<00:02:31.870> apparently

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
underneath the trailer now apparently

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.670 
underneath the trailer now apparently
those<00:02:32.740> really<00:02:33.310> work<00:02:34.170> what<00:02:35.170> I've<00:02:35.320> been<00:02:35.470> told

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
those really work what I've been told

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.180 
those really work what I've been told
that<00:02:35.950> as<00:02:36.280> much<00:02:36.490> as<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.700> half<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.300> half<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.810> mile

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
that as much as a half and half a mile

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.430 
that as much as a half and half a mile
per<00:02:39.190> gallon<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.480> if<00:02:40.570> your<00:02:40.720> average<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.260> say

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
per gallon so if your average and say

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.700 
per gallon so if your average and say
six<00:02:41.770> six<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.610> half<00:02:42.670> miles<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.390> gallon<00:02:43.710> when

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
six six and a half miles a gallon when

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.530 
six six and a half miles a gallon when
you<00:02:44.800> pull<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.070> trailer<00:02:45.460> that<00:02:45.640> has<00:02:45.970> those<00:02:46.240> on

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
you pull a trailer that has those on

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.220 
you pull a trailer that has those on
there<00:02:46.810> you'll<00:02:47.590> average<00:02:48.040> like<00:02:48.250> seven<00:02:49.230> maybe

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
there you'll average like seven maybe

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.640 
there you'll average like seven maybe
even<00:02:50.440> it's<00:02:50.650> like<00:02:50.800> 7.1<00:02:51.790> miles<00:02:52.030> per<00:02:52.480> gallon<00:02:52.720> so

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
even it's like 7.1 miles per gallon so

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.990 
even it's like 7.1 miles per gallon so
I've<00:02:53.740> been<00:02:53.860> at<00:02:54.010> yeah<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.190> guess<00:02:54.460> that<00:02:54.670> would<00:02:54.790> pay

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
I've been at yeah I guess that would pay

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.470 
I've been at yeah I guess that would pay
off<00:02:55.030> pretty<00:02:55.480> damn<00:02:55.720> quick

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.340 

I<00:02:58.569> don't<00:02:59.200> know<00:02:59.260> what<00:02:59.379> they<00:02:59.530> cost<00:03:00.450> probably

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
I don't know what they cost probably

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.260 
I don't know what they cost probably
six<00:03:03.070> eight<00:03:03.430> hundred<00:03:03.760> thousand<00:03:04.240> dollars
