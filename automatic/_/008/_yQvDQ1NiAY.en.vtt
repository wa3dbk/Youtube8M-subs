the<00:00:00.930> first<00:00:01.140> thing<00:00:01.319> we<00:00:01.439> do<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.829> we<00:00:02.010> apply

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
the first thing we do is we apply

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.210 
the first thing we do is we apply
alcohol<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.899> our<00:00:03.990> hands<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.770> way<00:00:04.890> we<00:00:05.040> can

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
alcohol to our hands that way we can

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.499 
alcohol to our hands that way we can
kill<00:00:05.339> all<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.700> bacteria<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:06.150> be<00:00:06.299> might<00:00:06.480> have

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
kill all the bacteria to be might have

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.339 
kill all the bacteria to be might have
enormous<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:07.500> might<00:00:07.649> affect<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.340> few<00:00:09.349> seconds

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
enormous that might affect a few seconds

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.790 
enormous that might affect a few seconds
we<00:00:10.740> apply<00:00:11.160> alcohol

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.060 

after<00:00:18.520> we<00:00:18.610> do<00:00:18.790> this<00:00:18.990> we're<00:00:19.990> gonna<00:00:20.050> do

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
after we do this we're gonna do

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.450 
after we do this we're gonna do
I'm<00:00:22.400> gonna<00:00:22.580> cut<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.090> grass<00:00:23.390> for<00:00:24.250> this<00:00:25.250> one

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
I'm gonna cut the grass for this one

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.240 
I'm gonna cut the grass for this one
you're<00:00:26.180> gonna<00:00:26.240> be<00:00:26.480> doing<00:00:26.780> a<00:00:26.900> clef<00:00:27.140> that<00:00:27.380> which

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
you're gonna be doing a clef that which

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.690 
you're gonna be doing a clef that which
is<00:00:28.430> done<00:00:28.580> in<00:00:28.610> a<00:00:28.820> V<00:00:31.119> and<00:00:32.119> then<00:00:32.360> V<00:00:32.570> form<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.860> this

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
is done in a V and then V form and this

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.410 
is done in a V and then V form and this
is<00:00:34.760> done<00:00:35.410> both<00:00:36.410> for<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:37.520> rootstock<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.270> the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
is done both for the rootstock and the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.840 
is done both for the rootstock and the
Scion<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:39.860> reason<00:00:40.129> why<00:00:40.250> we<00:00:40.370> do<00:00:40.550> this<00:00:40.580> is

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
Scion the reason why we do this is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.610 
Scion the reason why we do this is
because<00:00:40.970> it<00:00:41.510> um<00:00:43.660> it<00:00:44.660> gives<00:00:44.809> us<00:00:45.020> more<00:00:45.230> surface

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
because it um it gives us more surface

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.600 
because it um it gives us more surface
area<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:45.890> work<00:00:46.309> with

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
area to work with

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.650 
area to work with
whenever<00:00:47.120> grafting<00:00:47.600> that<00:00:47.809> way<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:50.449> both

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
whenever grafting that way the the both

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.369 
whenever grafting that way the the both
plants<00:00:51.050> get<00:00:51.230> stitches<00:00:51.650> a<00:00:51.680> little<00:00:51.860> bit<00:00:51.980> more<00:00:53.379> so

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
plants get stitches a little bit more so

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.189 
plants get stitches a little bit more so
for<00:00:54.559> this<00:00:54.680> one<00:00:54.920> we<00:00:55.250> go<00:00:55.400> ahead<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:55.610> take<00:00:55.820> off<00:00:56.199> do

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
for this one we go ahead and take off do

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.330 
for this one we go ahead and take off do
excess

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:14.370 

things<00:01:00.940> we<00:01:01.090> have

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.109 

you<00:01:14.799> can<00:01:14.979> narrow<00:01:15.219> this<00:01:15.399> down<00:01:15.460> a<00:01:15.729> little<00:01:15.969> bit

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
you can narrow this down a little bit

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:30.350 
you can narrow this down a little bit
more

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.990 

which<00:01:30.870> we<00:01:31.050> get<00:01:31.230> here<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.710> fit

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
which we get here to fit

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
which we get here to fit
you<00:01:33.450> might<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.870> make<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.530> sit<00:01:34.770> down

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you might have a make a little sit down

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.380 
you might have a make a little sit down
here

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690 

once<00:01:39.960> they're<00:01:40.140> touching<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.890> get<00:01:41.160> to<00:01:41.370> para

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
once they're touching we get to para

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.719 
once they're touching we get to para
phone

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.539 

go<00:01:50.240> around<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.979> there<00:01:51.979> isn't<00:01:52.219> where<00:01:52.310> we<00:01:52.399> use

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
go around it there isn't where we use

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.690 
go around it there isn't where we use
this<00:01:52.670> parafilm<00:01:53.210> it's<00:01:53.360> because<00:01:54.039> it<00:01:55.039> helps<00:01:55.579> us

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
this parafilm it's because it helps us

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.690 
this parafilm it's because it helps us
keep<00:01:56.000> oxygen<00:01:56.689> out<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.049> cuts<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:58.579> way

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
keep oxygen out of the cuts and that way

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:44.140 
keep oxygen out of the cuts and that way
they<00:01:58.850> can<00:01:58.880> survive<00:01:59.149> and<00:02:00.520> there<00:02:01.520> was<00:02:01.700> wood

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.540 

so<00:02:44.690> once<00:02:44.870> we<00:02:45.050> see<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.500> we<00:02:45.739> have<00:02:46.010> like<00:02:46.220> enough

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
so once we see that we have like enough

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.990 
so once we see that we have like enough
for<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.900> keep<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.230> oxygen<00:02:48.319> out<00:02:48.890> just<00:02:49.849> go

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
for it to keep the oxygen out just go

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.470 
for it to keep the oxygen out just go
ahead

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.490 

two<00:02:55.690> turds

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
two turds

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.540 
two turds
so<00:02:57.950> for<00:02:58.130> this<00:02:58.220> one<00:02:58.400> we<00:02:58.520> can<00:02:58.670> just<00:02:58.880> add<00:03:00.550> black

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
so for this one we can just add black

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:10.470 
so for this one we can just add black
and<00:03:01.850> Tula

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.940 

very<00:03:10.989> good

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
very good

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.030 
very good
and<00:03:13.310> that's<00:03:13.550> how<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.849> make
