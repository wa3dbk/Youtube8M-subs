least of the good teams oh it's

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.699 
least of the good teams oh it's
true<00:03:56.780> though<00:03:56.930> isn't<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.350> know<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.620> it's

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
true though isn't it you know and it's

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.920 
true though isn't it you know and it's
gonna<00:03:57.860> be<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:58.190> it's<00:03:58.280> gonna<00:03:58.459> be<00:03:58.640> used<00:03:59.150> hopefully

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
gonna be so it's gonna be used hopefully

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.479 
gonna be so it's gonna be used hopefully
as<00:04:00.080> if<00:04:00.230> we<00:04:00.350> if<00:04:00.530> we<00:04:00.650> can<00:04:00.770> get<00:04:00.920> some<00:04:01.069> goals<00:04:01.250> but

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
as if we if we can get some goals but

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.610 
as if we if we can get some goals but
then<00:04:01.640> that<00:04:01.760> side<00:04:01.940> man<00:04:02.569> United<00:04:03.110> and<00:04:03.319> then<00:04:03.470> it

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
then that side man United and then it

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.320 
then that side man United and then it
depends<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:04.040> spares<00:04:04.370> put<00:04:04.550> on<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.150> think

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
depends of spares put on and I think

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.820 
depends of spares put on and I think
they're<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.750> teams<00:04:05.959> are<00:04:06.140> gonna<00:04:06.230> be<00:04:06.319> healing

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
they're the teams are gonna be healing
