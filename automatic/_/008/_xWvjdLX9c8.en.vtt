being older and hungry you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.330 
being older and hungry you
you'll<00:02:13.459> go<00:02:13.879> through<00:02:13.909> perhaps<00:02:14.329> your<00:02:14.629> usual

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
you'll go through perhaps your usual

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.289 
you'll go through perhaps your usual
thing<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.519> do<00:02:16.670> you'll<00:02:16.879> move<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.209> then

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
thing that you do you'll move and then

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.929 
thing that you do you'll move and then
you'll<00:02:17.420> forget<00:02:17.569> forget<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.469> move<00:02:18.620> troops<00:02:19.010> from

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
you'll forget forget to move troops from

you'll forget forget to move troops from
one<00:02:20.180> place<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.629> another<00:02:20.810> or<00:02:21.170> you'll<00:02:22.040> forget<00:02:22.370> to

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
one place to another or you'll forget to

but you know and just and have your body
in<00:02:33.680> good<00:02:34.159> shape<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.790> course<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.180> can<00:02:35.329> plan

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
in good shape of course you can plan

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.479 
in good shape of course you can plan
ahead<00:02:35.719> for<00:02:36.909> the<00:02:37.909> eventualities

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
ahead for the eventualities

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.920 
ahead for the eventualities
if<00:02:40.489> it's<00:02:40.639> not<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:40.879> your<00:02:41.060> house<00:02:41.299> bringing<00:02:41.780> your

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
if it's not in your house bringing your

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.710 
if it's not in your house bringing your
own<00:02:41.959> food

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
own food

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.319 
own food
sounds<00:02:44.720> crazy<00:02:44.989> but<00:02:45.409> it<00:02:45.530> works<00:02:45.769> just<00:02:46.730> crisps

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
sounds crazy but it works just crisps

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.379 
sounds crazy but it works just crisps
and<00:02:47.510> stuff<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:48.409> to<00:02:48.530> keep<00:02:48.739> self<00:02:49.069> going<00:02:49.389> and

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
and stuff just to keep self going and

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.449 
and stuff just to keep self going and
therefore<00:02:50.930> getting<00:02:51.109> really<00:02:51.680> dirty<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:54.049> can

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
therefore getting really dirty you can

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.250 
therefore getting really dirty you can
have<00:02:55.459> enough<00:02:55.760> food<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.419> can<00:02:56.629> when<00:02:57.139> you

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
have enough food that you can when you

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.869 
have enough food that you can when you
realize<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.650> both<00:02:58.069> of<00:02:58.099> you<00:02:58.400> are<00:02:58.430> getting<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
realize that both of you are getting a

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.940 
realize that both of you are getting a
bit<00:02:59.030> hungry<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.629> stuff<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.200> maybe<00:03:00.620> it's<00:03:00.829> at

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
bit hungry and stuff and maybe it's at

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.170 
bit hungry and stuff and maybe it's at
his<00:03:01.099> house<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.549> he<00:03:01.639> doesn't<00:03:01.730> want<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.030> offer

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
his house and he doesn't want to offer

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.069 
his house and he doesn't want to offer
you<00:03:02.329> anything<00:03:02.569> get<00:03:03.430> then<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:05.480> can<00:03:05.659> offer<00:03:05.810> him

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
you anything get then you can offer him

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.429 
you anything get then you can offer him
just<00:03:06.409> a<00:03:06.500> taster<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.900> have<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.049> lion's<00:03:09.379> share

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
just a taster and have the lion's share

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.699 
just a taster and have the lion's share
for<00:03:09.769> yourself<00:03:11.109> because<00:03:12.109> this<00:03:12.230> works<00:03:12.469> even

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
for yourself because this works even

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.140 
for yourself because this works even
better<00:03:12.829> if<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.159> is<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.400> your<00:03:13.519> own<00:03:13.549> home<00:03:13.909> because

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
better if it is in your own home because

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.409 
better if it is in your own home because
then<00:03:15.139> you<00:03:15.290> offer<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.889> little<00:03:16.219> bit<00:03:16.639> and<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.030> eat

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
then you offer a little bit and you eat

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.869 
then you offer a little bit and you eat
the<00:03:17.569> lion's<00:03:17.870> share<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.319> all<00:03:19.099> he<00:03:19.370> can<00:03:19.579> do<00:03:19.729> is<00:03:19.849> I

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
the lion's share and all he can do is I

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.259 
the lion's share and all he can do is I
ask<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.329> for<00:03:20.359> food<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.949> might<00:03:22.269> delay

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
ask you for food and you might delay

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.509 
ask you for food and you might delay
giving<00:03:24.019> him<00:03:24.199> the<00:03:24.349> food<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:25.010> want<00:03:25.159> to<00:03:25.250> get<00:03:25.370> him

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
giving him the food you want to get him

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.069 
giving him the food you want to get him
thinking<00:03:25.909> about<00:03:26.150> food<00:03:26.449> and<00:03:26.629> not<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.900> game

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
thinking about food and not the game

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.460 
thinking about food and not the game
okay<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:28.069> -<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.430> few<00:03:28.669> tactics<00:03:28.909> well<00:03:29.419> the<00:03:30.290> next

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
okay so - a few tactics well the next

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.409 
okay so - a few tactics well the next
thing<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:31.040> realise<00:03:31.340> when<00:03:31.579> you're<00:03:31.729> you're

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
thing to realise when you're you're

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.030 
thing to realise when you're you're
playing<00:03:32.720> man<00:03:32.959> or<00:03:33.139> man<00:03:33.349> is<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.919> clash<00:03:34.639> of<00:03:34.819> styles

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
playing man or man is a clash of styles

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.189 
playing man or man is a clash of styles
can<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.250> get<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.729> game<00:03:38.000> moving<00:03:38.780> in<00:03:39.109> the

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
can you get the game moving in the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.929 
can you get the game moving in the
direction<00:03:39.349> that<00:03:39.949> he<00:03:40.010> doesn't<00:03:40.489> like<00:03:40.669> playing

here<00:04:34.040> particularly<00:04:35.040> if<00:04:35.310> Africa<00:04:36.120> was<00:04:36.300> one<00:04:36.480> in
