to build grew from the ground up

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.670 
to build grew from the ground up
including<00:00:13.789> the<00:00:13.879> drums<00:00:14.150> and<00:00:14.360> the<00:00:14.449> bass<00:00:14.690> now

we have an overhead shot of the drums so
that's<00:00:20.840> can<00:00:20.960> be<00:00:21.080> beneficial<00:00:21.260> for<00:00:21.680> all<00:00:21.800> of<00:00:22.040> you

viewpoint you know you hear things

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.120 
viewpoint you know you hear things
differently<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:36.350> get<00:00:36.500> focused<00:00:36.920> on<00:00:37.040> the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
differently and you get focused on the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.410 
differently and you get focused on the
groove<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:37.670> that's<00:00:37.820> really<00:00:37.970> what<00:00:38.150> this<00:00:38.270> is

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
groove and that's really what this is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.510 
groove and that's really what this is
all<00:00:38.570> about<00:00:38.600> our<00:00:39.079> first<00:00:39.860> groove<00:00:40.130> is<00:00:40.280> going<00:00:40.460> to

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
all about our first groove is going to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.160 
all about our first groove is going to
be<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:40.640> straight<00:00:41.030> eight<00:00:41.210> field<00:00:41.570> now<00:00:41.930> as<00:00:42.050> you've

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
be a straight eight field now as you've

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.600 
be a straight eight field now as you've
learned<00:00:42.380> earlier<00:00:42.770> you<00:00:42.980> subdivide<00:00:43.340> the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
learned earlier you subdivide the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.610 
learned earlier you subdivide the
quarter<00:00:43.880> notes<00:00:44.060> into<00:00:44.329> eighth<00:00:44.510> notes<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.530> the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
quarter notes into eighth notes so the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.720 
quarter notes into eighth notes so the
first<00:00:45.770> thing<00:00:45.890> we're<00:00:46.040> gonna<00:00:46.130> do<00:00:46.250> is<00:00:46.280> have<00:00:46.460> Mike

first thing we're gonna do is have Mike
demonstrate<00:00:47.300> a<00:00:47.450> straight<00:00:47.750> eighth<00:00:47.899> groove

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309

hat and my bass line is just an a note
pumped<00:01:06.799> right<00:01:06.920> along<00:01:07.159> with<00:01:07.399> that<00:01:13.090> but<00:01:14.090> let's

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
pumped right along with that but let's

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.870 
pumped right along with that but let's
say<00:01:14.509> we<00:01:14.659> wanted<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:14.929> change<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:15.469> okay<00:01:15.889> let's

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
say we wanted to change this okay let's

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.639 
say we wanted to change this okay let's
say<00:01:17.060> we<00:01:17.240> want<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.569> not<00:01:17.749> have<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.020> constant

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
say we want to not have a constant

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.289 
say we want to not have a constant
baseline<00:01:19.219> there's<00:01:19.520> nothing<00:01:19.639> wrong<00:01:19.939> with<00:01:19.999> that

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
baseline there's nothing wrong with that

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:21.879 
baseline there's nothing wrong with that
but<00:01:20.479> if<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.749> want<00:01:20.959> to<00:01:20.990> have<00:01:21.139> a<00:01:21.170> different<00:01:21.529> figure

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:21.889 
but if I want to have a different figure

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.769 
but if I want to have a different figure
going<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.789> I<00:01:23.119> know<00:01:23.179> you're<00:01:23.389> saying<00:01:23.600> wait<00:01:23.749> a

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:23.779 
going on and I know you're saying wait a

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:24.760 
going on and I know you're saying wait a
minute<00:01:23.959> I<00:01:23.990> thought<00:01:24.139> this<00:01:24.259> is<00:01:24.319> a<00:01:24.409> guitar<00:01:24.740> lesson

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
minute I thought this is a guitar lesson

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.319 
minute I thought this is a guitar lesson
well<00:01:25.549> you're<00:01:25.700> going<00:01:25.819> to<00:01:25.880> learn<00:01:25.939> about<00:01:25.999> the

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
well you're going to learn about the

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.940 
well you're going to learn about the
baseline<00:01:26.779> because<00:01:27.079> your<00:01:27.200> guitar<00:01:27.469> part<00:01:27.740> has<00:01:27.920> to

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
baseline because your guitar part has to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.980 
baseline because your guitar part has to
complement<00:01:28.579> sometimes<00:01:29.209> lock<00:01:29.479> up<00:01:29.659> with<00:01:29.810> bass

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
complement sometimes lock up with bass

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.440 
complement sometimes lock up with bass
or<00:01:30.200> play<00:01:30.350> opposite<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:30.920> I<00:01:31.099> know<00:01:31.939> that<00:01:32.209> I<00:01:32.240> have

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
or play opposite it I know that I have

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.569 
or play opposite it I know that I have
eight<00:01:32.630> slots<00:01:32.959> in<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.259> measure<00:01:33.529> so<00:01:34.219> if<00:01:34.459> you

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
eight slots in the measure so if you

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:35.830 
eight slots in the measure so if you
look<00:01:34.729> at<00:01:34.819> his<00:01:34.969> kick<00:01:35.179> drum<00:01:35.420> he's<00:01:35.569> going<00:01:35.749> to

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
look at his kick drum he's going to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.449 
look at his kick drum he's going to
establish<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.439> pattern<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.099> he'll

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
establish a pattern and he'll

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.039 
establish a pattern and he'll
demonstrate<00:01:37.969> just<00:01:38.090> more<00:01:38.569> or<00:01:38.630> less<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.869> kick

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
demonstrate just more or less the kick

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.719 
demonstrate just more or less the kick
drum<00:01:39.079> pattern<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:39.799> then<00:01:39.889> I'll<00:01:39.979> lock<00:01:40.249> up<00:01:40.279> and

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
drum pattern and then I'll lock up and

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.609 
drum pattern and then I'll lock up and
open<00:01:41.299> up<00:01:41.389> my<00:01:41.569> baseline<00:01:42.109> because<00:01:42.289> if<00:01:42.380> i<00:01:42.409> play

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
open up my baseline because if i play

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.889 
open up my baseline because if i play
constant<00:01:43.189> eighth<00:01:43.369> notes<00:01:43.700> it's<00:01:44.299> great<00:01:44.569> it's<00:01:44.810> a

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
constant eighth notes it's great it's a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.080 
constant eighth notes it's great it's a
real<00:01:45.169> sturdy<00:01:45.469> sound<00:01:45.889> but<00:01:46.579> I'm<00:01:46.609> not<00:01:46.789> leaving<00:01:47.029> a

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
real sturdy sound but I'm not leaving a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.609 
real sturdy sound but I'm not leaving a
lot<00:01:47.179> of<00:01:47.299> space<00:01:47.509> for<00:01:47.539> other<00:01:47.840> things<00:01:48.139> to<00:01:48.259> come<00:01:48.439> in

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
lot of space for other things to come in

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.050 
lot of space for other things to come in
it's<00:01:48.829> a<00:01:48.979> different<00:01:49.099> sound<00:01:49.459> so<00:01:49.819> we'll

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
it's a different sound so we'll

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.159 
it's a different sound so we'll
demonstrate<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.719> he's<00:01:50.959> going<00:01:51.079> to

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:51.169 
demonstrate this he's going to

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:53.620 
demonstrate this he's going to
demonstrate<00:01:51.349> the<00:01:51.859> different<00:01:52.520> kick<00:01:53.240> drum

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
demonstrate the different kick drum

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:29.440 
demonstrate the different kick drum
patterns<00:01:53.990> he<00:01:54.079> could<00:01:54.200> play<00:01:54.319> on<00:01:54.469> this

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.210 

okay<00:02:30.450> now<00:02:30.690> if<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.140> noticed<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.860> got<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.100> little

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
okay now if you noticed it got a little

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.530 
okay now if you noticed it got a little
busier<00:02:32.640> that's<00:02:32.850> because<00:02:33.120> we're<00:02:33.270> playing

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
busier that's because we're playing

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.150 
busier that's because we're playing
sixteenth<00:02:34.110> notes<00:02:34.380> one<00:02:34.950> two<00:02:35.400> three<00:02:35.640> and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
sixteenth notes one two three and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.440 
sixteenth notes one two three and
da-da-da-da-da<00:02:38.160> why<00:02:38.970> does<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.150> work

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
da-da-da-da-da why does that work

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.910 
da-da-da-da-da why does that work
because<00:02:39.750> if<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.930> sub<00:02:40.140> 2<00:02:40.260> by<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.410> eighth<00:02:40.650> notes

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
because if you sub 2 by the eighth notes

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.490 
because if you sub 2 by the eighth notes
in<00:02:41.070> half<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.520> get<00:02:41.640> sixteenth<00:02:42.180> notes<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
in half you get sixteenth notes so the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.810 
in half you get sixteenth notes so the
groove<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:43.890> we're<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.160> play<00:02:44.370> here<00:02:44.730> is

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
groove that we're going to play here is

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.010 
groove that we're going to play here is
going<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:44.970> be<00:02:45.060> predominantly<00:02:45.600> an<00:02:45.720> eighth<00:02:45.990> note

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
going to be predominantly an eighth note

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.980 
going to be predominantly an eighth note
driven<00:02:46.680> groove<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:47.730> we'll<00:02:47.910> sprinkle<00:02:48.210> in<00:02:48.450> 16

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
driven groove but we'll sprinkle in 16

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.200 
driven groove but we'll sprinkle in 16
for<00:02:49.260> some<00:02:49.410> variety<00:02:49.890> now<00:02:50.400> we'll<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.760> jam

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
for some variety now we'll have a jam

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.300 
for some variety now we'll have a jam
track<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.750> will<00:02:51.780> have<00:02:51.960> two<00:02:52.200> sections<00:02:52.680> so

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
track that will have two sections so

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.760 
track that will have two sections so

okay<00:04:30.110> so<00:04:30.800> this<00:04:31.039> is<00:04:31.280> how<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.460> would<00:04:31.729> build<00:04:32.000> a

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
okay so this is how you would build a

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.510 
okay so this is how you would build a
basic<00:04:32.570> track<00:04:33.050> playing<00:04:33.740> on<00:04:33.919> top<00:04:34.190> of<00:04:34.370> this

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
basic track playing on top of this

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.550 
basic track playing on top of this
you've<00:04:34.789> got<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.970> find<00:04:35.330> spots<00:04:35.720> where<00:04:36.289> what<00:04:36.440> you

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
you've got to find spots where what you

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.650 
you've got to find spots where what you
play<00:04:36.740> makes<00:04:37.010> sense<00:04:37.330> we're<00:04:38.330> going<00:04:38.449> to<00:04:38.510> go<00:04:38.630> ahead

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
play makes sense we're going to go ahead

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.150 
play makes sense we're going to go ahead
and<00:04:39.139> then<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.320> next<00:04:39.350> segment<00:04:39.710> give<00:04:39.979> you<00:04:40.039> the

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
and then the next segment give you the

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.910 
and then the next segment give you the
whole<00:04:40.280> jam<00:04:40.610> track
