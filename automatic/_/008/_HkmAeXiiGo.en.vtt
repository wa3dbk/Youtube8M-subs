00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.860 
and not just a one-night experience but
this<00:03:20.099> is<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.280> chance<00:03:20.939> where<00:03:21.239> they<00:03:21.359> can<00:03:21.540> begin<00:03:21.840> to

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
this is a chance where they can begin to

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.479 
this is a chance where they can begin to
build<00:03:22.079> relationships<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.220> will<00:03:23.310> actually

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
build relationships that will actually

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.030 
build relationships that will actually
sustain<00:03:24.090> them<00:03:24.359> throughout<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.200> week<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.859> see

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
sustain them throughout the week to see

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.470 
sustain them throughout the week to see
the<00:03:26.189> way<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.340> that's<00:03:26.549> grown<00:03:26.879> over<00:03:27.090> 10<00:03:27.299> years

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
the way that that's grown over 10 years

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.030 
the way that that's grown over 10 years
and<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.840> think<00:03:27.989> about<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.439> kind<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.680> impact

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
and to think about the kind of impact

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.800 
and to think about the kind of impact
that<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.639> ministry<00:03:29.939> will<00:03:30.209> continue<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:30.689> have

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
that this ministry will continue to have

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.569 
that this ministry will continue to have
on<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:30.959> campus<00:03:31.349> you<00:03:31.590> know<00:03:31.709> ten<00:03:31.919> years<00:03:32.099> later<00:03:32.370> I

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
on the campus you know ten years later I

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.009 
on the campus you know ten years later I
just<00:03:32.760> really<00:03:33.150> think<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.510> potential<00:03:33.810> is

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
just really think the potential is

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:48.120 
just really think the potential is
unlimited

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.190
