00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.639
 hello friends today I'm going to make a corvina 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:13.129
 baked as you will see is a very fish 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.990
 cool pretty good and fairly 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.990
 moderate creative 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.380
 I cut with four legs are like that in 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:30.500
 same very fat slices 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.720
 leezza leezza half onion salt oil and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.390
 a little bit of white wine and the moment 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:40.670
 in the microwave to leave 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:43.940
 making time the microwaves capped it 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.360
 with him in a microwave cover that 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.640
 if you have this from the pins of this one with 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.640
 better cover that is made better 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.829
 then the potatoes and onions 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.969
 they throw half done 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.649
 when they are fenced together with the 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.140
 croaker with the fish I put them for 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.790
 here around and then like the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.560
 fish needs very little time in the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.720
 oven because other causes right away 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.119
 man in one is coordinated 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.220
 great than a smaller lawyer or 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.500
 a smaller routine needs less 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.920
 not time but let's see the fish 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.360
 it's very fast then I put it 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.130
 here in the oven up on the green the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.060
 band does not go up high 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.710
 I put only the grill to maximum 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.500
 power 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.890
 the gray without air 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.729
 and then it is done very well it is done 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.909
 it quickly does not stain passion and cans 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.119
 of microwaves are half done 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.670
 I have never said that while I have 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.030
 Little croaker the pupil because it is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.049
 quite big and apart from I promise everything 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.149
 together but because they are golden or golden 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.049
 ordinas that are smaller because they are 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.369
 fattest forwarded a little while before 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.819
 now it's out the potatoes the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.269
 microwave is out on the edge of the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.540
 oven that is a little bit netza and now 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:22.760
 it's all half done I put it up 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.760
 to open at full power 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:36.220
 at full power and I leave it as you 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.050
 I'm going to tell you to wear twenty 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.990
 minutes with yourselves you see it 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.400
 when it's done I can not tell you 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.040
 Exactly because it's what I told you 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.870
 before, a golden one that is more 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.350
 little one because in a moment it is made 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.380
 is your operators and when you see that 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.580
 it's made you do not need to know you do not 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.060
 It needs a lot to be done just 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.340
 together and then when we make 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.970
 we throw a rehash but let's make 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.030
 a voice a famous parsley a little bit of 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.270
 vinegar and some prawns and we make that 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.200
 rehashed and we throw collective 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.620
 the croaker I'm about to finish and 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.060
 we are doing the masters 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.060
 look at the eyes 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.959
 and the prawns 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.210
 how many 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.240
 then we missed at the last minute 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.020
 parsley and a little bit of vinegar and now 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.730
 whereas before 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:52.280
 let's take it out with her and it 's done 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.280
 we had about 20 minutes maximum 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.610
 you see 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.659
 with this as a garage this order 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.659
 they lived in a small 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.630
 and the little eyes come out very fast and 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.630
 the antler pumps 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.580
 now let's pay 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.580
 because to this 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.810
 nothing 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.470
 well, it's great 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.480
 established to give to the coordinator 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.140
 next 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.140
 s 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:55.980
 a great candle 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.980
 to the old night for Christmas now 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.080
 so that very little oil is made and then 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.080
 how is it so big 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.340
 ah 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:18.400
 the room coordinates are already finished 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:21.050
 I hope you like it and happy Christmas 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.889
 all with a lot of love 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.889
 And until next time
