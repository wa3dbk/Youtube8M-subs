end of the season I think we'll going up
season<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:30.929> episode<00:00:31.320> number<00:00:31.380> eight<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> then

seasons<00:00:32.640> he<00:00:32.730> will<00:00:32.850> start<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
seasons he will start so that is that

just<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.130> you're<00:00:35.250> interested<00:00:35.850> how<00:00:36.000> many

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
just for if you're interested how many

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.340 
just for if you're interested how many
you<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.510> sort<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.809> where<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.050> are<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
you know sort of where we are on the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.510 
you know sort of where we are on the
season<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.710> kind<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> obvious<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.430> we're

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
season it's kind of obvious that we're

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.310 
season it's kind of obvious that we're
near<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.730> end<00:00:38.820> because<00:00:39.030> terms<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.140> fun

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
near the end because terms like fun

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.229 
near the end because terms like fun
obviously<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.010> that's<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.460> lemonade<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.030> nil

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
obviously so that's that lemonade to nil

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
obviously so that's that lemonade to nil
