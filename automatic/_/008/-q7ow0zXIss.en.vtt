00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
something you can really quickly do that

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.460 
something you can really quickly do that
so<00:05:58.050> I'm<00:05:58.169> going<00:05:58.320> to<00:05:58.380> say<00:05:58.770> save<00:05:59.190> and<00:05:59.220> preview<00:06:00.470> so

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
so I'm going to say save and preview so

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.080 
so I'm going to say save and preview so
this<00:06:01.680> is<00:06:01.830> going<00:06:02.010> to<00:06:02.190> preview<00:06:02.550> this<00:06:02.760> and<00:06:02.820> now<00:06:03.060> I

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
this is going to preview this and now I

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.250 
this is going to preview this and now I
can<00:06:03.300> look<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:03.600> see<00:06:03.780> what<00:06:03.930> this<00:06:04.050> would

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
can look and see what this would

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.620 
can look and see what this would
probably<00:06:04.440> look<00:06:04.860> like<00:06:04.919> on<00:06:05.340> my<00:06:05.729> blog<00:06:06.030> now<00:06:06.510> it

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
probably look like on my blog now it

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.450 
probably look like on my blog now it
doesn't<00:06:06.960> have<00:06:07.080> all<00:06:07.289> my<00:06:07.500> style<00:06:07.979> sheet<00:06:08.310> and

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
doesn't have all my style sheet and

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.370 
doesn't have all my style sheet and
doesn't<00:06:08.729> have<00:06:08.850> my<00:06:09.030> blogs<00:06:09.479> theme<00:06:09.870> so<00:06:10.110> it's<00:06:10.229> not

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
doesn't have my blogs theme so it's not

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.260 
doesn't have my blogs theme so it's not
exactly<00:06:10.560> accurate<00:06:11.160> but<00:06:11.850> it<00:06:11.940> gives<00:06:12.030> you<00:06:12.240> a

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
exactly accurate but it gives you a

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.940 
exactly accurate but it gives you a
close<00:06:12.900> look<00:06:13.140> at<00:06:13.289> what<00:06:13.410> it<00:06:13.500> would<00:06:13.620> probably

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
close look at what it would probably

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.700 
close look at what it would probably
look<00:06:14.190> like<00:06:14.520> once<00:06:15.030> everything<00:06:15.570> is<00:06:15.750> done<00:06:16.110> so

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
look like once everything is done so

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.770 
look like once everything is done so
i'll<00:06:16.860> say<00:06:17.070> then<00:06:17.340> now<00:06:17.789> i<00:06:17.850> can<00:06:18.090> always<00:06:18.330> go<00:06:18.630> in

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
i'll say then now i can always go in

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.659 
i'll say then now i can always go in
here<00:06:19.020> and<00:06:19.050> hit<00:06:19.380> save<00:06:19.650> and<00:06:19.710> i<00:06:20.039> could<00:06:20.190> publish<00:06:20.550> it

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
here and hit save and i could publish it

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.640 
here and hit save and i could publish it
if<00:06:20.760> I<00:06:20.850> want<00:06:21.090> or<00:06:21.270> I<00:06:21.330> can<00:06:22.110> do<00:06:22.229> something<00:06:22.440> else

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
if I want or I can do something else

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.560 
if I want or I can do something else
like<00:06:22.950> this<00:06:23.190> card<00:06:23.460> and<00:06:23.669> up<00:06:24.120> here<00:06:24.150> you'll<00:06:24.510> see
