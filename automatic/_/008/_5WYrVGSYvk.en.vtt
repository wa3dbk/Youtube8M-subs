00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.929
 Christoph Kramer did not have himself 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.359
 on the list 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.470
 now the main character is on the dfb 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.150
 press conference 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.250
 out of the blue in the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.440
 training camp could be the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.639
 now from funbach to zum 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.800
 become a permanent burner 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.400
 at the moment he has already achieved more than 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.689
 he dared to dream I am 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.609
 very happy to be here 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.840
 that was a big thing for me 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.130
 surprise because I did not get so 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.349
 the screen had that after the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.750
 30s squad can somehow change or 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.120
 may and therefore it was a giant 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.540
 surprise for me and I have already 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 I often emphasize it as somehow as 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.570
 Bonus or confirmation for one for one 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.420
 good season I've played in 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.989
 gladbach and since I was want me now 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.820
 build up no artificial pressure or 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.489
 any requirements make the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.020
 national coach is a big fan of the 23 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.180
 year old he had days ago 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.710
 hinted that Kramer has good chances 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.750
 to attend the wm 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.940
 khedira and schweinsteiger are looking for 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.109
 injuries are her form lars bender 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.730
 already left 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.549
 it is recommended as a kramer 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.890
 healthy and fit he runs on average 13 km 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.030
 per game as much as no one else in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.799
 the bundesliga where we are as in every game 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.250
 to give everything I think like everyone 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.200
 athlete or footballer that also does and 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.090
 then it's just that I'm scary 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.720
 high actionism and try violence 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.369
 to help 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 and that's why it comes a little bit 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.549
 that I walk a lot, whether that is always 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.200
 It makes sense that I have so much 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.049
 Run that I also set it 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.869
 certainly also gives way unnecessary 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.729
 and I could have saved 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.290
 bright and pleasant as it looks 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.360
 the gladbacher the private completely 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.369
 unusual and old-fashioned diary 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.439
 Cramer leads his footballing life 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.850
 grabs the task national team 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.070
 pretty bland on 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.200
 without being overbearing asked for 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.860
 his running event he equals his 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.170
 weaken with 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.149
 how it happened I do not know 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.439
 maybe they are genes 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.380
 I do not find it really difficult to walk 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.180
 but other things so if I yes 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.780
 in the power room then we take the top 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.550
 and then I see that I'm there yet 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.440
 a few deficits 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.800
 on the second june, the national coach 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.580
 his squad from 26 to 23 man 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.350
 to reduce 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.300
 it is very likely that kramer 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.340
 survives this path and with 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.760
 That is why he is taking off from Brazil 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.760
 but not
