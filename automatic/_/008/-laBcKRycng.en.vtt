no body week times this divided by this

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.060 
no body week times this divided by this
it<00:04:35.610> was<00:04:35.970> all<00:04:36.180> literally<00:04:36.870> as<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.560> go<00:04:37.770> we

adjustments<00:04:39.930> as<00:04:40.020> we<00:04:40.139> watch<00:04:40.290> had<00:04:40.889> a<00:04:40.919> small

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
adjustments as we watch had a small

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.740 
adjustments as we watch had a small
offseason<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:41.910> would<00:04:42.090> help<00:04:42.240> him<00:04:42.389> improve

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
offseason that would help him improve

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.050 
offseason that would help him improve
where<00:04:43.290> he<00:04:43.440> didn't<00:04:43.680> get<00:04:43.830> that<00:04:44.100> okay<00:04:44.610> he<00:04:44.760> bucked

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
where he didn't get that okay he bucked

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
where he didn't get that okay he bucked
up<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.240> little<00:04:45.449> bit<00:04:45.540> he<00:04:45.600> kept<00:04:45.690> getting<00:04:45.810> bigger

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
up a little bit he kept getting bigger

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.540 
up a little bit he kept getting bigger
and<00:04:46.229> bigger<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.560> bigger<00:04:46.680> but<00:04:47.250> he<00:04:47.340> wasn't

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
and bigger and bigger but he wasn't

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.100 
and bigger and bigger but he wasn't
getting<00:04:47.729> fatter<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.330> then<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:48.870> were<00:04:48.930> launched

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
getting fatter and then we were launched

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.560 
getting fatter and then we were launched
into<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.740> cut<00:04:49.949> ten<00:04:50.220> weeks<00:04:50.430> out<00:04:50.639> and<00:04:50.880> as

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
into the the cut ten weeks out and as

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.510 
into the the cut ten weeks out and as
that<00:04:52.229> cut<00:04:52.440> went<00:04:52.650> along<00:04:52.860> we<00:04:53.070> noticed<00:04:53.370> within

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
that cut went along we noticed within

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.610 
that cut went along we noticed within
you<00:04:54.120> know<00:04:54.240> six<00:04:54.780> weeks<00:04:55.020> he<00:04:55.199> was<00:04:55.290> pretty<00:04:55.530> much

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
you know six weeks he was pretty much

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.320 
you know six weeks he was pretty much
almost<00:04:55.830> ready<00:04:56.160> so<00:04:56.729> then<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:56.880> got<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.090> tone<00:04:57.300> it

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
almost ready so then you got to tone it

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.150 
almost ready so then you got to tone it
down<00:04:57.479> a<00:04:57.630> notch<00:04:57.960> you<00:04:58.500> just<00:04:58.650> say<00:04:58.710> okay<00:04:58.889> what's

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
down a notch you just say okay what's

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.560 
down a notch you just say okay what's
happening<00:04:59.340> now<00:04:59.729> we<00:04:59.789> need<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.060> push<00:05:00.270> harder

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
happening now we need to push harder

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.000 
happening now we need to push harder
with<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:01.350> know<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.530> training<00:05:01.860> in<00:05:01.949> the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
with the you know the training in the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.469 
with the you know the training in the
gym<00:05:02.039> maybe<00:05:02.460> push<00:05:02.699> harder<00:05:02.970> with<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.150> cardio

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
gym maybe push harder with the cardio

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.240 
gym maybe push harder with the cardio
for<00:05:03.660> this<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.050> everything<00:05:04.740> had<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.860> be<00:05:04.949> time

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
for this and everything had to be time

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.730 
for this and everything had to be time
so<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.699> he<00:05:05.729> would<00:05:05.940> peak<00:05:06.090> on<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.419> day

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
so that he would peak on that day

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.900 
so that he would peak on that day
perfectly<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:07.979> then<00:05:08.310> we<00:05:08.370> tried<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.639> suck<00:05:08.820> him

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
perfectly and then we tried to suck him

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.070 
perfectly and then we tried to suck him
down<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.150> bantamweight<00:05:09.479> which<00:05:09.720> could<00:05:09.960> have

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
down to bantamweight which could have

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.840 
down to bantamweight which could have
backfired<00:05:10.289> drastically<00:05:11.160> but<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.400> idea<00:05:11.669> was

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
backfired drastically but the idea was

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.640 
backfired drastically but the idea was
you're<00:05:12.510> bigger<00:05:12.870> in<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.139> smaller<00:05:13.410> weight

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
you're bigger in the smaller weight

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.750 
you're bigger in the smaller weight
class<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:13.860> you're<00:05:14.220> gonna<00:05:14.310> be<00:05:14.520> already

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
class and you're gonna be already

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.029 
class and you're gonna be already
shredded<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:15.449> you're<00:05:15.990> better<00:05:16.320> off<00:05:16.410> your

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
shredded so you're better off your

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.710 
shredded so you're better off your
chances<00:05:17.400> have<00:05:17.490> better<00:05:17.639> off<00:05:17.789> there<00:05:18.030> when<00:05:18.600> you

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
chances have better off there when you

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.719 
chances have better off there when you
miss<00:05:18.960> that<00:05:19.229> that<00:05:19.710> cut<00:05:20.010> off<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.340> went<00:05:20.460> into<00:05:20.580> the

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
miss that that cut off and went into the

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.490 
miss that that cut off and went into the
light<00:05:20.880> weights<00:05:21.090> and<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:21.360> said<00:05:21.570> okay<00:05:21.780> we<00:05:22.260> need<00:05:22.410> to

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500
