00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.240
 when we talk about sustainability we 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.250
 we refer to the search for balance 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.010
 between what we consume and what 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.990
 we need to make an example so that 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.150
 what you understand is better let's say that this 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.760
 it's you and you're 20 years old daily 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 aerial consume 3,000 calories this you 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.659
 It provides enough energy for 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.640
 activities that you do on the day but 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:26.369
 what happens if you eat others I would put you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.140
 so fat you lie not so fat but 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.269
 if necessary to suffer 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.040
 health problems already having this in 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.020
 account we could compare you with the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.420
 planet suppose that the water of your 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.190
 body represents the water of the planet you 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.960
 you're 60 percent water and the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.750
 planet 70 percent water 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.329
 seeing it well is not much difference 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.489
 let's say that you are the planet then 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.690
 how much weight is the amount of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.760
 fat you have in your body 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.230
 would amount to the amount of waste 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.870
 what it produces in your whole life 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.940
 the daily average that you produce is 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.659
 a kilo of garbage and as you remember 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.539
 You are 20 years old and every year you have 365 days 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.850
 the 5 days of leap year 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.240
 calculations if each day equals one kilogram of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.540
 waste and until now you have lived 7305 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.250
 this would be seven thousand 305 kilos of garbage 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.049
 but as well 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.729
 so if we make a pile of everything 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.649
 that is discarded is as if you had 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.200
 spent what a giant eating a 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.360
 week this garbage on the planet is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.460
 equal to the fat of your body then 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.799
 Excess consumption hurts you so much 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.600
 to you as the earth and what is the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.640
 solution finds the balance between 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.189
 what you consume the waste and what 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.289
 you really need already knowing that it is 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.570
 sustainable let's talk about consumption and 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.700
 sustainable development when you consume 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.319
 goods and services have you thought about their value 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.990
 real or the impact on the environment 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.179
 what natural resources would be used in 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 its production or if the companies respect 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.990
 environmental laws or 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.759
 workers and what about the debris 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.159
 they produce where they end 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.440
 have a responsible management if the 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.539
 answer is not sustainable consumption 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.580
 have the solution when you consume goods 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.350
 and services take into account their impact on 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.390
 the environment wants them to be 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.340
 friendly for example when you buy 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.890
 something you have asked yourself what resources are 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.810
 use a consumption for their production 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.910
 responsible leads us to the development is 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.580
 say play the resources we have 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.770
 help 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.510
 keep it for future development 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.580
 sustainable also promotes the use of 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.890
 alternative energies like energy 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.450
 wind and solar but if there is a point 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.610
 key that touches the development of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.350
 population as we intend to reduce the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.350
 consumption of the population if it is increasing 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.780
 it is easy when in population it is equal to 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.240
 less needs to satisfy less 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.730
 production and therefore less exploitation 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.860
 of resources knowing this together we can 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.840
 find a solution and what can you 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.700
 do from home start buying a 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.920
 saving videos paints the interior of 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.930
 your house with light colors especially 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.060
 the white generating more luminosity 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.980
 use the water that the washing machine 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.690
 to unload the bathroom and take it in 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.550
 places that require water completely 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.550
 clean disconnect the appliances 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.590
 that you are not using would be a big step 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.260
 to keep our resources intact 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.820
 and you would be a generator of life in the future 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.920
 not very far the application of these 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.080
 tips would help decrease the great 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.760
 impact that we have already generated in forming 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.620
 all part of our society 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.900
 priority should be to worry about the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.880
 future generations forming those from 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.739
 house raising awareness about the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.360
 planet and that do not think only of them 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.400
 but remember the plan 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.750
 and make part of the change from the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.390
 classrooms with activities 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.190
 didactic that catch your attention to 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.440
 that the message is fun clear 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.540
 perfect and effective the most 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.910
 simple to contribute is to think before 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.820
 consume like ten people and discard 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.740
 like 20 good and what that has to do 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.450
 with Colombia as it happens that from the 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.640
 last century colombia has developed 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.740
 policies that favor some companies 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.110
 for extracting resources without 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.910
 import their environmental impact our 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.590
 country has been influenced by countries 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.540
 developed towards the path of 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.610
 globalization this has led us to a 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.680
 supremely expensive environmental consumption 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.390
 which causes the use of technologies 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.489
 obsolete which are very 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.170
 contaminants contributing to the 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.540
 uncontrolled urban growth 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.580
 causing toxic gas emissions in 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.709
 the atmosphere the water coating 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.750
 the stagnation of waste to the seas 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.220
 In general, high levels of 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.680
 pollution that negatively affect 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.320
 the quality of life of the inhabitants of 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.300
 cities and rural areas the effects 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.250
 negative effects of urban growth are the 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.870
 insufficient and irrational use of 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.180
 resources the rejection of the new 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.040
 Inflation technologies and difficulties 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.320
 for eating 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.450
 this is very difficult to finance 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.280
 environmental technologies losses 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.470
 social and environmental well as the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.530
 corruption makes adoption difficult 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.840
 of the most advanced proposals good and 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.970
 that we learned the development of consumption 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.130
 sustainable are key to assessing 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.230
 more precisely the needs of the 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.510
 society in terms of resources 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.310
 the instruction and expenses of 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.350
 these taking into account that the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.850
 societies must be able to spend and 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.560
 give back to the environment in a 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.480
 equitable without step to the 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.610
 overexploitation if this balance 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.860
 comes to break this will generate a 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.050
 environmental impact what would leave what 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.640
 we know how the ecological footprint the 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.600
 Earth has all the time in the world 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.600
 but we do not
