00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.390
 hello and welcome to the guide of 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.860
 proteins for our pro test said in 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.720
 this video i will test the m5 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.220
 extreme of these of the body then everything 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.620
 first of all it's worth remembering that this is 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.700
 the body to gmp certification so this 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.140
 which is a guarantee of quality 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.550
 so then this product has a 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.289
 peculiarity is that it is not a 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.000
 alone but two dietary supplements 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.660
 you see from the box in fact to two 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.460
 separate floors with an inite floor that 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.380
 in fact a stimulating product and a 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.210
 ettajdid which is a product rather for 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.829
 congestion so then you can 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.829
 mix according to your objectives 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.449
 if we talk in terms of dosage and for 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.329
 the inite product so for the stimulant 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.039
 we will find 500 mg of bethanie in 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.569
 beta alanine l helps to have more 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.569
 endurance and will arrive burns 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:48.460
 500 mg muscle is not enough 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:50.139
 dare but as there are also in the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.239
 part then of you will see at the end 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:54.789
 it will be very largely enough then 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.780
 we will find 150 mg of caffeine then 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.670
 150 mg 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.229
 it's a pretty low dose but that's 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.059
 correct it will be enough for them 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.709
 people who are very sensitive to this 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.270
 stimulating for those who have 

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:06.250
 the habit it will take a small 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.180
 little more and then we also went through 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.030
 example of tyrosine 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.940
 knowing that it's body advises to 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.650
 take one to two doses of vine and one 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.410
 traitor and nick so you see we'll get 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.660
 recover between 150 and 300 mg of caffeine 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.130
 knowing that 300 mg already starts at 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.470
 to make that big bumps 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.750
 then always for dosage but for 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.770
 the part then does it feel 18 serious 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.210
 in these divine g 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.550
 we will find three grams 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.620
 of carbohydrates and 5 grams of a mixture of 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.780
 creative with creatine nitrates from 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.340
 the creatine manpower then these are two 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.990
 fairly new creatine forms 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.090
 as a goal to improve the simulation 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.970
 of creatine but also to increase the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.260
 congestion so his skirt check is by 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.870
 against under the weight also check 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.120
 it is a risk of hypoglycemia since 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.720
 his creatine entry training g 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.659
 still a lot 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.939
 so he stays 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.069
 of hypoglycemia pardon which is enough 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.810
 important so that I actually see 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.630
 during the test if feel this 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.670
 hypoglycemia or not then we have two 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.850
 grams of alanine and so on the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.420
 is playing at the 05 or the program which also 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.069
 limits 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.360
 we're going to have two and a half grams to three 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.360
 Betadine guy what he started 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.709
 executives to make a pretty important area 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.330
 attention since the betanin to strong 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.810
 dose products like demos and 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.459
 itching to the ears or my face 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.280
 after we will have the aspect in management 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.390
 with 2 grams of clay to kg more than one 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.579
 gram of sick citrine 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.530
 taken separately to each of 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.819
 ingredients is fairly low dosage and 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.209
 cumulate together I think it will be 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.879
 sufficient 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.440
 and finally we have a gram of betaine that 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.579
 helps in particular to fight 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:41.390
 catabolism so I'm going to talk it's 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:44.030
 so a build dose fringe perfume 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.390
 I am here on a little over 250 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.769
 milliliters of water and I'm going to take 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.140
 you see everything tiny 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.690
 pods I will take a dose and 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.040
 half of binic because for me I know 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.040
 that normally that's enough 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.930
 a little bit of foam but very 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.340
 very light a little bit of deposits 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.950
 how do we actually find with the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.020
 most boosters of the not all 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.370
 just often it's creatine or 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.780
 some animated acids that end up 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.780
 sometimes a little bit at the bottom of each 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.480
 the taste is light enough not bad a 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.500
 little bit targeted not too sweet a 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.290
 little bit at nikko also 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.730
 but overall, it's pretty good 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.710
 in now or Bayonne finally 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.250
 shaker I'm going to train and then we get 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.410
 found at the end of the session so at the 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.470
 end of the season at the arm a small balance sheet 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.420
 hot m5 extreme of this door then 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.130
 already where it is very very efficient in 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.960
 congestion term really I have them 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.790
 I felt very quickly 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.140
 elsewhere as soon as the warm-up and during 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.270
 the whole session in a lot of 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.940
 notification then in terms of energy 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.650
 I also have a little more energy 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.250
 more stimulation but against 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.810
 it was also a little bit 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.550
 counterbalanced by hypoglycemia 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.160
 contract I had the impression of having a 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.310
 critical hypoglycemia small flat there 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.310
 above 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.500
 dekra think tank products for small 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.209
 flat on it in any case very very 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.720
 efficient in terms of congestion 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.460
 after compared to the beta the ninja tune 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.720
 fear of tingling and 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.770
 finally while I had 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.840
 virtually 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.199
 had she friends anything felt so 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.030
 positive also to attract in a few 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.639
 hours after vincent workout for 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.139
 a review of the test of the n 5 extreme of these 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.900
 then the body as said just 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.729
 the time quite efficient in terms 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.919
 of energy even though I think because having 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.000
 felt some hypoglycemia 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.770
 so it would have been even more 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.229
 interestingly I would say if he saw less of 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.910
 creatine on the other hand very effective in 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.560
 term congestion manager sees a very 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.240
 big congestion that's really very 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.760
 nice and after as I say everything to 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.040
 the time so a good mix pakumotu 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.930
 little bit the deposit no foam the taste 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.490
 is good though a little chemical to 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.300
 my opinion so now I'm counting 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.320
 go to the grids of 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.360
 proteins no matter what a topic 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.040
 derby tests for all the details on this 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.330
 product and on this test we advise purpose 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.169
 is the following and of course all our 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.169
 metal test 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.280
 no
