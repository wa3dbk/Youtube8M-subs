00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
for example from lush or sephora so it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.670 
for example from lush or sephora so it's
good<00:00:58.370> quality<00:00:58.580> stuff<00:00:58.970> but<00:00:59.690> it's<00:01:00.260> really

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
good quality stuff but it's really

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.860 
good quality stuff but it's really
expensive<00:01:00.860> like<00:01:01.670> it's<00:01:01.820> at<00:01:01.970> least<00:01:02.330> twenty

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
expensive like it's at least twenty

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.380

dollars<00:01:03.200> for<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.470> good<00:01:03.680> sugar<00:01:03.980> lip<00:01:04.250> scrub<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:05.210> I

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
dollars for a good sugar lip scrub and I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.050 
dollars for a good sugar lip scrub and I
thought<00:01:05.659> to<00:01:05.720> myself<00:01:05.930> why<00:01:06.830> would<00:01:06.860> anyone<00:01:07.640> pay

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
thought to myself why would anyone pay

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.810 
thought to myself why would anyone pay
for<00:01:08.330> that<00:01:08.420> when<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:09.500> basically<00:01:10.130> just<00:01:10.250> sugar

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
for that when it's basically just sugar

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.270 
for that when it's basically just sugar
in<00:01:11.210> kind<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.720> sticky<00:01:12.140> liquid<00:01:12.470> mixed

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
in kind of a sticky liquid mixed

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.520 
in kind of a sticky liquid mixed
together<00:01:13.460> which<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:14.390> rub<00:01:14.689> on<00:01:14.869> your<00:01:15.049> lips<00:01:15.290> and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
together which you rub on your lips and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.609 
together which you rub on your lips and
then<00:01:15.770> wash<00:01:16.040> off<00:01:16.340> or<00:01:16.549> lick<00:01:16.729> off<00:01:16.939> I<00:01:17.470> figured<00:01:18.470> out

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
then wash off or lick off I figured out

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.459 
then wash off or lick off I figured out
that<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:19.369> can<00:01:19.700> make<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:19.969> at<00:01:20.119> home<00:01:20.149> for<00:01:20.780> free<00:01:20.810> or

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
that you can make it at home for free or

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.950 
that you can make it at home for free or
for<00:01:21.770> really<00:01:22.609> little<00:01:22.999> money<00:01:23.240> because<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:23.780> can

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
for really little money because you can

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.959 
for really little money because you can
just<00:01:23.990> get<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.590> supplies<00:01:24.979> from<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.520> grocery

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
just get the supplies from a grocery

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.510 
just get the supplies from a grocery
store<00:01:26.390> or<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.659> drugstore<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:27.920> just<00:01:28.219> don't

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
store or a drugstore so I just don't

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.429 
store or a drugstore so I just don't
understand<00:01:29.090> why<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.329> think<00:01:29.719> one<00:01:29.840> would<00:01:30.049> want<00:01:30.289> to

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
understand why I think one would want to

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.489 
understand why I think one would want to
pay<00:01:30.740> for<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.729> sugar<00:01:32.119> lip<00:01:32.420> scrub<00:01:32.689> other<00:01:33.020> than<00:01:33.289> the

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
I know we all have that problem where

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.819 
I know we all have that problem where
let's<00:02:50.579> get<00:02:51.090> tend<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.510> get<00:02:51.629> chopped<00:02:52.019> up<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.500> dry
