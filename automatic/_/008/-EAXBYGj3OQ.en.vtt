trying this out because I have a lot of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.610 
trying this out because I have a lot of

try<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.879> didn't<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:58.170> anything<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
try this out I didn't have anything to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.760 
try this out I didn't have anything to
really<00:00:59.609> help<00:00:59.940> control<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.539> oil<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> did

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
really help control the oil but I did

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.660 
really help control the oil but I did
use<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.120> Smashbox<00:01:03.120> photo<00:01:03.270> finish<00:01:03.840> primer<00:01:03.870> um

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
use the Smashbox photo finish primer um

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.030 
use the Smashbox photo finish primer um
it<00:01:05.670> helps<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.390> kind<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.990> control<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> oil<00:01:07.590> but

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
it helps to kind of control the oil but

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
it helps to kind of control the oil but
it's<00:01:08.189> more<00:01:08.369> soda<00:01:08.640> smooth<00:01:09.060> lines<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.780> wrinkles

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it's more soda smooth lines and wrinkles

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.140 
it's more soda smooth lines and wrinkles
