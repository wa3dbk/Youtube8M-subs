 analyze 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.019
 Are you having problems with your systems? 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.060

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:14.700
 counted ok then this is a personal one 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:18.289
 cool thing is that I think it's cool in 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.560
 that is why I had from now on 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:25.620
 I hope it works and I hope it too. 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.889
 that helps a lot of people out there with fps 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.949
 down some low fps lines put 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.889
 the netbook notebook is is a thing even 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.240

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.250
 Staying there stays a must of 10 more 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.400
 sometimes it's 30 and you can play a 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:54.449
 a little but in some notebooks too 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.680
 that they are not that good to play and is 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.220
 that's right 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.710
 if you have some bass fps problem 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.120
