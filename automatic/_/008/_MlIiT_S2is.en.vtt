00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
well a little line right there seemed

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.039 
well a little line right there seemed
tightening<00:01:47.590> up<00:01:47.710> don't<00:01:47.890> worry<00:01:48.479> yeah<00:01:49.479> so<00:01:49.810> and

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
tightening up don't worry yeah so and

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.600 
tightening up don't worry yeah so and
then<00:01:50.170> in<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.380> evening<00:01:50.770> we'll<00:01:51.429> probably

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
then in the evening we'll probably

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.010 
then in the evening we'll probably
because<00:01:51.970> posed<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.360> us<00:01:52.420> about<00:01:52.569> the<00:01:52.750> leaf<00:01:52.869> so

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
because posed to us about the leaf so

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.690 
because posed to us about the leaf so
you<00:01:53.080> can<00:01:53.200> pump<00:01:53.380> out<00:01:53.560> some<00:01:53.799> lines<00:01:54.190> in<00:01:54.399> two<00:01:54.520> main

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
you can pump out some lines in two main

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.789 
you can pump out some lines in two main
lake<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.209> then<00:01:55.780> we'll<00:01:56.110> settle<00:01:56.350> down<00:01:56.500> in<00:01:56.679> our
