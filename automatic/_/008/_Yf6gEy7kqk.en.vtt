 just such a delicious slice of watermelon 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.609
 for weaving such a slice to us as always 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.960
 will need our slingshot hook and two 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.760
 rezinochek colors 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.060
 These are 9 rezinochek red color and 9 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.380

 take the red rubber band and wind it up 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:41.329
 three turns on the right column 1 2 3 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.079
 to make it 3 rezinochki 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.870
 then we will weave a pair of rezinochek 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:53.820
 take a pair of red gum put on 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.370

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.430
 we throw on 2 columns and throw off on the left 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.830

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.200
 rezinochki 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:07.549
 now we take a pair of green rubber bands 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.130
 put on 2 poles and discard our 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:14.680
 red rezinochki right and boldly 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.140
 column on the center now we are again 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.730

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.450
 here it is, we are already in the middle 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.690
 of three rezinochek we throw on the left 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.690
 column 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.540
 throw a pair of red rubber bands on two 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.540

 column and again we are our loop of 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:14.109
 which we will throw over again 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:19.090
 the left column we throw the last pair 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:23.439
 red rubber bands and throw off rezinochki 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.930
 left column on the center let's so 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:29.079
 carpenter we will press our rubber because 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.510
 that we already have a lot on the column 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.439

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:40.169
 red rubber bands on the left and on the right 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.169
 column 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.930
 then we throw 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.930
 one green gum 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:54.460
 and throw on it all our rezinochki 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.460
 from the columns here is the right column 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.870
 so here 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.000
 now we will remove the rubber from the left to the right 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.390
 became a column 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.380
 if alla posts on the hook tighten 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:25.990
 a loop as the inside of a sell 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.990
 our rezinochku on tightening the eyelet 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.770
 straighten our slice of watermelon 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:40.010
 so we do not interfere with rezinochka we can 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.380
 we can fill it with watermelon only 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.300
 hook up opposite side 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.310
 under our rezinochki on in inside 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:58.850
 grab this loop and stretch it 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:05:00.140
 through the midpoint so do not need to go there and 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:06.080
 fill in 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:16.970
 need from this side now to her lead 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:19.300
 our loop has turned out we have such 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.010
