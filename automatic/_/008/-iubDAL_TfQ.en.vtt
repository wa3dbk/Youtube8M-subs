00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
legs too high for a net-like 1990s and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.290 
legs too high for a net-like 1990s and
airflow<00:03:24.860> always<00:03:25.860> want<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.070> keep<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.400> medium

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
airflow always want to keep it medium

airflow always want to keep it medium
side<00:03:28.010> right<00:03:29.600> this<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:30.750> slight<00:03:31.020> change<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.380> it

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
side right this is slight change to it

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.479 
side right this is slight change to it
right<00:03:32.730> when<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:32.970> get<00:03:33.090> up<00:03:33.360> here<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:35.250> want<00:03:35.400> to

for the van people is something called a
coin<00:05:13.430> drop<00:05:13.670> we<00:05:13.850> just<00:05:14.440> one<00:05:15.440> handed<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:15.950> drop<00:05:16.220> it

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
coin drop we just one handed and drop it

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.820 
coin drop we just one handed and drop it
but<00:05:16.910> i'll<00:05:17.690> make<00:05:18.020> that<00:05:18.050> a<00:05:18.200> second<00:05:18.500> part<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.740> my

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
but i'll make that a second part of my

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:28.640 
but i'll make that a second part of my
tutorial<00:05:19.280> all<00:05:20.180> right<00:05:20.830> half<00:05:21.830> speed

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:49.399 
master the elbow drop the same position

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.469 
master the elbow drop the same position
you<00:05:50.209> ready<00:05:50.389> for<00:05:50.449> coin<00:05:51.199> drop<00:05:52.209> basically<00:05:53.209> coin

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
you ready for coin drop basically coin

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.339 
you ready for coin drop basically coin
drop<00:05:53.689> is<00:05:55.300> not<00:05:56.300> using<00:05:56.689> you<00:05:56.839> just<00:05:57.019> using<00:05:57.199> the

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
drop is not using you just using the

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.169 
drop is not using you just using the
right<00:05:57.529> shoulder<00:05:57.739> just<00:05:58.219> the<00:05:58.459> role<00:05:58.669> like<00:05:58.969> when
