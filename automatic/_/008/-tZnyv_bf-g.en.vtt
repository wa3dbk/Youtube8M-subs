00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.300
 hey ho people and welcome to one 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.130
 new tutorial yes I had in the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.109
 last video announced that we are now 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.500
 work with vehicles in the list 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.199
 want 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.760
 but since I think that for vehicles 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.130
 After all, you should know how to do that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.570
 I could change the speed 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.279
 say, let's start with this as 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.470
 small preliminary work to the vehicles with 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.810
 the speed so with vectors 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.640
 I would say we go here 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.890
 Last event we had here was that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.300
 the flair interact event that is whole 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.559
 practically because you can of course 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.410
 the speed of the player 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.410
 We'll change that first 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.739
 vector path away then of course stands for 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.340
 vector equal to new vector and now comes 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.050
 actually already the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.030
 most complicated part namely that we 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.520
 the correct import does not select the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.020
 from java, but from paquet and then 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.670
 we must first of all the iks 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.739
 give speed to i would say 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.710
 we set the iks speed of 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.449
 the player zero so soon as he 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 left-click right-click on a blog 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.560
 or in the air then that will do 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.080
 Here he is here with something 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.760
 Next, the y has interacted 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.490
 speed I'm leaving now completely 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.439
 fly high and with 20 provided 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.090
 no roof over your head would otherwise 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.430
 he would come across it pretty violently 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.960
 I say and now that's his name 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.520
 would be raging now 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.259
 speed up as soon as we fly 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 have gone assigned them this the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.950
 because so far we only have these 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 speed into a variable 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.990
 saved now we just go 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.540
 a point set velocity so for 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.159
 speed set then give 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.950
 the vector as just created 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.049
 And good is that we have to do that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.579
 Of course, not before in a variable 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.990
 if I'm always very practical 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.619
 you then adapt later 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.329
 can 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.939
 But we can also easily in the 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.880
 reinschreiben strapped directly new vector 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.020
 and then just our speed 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.850
 of course that's the case with vehicles 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.350
 that's exactly the same thing 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.820
 and then it was 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.260
 already here with this little tutorial 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.430
 I hope you enjoyed it and then 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.150
 Let's see in my next video 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.150
 skin in again
