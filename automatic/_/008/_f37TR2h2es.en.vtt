 most draculaurs which by the way eyes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 less languid than the doll itself and of course 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.670

 art and a brief description of the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.079
 fine arts course 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.480
 appears draculaura in the form of such 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.149
 typical artist in all bright with 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.370
 paints on the background of shelves with paints and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.110
 brushes in general, such a typical artist 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.299
 which is in progress 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.189
 and very carefully engaged in their 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.409
 but of course about fashion 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.390
 Draculaurs have not forgotten therefore his outfit 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.670
 It turned out just so bright but also 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 very fashionable hair in draculaurs collected 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.479
 in high tail and knotted normal 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.909
 black elastics also hair and 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.130
 decorates the bezel with two bows on 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.229
 sides and it's pale pale yellow 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.060
 the draculaur bang is very tight 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.530
 something even resembles a curl 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.900
 and also she now has not only 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 pink strand but bright yellow which 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.100
 echoes her rim and all her 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.900
 Draculaurs makeup was also made 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.970
 in the colors of her outfits 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.280
 since the shadow of it is yellow with 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.500
 thin-thin pink arrow and 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.659
 sponge dyed bright pink lipstick in 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.670
 ears of draculaurs where you are very cute 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.860
 hot pink crock earrings 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.110
 monster high dressed draculare in a very 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.210
 Cute dress in a pin-up style up 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.430
 this dress is yellow with stripes 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.500
 pink colored sleeves sleeves 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.689
 the top of the dress is decorated with pink color 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.430
 frill front we can see 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.740
 delicate pink bow from 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.990
 satin fabric skirt and satin dress 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.829
 bottom can see a yellow frill of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.750
 mesh fabric 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.140
 the skirt itself we can notice the print in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.380
 the form 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.180
 spray paint or spray can 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.490
 which draw on the walls over the skirt 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.530
 wear a pink apron with a print 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.940
 as if he was tied up with a web behind 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.040
 apron tied in black satin 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.050
 ribbon and if you want it is easy to remove 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.330
 and on draculaurs' legs they put on 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.250
 interesting shoes but in my opinion by you 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.250
 in not so much because her shoes 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.530
 white and jewelry and platform and 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.930
 heel bright bright pink to be honest 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.030
 the combination in my opinion is not so 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.920
 more with everything else but 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.989
 but in the design of these shoes pretty 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.000
 fun and interesting since the heel and 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.160
 the platform of these shoes is very unusual 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.320
 since made in the form of a tube with 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.780
 squeezed heel paint this tube but 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.880
 and the platform is the paint itself 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.800
 monster shard decorated side 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.630
 high from which stick two brushes 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.519
 soiled with pink paint 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.260
 as well as various rivets we already 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.090
 the front of the shoes is a bit like 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.519
 all chats and socks in general are 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.290
 nice but I have a very good color 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.120
 gamma in my opinion since on course 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.040
 draculaurs fine art 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.080
 listened to the fact that she painted her 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.780
 self portrait in hand she holds a palette with 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.970
 paints and in the paint in her in the same 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.890
 tones that made her whole outfit 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.930
 black and yellow pink and white 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.190
 and the palette itself is made as a heart 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.320
 since laura's friend 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.329
 nature is very romantic and in another 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.640
 You can see a white tassel on your hand. 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.890
 which is already stained brightly pink 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.260
 paint by the way the brush can be put in 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.000
 center palette so she is not terence but 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.680
 of course the very creation of draculaur and 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.750
 which is more like a child's drawing 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.760
 but here she had problems since she 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.010
 vampire she is not reflected in the mirrors and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.410
 she simply cannot see herself therefore 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.450
 and painted your self portrait from a portrait 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.579
 which artist painted when she 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.070
 was in ska mode but in general it turned out 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.110
 she is quite funny and funny and an easel 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.910
 in which pictures of draculaura are inserted 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.739
 also very beautiful and unusual 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.739
 since it is decorated of course 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.750
 a web of hearts a bat here 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.180
 front and top and bottom we can 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.010
 see the fangs like a real vampire and 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.540
 you can see the back of the legs so 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.549
 the easel will be great to put on flat 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.590
 Draculares are included 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.480
 Here is her cute little diary that 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.209
 all decorated with shards with bows 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.640
 in front you can see the tag with streaks 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.330
 paint and on which is written her name and 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.189
 also the monster high coat of arms 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.110
 back side of this diary such 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.009
 the same small little bows and all 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.659
 pink color 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.879
 inside we can detect records 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:33.009
 Draculaurs in different languages ​​each 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.569
 page in its own way framed on the first 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.110
 page you can see the coat of arms monster 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.150
 high 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.370
 and also it is possible to notice a heart on the edge 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.710
 with bat wings on the other 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.810
 page we can see the drawing itself 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.389
 draculaurs which is also such a little bit 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.050
 baby of course no no 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.000
 highly artistic on very cute 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.250

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.409
 magnificent other page all such 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.569
 Venka and polka dot roses are very nice 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.879
 and below we can notice hearts with 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.740
 bat wings another page 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.629
 also all polka dots and po sparks and a 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.280
 at the bottom of the page we can see that 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.440
 whose very portrait is draculaura 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.240
 painted myself and as far as I can remember 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.250
 only one artist was alive this is katrin 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.819
 de meow even by signature it can be understood that 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.110
 here one more window obviously worked 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.240
 joyful pink page 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.460
 and in the neighborhood we can notice such 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.830
 same drawing as draculaurs 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.289
 easel her self-portrait which 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.270
 combined with the portrait and graphs and 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.919
 gorgeous further we can see 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.370
 draculaurs attempts to draw her 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.259
 classmates are both their skeleton but such 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.300
 she has pretty funny pictures in her body 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.039
 primitivism i would say something in 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.229
 a nice little in it there is also the last 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.000
 pages we can see the image 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.949

 image and also we can see 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.610
 image of chainsaw which 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.719
 used and bit to create your 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.219
 izolda project 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:50.409
 and on the last page we can 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:52.120
 see quite strange straight even 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.430
 very strange image of itself 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.710
 draculaurus which nose where front a 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.900
 lips and eyes behind the general artist on 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.339
 such a very strange creative but 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.560
 the main thing that she is trying and somehow 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:03.940
 tries and now let's honor and and 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.740
 there is no record on the subject 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.330
 fine arts record number 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.610

 I want to draw a self portrait as 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.699
 creative project

 but how can I do this if I don't see 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.539
 own reflection in the mirror 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.520
 record number two will have to be copied 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.650
 my portrait record number three 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.900
 I finished the project and we are not sure 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.699
 how much can a portrait look like me 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.949
 be no need to draw relying on 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.870
 feelings are not on the appearance of writing on honey 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.060
