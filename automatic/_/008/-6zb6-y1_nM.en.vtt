that<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.490> trend<00:01:54.759> is<00:01:54.909> changing<00:01:54.969> a<00:01:55.479> little<00:01:55.539> bit

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
that the trend is changing a little bit

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.569 
that the trend is changing a little bit
like<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:56.409> guys<00:01:56.590> used<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:56.950> come<00:01:57.189> in<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.460> be

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
like the guys used to come in to be

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.550 
like the guys used to come in to be
really<00:01:57.850> hardcore<00:01:58.149> here<00:01:58.569> but<00:01:58.750> there's<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.409> much

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
really hardcore here but there's so much

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.600 
really hardcore here but there's so much
now<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.670> different<00:02:01.149> range<00:02:01.719> of<00:02:02.079> athletes<00:02:02.619> and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
now a different range of athletes and

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.709 
now a different range of athletes and
people<00:02:03.819> being<00:02:04.090> able<00:02:04.209> to<00:02:04.359> compete<00:02:04.659> and

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
people being able to compete and

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.449 
people being able to compete and
obviously<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.409> look<00:02:05.679> sometimes<00:02:06.159> it's<00:02:06.399> more

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
obviously the look sometimes it's more

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.550 
obviously the look sometimes it's more
of<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.729> YouTube<00:02:07.119> thing<00:02:07.359> so<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.170> think<00:02:08.319> the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
of a YouTube thing so I think the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.550 
of a YouTube thing so I think the
Internet<00:02:09.009> has<00:02:09.190> kind<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.519> changed<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
Internet has kind of changed the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.900 
Internet has kind of changed the
visibility<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.799> lot<00:02:12.010> of<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:12.190> athletes<00:02:12.610> and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
visibility of a lot of the athletes and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.089 
visibility of a lot of the athletes and
now<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:14.230> can<00:02:14.410> become<00:02:14.680> more<00:02:14.890> popular

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
now you can become more popular

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.330 
now you can become more popular
obviously<00:02:15.670> with<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.849> social<00:02:16.360> media

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
different athletes of the ear and I'm

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.160 
different athletes of the ear and I'm

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
it's just it's kind of cool to see

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.850 
it's just it's kind of cool to see
everything<00:02:40.030> man<00:02:40.270> progression<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.080> not

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
everything man progression and not

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.100 
everything man progression and not
really<00:02:42.430> falling<00:02:42.819> back<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.360> think<00:02:43.660> we're<00:02:43.810> still

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
really falling back I think we're still

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.199 
really falling back I think we're still
gaining<00:02:44.410> traction<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.220> bodybuilding<00:02:46.090> is

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
gaining traction and bodybuilding is

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.380 
gaining traction and bodybuilding is
still<00:02:46.480> relevant<00:02:47.080> at<00:02:47.800> every<00:02:48.220> high<00:02:48.370> level<00:02:48.819> but

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
still relevant at every high level but

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.270 
still relevant at every high level but
the<00:02:49.510> fans<00:02:49.780> here<00:02:50.170> are<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:50.680> they<00:02:50.920> don't<00:02:50.950> get<00:02:51.160> to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
the fans here are just they don't get to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.580 
the fans here are just they don't get to
see<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.670> athletes<00:02:52.030> as<00:02:52.209> much<00:02:52.450> especially<00:02:53.200> the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.800 
wonder what they're saying sometimes
but<00:04:28.160> I<00:04:28.430> guess<00:04:28.849> that's<00:04:28.880> part<00:04:29.240> of<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.419> game<00:04:29.449> and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
but I guess that's part of the game and

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.320 
but I guess that's part of the game and
it's<00:04:30.259> brought<00:04:30.530> more<00:04:30.800> attention<00:04:31.000> it's<00:04:32.000> given

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
it's brought more attention it's given

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.850 
it's brought more attention it's given
more<00:04:32.539> people<00:04:32.840> opportunity<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.620> think

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
more people opportunity and I think

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.740 
more people opportunity and I think
that's<00:04:34.009> what<00:04:34.220> what<00:04:34.520> this<00:04:34.669> is<00:04:34.819> about<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.360> Expos

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
that's what what this is about the Expos

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.659 
that's what what this is about the Expos
are<00:04:35.900> about<00:04:36.080> opportunity<00:04:36.650> for<00:04:36.860> people<00:04:37.009> is

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
are about opportunity for people is

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.279 
are about opportunity for people is
going<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:37.970> be<00:04:38.090> new<00:04:38.240> stars<00:04:38.539> that<00:04:38.720> emerge<00:04:38.990> every

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
going to be new stars that emerge every

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.670 
going to be new stars that emerge every
year<00:04:39.740> more<00:04:40.580> popularity<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.569> I<00:04:42.050> think<00:04:42.530> that's

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
year more popularity and I think that's

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.830 
year more popularity and I think that's
kind<00:04:42.889> of<00:04:42.919> cool<00:04:43.099> yeah<00:04:43.550> no<00:04:43.789> it<00:04:43.970> certainly<00:04:44.180> is<00:04:44.539> in

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
kind of cool yeah no it certainly is in

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.080 
kind of cool yeah no it certainly is in
again<00:04:45.139> you<00:04:45.650> know<00:04:45.770> this<00:04:45.949> this<00:04:46.009> this<00:04:46.759> is<00:04:46.819> one<00:04:47.060> of

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090
