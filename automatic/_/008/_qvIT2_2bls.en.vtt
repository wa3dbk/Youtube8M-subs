00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.509
 Welcome my ladies and 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.459
 gentlemen here at woodworks tv we are 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.890
 Today via the phone connected with 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.680
 hello hello to our author heiko resch 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.720
 andreas micro is about your article in 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.680
 the woodwork issue number 38 to 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.140
 theme works 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.119
 a few clever ideas came up 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.739
 how are you generally on the idea 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.570
 come to build such a bascule bridge 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.700
 I always have the bascule bridge 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.770
 annoyed that you can buy so finished 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.690
 either really very rickety 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.579
 or very heavy and unwieldy 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.710
 I just wanted to work well 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.469
 which fit exactly to my needs 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.749
 to have the right height and yourself 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.819
 easy to stow if not 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.109
 it really is needed 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.780
 amazing at the BÃ¶cke as the 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.210
 hawk together on 2 x 18 mm so 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.249
 very very flat very stowed 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.589
 friendly material still leave 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.280
 I connect like pine plates 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.739
 used 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.549
 this is a kind of plywood that is very 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.470
 robust but inexpensive and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.150
 is great for workshop furniture 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.430
 or use such blocks 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.220
 You've seen that with us 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.170
 Pictures which we parallel to the girls 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.180
 lateral and horizontal slots are 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.760
 the good one, you can at this 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.760
 workpieces secure carriage of all 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.710
 with screwing and you can too 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.660
 still insert this table angle 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.610
 in different positions so that 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.290
 these blocks to one 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.900
 Work table will be very 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.160
 flexible use and we also see in 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.320
 some of the video material 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.730
 application possibilities for 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.740
 Electric machines for hand machines for 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.150
 example for sawing there is this 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.040
 small trick with the flat chub 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.690
 Can you explain it to us? 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.180
 Angling into the table is a four 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.040
 millimeter loaded milled there you can 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.560
 then plug in flat bible 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.420
 they are a bit over and then you are 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.610
 tailors in this table angles 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.380
 you put in the worst case times 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.750
 a flat dowel you just easy 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.120
 Can replace and the table angle 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.300
 even remain untouched 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.259
 yes, that means she can be me then 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.899
 unconfirmed and not always 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.160
 the individual little blue ones very much 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.440
 smart solution as I think 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.450
 but also watches for example 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.880
 this year for no problem this too 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.380
 in the video see if you can stop the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.320
 Workpieces in all possible positions 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.390
 at these angles tight exciting and has so 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.620
 always the optimal working height and the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.390
 optimal working position you spoke 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.830
 just about flexible than small 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.090
 helper in the notes but flat the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.250
 connections are not a problem either 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.170
 right he can through the angle 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.900
 also hold parts very exciting exactly 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.550
 at right angles what he was working with 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.440
 flat which are very handy is yes 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.209
 Of course there is no extra 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.790
 tension boards in the workbench or 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.830
 Everything like that we see in the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.870
 Video sequence here that you see the bucks 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.070
 of course I can easily stow away 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.660
 but still assume that 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.820
 probably very often in use 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.880
 i have this role in the workshop 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.430
 as well as in construction site use always with 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.010
 because it's wonderful in one 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.510
 fit normal trunk 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.160
 and if you really do not 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.690
 does it hang you on the wall? 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.930
 so you can also in the workshop 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.670
 remain without taking away the space 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.360
 and there is no stability either 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.760
 problem 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.820
 I already had more than 200 kilos up 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.390
 his blog are therefore very stable very 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.950
 stable 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.019
 Of course we are looking forward to everyone 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.420
 case for this great theme in our in 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.090
 the woodwork issue 38 have in it 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.190
 I say thank you all 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.930
 for'm at and Heiko many thanks 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.500
 for the talk and until the next 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.519
 times 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.519
 who until next time
