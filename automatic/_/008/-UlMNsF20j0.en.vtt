00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.819
 very good friends of youtube today les 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.740
 I bring the unboxing of layer file 80-81 and 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.540
 It is a Chinese tablet that I acquired in PC 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.269
 factory approximately for the value of 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.320
 about $ 130 and promises some 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.600
 luxury specifications 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.280
 then back on the front of the box 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.930
 we can see a little of the 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.580
 specifications and we see that it's a 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.070
 8-inch tablet with a processor 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.470
 of four cores and the most disturbing 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.930
 that he has is just a gb of ram this 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.140
 tablet so let's see the content 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:39.809
 from the box 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.730
 let's see what brings us here I see myself a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.790
 little complicated trying to get the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.860
 box already brings another box inside with two 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.980
 compartments that can already be 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.980
 to appreciate 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.190
 so that it does not bring any achievement we are going to 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.500
 put him here to this side 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.269
 we're going to turn around and we're going to open the 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.910
 first compartment we can already 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.920
 then see that here is the tablet that 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.870
 is 8 inches that is wrapped in 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.510
 a plastic 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.430
 of gummy texture here in the second 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.380
 compartment we can see the usb cable 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.380
 micro usb nothing common 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.219
 here on your side we can also see 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.079
 the adapter to the current that comes in 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.079
 your corresponding plastic bag 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.270
 down the table I found something 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.880
 curious these typical silicones that 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.130
 They come in shoebox and we can see 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.180
 the instruction manual that come 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.180
 also wrapped in a plastic 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.649
 so from the box then it does not contain 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.710
 nothing else we do not find surprises 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.509
 so let's do it to one side and 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.670
 continue with the revision of the 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.810
 team components 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.510
 so first we have the manual 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.860
 let's open it and see what it contains 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.860
 inside it if there are some news 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.600
 that complicates me a bit of recording with 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.550
 one hand and do the unboxing with the other 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.760
 we open then we have precautions of 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.950
 safety precautions auditory we have 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.690
 a little bit of advice from the tablet 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.360
 components we see the back 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.240
 we checked no blank keys 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.580
 micros there are no office keys 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.770
 we do not find one again a 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.810
 manual that does not need a read for a 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.430
 user that has and manages with 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.930
 technology we can see a bit of your 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.910
 main specifications and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.060
 tell them that you accept a card 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.950
 microsd of up to 64 gigabytes for which 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.470
 could expand its storage a little 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.840
 we have that silicone then the host 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.590
 be a side let's see the charger that 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.390
 such well in a plastic bag 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.090
 d 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.650
 turn around 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.010
 then we take the charger here 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.430
 we see that it has a single connector that is 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.040
 the usb we have there to put the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.569
 current its weight is quite 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.720
 that is significant in the sense that 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.640
 It gives a good quality to the touch me 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.520
 surprised knowing that it is a tablet 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.720
 without the usb cable 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.720
 Nothing out of the ordinary 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.900
 usb 2.0 should I say it then now 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.040
 let's see the contents of the tablet 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.099
 who is coming 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.969
 bag of gummy texture and the first thing that 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.680
 we meet then is with a 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.439
 protective sheet that will serve for 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.250
 cover your computer screen or 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.890
 tablet is rather said 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.880
 let's take out the tablet 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.880
 from the sachet 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.420
 we find 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.040
 says the brand and this we can also see 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.200
 the camera and the card slot 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.180
 micro SD 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.250
 and there we have the intel logo and we see 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.170
 he would be the position in an explain that 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.270
 It seems aesthetically very ugly 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.190
 we can see that it also brings a plastic 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.660
 pretty scratched and we can see also 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.000
 the windows button the keys 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.850
 volume and the power off key on 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.680
 and blocking 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.380
 here we can see then at first 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.500
 place the 3.5 headphone jack 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.810
 millimeters 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.829
 the usb connector the micro hdmi and the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.599
 microphone the microphone sorry 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.960
 and we have the card slot 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.669
 microsd true I read in some 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.259
 comments that the camera of this team 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.259
 it really is an ornament 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.430
 on the sides we can not find anything 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.780
 the top and bottom forgiveness 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.090
 neither he 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.139
 the tablet in the weight engineer are 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.960
 approximately 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.159
 between 300 and 400 grams I do not know 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.229
 exactly 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:47.360
 I promise to find out and it seems like a 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.759
 a good quality tablet touch 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.139
 to be a good Chinese tablet if you 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.139
 liked the elect video above and
