bizarre creations team has been really

standing pools of water seems like every

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.910 
standing pools of water seems like every

time you want to hit the brakes there's

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.259 
time you want to hit the brakes there's
a<00:02:25.010> pool<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.250> water<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.850> have<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.090> deal

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
a pool of water that you have to deal

a pool of water that you have to deal
with<00:02:26.420> before<00:02:26.569> hand<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.200> adds<00:02:27.350> an<00:02:27.620> entirely

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
with before hand so it adds an entirely

new level of depth and challenge to the
racetracks<00:02:31.010> really<00:02:31.430> adds<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.790> lot<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.360> snow

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630

and ice effects are cool they're
probably<00:02:34.580> not<00:02:34.970> as<00:02:35.180> convincing<00:02:35.660> where<00:02:36.200> the

probably not as convincing where the

they're easy to drive it seems like the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
developers wanted to make the bikes very

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.150 
developers wanted to make the bikes very
approachable<00:03:03.930> when<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.800> comes<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
approachable when it comes to the

approachable when it comes to the

comparison of the bikes and the cars in

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.080 
comparison of the bikes and the cars in
pgr<00:03:07.440> for<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.160> bikes<00:03:08.370> are<00:03:08.520> faster<00:03:08.940> off<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
pgr for the bikes are faster off the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.850 
pgr for the bikes are faster off the
line<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:09.720> most<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.320> cars<00:03:10.530> are<00:03:10.680> going<00:03:10.800> to

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
line but most of the cars are going to

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.410 
line but most of the cars are going to
be<00:03:10.920> faster<00:03:11.310> than<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.520> fastest<00:03:11.910> bike<00:03:12.090> so

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
be faster than the fastest bike so

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.900 
be faster than the fastest bike so
they've<00:03:12.870> attempted<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.590> even<00:03:14.370> things<00:03:14.550> out<00:03:14.700> and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
they've attempted to even things out and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.940 
they've attempted to even things out and
balance<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.390> cars<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:15.959> bikes<00:03:16.200> out<00:03:16.470> but

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
balance the cars and the bikes out but

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.290 
balance the cars and the bikes out but
it<00:03:17.040> still<00:03:17.250> seems<00:03:17.520> like<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.850> bikes<00:03:18.030> are

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
it still seems like the bikes are

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.880 
it still seems like the bikes are
quicker<00:03:18.750> off<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:18.989> line<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.320> if<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.770> know

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
quicker off the line and if you know

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.990 
quicker off the line and if you know
what<00:03:20.010> you're<00:03:20.130> doing<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.459> get<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> lead<00:03:20.880> and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
what you're doing you can get a lead and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.930 
what you're doing you can get a lead and
