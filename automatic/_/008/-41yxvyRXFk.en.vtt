spring<00:02:03.149> loaded<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.569> the<00:02:03.690> carburetor<00:02:03.989> so<00:02:04.890> in

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
spring loaded in the carburetor so in

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.130 
spring loaded in the carburetor so in

order to eliminate the stress that the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.309 
order to eliminate the stress that the
spring<00:02:07.470> would<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.739> on<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.039> server<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:09.319> added

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
spring would have on the server I added

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.410 
spring would have on the server I added
another<00:02:10.380> server<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:11.190> porn<00:02:11.790> server<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
another server a porn server on the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.089 
another server a porn server on the
other<00:02:12.480> side<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.050> balance<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.650> out<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.950> make<00:02:14.069> a

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
other side so balance it out to make a

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.729 
other side so balance it out to make a
lot<00:02:14.280> easier<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.819> server<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.349> tends

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
lot easier for the server and it tends

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.339 
lot easier for the server and it tends
to<00:02:16.830> work<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.370> lot<00:02:17.970> better<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.870> doesn't<00:02:19.050> drain

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
to work a lot better as it doesn't drain

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
yet just wait we use of the high speed

stop receiving a full drop so overall

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.130 
stop receiving a full drop so overall
pretty<00:04:37.340> sturdy<00:04:38.340> design<00:04:38.660> it's<00:04:39.660> taking<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:40.020> lot

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
pretty sturdy design it's taking a lot

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.200 
pretty sturdy design it's taking a lot
longer<00:04:40.650> than<00:04:40.890> I<00:04:40.950> thought<00:04:40.980> to<00:04:41.400> build<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.760> that's

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
longer than I thought to build it that's

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.409 
longer than I thought to build it that's
basically<00:04:42.660> because<00:04:43.050> I'm<00:04:43.700> having<00:04:44.700> to<00:04:44.940> redesign

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
basically because I'm having to redesign

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.290 
basically because I'm having to redesign
things<00:04:45.930> as<00:04:46.169> I<00:04:46.350> go<00:04:46.380> along<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:47.040> most<00:04:48.030> of<00:04:48.210> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
things as I go along and most of the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.240 
things as I go along and most of the
process<00:04:48.780> is<00:04:48.960> thinking<00:04:49.410> rather<00:04:49.620> than<00:04:49.860> actually

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
process is thinking rather than actually

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.380 
process is thinking rather than actually
building<00:04:51.050> so<00:04:52.160> nine<00:04:53.160> times<00:04:53.190> out<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.640> ten<00:04:53.910> half

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
building so nine times out of ten half

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.790 
building so nine times out of ten half
of<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.630> time<00:04:54.840> it's<00:04:55.020> been<00:04:55.230> down<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.590> ship

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
of the time it's been down to the ship

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.920 
of the time it's been down to the ship
will<00:04:56.760> be<00:04:56.880> spin<00:04:57.120> thinking<00:04:57.570> about<00:04:57.720> what<00:04:57.840> I'm

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
will be spin thinking about what I'm

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.030 
will be spin thinking about what I'm
going<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.110> do<00:04:58.230> next<00:04:58.410> so<00:05:00.470> I've<00:05:01.470> been<00:05:01.650> keeping<00:05:01.950> it

going to do next so I've been keeping it

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.330 
going to do next so I've been keeping it
as<00:05:02.130> simple<00:05:02.430> as<00:05:02.520> possible<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.960> reduce<00:05:04.340> things

I'm very nicely as I found out and later
on<00:05:35.599> I<00:05:35.900> will<00:05:36.349> be<00:05:36.560> adding<00:05:36.880> two<00:05:38.080> roller<00:05:39.080> wheels

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
on I will be adding two roller wheels

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.240 
on I will be adding two roller wheels
under<00:05:39.680> here<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:41.300> keep<00:05:41.509> this<00:05:41.710> nice<00:05:42.710> and<00:05:42.740> sitting

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
under here to keep this nice and sitting

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.460 
under here to keep this nice and sitting
up<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:44.020> that<00:05:45.020> should<00:05:45.320> give<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:45.979> track<00:05:47.470> zero

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
up and that should give that track zero

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.330 
up and that should give that track zero
chance<00:05:48.860> of<00:05:49.070> coming<00:05:49.340> on<00:05:49.520> so<00:05:51.009> one<00:05:52.009> thing<00:05:52.160> to<00:05:52.250> be

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
chance of coming on so one thing to be
