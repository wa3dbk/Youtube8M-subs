00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
GoPro cameras with different lenses so

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.209 
GoPro cameras with different lenses so
pairs<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:38.020> cameras<00:01:38.409> would<00:01:38.530> capture<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.979> face

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
pairs of cameras would capture the face

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.809

in<00:01:39.460> 3d<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.749> body<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.340> also<00:01:42.340> pick<00:01:42.549> up<00:01:42.639> on

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
in 3d the body and also pick up on

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.029 
in 3d the body and also pick up on

visual markers around the room and the

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.469 
visual markers around the room and the
idea<00:01:45.310> was<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:45.520> you'd<00:01:45.789> be<00:01:45.939> able<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.149> capture

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
idea was that you'd be able to capture

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.050 
idea was that you'd be able to capture
face<00:01:46.840> body<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:47.469> even<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.189> camera<00:01:48.520> position

from a series of photographs but instead

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.110 
from a series of photographs but instead
of<00:04:10.870> just<00:04:11.140> using<00:04:11.379> still<00:04:12.040> photographs<00:04:12.640> we<00:04:12.879> used

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
of just using still photographs we used

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.759 
of just using still photographs we used
GoPro<00:04:13.569> cameras<00:04:13.959> and<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:14.260> way<00:04:14.409> we<00:04:14.650> could

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
GoPro cameras and that way we could

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.460 
GoPro cameras and that way we could
capture<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.909> full<00:04:16.180> range<00:04:16.419> of<00:04:16.630> expressions<00:04:17.260> as

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
capture the full range of expressions as

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.819 
capture the full range of expressions as
they<00:04:17.650> happen<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:19.780> capture<00:04:20.169> even<00:04:20.350> finer

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
they happen and to capture even finer

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.640 
they happen and to capture even finer
levels<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.459> details<00:04:21.850> such<00:04:22.090> as<00:04:22.120> skin<00:04:23.020> pores<00:04:23.289> and

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
levels of details such as skin pores and

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.980 
levels of details such as skin pores and
wrinkles<00:04:23.760> we<00:04:24.760> created<00:04:25.240> another<00:04:25.510> prototype

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
wrinkles we created another prototype

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.560 
wrinkles we created another prototype
device<00:04:26.620> called<00:04:26.949> the<00:04:27.340> plant<00:04:27.669> pot<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.419> it's

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
device called the plant pot and it's

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.969 
device called the plant pot and it's
called<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.870> plant<00:04:29.139> pot<00:04:29.350> because<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:29.800> actually

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
called a plant pot because it actually

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.129 
called a plant pot because it actually
housed<00:04:30.400> was<00:04:30.699> in<00:04:30.820> a<00:04:30.880> plant<00:04:31.150> pod<00:04:31.389> casing<00:04:31.900> and

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
housed was in a plant pod casing and

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.379 
housed was in a plant pod casing and
inside<00:04:32.740> we've<00:04:32.949> set<00:04:33.190> up<00:04:33.220> some<00:04:33.490> LED<00:04:33.820> lights<00:04:33.850> and

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
inside we've set up some LED lights and

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.689 
inside we've set up some LED lights and
its<00:04:34.600> control<00:04:34.900> was<00:04:35.199> a<00:04:35.229> Raspberry<00:04:35.740> Pi<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.460> some

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
its control was a Raspberry Pi and some

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.790 
its control was a Raspberry Pi and some
custom<00:04:37.060> code<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.139> idea<00:04:38.169> is<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:38.620> you

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
custom code so the idea is that you

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.760 
custom code so the idea is that you
could<00:04:39.100> put<00:04:39.340> this<00:04:39.460> onto<00:04:39.669> any<00:04:39.940> surface<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:40.770> by

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
could put this onto any surface and by

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.320 
could put this onto any surface and by
triggering<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.400> lights<00:04:42.610> you<00:04:42.910> can<00:04:43.090> capture

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
triggering the lights you can capture

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.060 
triggering the lights you can capture
still<00:04:43.780> photographs<00:04:44.380> with<00:04:44.740> different

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
still photographs with different

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.430 
still photographs with different
lighting<00:04:45.250> conditions<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:46.150> from<00:04:46.750> that<00:04:46.930> you

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
lighting conditions and from that you

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.260 
lighting conditions and from that you
can<00:04:47.590> create<00:04:47.710> a<00:04:47.860> very<00:04:48.190> high<00:04:48.460> res<00:04:48.699> normal<00:04:49.120> map

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
can create a very high res normal map

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.520 
can create a very high res normal map
which<00:04:49.570> captures<00:04:50.440> very<00:04:51.010> precise<00:04:51.460> details<00:04:52.530> so

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
which captures very precise details so

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.170 
which captures very precise details so
now<00:04:53.650> we<00:04:53.710> had<00:04:53.889> a<00:04:53.919> solution<00:04:54.430> for<00:04:54.580> both<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:54.970> face

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
now we had a solution for both the face

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.760 
now we had a solution for both the face
and<00:04:55.449> the<00:04:55.510> body<00:04:55.660> but<00:04:56.020> we<00:04:56.229> also<00:04:56.380> wanted<00:04:56.710> to

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
and the body but we also wanted to

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.129 
and the body but we also wanted to
capture<00:04:57.039> the<00:04:57.310> camera<00:04:57.639> itself<00:04:57.780> which<00:04:58.780> is<00:04:58.930> very

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
capture the camera itself which is very

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.070 
capture the camera itself which is very
much<00:04:59.349> a<00:04:59.380> part<00:04:59.650> of<00:04:59.830> visual<00:05:00.130> storytelling<00:05:00.760> and

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
much a part of visual storytelling and

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.409 
much a part of visual storytelling and
to<00:05:02.080> do<00:05:02.199> that<00:05:02.380> we<00:05:02.560> built<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.860> further<00:05:03.099> rig<00:05:03.460> on<00:05:04.210> it

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
to do that we built a further rig on it

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.290 
to do that we built a further rig on it
we<00:05:04.510> attached<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:05.050> GoPro<00:05:05.440> camera<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:06.300> portable

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
we attached a GoPro camera a portable

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.620 
we attached a GoPro camera a portable
LCD<00:05:07.660> screen<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.669> put<00:05:09.669> markers<00:05:10.030> on<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:10.360> on<00:05:10.510> the

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
LCD screen and put markers on it on the

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.719 
LCD screen and put markers on it on the
rig<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.229> every<00:05:11.710> nuance<00:05:11.889> of<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.340> camera

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
rig so that every nuance of the camera

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.850 
rig so that every nuance of the camera
could<00:05:13.389> be<00:05:13.539> captured<00:05:13.930> on<00:05:14.020> set<00:05:14.349> in<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.250> scene

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
could be captured on set in the scene

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.379 
could be captured on set in the scene
finally<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:18.009> capture<00:05:18.339> audio<00:05:18.519> we<00:05:18.939> rented<00:05:19.299> a

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
finally to capture audio we rented a

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.749 
finally to capture audio we rented a
wireless<00:05:19.779> recording<00:05:20.289> system<00:05:20.679> our<00:05:21.129> room<00:05:21.580> isn't

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
wireless recording system our room isn't

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.759 
wireless recording system our room isn't
soundproofed<00:05:21.939> but<00:05:22.689> even<00:05:23.049> so<00:05:23.349> we<00:05:23.649> were

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:23.769 
soundproofed but even so we were

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:25.469 
soundproofed but even so we were
pleasantly<00:05:23.979> surprised<00:05:24.610> with<00:05:24.789> the<00:05:24.909> result<00:05:25.239> it

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
pleasantly surprised with the result it

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.419 
pleasantly surprised with the result it
meant<00:05:26.319> that<00:05:26.469> we<00:05:26.559> wouldn't<00:05:26.829> have<00:05:26.979> to<00:05:27.099> record

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:27.429 
meant that we wouldn't have to record

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:30.179 
meant that we wouldn't have to record
audio<00:05:27.639> separately<00:05:28.529> but<00:05:29.529> we're<00:05:29.679> still<00:05:29.919> pushing

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:30.189 
audio separately but we're still pushing

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:32.189 
audio separately but we're still pushing
other<00:05:30.669> areas<00:05:31.269> and<00:05:31.449> other<00:05:31.599> types<00:05:31.959> of

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
performance capture these are highly

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.449 
performance capture these are highly
experimental<00:05:35.049> and<00:05:35.499> may<00:05:35.679> or<00:05:35.829> may<00:05:35.949> not<00:05:35.979> produce

results<00:05:38.069> with<00:05:39.069> just<00:05:39.339> a<00:05:39.459> few<00:05:39.579> thousand<00:05:40.119> pounds

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
results with just a few thousand pounds

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.149 
results with just a few thousand pounds
we<00:05:40.539> now<00:05:40.719> had<00:05:40.959> a<00:05:40.989> set<00:05:41.229> up<00:05:41.379> in<00:05:41.499> the<00:05:41.559> studio<00:05:41.799> that

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
we now had a set up in the studio that

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.499 
we now had a set up in the studio that
would<00:05:42.279> allow<00:05:42.519> us<00:05:42.549> to<00:05:42.849> capture<00:05:43.059> a<00:05:43.239> full

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
would allow us to capture a full

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.009 
would allow us to capture a full
performance<00:05:44.139> face<00:05:44.919> body<00:05:45.579> voice<00:05:46.269> and<00:05:46.599> cameras

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:47.019 
performance face body voice and cameras

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:49.859 
performance face body voice and cameras
we<00:05:47.619> also<00:05:47.769> hope<00:05:48.069> to<00:05:48.249> show<00:05:48.429> that<00:05:48.639> a<00:05:48.969> small<00:05:49.539> team

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:49.869 
we also hope to show that a small team

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:52.469 
we also hope to show that a small team
with<00:05:50.139> limited<00:05:50.800> means<00:05:51.009> is<00:05:51.759> still<00:05:52.029> able<00:05:52.209> to

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
with limited means is still able to

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.509 
with limited means is still able to
capture<00:05:52.719> high-end<00:05:53.289> character<00:05:53.800> performances

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:54.519 
capture high-end character performances

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:56.429 
capture high-end character performances
and<00:05:54.759> this<00:05:54.939> is<00:05:55.089> something<00:05:55.239> that<00:05:55.659> up<00:05:56.050> until<00:05:56.229> now

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:56.439 
and this is something that up until now

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.379 
and this is something that up until now
