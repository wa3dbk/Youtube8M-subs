00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.970
 yes , I should be champion again 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.679
 welcome to another 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.530
 idea on a channel and that was the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.690
 net time quite often asked hey what for 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.340
 a kilo you have the black ops 2 what is 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.980
 a favorite weapon which is up to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.480
 currently you are going to prestige because of me 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.670
 but already uploaded two videos 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 where I pressed prestige that wanted 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.289
 I finally make prestige here 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.630
 and yes it is my name here I am 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.550
 still in the second prestige level 55 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 nothing has happened yet 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.270
 but of course the playing time is down 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.520
 gone upstairs 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.320
 thus on my kills and all sorts 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.059
 and I just wanted to do that for a moment 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.070
 Show this video because I'm wearing now 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.239
 was often asked and just like that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.309
 a current statistic about my 62nd 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.190
 came history so that's what you can call it 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.520
 Let's date on barrack everyone 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.260
 logo for the people who are interested 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.910
 and if you have a game 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 should the motorcycle then you have to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.409
 okay the sheet metal and this 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.200
 this business card here 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.840
 somehow you have to do it for three minutes 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.780
 three flags in dominance halt caption 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.259
 So secure and has managed once 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.270
 really cool times even on history so 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.479
 I have a playing time of three now 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.610
 days 12 hours 31 minutes I know 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.799
 not how much it was where I found it 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.240
 selfishly pushed two there it was 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.090
 through a day or so and yet 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.400
 of course, has a few hours , of course 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.450
 however, done in time now 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 I have everything as a holiday season 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.700
 properly played as neat on 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:46.530
 definitely more than usual yes statements 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.009
 27 and 1988 kill death ratio so 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.930
 my kg is 3 32 I'm with it 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.990
 reasonably satisfied of course 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.479
 are higher if I aimed at the kd 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.790
 I would not care much about playing 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.490
 my also I have round where I am 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.170
 on a single card from or so and yes 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.630
 I mean , you can not 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.229
 somehow every gamer somehow like that 70-80 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.770
 kills also 100 plus kills and then 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.910
 somehow 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.710
 110 was simply not paid to stay 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.660
 but I do not care because the kd bring on 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.330
 Next does not say anything and you do not 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.160
 should play yes to have fun and the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.530
 I have too and that's why I'm talking 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.280
 at 542 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.810
 yes means sign ratio is 2 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.640
 74 was much higher too 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.520
 but I have to say lately too 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.670
 I am often saved because 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.200
 end the servers have laid so the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.420
 elektrik whole lobby just does not make 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.430
 I voluntarily go out or I am 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.540
 just in the lobby dreamed that kesha 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.250
 was almost over 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.480
 I think I'm okay out of this 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.160
 or they just do not get that way 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.560
 fucked or I was just like that 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.420
 bad but okay now 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.210
 Do you listen to both game finished like 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.250
 in front of you somehow the pc and human 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.800
 usually not fun agree that is too 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.470
 the point moderately, I am now at 3 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.880
 million 30,800 15 points per minute 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.700
 598 believe it was the last time 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.780
 I'm sure I've got the hang of it 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.959
 yes vitrine here nuclear and on 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.790
 Let's have a look at game modes Springmann 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.080
 first place then there is also 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.060
 domination conclusion damaged tdm 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.670
 headquarters free for all position 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.790
 and sniper sheep through me too 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:42.150
 pretty much current 216 really horny 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:45.120
 All weapons moderately currently plays with pleasure 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.250
 the pbb is actually my favorite 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.020
 but you could say so too 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.610
 in the kg of 322 mp 7 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.380
 speak one rarely to time so the 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.230
 I usually pick it up and play it 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.459
 then amazon.com really horny villages but 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.380
 I actually use too rarely 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.120
 I also like the sector at the beginning 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.810
 played but with the I'm even 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.300
 not clear anymore 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.209
 So it is then just 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.840
 wicked and it is not anymore 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.900
 your hd 50 will work fine too 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.750
 and all 94 a really cool 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.180
 weapons you have selected now 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.700
 just times out is indeed at the beginning 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.360
 a bit getting used to it but me 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.460
 will 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.719
 to continue a class and then 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.259
 will you see with that you can 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:36.419
 Actually really good gamble and yes from 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:38.069
 40 or other scene yes here equipment 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.939
 moderately natural is nothing at the start 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.870
 mister six times then greeted the 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.250
 handgranate 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.860
 but I have to honestly tell the black 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.610
 I hardly ever play two ops 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.870
 the comparisons with mw2 black ops 13 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.090
 I hardly use it here so I play 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:00.090
 with more in an arms tower more 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:03.840
 and get away for it and c 46 am 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:08.039
 channel is most commonly used stuff points 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.580
 as standard, the drone is the most am 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.830
 begin 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.930
 but I only pack one 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.159
 if I somehow drone controller 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.349
 blackbird of course somehow up 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.319
 have a high full-time games otherwise 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.849
 I always blackbird dogs and swam 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.469
 Here we see orbital here 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.900
 member already in second place 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:27.770
 then the controller lightning strike come 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.289
 hunter killer drone brightest 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.199
 Hundestaffel 146 times swarm exactly 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.409
 100 times even Merkels has made than 100 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.370
 hertz a mess so preamble even two 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.500
 degrees 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.870
 I saw the last apples like this 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.830
 is just really cool but 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.819
 thrown somewhere and even has one 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:51.870
 Just kill the funny recordings 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:53.520
 because they do not let go of nature 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.400
 bring you used quite often at the beginning 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.909
 how awesome unit less water i can be 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.080
 synonymous ne time long used synonymous times yes 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.360
 and I've only care 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.949
 get package 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:12.560
 well not so fine and yes all that 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:16.560
 rest ag rbi used and war machine 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.279
 through care package the drains can me 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.699
 not imagine 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:22.849
 I think it comes through synonymous 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.729
 through through how is it then 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:28.710
 sniper taken that was so from 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.779
 my statistics if possible 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.349
 you should be able to ask questions 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.349
 to write the comments 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.810
 you can put your music in the comments 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.760
 write 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.440
 or how much 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.210
 have the time is gone so that is the 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.820
 eureka perhaps for points per 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.169
 minute will interest you 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:50.190
 and i would say servus by the time 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:50.190
 next time your job
