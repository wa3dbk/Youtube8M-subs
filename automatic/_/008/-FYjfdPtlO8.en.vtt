00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.000
Hey Big Band, youre so stubborn. Lay off Ileum
already, she isn't interested in you.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.500
Well I regret to inform you that's impossible,
I'm her destiny, no doubt about it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Both of you, just stop it. Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's harsh, you don't have to say such a
thing. Real men compete with their hearts!

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Nice job.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.000
Nice work!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000
So Whitefin, how are things lately?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.000
Doing excellent, you know. Lab 8's Anti-Skullgirl
research is moving along swimmingly.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.000
Is that right? More hack and slash jobs?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Oh, cut it out! The second verse is starting.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.780
My sweetest gutsy girl, I'm in love with you.
And if you can't accept that, I'll have to

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.500
serenade and woo you once again.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I built you myself with my scientific prowess,
but a heart is more difficult to make.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.700
Enough, the two of you. Are you listening
to me at all?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.500
The tsundere in you is so charming. But real
men compete with their hearts!

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.500
love you love you love you

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.500
love you love you a lot

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.300
love you love you love you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.000
love you love you a lot

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.000
Wait a moment, aren't you forgetting someone?

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.000
Leduc takes the stage, sorry to keep you waiting.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.900
A-ah what? Excuse me?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
K-Y, K-Y, read the atmosphere, you dense little
man.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.500
If you get carried away I'll take you apart!

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.700
One Lab member is already too much for me.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.500
Stand down, Leduc. Know your place.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.500
In looks, we're only medium to low-class.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But real men compete with their hearts.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.500
Next time, compete with your face.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Ah, it's finally over, I'm exhausted.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.000
So, let's get the night rolling.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.000
Oh sorry, I have a lot of research work today.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.500
Smooth operator, why don't you let me meet
her sometime.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Uh, the mic is still on.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.700
Damn, that's no good...!
