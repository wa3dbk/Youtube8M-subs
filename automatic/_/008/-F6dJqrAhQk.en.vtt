 bitch and you may be right but
know<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> did<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.430> was

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
know that I did this because I was

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.270 
know that I did this because I was
really<00:01:12.299> really<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:13.140> afraid<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.130> rejection

really really really afraid of rejection

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.999 
really really really afraid of rejection
and<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.030> figured<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.200> thought<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and I figured that if they thought I

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.590 
and I figured that if they thought I
knew<00:01:17.460> them<00:01:17.759> already

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
knew them already

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.660 
knew them already
they<00:01:18.869> might<00:01:19.049> kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.250> they<00:01:20.430> knew

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
they might kind of think that they knew

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730 
they might kind of think that they knew
me<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.420> subconsciously<00:01:22.200> they'd<00:01:22.530> want

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
me and that subconsciously they'd want

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.160 
me and that subconsciously they'd want
to<00:01:22.830> live<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.729> expectation<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
to live up to that expectation of the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.560 
to live up to that expectation of the
