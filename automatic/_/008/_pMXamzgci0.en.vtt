00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.840
 very good today I show you how to prepare 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.110
 this appetizer is super easy and is 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.710
 We are going to need 4 slices of 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.710
 smoked bacon a zucchini 8 prawns 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.739
 peeled a teaspoon of herbs 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.040
 come a splash of olive oil 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:43.100
 a pinch of salt and 4 skewers 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.470
 we started preheating the oven to 170 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.110
 degrees centigrade heat up and down 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.449
 in a source that we can put in the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.850
 oven we throw a torito de aceite de 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.629
 olive and we distribute it throughout the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.629
 surface 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.230
 we remove the ends 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.560
 and we peel it to myself I find it easier 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.290
 do it with a peeler of this type 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.200
 it also comes in handy for cutting 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.810
 very thin slices once peeled 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.070
 we discard the first three or four 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.070
 slices that we cut 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.520
 and the following ones we are reserving 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.760
 for this amount of ingredients 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.650
 we need 8 slices you can also 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.730
 do with a knife but there will be a 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.730
 slightly thicker 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.380
 the zucchini left over we keep it for 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.560
 another recipe we cut the slices of 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.799
 bacon in half 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.960
 and we reserve and use prawns 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.930
 frozen so I took it out of the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.140
 freezer the day before and I left them in the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.030
 refrigerator so that they will thaw 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.310
 correctly before using them there are 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.920
 to wash them a little bit with water and here 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.069
 are the sticks if you do not have this 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.690
 kind you can use normal sticks and 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.730
 once we have all the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.430
 prepared ingredients we can already 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.690
 mount the skewers we put a 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.410
 zucchini blade 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.510
 another bacon on top of a shrimp on the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.510
 end we roll up 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.880
 and click through the center of the roll 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:47.480
 We are going to place two rolls in each 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.480
 skewer we make the other zucchini 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.489
 bacon 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.800
 prawn 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.800
 and we roll up 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.170
 we introduce the roll on the stick 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.450
 and we have it 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.090
 we are placing the skewers in the 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.890
 oven tray that we had prepared 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.890
 and so on until you finish with all 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.800
 we put a pinch of salt but very 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.800
 little 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.540
 and sprinkle the rolls with herbs 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.930
 of provenza if you do not have also serves 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.579
 oregano basil or a mixture of the two 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.579
 we turn them over 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.060
 and we repeat a pinch of salt 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.069
 and herbs of provence 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:27.349
 we turn them around and baked 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.139
 we bake for 35 40 minutes then 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:32.240
 we turn them around and leave them 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.120
 ten more minutes have to be left 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.849
 Doraditas and the caldito that they release 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.460
 have to consume and that's how they are 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.770
 you have to serve them very hot and with 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.390
 one or two skewers per person will be 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.820
 enough 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.190
