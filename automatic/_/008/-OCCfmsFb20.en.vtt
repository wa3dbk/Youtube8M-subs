 road transport and all drivers that do that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.649

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.180
 crawl from such a truck and there 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.800
 it doesn't stop there 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.720
 undertakes in Dutch gold where yes one 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.700
 serious attempt to get a large driver's license 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.520
 to get 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.260
 what would signal the professionals thereof 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.830
 just found it interesting 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.450
 that there 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.100
 I there mini fall in the truckers there peace 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.280
 don't think many furniture women come to 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.280
 within 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.180

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.570
 I'm thinking about the driving license myself 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.100
 finally get a logical die 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:59.600
 duality is what you actually difficult 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.670

 constant people have to watch by bridge 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.440
 anyway not to do everything yourself too 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.520
 yet the distance you think nothing is 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.420
 I think I can 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.550
 but you also have to take into account 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.590
 people who don't mind you 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.420

 I really hate cleaning before 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.310
 I hope you have your wood but 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.380
 myself really I would determine that 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.049
 sounds very collegial at the end of 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.820

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.030

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.110

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.489
 actress and dj fajah lourens has after the 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.109
 meeting with a number 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.269
 truck drivers the challenge 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.980
 hired in dutch gold she goes 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.670
 Tried on the big driver's license too 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.939
 get it 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.920
 today her first lesson is hey madam 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.139
 you or her money and is a lot of business 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.000
 and yes it is different 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.189
 like a normal car yes he is already 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.720
 bigger 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:04.030
 I'm going a bit wider a bit higher 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.760
 how exciting until well, what did I have 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.530
 well invented because the truck or 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.790
 is had years of going to anyway 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.040
 right to form for you between those 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.320
 pawns through 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.070
 And that you also stop these four 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.870
 order here in front and you think that is difficult 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.330
 I hope you succeed but actually 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.720
 think you fail so as 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.720
 to get in 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.340
 sit comfortably so this is one 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.810
 are you good but god backrest then 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.760
 we will do we will go for a drive 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.330
 and not very well at the table 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.520
 switch 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.710
 so if we were the next one then 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.390
 do good because this is my collision 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.460
 just our one is just like normal throughout 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:53.080
 spacious prefer 2-way 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:04:03.720

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:07.470

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.720

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.980
 pedestrians 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.780
