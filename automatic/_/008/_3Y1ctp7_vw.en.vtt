 Debaltsevsky bridgehead we just 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.269
 just 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.120
 left the infrastructure of the city was 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.150

 there was no Debaltsev bridgehead 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.389
 sense if we talk about where 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.299
 following offensive are possible 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.850

 what does adversary mean for ukraine 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.260
 loss is not afraid of the question that is me 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.480
 absolutely not idle on the answer to 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.840
 which depends not only consequences 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.770
 for our country but also for 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.020
 The aggressor and I got contacted the day before 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.940
 With political scientist Vladimir Fesenko and your as 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.530
 he commented on this question 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:51.400
 attention is convenient and for years hiv 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.160

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.830
 the less hacking the current situation that 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.000
 the contribution to go around it goes without saying 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.730
 transport node 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.660
 the game was days Alina slightly come to their senses 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.299
 seen monitors perishing on so 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.440
 something that is not operated but also 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.290
 we asked Vladimir Fesenko 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.550
 the question of why europe is not 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.680
 states that truce 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.660
 agreement was reached in Minsk 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.520

 my process goat thailand and marking of what 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.400
 because this happens like this into an icon 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.790
 stupid in my world and close to him when you 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.600

 cool new k but hich one more 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.390
 question to the brakes gave on the eve of Vladimir 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.060
 fesenko concerned whether to expect 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.130
 conflict settlement in the Donbas 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.010
 I think I'll talk skating 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.830
 weaned longer than defense resources in 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.200
 Debaltseve area most accurate to a pile 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.600
 Nikishov e.g. 3 places valley and 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.000
 Slavic Kramatorsk straight down from 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.910
 defense to Mariupol and damn you on it 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.220
 cable loop Lugansk pci protect and 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.830
 first gadget placed on the same 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.380
 Galich and Kraft 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.650
 sealants and Hyder Luhansk handed it 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.169
 rock wanna and i control really 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.250
 This then she already received development stall 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.720
 in fact in the Minsk talks because 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.550
 Ukrainian authorities have announced that they are 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.030
 will insist on the introduction of peacekeepers 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.340
 Ukrainian combat zone 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.080
 again and officials say that 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.729
 Europe and the United States need to be strengthened 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.020
 social pressure on russia so 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.020
 so she stopped her aggressive 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.229
 offensive action and principle we 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.720
 see as debaltsevsky where fight 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.540
 the story begins to unfold in 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.500
 much larger 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.060
 geopolitically acquire significantly 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.760
 larger geopolitical 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.010
 consequences scratch written kakashi 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.870
 against or by thousands of ukrainian all coffee 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.700
 left debaltseve and you are trapped so 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.080
 would blast zhku technique flukes 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.750
 option for Ukraine is not 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.789
 but this lecture to the troops on 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.500
 well we must we touching statements 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:39.380
 from the world community here we are just 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.930
 we can see the NATO Secretary General called on Russia 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.860
 withdraw troops from the east of Ukraine to 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.770
 the call 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.660
 concern between is concerned to 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.940
 the story here is the americans actually 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.770
 already long ago judging by the statement 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.300
 top officials including American 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.780
 State Department American President have them 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.220
 not left 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.919
 illusions about treaties 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.870
 Kremlin abilities are all European 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.700
 still there is such a hope 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.350
 that with moscow special moscow with 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.220
 Russian president can 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.200
 agree and convince him not harm not 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.050
 Ukraine 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.860
 own country but in my opinion 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.780
 the Russian leadership is this 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.160
 argument is not the time is not in it years and 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.170
 considering that she is in strong 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.570
 bargaining position but anyway 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.150
 what consequences will the situation get 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.620
 bends we find out the next few days a 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.000
 maybe even watch and be 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.680
 return in this program to her 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.680
 stay with us again and again
