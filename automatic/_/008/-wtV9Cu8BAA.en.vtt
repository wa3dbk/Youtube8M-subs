question mark of the anime community and

question mark of the anime community and
I<00:00:18.630> got<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> little<00:00:19.140> theory<00:00:19.650> because<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.490> not

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
I got a little theory because I have not

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.599 
I got a little theory because I have not
found<00:00:20.939> any<00:00:21.529> logical<00:00:22.529> reason<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:22.980> him<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.340> love

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
found any logical reason for him to love

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.210 
found any logical reason for him to love
Sakura<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:24.750> isn't<00:00:24.960> any<00:00:25.410> where<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
Sakura there just isn't any where the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.009 
Sakura there just isn't any where the
all<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.670> logical<00:00:27.150> reasons<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.630> him<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.840> love

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
all the logical reasons for him to love

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.320 
all the logical reasons for him to love
somebody<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.529> find<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.099> Hinata<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.119> just

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
somebody I find in Hinata and it just

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.930 
somebody I find in Hinata and it just
baffled<00:00:30.900> me<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.529> he<00:00:31.710> would<00:00:31.920> love<00:00:32.099> Sakura<00:00:32.640> so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
baffled me that he would love Sakura so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.760 
baffled me that he would love Sakura so
I<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.510> figured<00:00:33.690> out<00:00:33.930> why<00:00:34.110> he<00:00:34.260> loves<00:00:34.559> her

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
I think I figured out why he loves her

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040 
I think I figured out why he loves her
and<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.309> psychological<00:00:35.820> sense<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:36.660> that

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and a psychological sense I think that

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.430 
and a psychological sense I think that
it<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.380> because<00:00:37.850> Sakura<00:00:38.850> directly<00:00:39.629> represents

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it is because Sakura directly represents

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.220 
it is because Sakura directly represents
the<00:00:40.680> cano<00:00:40.980> ha<00:00:41.160> leaf<00:00:41.399> village<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.059> he<00:00:42.780> has<00:00:42.930> tied

the cano ha leaf village and he has tied
his<00:00:43.260> pursuit<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.040> acceptance<00:00:44.610> from<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> leaf

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180

him<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> burden

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
him as a burden

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.039 
him as a burden
so<00:01:18.960> did<00:01:19.140> Sakura<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.820> Naruto<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
so did Sakura I think that Naruto is a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.890 
so did Sakura I think that Naruto is a
young<00:01:22.320> child<00:01:22.590> his<00:01:22.950> entire<00:01:23.400> his<00:01:24.180> entire<00:01:24.570> being

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
young child his entire his entire being

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080 
young child his entire his entire being
his<00:01:25.259> entire<00:01:25.590> Drive<00:01:25.979> was<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.729> become<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
his entire Drive was to become the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.149 
his entire Drive was to become the
Hokage<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.020> he<00:01:28.170> could<00:01:28.350> gain<00:01:28.530> acceptance

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
Hokage so that he could gain acceptance

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.700 
Hokage so that he could gain acceptance
but<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.299> as<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> child<00:01:30.780> he<00:01:31.200> realized

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
but I think that as a child he realized

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.760 
but I think that as a child he realized
that<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.159> was<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.150> far<00:01:33.479> ahead<00:01:33.509> he<00:01:34.350> wanted<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that that was so far ahead he wanted a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.190 
that that was so far ahead he wanted a
small<00:01:35.100> win<00:01:35.340> his<00:01:35.610> mind<00:01:35.909> wanted<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.509> small<00:01:36.780> win<00:01:37.020> I

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
small win his mind wanted a small win I

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960 
small win his mind wanted a small win I
think<00:01:37.710> he<00:01:37.829> tied<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.400> Sakura

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
think he tied that to Sakura

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.210 
think he tied that to Sakura
because<00:01:39.240> Sakura<00:01:39.799> represented<00:01:40.799> everything

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
because Sakura represented everything

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.429 
because Sakura represented everything
that<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.729> village<00:01:42.090> was<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.810> someone<00:01:43.320> who

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that the village was as someone who

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.469 
that the village was as someone who
didn't<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.860> him<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.070> anything<00:01:44.399> special

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
didn't see him as anything special

Sakura<00:02:48.069> has<00:02:48.340> always<00:02:48.609> been<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.299> similar<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
Sakura has always been so similar to the

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.410 
Sakura has always been so similar to the
village<00:02:50.440> Naruto<00:02:51.220> couldn't<00:02:51.549> have<00:02:51.670> ever<00:02:51.879> helped

village Naruto couldn't have ever helped

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.140 
village Naruto couldn't have ever helped
but<00:02:52.840> subconsciously<00:02:53.260> feel<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.489> acceptance

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
but subconsciously feel that acceptance

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.259 
but subconsciously feel that acceptance
from<00:02:55.299> Sakura<00:02:55.810> would<00:02:56.170> be<00:02:56.650> equal<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.310> acceptance

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
from Sakura would be equal to acceptance

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.300 
from Sakura would be equal to acceptance
of<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.629> village<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.109> I<00:02:59.200> think<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.799> is

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
of the village and I think that that is

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.110 
of the village and I think that that is
why<00:03:00.670> he<00:03:01.269> is<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.870> in<00:03:02.139> love<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:02.889> her<00:03:03.069> because<00:03:03.280> he

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
why he is so in love with her because he

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.449 
why he is so in love with her because he
wants<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.599> be<00:03:04.810> liked<00:03:05.170> he<00:03:05.620> wants<00:03:05.889> to<00:03:06.010> be<00:03:06.129> loved

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
wants to be liked he wants to be loved

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.699 
wants to be liked he wants to be loved
he<00:03:06.730> wants<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.120> be<00:03:07.209> accepted<00:03:07.930> he<00:03:08.319> wants<00:03:08.590> people

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
he wants to be accepted he wants people

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.039 
he wants to be accepted he wants people
to<00:03:08.859> see<00:03:09.159> that<00:03:09.370> he<00:03:09.549> is<00:03:09.670> special<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.359> because

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
to see that he is special and because

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.740 
to see that he is special and because
that<00:03:11.409> had<00:03:11.620> been<00:03:11.829> his<00:03:12.010> drive<00:03:12.510> throughout<00:03:13.510> his

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
that had been his drive throughout his

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.679 
that had been his drive throughout his
entire<00:03:14.170> life<00:03:14.230> until<00:03:14.859> Sasuke<00:03:15.730> came<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.569> then

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
entire life until Sasuke came and then

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.420 
entire life until Sasuke came and then
that<00:03:16.870> became<00:03:17.139> a<00:03:17.199> secondary<00:03:17.709> drive<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.340> be

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
that became a secondary drive and be

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.580 
that became a secondary drive and be
retrieving<00:03:19.299> Sasuke<00:03:19.840> become<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.260> primary

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
retrieving Sasuke become the primary

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.059 
retrieving Sasuke become the primary
drive<00:03:21.129> I<00:03:21.459> think<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.239> subconsciously<00:03:23.069> that's

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
drive I think that subconsciously that's

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.369 
drive I think that subconsciously that's
what<00:03:24.340> made<00:03:24.519> him<00:03:24.699> love<00:03:24.910> Sakura<00:03:25.480> that's<00:03:25.989> why<00:03:26.199> he

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
what made him love Sakura that's why he

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:27.900 
what made him love Sakura that's why he
can't<00:03:26.620> see<00:03:26.709> Hinata

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
can't see Hinata

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.569 
can't see Hinata
for<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.780> person<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.290> she<00:03:29.590> is<00:03:29.739> because<00:03:30.159> she

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
for the person that she is because she

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.250 
for the person that she is because she
is<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.879> exact<00:03:31.209> opposite<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.959> what<00:03:32.019> the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
is the exact opposite of what the
