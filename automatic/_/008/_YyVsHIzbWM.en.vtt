playing elite dangerous on dkt one of

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.150 
playing elite dangerous on dkt one of
the<00:00:22.199> things<00:00:22.380> you've<00:00:22.560> mentioned<00:00:22.769> previously

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the things you've mentioned previously

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.429 
the things you've mentioned previously
in<00:00:23.850> talks<00:00:24.300> has<00:00:24.570> been<00:00:24.779> kind<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> low

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
in talks has been kind of the low

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.259 
in talks has been kind of the low
resolution<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> DK<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.970> being<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
resolution of DK one and that being a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.589 
resolution of DK one and that being a
problem<00:00:27.949> has<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.189> been<00:00:29.429> overcome<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.179> DK<00:00:30.539> 2

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
problem has that been overcome with DK 2

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.170 
problem has that been overcome with DK 2
and<00:00:31.170> how<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.369> found<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.759> kind<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
and how have you found the kind of the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.630 
and how have you found the kind of the
overall<00:00:33.480> elites<00:00:33.750> bit<00:00:34.020> early<00:00:34.320> experience<00:00:35.010> with

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
overall elites bit early experience with

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:46.430 
overall elites bit early experience with
DK<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:44.120> head<00:00:45.120> tracking<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.570> nice<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:45.899> well<00:00:45.930> on

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
DK to head tracking is nice as well on

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
DK to head tracking is nice as well on
DTV<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:49.039> think<00:00:50.039> all<00:00:51.000> these<00:00:51.329> improvements

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
DTV so I think all these improvements

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
DTV so I think all these improvements
are<00:00:52.110> great<00:00:52.469> improvements<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.399> know<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.820> we

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
are great improvements you know are we

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.729 
are great improvements you know are we
at<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.090> end<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> road<00:00:54.600> probably<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.500> I

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
at the end of the road probably not I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.420 
at the end of the road probably not I
think<00:00:56.210> it's<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.440> when<00:00:58.440> people<00:00:58.770> said<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.039> HD

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
think it's like when people said is HD

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.209 
think it's like when people said is HD
enough<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.879> TV<00:01:00.260> HD<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.320> grip<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.100> it

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
enough on TV HD is grip then you see it

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.080 
enough on TV HD is grip then you see it
Oh<00:01:06.170> memory<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.380> hidden<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.400> things

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
Oh memory can be hidden and so things

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.080 
Oh memory can be hidden and so things
like<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.840> think<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> technology

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
like that I think this is a technology

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.710 
like that I think this is a technology
it's<00:01:12.090> massively<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.110> BS<00:01:14.210> but<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.540> will

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it's massively that's BS but it will

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.539 
it's massively that's BS but it will
keep<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.049> getting<00:01:16.770> better<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.040> don't<00:01:17.340> think

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
keep on getting better I don't think

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.230 
keep on getting better I don't think
there's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> reason<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.180> stop<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.920> negative

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
there's a reason to stop a negative

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.080 
there's a reason to stop a negative
because<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:22.140> still<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.280> pixels<00:01:23.640> if

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
because you can still see the pixels if

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.469 
because you can still see the pixels if
they're<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.390> small<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:25.200> true<00:01:26.479> education

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
they're all small that's true education

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.880 
they're all small that's true education
rich<00:01:29.060> with<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.240> beforehand<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.619> would<00:01:31.770> look

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
rich with that beforehand it would look

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.929 
rich with that beforehand it would look
just<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.400> much<00:01:32.579> better<00:01:37.460> what<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.700> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
just so much better what is that it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.460 
just so much better what is that it
would<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> say<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> definitive<00:01:40.020> way<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
would you say is the definitive way to

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.370 
would you say is the definitive way to
play

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
play

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.359 
play
if<00:01:41.469> you<00:01:41.619> have<00:01:41.950> access<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.579> um<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.950> in

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
if you have access to it um I think in

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.160 
if you have access to it um I think in
some<00:01:45.430> respects<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.479> really<00:01:46.719> improves<00:01:46.990> the

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
some respects it really improves the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.529 
some respects it really improves the
game<00:01:47.380> hi<00:01:47.680> hon<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:48.399> think<00:01:49.060> um<00:01:51.149> playing<00:01:52.149> so<00:01:52.390> the

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
game hi hon I think um playing so the

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.249 
game hi hon I think um playing so the
doctors<00:01:52.990> dk1<00:01:54.270> found<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.450> only<00:01:55.600> play<00:01:55.899> for<00:01:55.960> a

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
doctors dk1 found that only play for a

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.649 
doctors dk1 found that only play for a
certain<00:01:57.250> amount<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.610> time<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.420> I<00:01:58.539> actually

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
certain amount of time and I actually

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.919 
certain amount of time and I actually
want<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.049> play<00:01:59.259> back<00:01:59.470> on<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.740> screen<00:02:00.929> that's

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
want to play back on the screen that's

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.039 
want to play back on the screen that's
partly<00:02:02.319> me<00:02:02.560> probably<00:02:03.189> this<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:04.240> after<00:02:05.020> a

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
partly me probably this just after a

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.840 
partly me probably this just after a
while<00:02:05.289> it<00:02:05.470> also<00:02:05.740> disengages<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.610> with<00:02:06.729> the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
while it also disengages you with the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.940 
while it also disengages you with the
room<00:02:07.060> there's<00:02:07.899> something<00:02:08.229> very<00:02:08.349> nice<00:02:08.619> when

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
room there's something very nice when

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.490 
room there's something very nice when
you're<00:02:09.099> playing<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.300> know<00:02:10.720> someone<00:02:11.260> help<00:02:11.440> you

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
you're playing you know someone help you

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500 
you're playing you know someone help you
with<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> cavity<00:02:12.099> feel<00:02:12.519> really<00:02:13.000> problems<00:02:13.360> have

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
with a cavity feel really problems have

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.050 
with a cavity feel really problems have
it<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.620> comfortable<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:17.670> especially<00:02:18.670> when

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
it is so comfortable and especially when

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.300 
it is so comfortable and especially when
you<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.840> with<00:02:20.709> other<00:02:20.860> people<00:02:20.950> our

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
you think of it with other people our

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.339 
you think of it with other people our
kids<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.760> regular<00:02:22.000> example<00:02:22.599> are<00:02:22.660> already<00:02:23.019> cut

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
kids a regular example are already cut

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.160 
kids a regular example are already cut
off<00:02:23.500> enough<00:02:23.970> time<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.090> market<00:02:25.360> play<00:02:25.569> games<00:02:25.870> I

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
off enough time to market play games I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.949 
off enough time to market play games I
think<00:02:26.920> with<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.430> complete<00:02:27.790> immersion<00:02:28.330> headset

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
think with a complete immersion headset

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.690 
think with a complete immersion headset
it<00:02:29.260> would<00:02:29.470> just<00:02:29.500> be<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.340> bit<00:02:30.549> more

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
it would just be that bit more

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.970 
it would just be that bit more
interesting<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:32.049> might<00:02:32.410> not<00:02:32.799> necessarily

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
interesting so I might not necessarily

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.199 
interesting so I might not necessarily
for<00:02:33.489> everyone<00:02:34.680> fantastic<00:02:35.680> experience<00:02:36.220> you

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
for everyone fantastic experience you

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.420 
for everyone fantastic experience you
know<00:02:37.329> so<00:02:37.540> what<00:02:38.290> have<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.560> prob<00:02:38.799> power<00:02:39.010> probably

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
know so what have I prob power probably

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.670 
know so what have I prob power probably
with<00:02:39.549> plays<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:40.060> play<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.329> game<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.840> then<00:02:41.349> when

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
with plays I play the game and then when

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.100 
with plays I play the game and then when
I<00:02:41.709> come<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.190> maybe<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.970> battle<00:02:43.599> or<00:02:43.690> something

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
I come to maybe a battle or something

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.809 
I come to maybe a battle or something
for<00:02:44.290> all<00:02:44.410> actually<00:02:45.040> I'm<00:02:45.310> going<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.609> be<00:02:45.670> much

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
for all actually I'm going to be much

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.670 
for all actually I'm going to be much
better<00:02:46.000> without<00:02:46.239> for<00:02:46.630> this<00:02:46.750> all<00:02:46.930> I'm<00:02:47.470> now

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
better without for this all I'm now

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.349 
better without for this all I'm now
really<00:02:47.950> too<00:02:48.190> although<00:02:48.459> is<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.120> going<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.299> be

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
really too although is it going to be

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.720 
really too although is it going to be
hard<00:02:49.569> but<00:02:49.870> I'm<00:02:50.019> i<00:02:50.319> am<00:02:50.890> actually<00:02:51.100> i<00:02:51.400> think<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.700> is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
hard but I'm i am actually i think it is

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.970 
hard but I'm i am actually i think it is
much<00:02:52.150> easier<00:02:52.180> when<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.170> can<00:02:53.200> see<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:53.560> look

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
much easier when you can see just look

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.069 
much easier when you can see just look
around<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:55.090> get<00:02:55.299> your<00:02:55.480> spatial<00:02:55.959> awareness

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
around you to get your spatial awareness

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.660 
around you to get your spatial awareness
when<00:02:56.560> you're<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.799> combat<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.459> actually

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
when you're in combat that you actually

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.539 
when you're in combat that you actually
are<00:02:57.940> much<00:02:58.239> harder<00:02:59.100> opponent<00:03:00.100> when<00:03:00.400> you're

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
are much harder opponent when you're

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.910 
are much harder opponent when you're
wearing<00:03:00.940> off<00:03:01.380> even<00:03:02.380> though<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.739> game<00:03:02.889> is

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
wearing off even though the game is

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
wearing off even though the game is
actually<00:03:03.190> definitely<00:03:04.920> actually<00:03:05.920> pushing<00:03:06.280> do

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
actually definitely actually pushing do

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.420 
actually definitely actually pushing do
some<00:03:07.150> one<00:03:07.269> of<00:03:07.359> the
