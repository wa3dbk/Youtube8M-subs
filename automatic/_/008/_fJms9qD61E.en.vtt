00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.450
 a few hundred spectators have come to the duel between psv and 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.950
 deetossnel and that is too much for a field korfball game because the game 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.420
 Minister has to claim the hall the only culprit designated as past 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.660
 Saturday it's not about I think there may be the vertical even if you are there too 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.359
 decided on 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.359
 again as soon as possible before we would just go nice 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.050
 radar is there on bail image and 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.929
 it no longer so openly tells one with rain 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.199
 third can be for dead even though the new trainer from deetos i was 36 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.239
 old age international must of course this is worth less the korfball 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:37.850
 league 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.200
 dordtenaar doing that with a new player this thomas reijgersberg 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.450
 youth international came a test of fortuna from delft just like his 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.089
 Saturday's direct opponent a merchant 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.549
 Ajax and PSV The replacement for Leon Simon The King of Patents has ended 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.220
 Saturday the attentive spectator 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.950
 since that time a few teammates who are doing well in the first half PSV 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.309
 plays 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.730
 utrecht anp he is at rest with 3 6 4 behind a much more motivated this 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.160
 U.S 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.340
 the goals on board they said come in the name of bjorn van 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.030
 rosmalen 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.030
 21 year old youth international dordrecht 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.680
 You can other youth international intention was to put on the long ball 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.750
 the same source of rosmalen 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.680
 now his fifth goal will be the afternoon in 2012 but that will be PKC 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.060
 stronger here does not have a good balance for short, but it does score 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.710
 beautiful day 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.170
 ten minutes foster home has not yet every case he finds that nothing 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.710
 and from the arch rival 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.960
 What I did score, for example, four tons of merchant it comes 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.290
 was good 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.950
 following the newspaper 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.450
 this is a phase where peeters is a lot stronger 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.760
 even though they play 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.790
 without the internationals doctor and suzanne bush 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.810
 they see that peeters that also comes because we are our world 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.550
 to experience 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.550
 the penalty area 13 12 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.289
 the seated just before the final signal doing the second round of rosmalen 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.720
 it is his as the sixth goal of the afternoon position 13 against 13 and then there is 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 another minute to play, blankets 7 will have to come in 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:18.609
 4 tons of merchant from five meters of girls on the scoreboard and then you can do better 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.149
 had to attack 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.360
 he warns about the victory this team has shown 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.400
