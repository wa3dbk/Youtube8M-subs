00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
flying a jet i want to point out a few

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.929 
flying a jet i want to point out a few
things<00:01:18.770> first<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.100> you're<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.280> starting<00:01:20.520> out

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
things first if you're just starting out

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.109 
things first if you're just starting out
it<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:22.049> easy<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:23.130> necessarily

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it is not easy it's not necessarily

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.649 
it is not easy it's not necessarily
intuitive<00:01:25.159> most<00:01:26.159> people<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.729> understand<00:01:27.180> are

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
intuitive most people I understand are

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.240 
intuitive most people I understand are
going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> difficult<00:01:28.470> time<00:01:28.799> getting

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
going to have a difficult time getting

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
going to have a difficult time getting
into<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> jet<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.329> their<00:01:30.479> first<00:01:30.689> time<00:01:31.049> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
into a jet for their first time and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.920 
into a jet for their first time and
being<00:01:31.770> able<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.130> fly<00:01:32.250> naturally<00:01:32.689> so<00:01:33.689> there's<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
being able to fly naturally so there's a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
being able to fly naturally so there's a
few<00:01:33.990> things<00:01:34.350> I'd<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.799> point<00:01:35.009> out<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
few things I'd like to point out and I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.230 
few things I'd like to point out and I
think<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.880> will<00:01:36.060> help<00:01:36.590> first<00:01:37.850> stick<00:01:38.850> with

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
think this will help first stick with

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.080 
think this will help first stick with
the<00:01:39.540> right<00:01:39.810> stick<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.670> course<00:01:41.909> you're

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the right stick and of course you're

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.850 
the right stick and of course you're
right<00:01:42.119> stick<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.320> variety<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
right stick can go in a variety of

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.010 
right stick can go in a variety of
different<00:01:43.950> directions<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:44.939> primarily<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
different directions but primarily you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.819 
different directions but primarily you
can<00:01:46.200> move<00:01:46.350> your<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.649> stick<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.450> down<00:01:48.450> left

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
can move your right stick up down left

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.429 
can move your right stick up down left
and<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.460> right<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:51.570> using<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.290> your

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and to the right now using this on your

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.690 
and to the right now using this on your
right<00:01:52.590> state<00:01:52.829> will<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> variety<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
right state will do a variety of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
right state will do a variety of
different<00:01:53.880> things<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.600> jet<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.560> overall

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
different things to your jet but overall

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.740 
different things to your jet but overall
when<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.610> starting<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
when you're just starting I want you to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.039 
when you're just starting I want you to
focus<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.680> left<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.670> right<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.810> down

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
focus on the left the right and the down

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.459 
focus on the left the right and the down
let<00:02:01.890> me<00:02:01.979> tell<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.280> why<00:02:02.750> whatever<00:02:03.750> way<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.259> top

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
let me tell you why whatever way the top

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.889 
let me tell you why whatever way the top
of<00:02:04.680> your<00:02:04.799> jet<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.189> facing<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.540> will<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
of your jet is facing that will be the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.779 
of your jet is facing that will be the
direction<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.409> your<00:02:07.649> jet<00:02:07.860> will<00:02:08.039> turn<00:02:08.310> when

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
direction that your jet will turn when

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.630 
direction that your jet will turn when
you<00:02:08.910> pull<00:02:09.179> down<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.869> right

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
you pull down on the right

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.920 
you pull down on the right
that's<00:02:11.640> why<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:11.850> think<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.450> such<00:02:12.780> an

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
that's why I think this is such an

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.210 
that's why I think this is such an
important<00:02:13.410> part<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.890> flying<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.880> jet<00:02:16.100> here's<00:02:17.100> a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
important part of flying a jet here's a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.070 
important part of flying a jet here's a
quick<00:02:17.430> routine<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.300> do<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.630> get

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
quick routine that you can do to get

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.510 
quick routine that you can do to get
better<00:02:19.260> at<00:02:19.350> flying<00:02:19.680> your<00:02:19.830> jet<00:02:20.040> once<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.370> get

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
better at flying your jet once you get

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.970 
better at flying your jet once you get
off<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> runway<00:02:21.230> first<00:02:22.230> move<00:02:22.500> your<00:02:22.650> stick<00:02:22.860> to

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
off the runway first move your stick to

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.500 
off the runway first move your stick to
the<00:02:23.100> right<00:02:23.280> 90<00:02:23.610> degrees<00:02:23.940> let<00:02:24.390> your

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
the right 90 degrees let your

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.930 
the right 90 degrees let your
perpendicular<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.410> ground<00:02:25.730> then<00:02:26.730> move

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
perpendicular to the ground then move

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.030 
perpendicular to the ground then move
your<00:02:26.970> stick<00:02:27.300> again<00:02:27.750> 90<00:02:28.110> degrees<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.860> you're

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
your stick again 90 degrees so you're

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.980 
your stick again 90 degrees so you're
parallel<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.700> ground<00:02:29.820> but<00:02:30.450> your<00:02:30.630> jet<00:02:30.870> is

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
parallel to the ground but your jet is

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.640 
parallel to the ground but your jet is
upside<00:02:31.410> down<00:02:31.850> move<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.000> 90<00:02:33.300> degrees<00:02:33.330> again<00:02:33.990> so

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
upside down move it 90 degrees again so

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.980 
upside down move it 90 degrees again so
you're<00:02:34.800> perpendicular<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.730> then<00:02:36.360> another<00:02:36.480> 90

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
you're perpendicular and then another 90

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.350 
you're perpendicular and then another 90
degrees<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:37.530> you've<00:02:37.680> made<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.130> very<00:02:38.550> very<00:02:38.910> slow

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
degrees so you've made a very very slow

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.250 
degrees so you've made a very very slow
barrel<00:02:39.900> roll<00:02:40.940> taking<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.120> time<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:43.050> learn

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260

once<00:03:09.330> you've<00:03:09.480> started<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.960> get<00:03:10.080> down<00:03:10.290> the

once you've started to get down the

once you've started to get down the
simple<00:03:10.770> maneuvers<00:03:11.160> by<00:03:11.310> practicing<00:03:11.880> over<00:03:12.030> and

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
simple maneuvers by practicing over and

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.870 
simple maneuvers by practicing over and
over<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.660> do<00:03:13.290> fully<00:03:13.890> believe<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.670> you've

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
over I do fully believe that you've

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.210 
over I do fully believe that you've
probably<00:03:15.120> seen<00:03:15.750> yourself<00:03:16.020> using<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.040> up

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
probably seen yourself using the up

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.590 
probably seen yourself using the up
portion<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.850> your<00:03:17.940> right<00:03:18.150> analog<00:03:18.570> stick

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
portion of your right analog stick

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.260 
portion of your right analog stick
already<00:03:19.290> what<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.190> typically<00:03:20.700> find<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.239> that

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
already what I typically find is that

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.210 
already what I typically find is that
that<00:03:21.660> up<00:03:21.870> portion<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.709> right<00:03:22.890> analog

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
that up portion of the right analog

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.280 
that up portion of the right analog
stick<00:03:23.370> is<00:03:23.820> used<00:03:23.850> more<00:03:24.510> as<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.660> corrective

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
stick is used more as a corrective

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.460 
stick is used more as a corrective
measure<00:03:25.560> than<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.430> directional<00:03:27.090> measure<00:03:27.270> so<00:03:28.170> as

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
measure than a directional measure so as

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.680 
measure than a directional measure so as
I<00:03:28.950> mentioned<00:03:28.980> before<00:03:29.340> by<00:03:30.000> focusing<00:03:30.180> on<00:03:30.600> the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
I mentioned before by focusing on the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.500 
I mentioned before by focusing on the
left<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.500> right<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.489> down<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:33.120> order<00:03:33.330> to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
left the right and the down in order to

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.570 
left the right and the down in order to
drive<00:03:33.750> your<00:03:33.930> jet<00:03:34.170> I<00:03:34.380> think<00:03:35.070> you'll<00:03:35.250> begin<00:03:35.520> to

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
drive your jet I think you'll begin to

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.979 
drive your jet I think you'll begin to
maneuver<00:03:36.330> like<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.989> true<00:03:37.320> Pro<00:03:38.630> now<00:03:39.630> let's<00:03:39.810> talk

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
maneuver like a true Pro now let's talk

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.020 
maneuver like a true Pro now let's talk
about<00:03:40.290> when<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.680> use<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.310> how<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.519> use<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
about when to use and how to use the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.300 
about when to use and how to use the
afterburners<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.470> brakes<00:03:43.739> on<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.070> jet

you can use it when you're trying to

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.529 
you can use it when you're trying to
make<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:35.960> tight<00:04:36.139> turn<00:04:36.320> as<00:04:36.470> I<00:04:36.530> mentioned<00:04:36.860> before

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
make it tight turn as I mentioned before

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.610 
make it tight turn as I mentioned before
once<00:04:38.539> you've<00:04:38.660> got<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.870> brakes<00:04:39.110> figured<00:04:39.470> out

once you've got the brakes figured out

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.379 
once you've got the brakes figured out
you'll<00:04:40.220> also<00:04:40.400> realize<00:04:40.880> that<00:04:41.090> when<00:04:41.240> you're

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
you'll also realize that when you're

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.210 
you'll also realize that when you're
getting<00:04:41.509> shot<00:04:41.660> at<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.500> brakes<00:04:42.770> probably

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
getting shot at the brakes probably

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.340 
getting shot at the brakes probably
aren't<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.490> best<00:04:43.639> thing<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:43.970> have<00:04:44.270> on<00:04:44.350> instead

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
aren't the best thing to have on instead

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.810 
aren't the best thing to have on instead
what<00:04:45.500> you<00:04:45.530> want<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.919> use<00:04:46.039> there<00:04:46.400> is<00:04:46.520> the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
what you want to use there is the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.060 
what you want to use there is the
afterburner<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:48.020> afterburner<00:04:48.470> increases

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
afterburner the afterburner increases

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.159 
afterburner the afterburner increases
the<00:04:49.220> speed<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.580> your<00:04:49.610> jet<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.120> also<00:04:50.930> makes

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
the speed of your jet and also makes

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.580 
the speed of your jet and also makes
turning<00:04:51.830> angles<00:04:52.280> wider<00:04:52.820> so<00:04:53.690> if<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.110> are<00:04:54.320> being

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
turning angles wider so if you are being

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.409 
turning angles wider so if you are being
chased<00:04:54.949> by<00:04:55.099> someone<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.639> you<00:04:55.940> want<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.240> just

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
chased by someone and you want to just

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:57.939 
chased by someone and you want to just
burn<00:04:56.690> them<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.050> get<00:04:57.169> as<00:04:57.289> far<00:04:57.500> as<00:04:57.620> way<00:04:57.770> as<00:04:57.830> we

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
burn them and get as far as way as we

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.770 
burn them and get as far as way as we
can<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.849> afterburner<00:04:59.300> will<00:04:59.449> help<00:04:59.570> you<00:04:59.720> in

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
can the afterburner will help you in

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.659 
can the afterburner will help you in
your<00:04:59.870> straight<00:05:00.229> line<00:05:00.470> however<00:05:01.340> if<00:05:01.520> you're

your straight line however if you're

quickly here I've used an afterburner to

quickly here I've used an afterburner to
go<00:05:09.860> forward<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.490> then<00:05:10.849> hold<00:05:11.060> down<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.389> break

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
go forward and then hold down the break

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.350

afterburner in two scenarios the first

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.830 
afterburner in two scenarios the first
is<00:05:25.669> when<00:05:25.789> I'm<00:05:25.909> trying<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.300> get<00:05:26.389> out<00:05:26.510> of<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.690> map

as<00:05:27.050> quick<00:05:27.260> as<00:05:27.380> possible<00:05:27.440> hoping<00:05:28.340> that<00:05:28.460> nobody

as quick as possible hoping that nobody

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
what stalling is stalling is when you

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.659 
what stalling is stalling is when you
take<00:06:01.759> your<00:06:02.000> aircraft<00:06:02.630> up<00:06:02.930> about<00:06:03.680> 800<00:06:04.340> and<00:06:04.490> 900

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.420 
take your aircraft up about 800 and 900
meters<00:06:05.330> into<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:05.720> air<00:06:05.810> you'll<00:06:06.740> hear<00:06:07.099> a<00:06:07.130> sound

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
meters into the air you'll hear a sound

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.550 
meters into the air you'll hear a sound

that you'll be out of control what you

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.320 
that you'll be out of control what you
need<00:06:18.710> to<00:06:18.800> do<00:06:18.949> to<00:06:18.979> avoid<00:06:19.400> stalls<00:06:19.789> is<00:06:20.000> once<00:06:20.210> you

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
need to do to avoid stalls is once you

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.689 
need to do to avoid stalls is once you
get<00:06:20.509> to<00:06:20.630> about<00:06:20.810> 800<00:06:21.110> meters<00:06:21.740> even<00:06:22.430> out<00:06:22.550> your

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699 
get to about 800 meters even out your

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.450 
get to about 800 meters even out your
jet<00:06:22.970> I<00:06:23.210> would<00:06:23.690> even<00:06:23.780> say<00:06:24.110> to<00:06:24.169> about<00:06:24.470> 750

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
jet I would even say to about 750

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.339

stalling<00:06:26.449> can<00:06:26.599> be<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.780> number<00:06:27.020> one<00:06:27.050> way<00:06:27.289> to

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
stalling can be the number one way to

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.800 
stalling can be the number one way to
kill<00:06:27.650> enemies<00:06:28.099> but<00:06:28.340> also<00:06:28.520> result<00:06:29.509> in<00:06:29.599> number

kill enemies but also result in number
one<00:06:29.930> way<00:06:30.080> that<00:06:30.229> you<00:06:30.289> get<00:06:30.590> killed<00:06:30.770> yourself<00:06:31.510> so

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
one way that you get killed yourself so

one way that you get killed yourself so
here<00:06:32.659> we've<00:06:32.810> learned<00:06:33.020> three<00:06:33.289> things<00:06:33.320> one

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
here we've learned three things one

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.260 
here we've learned three things one
we've<00:06:34.159> gone<00:06:34.340> over<00:06:34.370> some<00:06:34.639> basic

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
we've gone over some basic

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.110 
we've gone over some basic
in<00:06:35.330> the<00:06:35.450> maneuvering<00:06:35.930> to<00:06:36.920> we've<00:06:37.640> talked<00:06:37.940> about

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
in the maneuvering to we've talked about

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.320 
in the maneuvering to we've talked about
how<00:06:38.690> to<00:06:38.750> thrust<00:06:39.740> and<00:06:39.980> also<00:06:40.550> how<00:06:40.730> to<00:06:40.790> break<00:06:41.060> and

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
how to thrust and also how to break and

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.000 
how to thrust and also how to break and
three<00:06:42.140> we've<00:06:42.290> gone<00:06:42.470> over<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:42.890> actual

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
three we've gone over the actual

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.610 
three we've gone over the actual
logistics<00:06:43.670> of<00:06:43.760> stalling<00:06:44.090> don't<00:06:45.020> go<00:06:45.170> above<00:06:45.380> 800

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
logistics of stalling don't go above 800

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.920 
logistics of stalling don't go above 800
meters<00:06:46.010> you'll<00:06:46.190> find<00:06:46.400> yourself<00:06:46.490> stuck<00:06:47.000> so

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
meters you'll find yourself stuck so

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.600 
meters you'll find yourself stuck so
here<00:06:48.110> we<00:06:48.200> go<00:06:48.230> after<00:06:48.530> a<00:06:48.680> long<00:06:48.860> dogfight<00:06:49.400> I

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
here we go after a long dogfight I

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.670 
here we go after a long dogfight I
finally<00:06:50.210> get<00:06:50.810> a<00:06:50.870> chance<00:06:50.960> to<00:06:51.440> take<00:06:51.620> down

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
finally get a chance to take down
