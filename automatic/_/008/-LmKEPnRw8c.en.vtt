 I do n't know how to pronounce the text is a lot

 charming 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.729
 you can easily read it because 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.149
 gives surprising news I don't have the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.439
 precise skills, however, the fact is given 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.229
 that this text you can read

 summarized in this video strangely 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.360
 this text traces backwards to 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:17.500
 back to the history of humanity 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.420
 and reaching an ancestral company e 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.310
 matriarchal like that from me is 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:30.260
 described in this work and historical 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:34.960
 mythological for which we arrive at 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:40.310
 conclusion that in ancient society 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:44.150
 mainly fruit list fruit 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.240
 blacklist seen in practice was 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.650
 the figure of the father and not unknown 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:57.350
 the father existed I also showed 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:00.290
 that the ancient the ancient humanity does not figure 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.750
 I did not know the figure of the father for the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.570
 simple reason that had not yet been 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.020
 discovered sperm function is 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.470
 interesting the text that I leave the 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:16.519
 your reading and your evaluation 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.880
 precisely because backtracking to them 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.610
 authors of this text going backwards 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.750
 from our current diet 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.650
 omnivorous to the previous ones 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:34.880
 power supplies ever closer to the 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:39.049
 nature up to the primitive power supply 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.989
 of type on carista as the net arist 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.630
 while backwards they come to describe 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.600
 what was to be the company 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.760
 primitive of matriarchal type where 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.750
 coincidentally there was no figure of the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.930
 father 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.600
