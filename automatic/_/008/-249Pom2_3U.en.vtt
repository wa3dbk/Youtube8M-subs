00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.259
 yes at 19 o'clock together and warmly 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.480
 welcome to a new mod 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.220
 Idea yes who does not know that man 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.900
 built my power house you just know 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.940
 Not at all with what you own the house 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 decorate or set up 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.900
 of course you can take the tab level 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.400
 and put a sign on the side and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.590
 which then as a bank but is called 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.939
 that's really the true i do not think so 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.680
 and that's why there is the fashion biblio 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.880
 power and what the mod can I show 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.599
 First of all, there are three new ones 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.849
 decorations for your kitchen 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.009
 and on the one hand a kubicas, then 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.300
 a biscuit glass with shift comes right 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.440
 the interface because you have them then 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.790
 cookies in it and they are too 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.250
 three-dimensional in this glass 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.510
 pictured next we have one 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.370
 display resp 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.660
 a normal dish with shift 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.670
 on the right you will see the interface again 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 and you see I have a biscuit 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.660
 a steak and an apple 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.100
 if you had to like me right now 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.300
 and on it makes sure then can 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.660
 it directly from this plate down 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.710
 eat and fill up your or yours 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.570
 Of course something needed woide 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.370
 can store and give for cellar 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.149
 it is a discrete one we just one 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.379
 plate stand 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.210
 there you can just your plate 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.559
 fooled when we have finished eating 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.170
 or just take out parts if you like 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.270
 wanted to eat something very nice about that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 store 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.570
 next will be with the place six 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.280
 pour new chairs minecraft added 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.200
 all four different types of wood 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.509
 the basic structure here always forms 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.670
 a normal chair so that's five 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.680
 can expand various lean and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.090
 For example, you have a chair and 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.430
 the elegant chair and desk 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.540
 tools and small stool was just 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.170
 a normal hour with one 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.450
 backrest 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.009
 a total of seven will be next 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.570
 new stow options with the mod 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.400
 added we just catch it completely 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.799
 right on it is a label 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.420
 this is best for crates 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.159
 to label it means he does 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.729
 that's on the crate with shift right against that 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.619
 interface 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.000
 you can tinker with items I want 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.310
 now just a rose in the middle 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.479
 For example, if garden shows for garden 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.100
 it will become a crate now 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.409
 but practical mean in this 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.850
 crate is a trousers as 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.520
 next we have a normal one 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.600
 showcase is called case that exists 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.369
 by the way also in all different ones 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.229
 wood types as well as you actually 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.610
 all in the rott with shift right 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.550
 let's open the door and now we can 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.620
 we put in any item here 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.440
 Special feature here was you can if 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.090
 give her a redstone block in this one 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.410
 Building set a puzzle signal 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.060
 spend and so shine now to 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.560
 For example , we take this lamp in 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.600
 our blog out again for the lamp 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.460
 to light up with the vod will too 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.350
 added a new bookshelf 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.730
 namely the book case this you can 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.770
 Storing correct books 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.570
 besides, it works exactly the same 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.590
 like a regular book chef 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.720
 means she could do it one way 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.040
 pack the crucial table and yours 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.660
 already enchanted books in it 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.260
 stowed around with magic power 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.790
 receive 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.380
 the fashion is a new book 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.750
 added these are redstone 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.310
 volume 1 if he is in this 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.930
 Bookshelf grabs then also from 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.760
 insert this bookshelf signal 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.590
 sent out 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.600
 should you use your weapons or tools 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.100
 always lose in their boxes then it is 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.460
 the touareg determines the right one for you 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.620
 you 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.810
 He could simply insert your items or 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.920
 or just stow them especially 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.110
 beautiful here it will be 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.000
 Enchanted items displayed enchanted 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.830
 Drinks usually take a lot 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.720
 a lot of space if you have them 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.640
 in boxes but stores with the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.310
 you can drink up chef you can drink 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.739
 easy to save space in a twelve slot 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.390
 shelves store really nice here 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.010
 colors drinks are displayed and 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.230
 also the form so whether it is a book or 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.790
 a normal tank is you should 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.410
 just have something and decorate 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.340
 Wish that's ok boss probably 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.170
 the best for you 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.850
 unfortunately it only has four slots but you 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.280
 you can easily stow all items in it 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.959
 and italo should be chic 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.910
 no minap minecraft is the one 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.380
 met film for you the right there can 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.970
 you just put a card in and 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.680
 Special feature here is you can with 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.790
 a drafting come at 60 on the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.480
 make a map and a waypoint 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.160
 create 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.709
 you can then a name and 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.150
 give a color and move to except 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.620
 and if now on one already 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.690
 existing waypoint with the village the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.700
 Compass rechtsweg , for example, opens up 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.230
 Then this lighthouse II will penetrate 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.239
 you in the chat on the coordinates of it 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.500
 will be displayed next with the 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.780
 note four new tables in minecraft 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.190
 added the normal table stands 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.600
 just as a side table and you 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.200
 can rightly put an item on him 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.940
 place 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.040
 next there is a very nice one 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.840
 desk with candle and an ink 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.310
 holder especially here is the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.170
 desk has the interface and you 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.810
 Overall, on the desk 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.489
 nine books are stored here on the left 4 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.560
 on the right side and single middle 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.030
 that they're reading and there are 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.700
 still the dough setting cable and the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.560
 Printing press with the books 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.329
 you can but what a new minecraft 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.389
 completely unnecessary therefore is that 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.710
 also with a strong can do 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.120
 It should be just like me at night 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.190
 of course you do not need it and its 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.690
 bude and what is better than that 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.470
 a nice lamp or something nice 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.820
 Lantern 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.130
 you can also do that with one 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.800
 to assemble streetgang differently with the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.410
 countries with a lid as a stand or 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.020
 just as a wall mount at the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.389
 it's just a blanket on the fans 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.220
 table or just on the wall yes and there 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.840
 usually no one with his armor 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.370
 Sleep is possible with this place 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.350
 also an armor with right 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.790
 yes comes the interface and you can 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.350
 before one you go to sleep 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.820
 take off the mess and if it again 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.100
 Tomorrow the armor will be back 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.450
 create and then in the evening the armor 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.700
 grab your arm again 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.470
 It does not know you want the middle 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.030
 to find out a wall but has none 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.950
 Bock the wall I count for blocks 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.510
 that's why there is now a measure 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.580
 a minecraft with the rule of law there 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.900
 then a new measurement will be in the 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.280
 middle of the screen the distance 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.080
 displayed and if you right again 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.520
 pressed there is by a shows how 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.470
 far apart these two points 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.600
 that is from here to here it is 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.310
 he will still be eight blocks at last 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.440
 Added a clipboard in minecraft 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.419
 were able to write on it list 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.710
 on my to-do-list is now the 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.490
 mod conception I have that 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.950
 completed 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.360
 of course that completed and with it 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.740
 I would say if you like it 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.300
 then has the thumb up and leaves 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.320
 an abo da if not then there is one 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.160
 thumb down and write me 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.510
 reason to do so 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.770
 otherwise I would say what that far 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.580
 you can find all the links in the video 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.580
