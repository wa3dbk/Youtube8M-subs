now that we determine the size of the

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.700 
now that we determine the size of the
strap<00:00:02.429> that<00:00:02.610> we're<00:00:02.760> going<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:02.970> use<00:00:03.589> and<00:00:04.589> we've

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
right along the grain and if you have a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.320 
right along the grain and if you have a
print<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.650> your<00:00:28.710> fabric<00:00:29.340> that's<00:00:29.519> great<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.210> if

print on your fabric that's great or if

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.569 
print on your fabric that's great or if
you<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.570> selvage<00:00:31.050> edge<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.309> want<00:00:32.489> to

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
you have a selvage edge that you want to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.130 
you have a selvage edge that you want to
use<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.030> measure<00:00:33.210> against<00:00:33.630> that's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> really

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
use to measure against that's a really

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.709 
use to measure against that's a really
good<00:00:34.290> idea<00:00:34.380> also<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.250> mean<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.000> already<00:00:36.210> cut<00:00:36.570> mine

whole<00:00:43.260> thing<00:00:43.530> 6<00:00:44.309> inches<00:00:44.640> over<00:00:45.379> here<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:46.680> I'm

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
whole thing 6 inches over here we go I'm

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.880 
whole thing 6 inches over here we go I'm
gonna<00:00:47.430> worry<00:00:47.640> about<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.940> length<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> yet

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
gonna worry about the length of it yet

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.119 
gonna worry about the length of it yet
because<00:00:50.210> I'll<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.539> right<00:00:52.379> after<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.770> cut

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
because I'll do that right after I cut

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.830 
because I'll do that right after I cut
this<00:00:53.370> long<00:00:53.640> piece<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.300> we'll<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.629> measure

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
this long piece then we'll just measure

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
this long piece then we'll just measure
39<00:00:55.469> inches<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> cut<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.520> off

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
39 inches out and cut that off

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
39 inches out and cut that off
let's<00:00:57.239> go<00:00:57.390> flip<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> over<00:00:57.870> measure<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.070> other

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
let's go flip it over measure the other

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.219 
let's go flip it over measure the other
side<00:01:00.320> go<00:01:02.359> here<00:01:05.479> 6<00:01:06.479> inches<00:01:06.780> I'm<00:01:06.930> gonna<00:01:07.080> make

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
side go here 6 inches I'm gonna make

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
side go here 6 inches I'm gonna make
some<00:01:07.409> marks<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.830> between<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:09.240> I'll<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
some marks in between so I'll have a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.560 
some marks in between so I'll have a
good<00:01:09.869> guideline<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.979> I'm<00:01:11.100> cutting<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> now

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
good guideline when I'm cutting so now

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.330 
good guideline when I'm cutting so now
that<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.990> marked<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.590> gonna<00:01:13.710> cut

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that I have it marked I'm just gonna cut

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.340 
that I have it marked I'm just gonna cut
this<00:01:14.520> out<00:01:17.420> okay<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:20.540> like<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> thick<00:01:21.960> straps

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
this out okay I like the thick straps

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
this out okay I like the thick straps
it's<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.920> good<00:01:23.100> idea<00:01:23.250> because<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.000> disperses

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it's a good idea because it disperses

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.179 
it's a good idea because it disperses
the<00:01:24.780> weight<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.229> whatever<00:01:25.530> you're<00:01:25.799> carrying

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the weight of whatever you're carrying

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.210 
the weight of whatever you're carrying
in<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.390> in<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.479> messenger<00:01:28.020> bag<00:01:28.290> across

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
in your in your messenger bag across

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.170 
in your in your messenger bag across
your<00:01:29.460> shoulders

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
your shoulders

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.359 
your shoulders
the<00:01:30.540> thinner<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.049> strap<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.829> more<00:01:32.040> pressure

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the thinner the strap the more pressure

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
the thinner the strap the more pressure
it<00:01:32.610> puts<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.180> shoulders<00:01:33.630> when<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
it puts on your shoulders when you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
it puts on your shoulders when you
you're<00:01:34.530> carrying<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:35.040> bag<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:36.180> why<00:01:36.270> I

have<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> ruler<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.130> long<00:01:56.670> ruler<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> 36<00:01:57.540> inch

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
so if you have a yardstick you can use

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.219 
so if you have a yardstick you can use
that<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.420> run<00:02:03.659> over<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
measure this there's 36 inches then I'm

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.630 
measure this there's 36 inches then I'm
gonna<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.390> three<00:02:09.390> more<00:02:09.690> okay<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:10.649> here's<00:02:11.099> 39

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
gonna do three more okay so here's 39

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.070 
gonna do three more okay so here's 39
inches<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.300> have<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> pinched<00:02:12.780> with<00:02:12.840> my

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
inches so I just have it pinched with my

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.760 
inches so I just have it pinched with my
finger<00:02:13.410> right

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
finger right

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.340 
finger right
here<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.160> want<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.090> make<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.210> little<00:02:15.390> mark<00:02:15.660> but

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
here I want to make a little mark but

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.810 
here I want to make a little mark but
instead<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:16.920> doing<00:02:17.040> 30<00:02:17.310> now<00:02:17.460> I<00:02:17.580> think<00:02:17.640> I

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
instead of just doing 30 now I think I

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.420 
instead of just doing 30 now I think I
could<00:02:18.210> maybe<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.440> little<00:02:19.620> bit<00:02:19.710> more<00:02:19.920> I'd

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
could maybe just a little bit more I'd

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.340 
could maybe just a little bit more I'd
like<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.760> her<00:02:21.240> I'd<00:02:21.360> be<00:02:21.480> safe<00:02:21.720> than<00:02:21.930> sorry

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
like to be her I'd be safe than sorry

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.280 
like to be her I'd be safe than sorry
and<00:02:22.850> when<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.880> finished<00:02:24.540> making<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.990> strap

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
and when I finished making the strap

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.710 
and when I finished making the strap
sewing<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.920> together<00:02:26.070> I'll<00:02:26.880> do<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> final

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
sewing it together I'll do a final

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.390 
sewing it together I'll do a final
measurement<00:02:28.230> before<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.710> actually<00:02:28.800> sew<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.280> to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
measurement before I actually sew it to

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.700 
measurement before I actually sew it to
the<00:02:29.520> bag<00:02:29.700> itself<00:02:30.120> but<00:02:30.870> for<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.290> next<00:02:31.440> clip
