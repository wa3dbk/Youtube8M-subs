00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 of marble is mainstream is mainstream what 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.770
 we have premiered here exclusively 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.450
 worldwide and we have the singer with 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.730
 us today who accompanies us at party 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.070
 supreme 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.260
 we have already begun to forgive I was 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.469
 doing some very good ideas 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.240
 well, we've seen the video clip in 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.520
 exclusive the singer and leader of the bar 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.460
 vote accompanies us to a pool section to 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.949
 we do not have we do not have a leader 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.789
 the band are an underground band and 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.960
 in any case we say front man or life 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.490
 ok good in any case has come in 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.010
 representation of the group of two 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.900
 comrades have not been able to come not us 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.600
 it seemed too mainstream the fact 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.660
 that we would have the three in addition I suppose 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.480
 that you pay a little and of course not between 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.920
 all three no no we do not stop this is like 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.739
 a promotional interview for you 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.870
 if we do not pay as promotional is 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.550
 tell us 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.620
 we worked out because we were too 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.420
 mainstream we do not want we do not need the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.430
 promotional promotion that good then 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.510
 promote the new video you have not 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.489
 taken a new video you have returned 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.840
 after last no we are not going to 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.460
 distinguish different is not the same 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.619
 fact of having taken out a disc is not what 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.940
 same as having returned no no no we have not 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.950
 said that we bolton have returned 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.300
 you have taken a video you were a 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.450
 time without doing anything you have done a 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.330
 video that's back to no no there has not been 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.310
 official official statement there has not been 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.660
 If there is no official communication, you do not know 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.490
 but you do not know is going to have is enough 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.670
 official you have made a video I do not know what 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.110
 we have seen here no no exclusively that 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.940
 is to return unless the day you recorded 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.880
 the video because you returned but good 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.670
 I'm sorry you said the ones in the video are 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.920
 we good pretty obvious not 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.750
 will you be wearing this same sweater that 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.330
 they are unforgettable jerseys there is only one 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.780
 how to say the comment of the jersey 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.970
 jersey the running says what was 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.009
 wishing to comment on the subject exercises and the 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.390
 Exercise theme had to bring up the subject 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.789
 of jersey is that that is your problem 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.480
 typical presenter bias 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.890
 mainstream 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.780
 Forgive me for saying it is my study 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.570
 typical and this is a program a plate 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.300
 mainstream and this camera forgives you 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.430
 say you are mainstream 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.430
 and I say mainstream because it is not mixed 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.790
 good 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.569
