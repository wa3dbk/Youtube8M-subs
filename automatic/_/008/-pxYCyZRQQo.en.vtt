00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
pattern just move it down one so you

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.990 
pattern just move it down one so you
have<00:01:24.340> an<00:01:24.460> e<00:01:24.700> an<00:01:24.880> E<00:01:25.840> major<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.770> an<00:01:26.890> E<00:01:27.039> major<00:01:27.189> of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.140 
g string 3rd fret of the B string and
2nd<00:03:10.760> fret<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.210> high<00:03:11.780> E<00:03:12.020> string<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:14.000> that

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
2nd fret of the high E string so that

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.440 
2nd fret of the high E string so that
should<00:03:14.330> sound<00:03:14.570> like<00:03:14.750> this<00:03:18.730> after<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.850> D<00:03:20.030> we're

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
should sound like this after the D we're

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.090 
should sound like this after the D we're
gonna<00:03:20.540> play<00:03:20.780> an<00:03:20.900> F<00:03:21.050> I'm<00:03:21.350> gonna<00:03:21.620> show<00:03:21.740> you<00:03:21.800> two

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
gonna play an F I'm gonna show you two

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.190 
gonna play an F I'm gonna show you two
ways<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.520> play<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.790> F<00:03:22.910> chord<00:03:23.150> because<00:03:23.570> one<00:03:24.050> of

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
ways to play the F chord because one of

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.870 
ways to play the F chord because one of
them<00:03:25.270> uses<00:03:26.270> a<00:03:26.300> bar<00:03:26.570> chord<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.550> I<00:03:28.550> know<00:03:28.610> that

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
them uses a bar chord and I know that

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.690 
them uses a bar chord and I know that
some<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.620> aren't<00:03:30.620> up<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:30.920> bar<00:03:31.160> chord<00:03:31.400> level

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
some of you aren't up to bar chord level

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.490 
some of you aren't up to bar chord level
yet<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.460> the<00:03:34.550> bar<00:03:34.730> chord<00:03:34.970> version<00:03:35.500> u

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
yet so this is the bar chord version u

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.230 
yet so this is the bar chord version u
bar<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:37.430> entire<00:03:38.500> first<00:03:39.500> fret<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:39.980> then<00:03:40.880> you

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
bar this entire first fret and then you

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:49.380 
bar this entire first fret and then you
make<00:03:41.420> an<00:03:41.540> e<00:03:41.840> shape<00:03:42.730> for<00:03:43.730> an<00:03:43.820> E<00:03:43.940> chord<00:03:44.200> up<00:03:45.200> here

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.210 

but<00:03:50.390> an<00:03:50.660> easier<00:03:51.200> version<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.740> F<00:03:51.890> is<00:03:54.010> with<00:03:55.010> this

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
but an easier version of F is with this

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.870 
but an easier version of F is with this
first<00:03:55.550> finger<00:03:55.790> u<00:03:56.210> bar<00:03:56.450> these<00:03:57.260> top<00:03:57.590> two<00:03:57.800> strings

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
first finger u bar these top two strings

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.390 
first finger u bar these top two strings
so<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.420> high<00:03:59.570> E<00:03:59.600> 1st<00:04:00.560> fret<00:04:01.060> also<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.860> B<00:04:04.040> string

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
so the high E 1st fret also the B string

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.200 
so the high E 1st fret also the B string
1st<00:04:05.210> fret<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:05.890> this<00:04:06.890> finger<00:04:07.100> is<00:04:07.310> holding<00:04:07.940> down

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
1st fret and this finger is holding down

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.970 
1st fret and this finger is holding down
both<00:04:08.510> of<00:04:08.690> them<00:04:09.400> then<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.430> add<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:12.620> add<00:04:12.830> your

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
both of them then you add you add your

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.130 
both of them then you add you add your
middle<00:04:13.190> finger<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:13.670> that's<00:04:14.300> gonna<00:04:14.480> go<00:04:14.720> on<00:04:15.020> the

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
middle finger and that's gonna go on the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.960 
middle finger and that's gonna go on the
second<00:04:15.620> fret<00:04:15.860> of<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:17.180> g<00:04:17.540> string<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.970> then

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
second fret of the g string and then

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.200 
second fret of the g string and then
we're<00:04:20.270> gonna<00:04:20.359> add<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:22.430> ring<00:04:22.640> finger<00:04:23.000> and

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
we're gonna add the ring finger and

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.200 
we're gonna add the ring finger and
that's<00:04:23.690> gonna<00:04:23.810> go<00:04:24.020> on<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.230> 3rd<00:04:24.470> fret<00:04:24.830> of<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.210> D

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
that's gonna go on the 3rd fret of the D

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.540 
that's gonna go on the 3rd fret of the D
string<00:04:26.240> so<00:04:27.170> that<00:04:27.200> should<00:04:27.710> sound<00:04:27.860> like<00:04:27.950> this

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.760 

then<00:04:32.550> we're<00:04:32.670> gonna<00:04:32.760> go<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.120> C<00:04:33.360> chord

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
then we're gonna go to a C chord

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.870 
then we're gonna go to a C chord
conveniently<00:04:34.770> if<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.070> use<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.400> fingering

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
conveniently if you use this fingering

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.050 
conveniently if you use this fingering
you<00:04:36.750> just<00:04:36.990> move<00:04:37.140> your<00:04:37.170> fingers<00:04:37.530> down<00:04:37.710> one<00:04:38.060> like

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
you just move your fingers down one like

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:49.340 
you just move your fingers down one like
that<00:04:43.970> then<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.000> D<00:04:45.270> minor<00:04:46.070> which<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.100> this<00:04:48.350> so

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
that then a D minor which is this so

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.690 
that then a D minor which is this so
instead<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.920> D<00:04:50.100> major<00:04:52.460> what<00:04:53.460> you're<00:04:53.610> gonna

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
instead of a D major what you're gonna

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.760 
instead of a D major what you're gonna
want<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.030> do<00:04:54.180> is<00:04:54.450> have<00:04:54.990> your<00:04:55.170> middle<00:04:55.380> finger

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
want to do is have your middle finger

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.930 
want to do is have your middle finger

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
take over the string that your index

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.320 
take over the string that your index

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.790 

for<00:05:57.910> the<00:05:58.000> second<00:05:58.330> part<00:05:58.480> of<00:05:58.540> the<00:05:58.630> chorus<00:05:58.960> we're

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
gonna use exactly the same chords we

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.050 
gonna use exactly the same chords we
were<00:06:01.690> using<00:06:01.900> before<00:06:02.320> they<00:06:03.040> are<00:06:03.490> just<00:06:03.730> arranged

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
were using before they are just arranged

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.969 
were using before they are just arranged
in<00:06:04.180> a<00:06:04.270> different<00:06:04.389> pattern<00:06:04.770> so<00:06:05.770> we're<00:06:05.889> gonna

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
in a different pattern so we're gonna

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:12.450 
in a different pattern so we're gonna
start<00:06:06.250> out<00:06:06.340> with<00:06:06.430> this<00:06:06.550> F<00:06:11.130> we're<00:06:12.130> gonna<00:06:12.220> go<00:06:12.400> to

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
start out with this F we're gonna go to

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:27.909 
start out with this F we're gonna go to
C<00:06:16.530> then<00:06:17.530> we're<00:06:17.650> gonna<00:06:17.770> go<00:06:17.949> to<00:06:17.979> D<00:06:18.190> minor<00:06:18.430> a<00:06:22.650> minor

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:44.150
