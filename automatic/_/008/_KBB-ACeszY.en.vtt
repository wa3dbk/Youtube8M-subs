best so far and you've got a few coats
this<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.289> supposed<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.679> an<00:00:31.800> antique<00:00:32.250> gold

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
this is supposed to be an antique gold

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.080 
this is supposed to be an antique gold
on<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.910> top<00:00:33.710> I<00:00:34.710> actually<00:00:35.190> think<00:00:35.430> tough<00:00:35.820> looks

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
on the top I actually think tough looks

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.650 
on the top I actually think tough looks
pretty<00:00:36.329> good<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:36.809> ceramic<00:00:38.420> additive<00:00:39.420> in

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
pretty good there ceramic additive in

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.700 
pretty good there ceramic additive in
there<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.200> help<00:00:40.320> reflect<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.950> heat<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.870> also

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
there to help reflect the heat and also

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.650 
there to help reflect the heat and also
keep<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> heat<00:00:44.250> out<00:00:44.370> people<00:00:44.879> warmth<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.329> type

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
keep the heat out people warmth in type

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
keep the heat out people warmth in type
of<00:00:45.840> thing<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.850> I<00:00:47.850> think<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.960> darker<00:00:49.350> color<00:00:49.620> is

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
of thing and I think the darker color is

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
of thing and I think the darker color is
actually<00:00:50.670> good<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.840> top<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.500> really

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
actually good on the top it's not really

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.139 
actually good on the top it's not really
gold<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.250> don't<00:00:53.489> know<00:00:53.579> where<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:53.820> got<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
gold I don't know where they got that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.830 
gold I don't know where they got that
from<00:00:54.379> but<00:00:55.789> because<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.000> ceramic<00:00:57.510> makes<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
from but because the ceramic makes it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.779 
from but because the ceramic makes it
kind<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.050> grippy<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> know<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
kind of grippy so I know it's going to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.599 
kind of grippy so I know it's going to
collect<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.239> lot<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.510> dirt<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> rather<00:01:02.399> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
collect a lot of dirt so I rather that

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.509 
collect a lot of dirt so I rather that
