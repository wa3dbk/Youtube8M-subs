00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.240
All dressed and ready to go?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.639
Oh, yeah.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.740
Taping them on.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.590
So you look a little bit ridiculous.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.990
I feel like a robot.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.810
And you look like a robot.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.910
But these are actually our outfits to go ice
canoeing, so we've got special socks, special

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.810
boots and hockey pads.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.750
I'm so excited to try ice canoeing.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.230
This is as Canadian as it gets.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.910
These are large, medium, small.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.180
My shoes.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.730
Can you stand up?

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.260
For a second.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.190
Put your feet like this.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.739
Like that on the toe.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.449
Yeah.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.920
So we have a super exciting morning today.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.140
We are out here in Quebec City and we are
going to be going ice canoeing.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.390
All geared up.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:02:36.140
Practicing in the snow but we're going to
be hitting the ice soon.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:03:08.280
So we officially survived ice canoeing on
the Saint Lawrence River.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.690
If you can have a look behind me you'll be
able to see what exactly we were trying to

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.690
canoe in.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.600
I mean it is a combination of ice, a bit of
water, chucks of icebergs.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.170
It's crazy!
