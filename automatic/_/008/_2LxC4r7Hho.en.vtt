which also houses the card slot more on

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.030 
which also houses the card slot more on
that<00:01:24.360> later<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:25.170> thing<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:26.009> about

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that later one thing I really like about

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.890 
that later one thing I really like about
this<00:01:26.369> case<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> fact<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> case<00:01:27.720> has

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
this case is the fact that the case has

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.510 
this case is the fact that the case has
four<00:01:28.140> plastic<00:01:28.380> corners<00:01:28.950> which<00:01:29.100> match<00:01:29.310> up

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
four plastic corners which match up

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
four plastic corners which match up
nicely<00:01:29.729> around<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> phone<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.930> hold<00:01:31.140> it

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
nicely around the phone to hold it

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
nicely around the phone to hold it
securely<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.799> place<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.520> also<00:01:32.790> means<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
securely in place this also means that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.730 
securely in place this also means that
should<00:01:33.479> decay<00:01:33.750> slip<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.259> hand<00:01:34.560> and
