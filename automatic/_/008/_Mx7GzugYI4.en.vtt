you're going to be applying your
foundation<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> egg<00:00:40.110> part<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.680> good<00:00:40.950> for

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
foundation and the egg part is good for

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
foundation and the egg part is good for
getting<00:00:41.309> into<00:00:41.730> your<00:00:41.850> corners<00:00:42.329> or<00:00:42.540> any<00:00:42.690> other

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
getting into your corners or any other

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.810 
getting into your corners or any other
place<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.250> hard<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> reach

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
place but it's going to be hard to reach

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.660 
place but it's going to be hard to reach
so<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.780> very<00:00:45.809> nice<00:00:46.260> design<00:00:46.770> very<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
so it's a very nice design very this is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.240 
so it's a very nice design very this is
the<00:00:47.789> size<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.510> wet<00:00:48.809> I've<00:00:49.110> already<00:00:49.590> wet<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the size of it wet I've already wet the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.680 
the size of it wet I've already wet the
sponge<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.120> run<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> under<00:00:51.660> cold

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
sponge and you just run it under cold

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.990 
sponge and you just run it under cold
water<00:00:52.079> squeeze<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> couple<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.219> times<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
water squeeze it a couple of times and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.490 
water squeeze it a couple of times and
this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> size<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> end

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
this is the size that it's going to end

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.040 
this is the size that it's going to end
up<00:00:55.649> being<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.449> bit<00:00:57.600> smaller

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
up being and it's a little bit smaller

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.840 
up being and it's a little bit smaller
when<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> first<00:00:59.129> get<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.730> probably

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
when you first get it it's probably

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.810 
when you first get it it's probably
about<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.809> big<00:01:00.920> when<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.219> wet<00:01:02.489> so

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
about this big when it's not wet so

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.969 
about this big when it's not wet so
that's<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.899> ok<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.439> foundation<00:01:04.890> that

my hands I'm just going to take the back

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.400 
my hands I'm just going to take the back
of<00:02:04.410> my<00:02:04.440> sponge<00:02:05.210> dab<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> couple<00:02:06.570> times<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
of my sponge dab it a couple times and

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:17.320 
of my sponge dab it a couple times and
just<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:09.060> fight

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.170 

and<00:02:17.570> I<00:02:18.020> apply<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.740> kind<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.910> circular

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
and I apply it in kind of circular

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.790 
and I apply it in kind of circular
motions<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.640> just<00:02:23.330> blend<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.810> on<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.440> into

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
motions and just blend it on to you into

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.490 
motions and just blend it on to you into
your<00:02:24.920> skin<00:02:25.240> I've<00:02:26.240> noticed<00:02:26.510> applying<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.290> this

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
your skin I've noticed applying it this

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.140 
your skin I've noticed applying it this
way<00:02:27.710> it<00:02:27.950> does<00:02:28.190> take<00:02:28.460> a<00:02:28.490> little<00:02:28.700> bit<00:02:28.850> more

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
way it does take a little bit more

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.630 
way it does take a little bit more
foundation<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.290> usually<00:02:30.980> use<00:02:31.400> because

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
foundation and you usually use because

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.640 
foundation and you usually use because
the<00:02:32.000> sponge<00:02:32.270> does<00:02:32.600> suck<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.080> up<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.290> little<00:02:33.410> bit

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
the sponge does suck it up a little bit

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.130 
the sponge does suck it up a little bit
so<00:02:34.280> that's<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.820> factor<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.780> might<00:02:35.960> want

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
so that's a factor that you might want

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.670 
so that's a factor that you might want
to<00:02:36.230> take<00:02:36.350> into<00:02:36.650> consideration<00:02:37.460> be<00:02:38.680> because

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
to take into consideration be because

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.680 
to take into consideration be because
usually<00:02:39.890> that's<00:02:40.460> all<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:40.850> would<00:02:41.030> need<00:02:41.180> on<00:02:41.420> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
usually that's all I would need on the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.770 
usually that's all I would need on the
back<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.990> my<00:02:42.050> hand<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.530> one<00:02:42.800> little<00:02:42.980> pump<00:02:43.280> but

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
back of my hand that one little pump but

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:53.200 
back of my hand that one little pump but
going<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.870> need<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.080> little<00:02:45.290> bit<00:02:45.410> more<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:52.210> i'm

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
going to need a little bit more and i'm

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.360 
going to need a little bit more and i'm
just<00:02:53.360> using<00:02:53.630> really<00:02:54.320> short<00:02:54.680> like<00:02:54.890> circular

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.770 
motions and just really soaking into my
skin<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:59.140> getting<00:03:00.140> good<00:03:00.770> coverage<00:03:04.750> get<00:03:05.750> a
