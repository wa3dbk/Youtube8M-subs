00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello you dear and side warmly 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.810
 welcome i am mister x gp and 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.780
 inventiveness on the pc server because there 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.300
 it looks like neither the one or the other 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.410
 got another change and me 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.990
 I just wanted this change 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.010
 show it 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.359
 Of course, no optically see any 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.699
 Change is the whole classic 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.680
 vegas also go the skills and the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.949
 symbolize the icons all the same and 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.230
 Ultimately of the total package is which 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.500
 still the hey i put a cage 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.730
 and do you hear then but the awakens 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.250
 We already see the first change 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.790
 The world Xinyu is a skill shot 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.030
 been 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.649
 that means it's not like that anymore 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.510
 we are used to that we just go up 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.280
 the opponent click on it but we 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.489
 now have cow as killshot about it 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.070
 in addition, forest cow similar to lynx her 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.050
 binding to another line 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.960
 or if you are through 1 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.360
 go through it shoot it again 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.469
 we just saw i show you 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.480
 now if we all look like that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.090
 one tries two million space ready 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.420
 to load for it if I now the times 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.040
 back off ok if your german renault 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.250
 Let's take the checkout so that's it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.740
 easier now the two get 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.680
 just by a cube because the cue 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.540
 it did not fly again 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.920
 about lux your binding now we see 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.530
 another change of coffee 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.550
 comes a bit late 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.760
 that maybe personally is a very 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.620
 stronger only because the strong investor 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.360
 just whether we lately in there 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.230
 now seen as a get away support 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.970
 had what you come if the countries with 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.190
 film was already formed sets a cage 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.760
 and up to world so now has the 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.250
 Church only a short delay of only 75 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.460
 in seconds that means a vienna leblanc 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.170
 and an aria you see all children 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.120
 actually react fast enough and 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.400
 jump out and make it more difficult 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.860
 the sitting cage to cage sets the 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.460
 now actually exactly on the opponent 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.250
 it 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.200
 or is there where the enemy is 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.030
 would probably run out 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.040
 then I came running straight now 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.290
 I him but no he runs backwards 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.580
 which do not have to be an example 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.680
 Of course it's a bit overdrawn 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.390
 shown 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.250
 but I find that I do not know what 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.580
 talking to myself thought so i found yes 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.780
 Anyway vegas problem in waging was 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.920
 that the opponents have danger someday 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.650
 baby's wail again for the me 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.300
 know this is me old and soon 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.800
 they could have had one anyway 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.870
 from the cage no longer confessed when or 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.370
 active already has a pool of 17 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.989
 seconds that is also level 1 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.879
 Of course you can still do that right now 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.489
 all teams 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.750
 So less make really two 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.060
 main change that is one of the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.500
 church where the enemy is pretty 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.540
 I probably do not go in there 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.489
 my it's on board now but it is 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.019
 to patch difficult people 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.159
 it is more difficult you can the pew 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.810
 now in German which I too 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:02.489
 personally a pity 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.989
 that was always very bad and me 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.269
 also believe that it will be partly later 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.310
 could be with the youtube as 100's 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.930
 harder because you when the opponent you 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.470
 already so and and vegas honest is yes 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.090
 I will not be that strong then 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.530
 then you come, for example, a caste 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.540
 Minister, how am I supposed to do this now? 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.609
 casting - meet with my co but 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.810
 then here or here is a bank the 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.969
 Tempt me more like I'm supposed to 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.169
 the coffers come that is not so 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.299
 until now we are playing to drive others 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.609
 of course, if you then try 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.799
 two minutes equal to two chambers 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.209
 who his usetec and that was also the 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.819
 intention conducts itself thinking 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.790
 So I can Hellweger two men 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.620
 but that can be fast as well 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.569
 again has a problem in the consideration 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.739
 because the mails come faster and if 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.079
 one has already done well 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.080
 almost any amount anyway with his 4 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.099
 brought 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.870
 you can maybe a little 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.319
 faster then exhaust that's not that 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.069
 problem 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.069
 because brisker could 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.019
 neither could be with her who anyway 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.860
 always pretty good 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.700
 it did not really need that 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.049
 otherwise they also have the 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:18.320
 little bit of the multi 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:20.310
 definitely reduced for me it is 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.949
 actually it is not difficult 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.389
 is to be estimated 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.620
 I do not know why I think so too 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.150
 here is a bit more tinkering to it 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.210
 just as they are currently on monday 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.710
 laser water there you come from me 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.510
 a video about it and that means too 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.130
 sometime my post that which 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.870
 first camp would have been 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.080
 bring them out if they did 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.300
 I would have to delete a champion 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.550
 me why so much to the players 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.870
 Above all, I am having fun 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.550
 very much on my middle of the hall 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.320
 played but then as I said it was 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.539
 always so counter for it and you see 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.229
 rather , it's probably not going to be pure 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.229
 there goes his 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.530
 minimal cool that the range of you 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.930
 I think it was a bit higher 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.560
 that may be minimal but it is 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.500
 20 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.400
 but the range is you can hear yes 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.870
 really now here maximum range so far 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.050
 still meet the media 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.030
 that was before with the pure on each 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.719
 take a case 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.370
 in the end, we have the roads now 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.469
 you know you like in the 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.020
 exchange comments was for you 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:37.229
 a brook or annoys you actually up 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.779
 the discussion is pretty clear 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.210
 So that's really the motive 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.729
 his 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.860
 Scaling down played instead 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.840
 direct damage of the cage comes 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:54.840
 delays the minimal which is good 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.009
 the range of kju but otherwise white 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.050
 I might not be what one 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.270
 I hope so, which one should 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.099
 be playable for me it's a champion 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.990
 I always like to run the rows 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.599
 opponent date and is dead 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.000
 well that was it first of me before 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.680
 the pc server I hope was for some 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.960
 it certainly not something new for some 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.210
 That was the new way and as I said so 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.509
 Shameless as it takes to the next 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.229
 times 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.229
 bayern ag
