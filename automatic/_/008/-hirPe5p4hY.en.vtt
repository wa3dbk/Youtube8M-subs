00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:17.210
 Hello my name is Michael and today 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.770
 we'll talk again about airplanes in 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.720
 battlefield 3 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.580
 My last video dedicated to management 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.279
 airplanes are now gaining popularity 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.360
 so I decided to continue this topic 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.730
 After all, there is still something to tell so 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.120
 today we will talk about improving 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.019
 that will make you the most effective 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.190
 in battle 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.869
 Let's start with the main slot and the most 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.830
 effective improvement for aircraft 

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:51.680
 is aviation glad of me often 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.320
 ask in the comments how to reset 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.100
 the tail of his plane is naturally possible 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.619
 reset 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.379
 but first of all you have to learn 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:01.189
 fly so that no one could eat you 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.439
 on the tail 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:05.869
 for this very thing exists 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.390
 aviation radar just noticed 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.430
 enemy plane behind you on the radar 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.100
 you must immediately 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.590
 do any maneuver which is not 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.380
 allow the enemy to sit on your tail 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.979
 Sorry to learn how to use 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.810
 aviation radar in words I can not 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.249
 the only thing I can advise 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.310
 fly as much as possible 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:31.609
 and understanding what's going on 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.920
 radar will come to you by itself with me 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.469
 that's exactly what happened 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.549
 go to the second slot and there I personally 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.149
 I use 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.670
 infrared traps they allow you 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.909
 move away from heat 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.310
 rockets why not rap traps now 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.350
 I'll actually explain the fish traps 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.039
 much more effective than 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.679
 infrared but my own and not buggy 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.079
 many times I did it so they 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.520
 not fought off enemy missiles while 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.340
 included them during 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.069
 sometimes they are nâ€™t even included i 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.700
 I noticed I read the forum and batloga what is 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:13.040
 happens not only for me but if u 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.640
 you fish traps turn on normally and 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.120
 no glitch 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.920
 you use them because besides 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.870
 that they beat a tip on you they 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.230
 allow you to disappear for 5 seconds with 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.470
 enemy radar and this is very important in 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.780
 battle and finally the third slot there i 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.280
 I recommend using containers with 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.180
 rocket armament 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.030
 this is 14 rockets which will allow you to be 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.080
 extremely effective in dealing with 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.480
 ground technology but this improvement 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.500
 I recommend to people who are a little bit 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.320
 already learned to fly a plane if 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.019
 you just sat at the helm so to speak 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.600
 you better use heat rocket 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.720
 hover because you just don't 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.000
 will not be able to control the aircraft 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.950
 attack ground equipment as it is 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.680
 Well, I need to think about improvements 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.200
 Now a little about choosing a plane to 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.910
 Sorry all American air 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.150
 equipment in battlefield3 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.150
 better than Russian technology 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.940
 attack helicopters and airplanes 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.450
 so for beginners, I recommend 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.630
 use american f-18 aircraft 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.870
 they are smaller in size than drying and 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.360
 In my opinion it is easier to learn 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.340
 it's easier to fly a plane 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.040
 now for more information 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.110
 video, I comment on my 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:51.170
 gameplay and so flying to f-18 but 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.810
 absolutely beautiful card is not banned 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.709
 Don plains that are simply created 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.799
 for flying equipment and indeed she 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.920
 just almost perfect adore this 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:07.910
 map and here I just shot down a helicopter 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.319
 enemy now I go to bmp lump 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.469
 enemy and bring out build 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.620
 mp usually incapacitated from one 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:19.289
 calling tanks are not always that is not 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.979
 always well everything depends on your accuracy 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:26.599
 i'm trying to hit here but she 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:29.669
 already destroyed by my allied helicopter 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:34.520
 then we fly behind the enemy on the plane 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:38.930
 jumped out but even an empty plane costs 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:42.090
 destroy all the same 150 points is not superfluous 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.800
 I turn around and see the enemy 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.780
 the plane that chases my 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.990
 ally do turn and I go to his tail 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:57.570
 practically respected from the first turn and 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:00.840
 Achieve 2 excellent so on we are looking 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.410
 sacrifice continually click on the button so that q 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.360
 for spot you victim sacrifice and not find 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:12.630
 so turn on the enemy 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:15.690
 helicopter and whip well turned 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:19.500
 so I'm flying to my own base 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:23.340
 in order to turn around and look normal 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.710
 in search of a new victim on his own 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.729
 base safe you can safely like this 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.680
 Here I see the neighborhood 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.710
 enemy motorcycle motorcycle is it by the way 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.949
 just the perfect goal for pumping 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:41.639
 aircraft if you blow up completely 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:45.270
 motorcycle with the enemy it will turn 250 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:48.720
 points and if on it also si4 and two 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.260
 enemies there almost 400 points passes then 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.400
 there is no need to pump 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.510
 pilaf and so do the turn trying to go to 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.400
 enemy helicopter 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:01.950
 I slow down very much this way is bad 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.560
 very much for a slow plane 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:09.940
 is a good target for the enemy here I see 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:12.490
 enemy plane I call him tail but he 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.560
 apparently does not know how to fly because 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.290
 don't even react to my old man will 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.400
 continues to fly farther I 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.560
 finish my video 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.090
 For now I will break. I hope he was to you. 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.090
 useful to all until
