video that I posted earlier where I

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.580 
video that I posted earlier where I
mounted<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.299> sony<00:00:06.839> action<00:00:07.550> camera<00:00:08.900> to<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.929> DJI

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
mounted a sony action camera to a DJI

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.450 
mounted a sony action camera to a DJI
phantom<00:00:11.280> 2<00:00:11.809> Vision+<00:00:12.950> and<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.040> problem<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.429> I

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
phantom 2 Vision+ and the problem that I

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.820 
phantom 2 Vision+ and the problem that I
had<00:00:14.610> before<00:00:14.759> was<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.299> camera<00:00:15.780> would<00:00:16.560> start

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
had before was the camera would start

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.650 
had before was the camera would start
vibrating<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.609> shaking<00:00:18.830> violently<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.660> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
vibrating and shaking violently and I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.900 
vibrating and shaking violently and I
fixed<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.350> issue<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:25.430> previously<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.670> was

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
fixed that issue so previously I was

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.320 
fixed that issue so previously I was
using<00:00:27.090> these<00:00:27.359> mounts<00:00:27.869> right<00:00:28.080> here<00:00:29.330> these

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
using these mounts right here these

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.190 
using these mounts right here these
GoPro<00:00:30.810> mounts<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:32.189> mouth<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.030> Sony<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> had

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
GoPro mounts to mouth to Sony so I had

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.680 
GoPro mounts to mouth to Sony so I had
this<00:00:34.380> arm<00:00:34.680> basically<00:00:35.640> connected<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.600> was

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
this arm basically connected and it was

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
this arm basically connected and it was
plugged<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.140> up<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.399> Sony<00:00:38.640> was

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
plugged in up here and the Sony was

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.850 
plugged in up here and the Sony was
connected<00:00:39.270> down<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.840> okay<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.680> what

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
connected down here okay and so what

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.520 
connected down here okay and so what
would<00:00:40.950> happen<00:00:41.129> was<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.489> would<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.700> start

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
would happen was it would just start

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
would happen was it would just start
flapping<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.379> around<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:47.399> using

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
flapping so to get around that I'm using

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.080 
flapping so to get around that I'm using
a<00:00:47.700> low<00:00:47.850> profile<00:00:48.390> arm<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.469> let<00:00:49.739> me<00:00:49.910> take<00:00:50.910> this

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
a low profile arm so let me take this

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.600 
a low profile arm so let me take this
off<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:52.430> okay<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.090> before<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.610> was

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
off here okay so before this one was

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.849 
off here okay so before this one was
mounted<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> plate<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.359> which<00:01:00.859> as

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
mounted to a plate like this which as

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.260 
mounted to a plate like this which as
you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.190> right<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.969> plate

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you can see right here I have a plate

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
you can see right here I have a plate
still<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:05.299> okay<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.810> dropped<00:01:07.439> it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
still on there okay I dropped it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.000 
still on there okay I dropped it
so<00:01:08.460> there's<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> plate<00:01:09.049> mounted<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.500> 3m

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
so there's the plate mounted with 3m

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.230 
so there's the plate mounted with 3m
tape<00:01:12.380> okay<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.159> basically<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.670> slide<00:01:15.060> these

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
tape okay and basically you slide these

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.260 
tape okay and basically you slide these
connect<00:01:15.659> these<00:01:15.960> uh<00:01:18.380> arms<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.619> into<00:01:20.270> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
connect these uh arms here into that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
connect these uh arms here into that
place<00:01:21.570> okay<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.470> basically<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
place okay so basically this is what the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.550 
place okay so basically this is what the
original<00:01:23.490> setup<00:01:24.090> look<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:26.479> okay<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.259> now

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
original setup look like okay and now

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.550 
original setup look like okay and now
what<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:30.420> low<00:01:30.720> profile<00:01:33.560> adapter

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
what I have is a low profile adapter

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.260 
what I have is a low profile adapter
okay<00:01:37.040> yeah<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.220> one's<00:01:38.400> long<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.210> curved<00:01:39.509> and

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
okay yeah this one's long and curved and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.630 
okay yeah this one's long and curved and
this<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:42.920> okay<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:47.430> what's

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
this one is not okay but what's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.270 
this one is not okay but what's
happening<00:01:48.000> was<00:01:48.740> vibration<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.860> traveling

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
happening was vibration was traveling

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.760 
happening was vibration was traveling
down<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.640> arm<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> weak<00:01:52.409> points<00:01:52.680> on

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
down this arm and all the weak points on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.289 
down this arm and all the weak points on
the<00:01:52.860> arm<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.250> started<00:01:53.490> making<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.880> gyrate

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the arm just started making it gyrate

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.060 
the arm just started making it gyrate
okay<00:01:55.549> you<00:01:56.549> don't<00:01:56.729> want<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.590> what<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> did<00:01:58.710> was

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
okay you don't want that what I did was

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.639 
okay you don't want that what I did was
I<00:01:59.100> installed<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.420> from<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> from<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
I installed this from the from the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.700 
I installed this from the from the
center<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.640> instead<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.939> plugging<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.390> in

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
center so instead of plugging it in

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.499 
center so instead of plugging it in
where<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:07.860> mount<00:02:08.190> point<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:09.119> sitting

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
where this this mount point is sitting

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.639 
where this this mount point is sitting
out

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
out

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.320 
out
so<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> don't<00:02:11.610> plug<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.000> from<00:02:12.120> this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so I don't plug it in from this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.660 
so I don't plug it in from this
direction<00:02:12.510> here<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.290> don't<00:02:14.010> plug<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.459> like

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
direction here I don't plug it in like

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.640 
direction here I don't plug it in like
that<00:02:14.849> I'm<00:02:15.569> going<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.780> plug<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.200> from<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
that I'm going to plug it in from the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:26.059 
that I'm going to plug it in from the
inside<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:21.000> where<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:23.390> camera<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.690> facing<00:02:25.260> or

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
inside to where the camera is facing or

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
you know if the tape comes undone I'm

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.030 
you know if the tape comes undone I'm
won't<00:02:54.150> ones<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.480> camera<00:02:54.840> see<00:02:55.470> how<00:02:55.530> loose<00:02:55.799> it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
won't ones the camera see how loose it

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.670 
won't ones the camera see how loose it
is<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:56.489> not<00:02:56.610> gonna<00:02:56.989> it's<00:02:57.989> very<00:02:58.230> loose<00:02:58.470> so

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
is so it's not gonna it's very loose so

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.259 
is so it's not gonna it's very loose so
it<00:02:58.739> doesn't<00:02:58.980> transfer<00:02:59.970> any<00:03:00.299> vibrations<00:03:01.190> okay

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
it doesn't transfer any vibrations okay

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.400 
it doesn't transfer any vibrations okay
now<00:03:03.269> I'm<00:03:03.329> gonna<00:03:03.420> put<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.660> camera<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.260> show

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.890 
for the camera okay so that I can mount
it<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.720> GoPro<00:03:23.520> accessories<00:03:24.520> this<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.450> vital<00:03:25.870> to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
it to GoPro accessories this is vital to

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.050 
it to GoPro accessories this is vital to
this<00:03:26.230> whole<00:03:26.440> setup<00:03:26.740> okay<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.760> have<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.030> to

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
this whole setup okay and I have it to

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.620 
this whole setup okay and I have it to

I'm gonna show you how I throw it on

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.100 
I'm gonna show you how I throw it on
like<00:03:35.740> this<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.570> while<00:03:37.959> it's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
like this and and and and while it's

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.080 
like this and and and and while it's
loose<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.500> just<00:03:38.680> let<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.890> camera<00:03:39.100> hang<00:03:39.490> and

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
loose I just let the camera hang and

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.780 
loose I just let the camera hang and
find<00:03:40.390> its<00:03:40.540> natural<00:03:41.310> center<00:03:42.310> point<00:03:42.580> for

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
find its natural center point for

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.250 
find its natural center point for
gravity<00:03:43.180> okay

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
gravity okay

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.830 
gravity okay
it's<00:03:44.890> not<00:03:45.040> even<00:03:45.220> tightened<00:03:45.520> right<00:03:45.670> now<00:03:45.850> and

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
it's not even tightened right now and

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.479 
it's not even tightened right now and
that<00:03:47.410> gives<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.650> enough<00:03:47.860> clearance<00:03:48.280> on<00:03:48.400> the

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
that gives you enough clearance on the

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.190 
that gives you enough clearance on the
side<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:49.209> arm<00:03:49.360> sort<00:03:50.080> of<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.200> landing<00:03:50.560> gear

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
side of the arm sort of the landing gear

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.740 
side of the arm sort of the landing gear
to<00:03:53.200> where<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.440> pictures<00:03:53.940> won't<00:03:54.940> be<00:03:55.150> obscured

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
to where the pictures won't be obscured

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.780 
to where the pictures won't be obscured
okay<00:03:57.330> all<00:03:58.330> right<00:03:58.510> now<00:03:58.690> I'm<00:03:59.350> gonna<00:03:59.640> tighten<00:04:00.640> it

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
okay all right now I'm gonna tighten it

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.240 
okay all right now I'm gonna tighten it
up<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.209> just<00:04:01.330> give<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.630> little<00:04:01.810> bit<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:02.250> a

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
up and just give you a little bit of a

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.550 
up and just give you a little bit of a
better<00:04:03.850> view<00:04:04.150> okay<00:04:04.959> now<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.290> have<00:04:05.470> this

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
better view okay now that I have this

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
better view okay now that I have this
camera<00:04:05.860> mounted<00:04:06.400> on<00:04:06.520> here<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:07.090> can<00:04:07.239> see<00:04:08.580> that

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
camera mounted on here you can see that

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.830 
camera mounted on here you can see that
its<00:04:10.230> center<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.290> gravity<00:04:11.770> is<00:04:12.190> basically<00:04:12.840> just

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
its center of gravity is basically just

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.479 
its center of gravity is basically just
behind<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.290> landing<00:04:14.680> gear<00:04:14.920> stripe<00:04:15.310> okay

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
behind the landing gear stripe okay

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.190 
behind the landing gear stripe okay
right<00:04:18.489> here<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.510> it's<00:04:19.630> more<00:04:19.810> towards<00:04:20.109> the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
right here so it's more towards the

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.420 
right here so it's more towards the
center<00:04:20.380> of<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.590> quadcopter<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:24.220> you're<00:04:24.340> not

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
center of the quadcopter so you're not

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.950 
center of the quadcopter so you're not
going<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.610> get<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.760> lot<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.180> vibration

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
going to get a lot of that vibration

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.380 
going to get a lot of that vibration
from<00:04:26.110> it's<00:04:26.290> sitting<00:04:26.560> too<00:04:26.860> far<00:04:26.890> out<00:04:27.340> here<00:04:27.850> and

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
from it's sitting too far out here and

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.190 
from it's sitting too far out here and
flopping<00:04:28.930> up<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.110> down<00:04:29.229> okay<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:32.050> is

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
flopping up and down okay so this is

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.930 
flopping up and down okay so this is
good<00:04:32.320> enough<00:04:32.350> for<00:04:32.590> taking<00:04:32.979> photos<00:04:33.340> while

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
good enough for taking photos while

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.680 
good enough for taking photos while
you're<00:04:34.150> flying

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
you're flying

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
you're flying
using<00:04:35.350> GPS<00:04:35.470> mode<00:04:35.919> or<00:04:36.460> GPS<00:04:37.090> Waypoint<00:04:37.270> mode<00:04:37.720> and

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
using GPS mode or GPS Waypoint mode and

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.140 
using GPS mode or GPS Waypoint mode and
but<00:04:39.130> video<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.550> still<00:04:39.760> you're<00:04:39.880> gonna<00:04:40.000> get

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
but video is still you're gonna get

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.770 
but video is still you're gonna get
jello<00:04:40.950> because<00:04:41.950> there's<00:04:42.340> no<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:43.660> know

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
jello because there's no you know

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.680 
jello because there's no you know
there's<00:04:43.960> no<00:04:44.050> rubberized<00:04:45.540> grommets<00:04:46.540> or

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
there's no rubberized grommets or

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.450 
there's no rubberized grommets or
anything<00:04:46.890> between<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:48.460> tape<00:04:48.700> in<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:50.460> mouth

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
anything between the tape in the mouth

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.270 
anything between the tape in the mouth
plate<00:04:51.729> here<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.780> it's<00:04:53.560> not<00:04:53.740> great<00:04:53.979> for<00:04:54.160> video

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
plate here so it's not great for video

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.409 
plate here so it's not great for video
because<00:04:54.610> you<00:04:54.669> still<00:04:54.850> get<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.030> jello<00:04:55.240> effect

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
because you still get the jello effect

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.469 
because you still get the jello effect
however<00:04:56.110> photos<00:04:56.740> or<00:04:56.950> photos<00:04:57.190> are<00:04:57.940> perfect

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
however photos or photos are perfect

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.219 
however photos or photos are perfect
okay

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
okay

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.580 
okay
so<00:04:59.680> just<00:04:59.860> put<00:04:59.979> on<00:05:00.070> time-lapse<00:05:00.660> let<00:05:01.660> it<00:05:01.780> go<00:05:01.960> and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
so just put on time-lapse let it go and
