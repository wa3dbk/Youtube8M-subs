00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.320
So I...

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.500
I think I will forgive you!

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.940
What are you saying, you bastard?!

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.060
It's you, Lidia!

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.630
Y-You!

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.890
Impossible!

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.640
You're saying it was I who didn't deliver the finishing blow?

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.860
I'm not the one who should feel ashamed!

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.640
You should!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.060
Don't give me that crap!

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.570
Oww...

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.460
Octavia...

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.760
We were perfect.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.350
Real swordsmen.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.320
Right?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.190
Yeah.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.760
It's just as you say.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.500
We were perfect.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.050
You were a true swordsman.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.470
Octavia.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.690
Lidia.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.080
This is something I've known for a while.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.820
I...

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.790
...loved you.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.170
And you loved me back, didn't you?

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.340
I realized this only after I distanced myself from the Empire.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.620
Back then...

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.620
We...

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.110
Didn't want to see each other die!
