is<00:00:30.439> another<00:00:30.739> requested<00:00:31.399> tutorial<00:00:31.520> I<00:00:32.059> got

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
is another requested tutorial I got

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.330 
is another requested tutorial I got
asked<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.170> couple<00:00:33.410> of<00:00:33.649> times<00:00:33.710> by<00:00:34.280> some

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
asked a couple of times by some

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.060 
asked a couple of times by some
different<00:00:35.000> guys<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:36.020> I<00:00:36.050> thought<00:00:36.559> I'd<00:00:36.800> tackle

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
different guys so I thought I'd tackle

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.060 
different guys so I thought I'd tackle
this<00:00:37.309> one<00:00:37.520> as<00:00:37.760> well<00:00:38.020> basically<00:00:39.020> what<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:39.860> do

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
this one as well basically what you do

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.930 
this one as well basically what you do
is<00:00:40.310> just<00:00:40.730> start<00:00:41.480> by<00:00:41.800> marking<00:00:42.800> off<00:00:43.130> the<00:00:43.250> area

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
is just start by marking off the area

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.430 
is just start by marking off the area
you<00:00:44.150> want<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.630> cut<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:46.160> template<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:46.960> so<00:00:47.960> I

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
you want to cut the template to so I

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.500 
you want to cut the template to so I
took<00:00:48.860> out<00:00:49.220> a<00:00:49.430> pencil<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.410> this<00:00:51.410> window<00:00:51.890> has<00:00:52.160> a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
took out a pencil and this window has a

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.640 
took out a pencil and this window has a
sort<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.630> abrasive<00:00:54.970> hazy<00:00:55.970> grey<00:00:56.660> area<00:00:57.230> around

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
sort of abrasive hazy grey area around

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.260 
sort of abrasive hazy grey area around
the<00:00:57.890> window<00:00:58.220> which<00:00:58.489> needs<00:00:58.790> to<00:00:58.880> be<00:00:58.940> painted

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
the window which needs to be painted

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.200 
the window which needs to be painted
black<00:00:59.630> and<00:00:59.930> is<00:01:00.590> ideal<00:01:01.130> for<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.640> pencil<00:01:02.060> to

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
black and is ideal for the pencil to

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.630 
black and is ideal for the pencil to
follow<00:01:02.480> around<00:01:02.660> so<00:01:03.440> you<00:01:03.530> know<00:01:03.739> which<00:01:03.980> edge<00:01:04.280> to

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
follow around so you know which edge to

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.060 
follow around so you know which edge to
follow<00:01:04.909> I<00:01:05.269> take<00:01:06.020> out<00:01:06.170> a<00:01:06.200> piece<00:01:06.560> of<00:01:06.619> masking

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
follow I take out a piece of masking

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.910 
follow I take out a piece of masking
tape<00:01:07.369> that<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.030> pretty<00:01:08.630> much<00:01:08.899> as<00:01:09.200> wide<00:01:09.560> as<00:01:09.890> the

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
tape that is pretty much as wide as the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.000 
tape that is pretty much as wide as the
window<00:01:10.520> itself<00:01:10.940> and<00:01:11.240> then<00:01:12.080> put<00:01:12.470> it<00:01:12.590> on<00:01:12.710> there

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
window itself and then put it on there

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.070 
window itself and then put it on there
and<00:01:13.190> try<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.700> get<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.150> on<00:01:14.270> there<00:01:14.510> without<00:01:14.659> any

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
and try to get it on there without any

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:32.420 
and try to get it on there without any
wrinkles<00:01:15.740> in<00:01:15.950> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.010 

once<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.640> masking<00:01:34.060> tape<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:34.300> on<00:01:34.600> there<00:01:34.840> you

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
once the masking tape is on there you

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.440 
once the masking tape is on there you
can<00:01:35.200> still<00:01:35.440> clearly<00:01:35.830> see<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.490> line<00:01:36.760> I<00:01:36.790> put<00:01:37.270> on

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
can still clearly see the line I put on

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.140 
can still clearly see the line I put on
there<00:01:37.630> earlier<00:01:38.110> through<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:39.729> now<00:01:39.910> know

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
there earlier through and you now know

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.870 
there earlier through and you now know
where<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.630> cut<00:01:40.870> but<00:01:41.650> what<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.070> could<00:01:42.280> also<00:01:42.460> do

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
where to cut but what you could also do

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.120 
where to cut but what you could also do
is<00:01:43.030> take<00:01:43.060> out<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.630> pen<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:43.990> follow<00:01:44.800> that<00:01:45.070> line

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
is take out a pen and follow that line

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.510 
is take out a pen and follow that line
again<00:01:46.000> but<00:01:46.390> then<00:01:46.570> on<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.080> masking<00:01:47.530> tape<00:01:47.560> so

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
again but then on the masking tape so

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.910 
again but then on the masking tape so
you<00:01:48.550> have<00:01:48.940> something<00:01:49.240> extra<00:01:49.960> that<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:50.590> can

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
you have something extra that you can

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.040 
you have something extra that you can
look<00:01:51.100> at<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.310> follow<00:01:51.759> with<00:01:52.210> your<00:01:52.420> knife<00:01:52.690> later

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
look at to follow with your knife later

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:24.479 
look at to follow with your knife later
on

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.000 

so<00:02:25.489> for<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.330> first<00:02:26.569> option<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.260> now<00:02:27.560> take<00:02:27.620> off

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
so for the first option you now take off

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.070 
so for the first option you now take off
the<00:02:28.190> masking<00:02:28.549> tape<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.000> place<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.599> onto<00:02:29.810> your

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
the masking tape and place it onto your

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.800 
the masking tape and place it onto your
workbench<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.860> then<00:02:31.459> carefully<00:02:31.819> cut<00:02:32.209> along

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
workbench and then carefully cut along

00:02:32.810 --> 00:03:07.210 
workbench and then carefully cut along
the<00:02:33.080> line<00:02:33.349> with<00:02:33.680> your<00:02:33.950> knife

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.119 

and<00:03:08.660> now<00:03:09.660> you're<00:03:09.870> pretty<00:03:10.140> much<00:03:10.319> left<00:03:10.650> with<00:03:10.890> a

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
and now you're pretty much left with a

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.400 
and now you're pretty much left with a
perfect<00:03:11.670> template<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.209> should<00:03:12.660> fit<00:03:12.959> on<00:03:13.170> tier

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
perfect template that should fit on tier

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.430 
perfect template that should fit on tier
window<00:03:13.830> without<00:03:14.640> any<00:03:14.910> problems<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.720> mask<00:03:16.170> off

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
window without any problems and mask off

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.460 
window without any problems and mask off
the<00:03:16.470> areas<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.190> don't<00:03:17.430> want<00:03:17.760> painted<00:03:18.180> black

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
the areas you don't want painted black

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.559 
the areas you don't want painted black
but<00:03:19.470> there<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:19.950> also<00:03:20.250> another<00:03:20.730> option<00:03:21.480> you

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
but there is also another option you

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.380 
but there is also another option you
have<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.680> by<00:03:23.129> again<00:03:23.549> tracing<00:03:24.180> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
have and that is by again tracing the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.259 
have and that is by again tracing the
line<00:03:24.629> on<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.200> masking<00:03:25.620> tape<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.209> instead<00:03:27.209> of

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
line on the masking tape and instead of

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.170 
line on the masking tape and instead of
taking<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.319> masking<00:03:28.709> tape<00:03:28.739> off<00:03:29.099> you<00:03:29.610> just<00:03:29.910> cut

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
taking the masking tape off you just cut

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.479 
taking the masking tape off you just cut
it<00:03:30.330> directly<00:03:30.750> onto<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.319> clear<00:03:31.530> parts<00:03:31.890> now

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
it directly onto the clear parts now

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.400 
it directly onto the clear parts now
there<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.879> a<00:03:32.910> bit<00:03:33.180> more<00:03:33.209> danger<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.140> as

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
there is a bit more danger in this as

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.619 
there is a bit more danger in this as
you<00:03:34.680> are<00:03:34.920> cutting<00:03:35.250> onto<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.849> clear<00:03:36.060> parts<00:03:36.420> and

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
you are cutting onto the clear parts and

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.020 
you are cutting onto the clear parts and
therefore<00:03:37.410> putting<00:03:37.890> scratches<00:03:38.580> into<00:03:38.940> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
therefore putting scratches into the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.080 
therefore putting scratches into the
clear<00:03:39.239> parts<00:03:39.569> so<00:03:40.140> be<00:03:40.620> sure<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.160> not<00:03:41.400> put<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> lot

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
clear parts so be sure to not put a lot

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.319 
clear parts so be sure to not put a lot
of<00:03:42.209> pressure<00:03:42.480> on<00:03:42.630> your<00:03:42.930> knife<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:44.180> keep<00:03:45.180> the

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
of pressure on your knife and keep the

of pressure on your knife and keep the
cut<00:03:45.510> clean<00:03:45.840> if<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.530> don't<00:03:46.829> have<00:03:47.069> faith<00:03:47.340> in

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
cut clean if you don't have faith in

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.240 
cut clean if you don't have faith in
yourself<00:03:48.030> with<00:03:48.450> making<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.019> cuts<00:03:49.230> clean<00:03:49.590> just

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
yourself with making the cuts clean just

00:03:50.250 --> 00:04:02.180 
yourself with making the cuts clean just
take<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.640> off<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.030> cut<00:03:51.299> it<00:03:51.450> on<00:03:51.599> your<00:03:51.840> workbench

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.780 

and<00:04:03.440> again<00:04:04.440> you're<00:04:04.710> left<00:04:04.950> with<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.220> perfect

and again you're left with a perfect

moving on to painting remove the pencil

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.250 
moving on to painting remove the pencil
marks<00:04:11.160> because<00:04:11.850> they<00:04:12.240> look<00:04:12.510> weird<00:04:12.810> once

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
marks because they look weird once

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.190 
marks because they look weird once
painted<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:14.150> decided<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.390> paint<00:04:15.630> these<00:04:15.810> with

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
painted I decided to paint these with

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.140 
painted I decided to paint these with
the<00:04:16.380> airbrush<00:04:16.769> this<00:04:17.070> time<00:04:17.370> this<00:04:17.730> could<00:04:17.940> also

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
the airbrush this time this could also

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.979 
the airbrush this time this could also
be<00:04:18.360> done<00:04:18.480> with<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.019> brush<00:04:19.350> or<00:04:19.620> with<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.220> spray<00:04:20.580> can

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
be done with a brush or with a spray can

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.900 
be done with a brush or with a spray can
but<00:04:21.989> for<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.380> airbrush<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:23.070> time<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.580> chose

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
but for the airbrush this time I chose

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.260 
but for the airbrush this time I chose
for<00:04:24.330> some<00:04:24.540> Vallejo<00:04:24.990> flat<00:04:25.590> black<00:04:26.160> which<00:04:26.940> looks

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
for some Vallejo flat black which looks

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.140 
for some Vallejo flat black which looks
perfectly<00:04:27.900> fine<00:04:28.230> on<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.710> outside<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.520> has<00:04:30.120> a

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
perfectly fine on the outside and has a

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.890 
perfectly fine on the outside and has a
nice<00:04:30.510> clean<00:04:30.570> effect<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:32.580> think<00:04:33.390> this<00:04:33.630> is<00:04:33.870> a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
nice clean effect and I think this is a

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.170 
nice clean effect and I think this is a
lot<00:04:34.230> cleaner<00:04:34.620> than<00:04:34.950> doing<00:04:35.280> this<00:04:35.430> with<00:04:35.670> a<00:04:35.700> brush

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
lot cleaner than doing this with a brush

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.620 
lot cleaner than doing this with a brush
it<00:04:37.170> saves<00:04:37.530> on<00:04:37.800> paint<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.970> looks<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.420> lot

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
it saves on paint and it looks a lot

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:56.740 
it saves on paint and it looks a lot
more<00:04:40.170> crisp<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.280> professional

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.560 

I<00:04:57.250> let<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.370> first<00:04:58.580> coat<00:04:58.700> drive<00:04:59.120> for<00:04:59.360> about

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
I let the first coat drive for about

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.690 
I let the first coat drive for about
four<00:04:59.900> minutes<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.500> then<00:05:00.920> moved<00:05:01.190> on<00:05:01.460> to<00:05:01.610> the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
four minutes and then moved on to the

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.630 
four minutes and then moved on to the
second<00:05:02.240> coat<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.630> that's<00:05:03.620> pretty<00:05:03.980> much<00:05:04.250> all

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
second coat and that's pretty much all

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:32.590 
second coat and that's pretty much all
you<00:05:04.670> need<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.240> do
