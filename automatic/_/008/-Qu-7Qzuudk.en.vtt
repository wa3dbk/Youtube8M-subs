you're also going to locate two levels

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.720 
you're also going to locate two levels
then<00:00:27.750> we're<00:00:27.869> going<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.019> place<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.859> tool

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
inches if we were to do six inch stripes

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.100 
inches if we were to do six inch stripes
we<00:02:15.730> place<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.269> top<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.720> tool<00:02:18.000> on<00:02:19.000> on<00:02:19.810> the

six number six with the line 10 inch you

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.500 
six number six with the line 10 inch you
move<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.959> down<00:02:26.109> to<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.470> 10<00:02:26.620> inches<00:02:27.359> place<00:02:28.359> the

move it down to the 10 inches place the
tool<00:02:28.780> on<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.769> line<00:02:30.760> with<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.570> number<00:02:31.810> 10

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
tool on the line with the number 10

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.099 
tool on the line with the number 10
again<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:33.609> decided<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.180> do<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:34.329> number<00:02:34.690> an

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
again we decided to do a number an

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.229 
again we decided to do a number an
8-inch<00:02:35.709> stripe<00:02:36.070> so<00:02:36.640> we're<00:02:36.880> going<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.060> place

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
8-inch stripe so we're going to place

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.920 
8-inch stripe so we're going to place
the<00:02:37.420> tool<00:02:37.630> on<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:37.989> line<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:39.359> has<00:02:40.359> the<00:02:40.690> number
