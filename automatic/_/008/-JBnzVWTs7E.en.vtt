00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
understanding so it's quite significant

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.870 
understanding so it's quite significant
and<00:04:00.230> that's<00:04:00.350> actually<00:04:00.530> another<00:04:00.920> lesson<00:04:01.130> well

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
and that's actually another lesson well

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.120 
and that's actually another lesson well
I<00:04:01.910> agree<00:04:02.270> we<00:04:02.480> were<00:04:02.570> doing<00:04:02.780> like<00:04:02.900> 30<00:04:03.170> 30<00:04:03.680> 10<00:04:03.980> or

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
I agree we were doing like 30 30 10 or

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.950 
I agree we were doing like 30 30 10 or
something<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.910> was<00:04:05.030> reading<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.450> nearly<00:04:05.630> 50

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
something it was reading the nearly 50

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.650 
something it was reading the nearly 50
miles<00:04:06.170> an<00:04:06.320> hour<00:04:06.490> massively<00:04:07.490> rightly<00:04:07.970> so

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
miles an hour massively rightly so

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.060 
miles an hour massively rightly so
anyway<00:04:08.900> let's<00:04:09.080> go<00:04:09.170> back<00:04:09.350> and<00:04:09.470> have<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.620> look<00:04:09.770> I

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
anyway let's go back and have a look I

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.890 
anyway let's go back and have a look I
want<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:10.820> have<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:10.970> look<00:04:11.120> again<00:04:11.270> because<00:04:11.750> it's

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
want to have a look again because it's

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.070 
want to have a look again because it's
barely<00:04:12.170> believable<00:04:13.270> it's<00:04:14.270> okay<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.810> speed

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
barely believable it's okay the speed

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.490 
barely believable it's okay the speed
