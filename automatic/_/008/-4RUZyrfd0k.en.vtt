but<00:00:53.350> still<00:00:53.620> use<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:53.920> different<00:00:54.309> remote<00:00:54.550> system

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
but still use a different remote system

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.090 
but still use a different remote system
that<00:00:55.210> allows<00:00:55.480> us<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.989> really<00:00:56.290> encapsulate

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
that allows us to really encapsulate

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.369 
that allows us to really encapsulate
that<00:00:57.129> arcade<00:00:57.790> feel<00:00:58.180> that<00:00:58.450> Sega<00:00:58.750> created<00:00:59.140> over

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379

the<00:00:59.410> years<00:01:01.290> 30<00:01:02.290> love<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.940> I<00:01:04.000> think<00:01:04.059> one<00:01:04.270> of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
the years 30 love well I think one of

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.760 
the years 30 love well I think one of
the<00:01:04.420> main<00:01:04.449> things<00:01:04.570> obviously<00:01:05.199> everybody's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
the main things obviously everybody's

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.740 
the main things obviously everybody's
familiar<00:01:05.979> we<00:01:06.369> sports<00:01:06.670> tennis<00:01:06.940> so<00:01:07.240> our<00:01:07.509> main

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
familiar we sports tennis so our main

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.469 
familiar we sports tennis so our main
focus<00:01:08.170> has<00:01:08.290> been<00:01:08.350> motion<00:01:09.340> control<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:10.390> so

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
focus has been motion control and so

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.880 
focus has been motion control and so
he's<00:01:10.630> taking<00:01:10.750> our<00:01:11.050> very<00:01:11.229> simple<00:01:11.619> sort<00:01:11.830> of

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
he's taking our very simple sort of

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.260 
he's taking our very simple sort of
control<00:01:12.190> system<00:01:12.399> that<00:01:12.670> everybody<00:01:12.970> kind<00:01:13.119> of

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
control system that everybody kind of

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.900 
control system that everybody kind of
expect<00:01:13.660> but<00:01:13.960> Marian<00:01:14.500> Getz<00:01:14.619> are<00:01:14.890> various<00:01:15.580> the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
expect but Marian Getz are various the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.219 
expect but Marian Getz are various the
contenders<00:01:16.360> day<00:01:16.540> which<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:17.020> think<00:01:17.170> will

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
contenders day which I think will

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.719 
contenders day which I think will
provide<00:01:17.530> by<00:01:17.740> different<00:01:18.100> sort<00:01:18.369> of<00:01:18.399> experience

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
provide by different sort of experience

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.490 
provide by different sort of experience
so<00:01:19.090> we've<00:01:19.360> been<00:01:19.450> taking<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.050> elements<00:01:20.410> from

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
so we've been taking the elements from

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.990 
so we've been taking the elements from

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
these ports tennis and adding more

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.999 
these ports tennis and adding more
gifted<00:01:22.420> anymore<00:01:22.840> movements<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.500> more

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
gifted anymore movements and more

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.200 
gifted anymore movements and more
control<00:01:24.369> it's<00:01:24.670> me

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.880 

the<00:01:30.210> wii<00:01:30.330> motionplus<00:01:30.660> which<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.440> effectively

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the wii motionplus which is effectively

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.650 
the wii motionplus which is effectively
nintendo's<00:01:32.580> new<00:01:32.610> add-on<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> weave

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
nintendo's new add-on to the weave

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.720 
nintendo's new add-on to the weave
technically<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.470> sort<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> adds<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.040> gyroscope

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
technically it sort of adds a gyroscope

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.300 
technically it sort of adds a gyroscope
to<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.450> allows<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.080> get

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.800 
to the we and that allows you to get
positioning<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> where<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.210> are<00:01:39.479> with

positioning as to where you are with
your<00:01:39.900> remote<00:01:40.260> now<00:01:41.010> with<00:01:41.400> regards<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.760> tennis

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
your remote now with regards to tennis

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.850 
your remote now with regards to tennis
that's<00:01:42.570> quite<00:01:42.810> helpful<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> allows

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
that's quite helpful because it allows

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.890 
that's quite helpful because it allows
you<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.160> give<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.520> bit<00:01:44.790> more<00:01:44.940> direction<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
you to give a bit more direction to the

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.540

like peace with the moon motion plus

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.070 
like peace with the moon motion plus
we're<00:01:56.640> able<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.119> apply<00:01:57.330> more<00:01:57.600> control<00:01:58.050> in

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
we're able to apply more control in

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.660 
we're able to apply more control in
terms<00:01:58.260> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> way<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.100> they<00:01:59.220> direct<00:01:59.580> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
terms of the way that they direct the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.070 
terms of the way that they direct the
shot<00:01:59.880> and<00:01:59.970> position<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.690> shot<00:02:00.899> will

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
shot and position that the shot will

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.410 
shot and position that the shot will
place<00:02:01.440> itself<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.950> call<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.729> ultimately<00:02:03.180> lends

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
place itself on call it ultimately lends

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.180 
place itself on call it ultimately lends
more<00:02:03.630> control<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.200> also<00:02:04.710> allows<00:02:04.920> us<00:02:05.070> to

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
more control and also allows us to

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.040 
more control and also allows us to
distinguish<00:02:05.640> more<00:02:05.880> between<00:02:06.180> shots<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.750> drop

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
distinguish more between shots like drop

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.550
