miles on it I am changing the fuel pump
reason<00:00:13.740> why<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:13.980> because<00:00:14.570> I'm<00:00:15.570> getting

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
reason why is because I'm getting

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.290

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
feels when it happens it feels like I'm

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
all right I've disconnected the negative

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.440 
all right I've disconnected the negative
wire<00:01:47.570> make<00:01:48.570> sure<00:01:48.720> that'll<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.020> no<00:01:49.170> power<00:01:53.450> and

you could just put the seat down and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.600 
you could just put the seat down and
you'll<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.880> able<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.120> reach<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:04.280> this<00:02:05.280> part

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
you'll be able to reach it this part

you'll be able to reach it this part
right<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:05.730> just<00:02:06.060> lifts<00:02:06.330> off<00:02:06.480> so<00:02:06.810> easy<00:02:07.650> access

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
right here just lifts off so easy access

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.030 
right here just lifts off so easy access
instead<00:02:09.510> of<00:02:09.630> taking<00:02:09.930> my<00:02:10.020> whole<00:02:10.200> boom<00:02:10.470> box<00:02:10.740> out

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
instead of taking my whole boom box out

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.590 
instead of taking my whole boom box out
so<00:02:13.940> you'll<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.180> three<00:02:15.600> screws<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:18.360> needs

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600

once you remove it you'll have access to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.140 
once you remove it you'll have access to
the<00:02:26.250> pump<00:02:29.990> when<00:02:30.990> removing<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> lines<00:02:32.150> when

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the pump when removing the lines when

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.260 
the pump when removing the lines when
you<00:02:33.240> take<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.570> one<00:02:33.900> out<00:02:34.080> first<00:02:35.270> it'll

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
you take this one out first it'll

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.110 
you take this one out first it'll
release<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.630> pressure<00:02:37.490> this<00:02:38.490> one<00:02:38.910> right<00:02:39.060> over

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
release the pressure this one right over

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.940 
release the pressure this one right over
here<00:02:39.620> will<00:02:40.620> have<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> lot<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.160> pressure<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.500> be

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
here will have a lot of pressure so be

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.940 
here will have a lot of pressure so be
careful<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.370> don't<00:02:44.460> get<00:02:44.700> your<00:02:44.940> face<00:02:45.210> splash

locking pliers great and pump slides
right<00:04:18.430> off<00:04:20.370> all<00:04:21.370> right<00:04:21.549> here<00:04:21.820> we<00:04:21.940> got<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.300> fuel

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
right off all right here we got the fuel

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.980 
right off all right here we got the fuel
pump<00:04:22.840> that's<00:04:23.800> all<00:04:23.950> it<00:04:24.100> brings<00:04:24.250> pump<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.750> line

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
pump that's all it brings pump the line

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.110 
pump that's all it brings pump the line
make<00:04:26.410> sure<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:26.680> measure<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.340> line<00:04:27.550> make<00:04:27.880> sure

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
make sure you measure the line make sure

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.670 
make sure you measure the line make sure
is<00:04:28.390> exactly<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.590> same<00:04:29.860> size<00:04:31.140> this<00:04:32.140> one<00:04:32.440> looks

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
is exactly the same size this one looks

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.709 
is exactly the same size this one looks
like<00:04:32.770> it's<00:04:32.980> not

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:35.719 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.610 

but<00:04:36.319> it<00:04:36.409> should<00:04:36.529> still<00:04:36.589> work

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
but it should still work

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.520 
but it should still work
because<00:04:39.280> their<00:04:39.550> nipple<00:04:40.030> is<00:04:40.240> pretty<00:04:40.930> long<00:04:41.140> so

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
because their nipple is pretty long so

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.410 
because their nipple is pretty long so
it'll<00:04:42.100> work<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.870> am<00:04:43.900> using<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.500> new<00:04:45.420> clamps

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.990 
it'll work and I am using the new clamps
that<00:04:46.540> comes<00:04:46.750> with<00:04:46.960> it
