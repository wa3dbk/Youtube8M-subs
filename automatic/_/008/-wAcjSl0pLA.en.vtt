 knobs 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.470
 finish 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.270
 As minimum 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.270
 in my life 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.610
 hello everyone I'm a poker flame and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.170
 Welcome to a tutorial 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.090
 origami today we're going to do to the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.980
 cap like this with paper you can choose 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.050
 the color you want and the type of paper 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.759
 that you want and even the size that I'm going 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.380
 to choose a normal folio the typical one 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.419
 you use at school and all those 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.559
 things because good is good nice for 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.870
 all and canada 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.210
 we started let's start like when 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.430
 we would make a comeoco to me especially 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.480
 It's hard for me to do squares I do not know why 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.480
 sports 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.290
 my mother must be crossing because 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.330
 I'm sticking fingers at this time if 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.730
 it was not planned or maybe not because 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.680
 sometimes he does not hear me so good if 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.010
 Origami is something that calms me down a lot 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.010
 it's like 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.739
 here we have the two squares that we have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.890
 fact that makes an X that X is 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.080
 important because we are going to double and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.290
 blocks in the middle of the x 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.649
 it is already six what is deviated is true of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.740
 what deviates from a certain master there are already points 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:20.399
 that fatigue already then we return to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.909
 rotate so it would be this part as 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.100
 they went to the hands they are very 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.030
 free in this video as you can see 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.399
 in the end this is not a joke 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.119
 we turn the paper and we will see what we can 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.300
 do 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.069
 audi and it should happen but it does not happen and 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.920
 normally when you do so you have a 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:44.670
 good paper because I know 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.860
 does well as it is not done well here for 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.490
 he has to do things 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.080
 or I am my children 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.720
 the thing is that when I'm drunk the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.200
 origami I'm given confession hacker 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.440
 of the day he proposes 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:09.010
 ok now we have this yes yes 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.680
 olé olé and even what we are going to do 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.780
 now we are going to double so it is a 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.060
 little more than half and in this 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.040
 also good, in fact, when 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.660
 I try things equally 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.960
 They go wrong 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.390
 at the end we have this is cool super 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.000
 which we turn the role of what we are going to 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:33.160
 to do is find what is this and we are going to 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.320
 fold again so very well white 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.570
 and again to me and so this is more 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.560
 difficult to make a damn firecracker 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.170
 now what we are going to do 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.360
 is that we are going to double this so that 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.700
 so that the visor does not move because 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.980
 these the viscera colleagues and we're going to 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.430
 fold so we're going to double this too 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.800
 because it looks nice and it will eat and it has 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.940
 stuck the colleague and then I do not know of 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.940
 where they peel but 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.230
 and after this what we are going to do 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.470
 is to do as the bowling alleys do not put 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.470
 the fear 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.980
 we have the challenge 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.379
 normally to this scripting 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.610
 I'm sorry for the minors 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:24.209
 sure there are minors 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.209
 there are many manual distributed shit 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:35.010
 fuck fuck that is already 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.099
 Here erases art art 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.180
 that I enjoyed that they had done French in my 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.180
 fucking life but it does not matter 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.799
 so if you see that something is like this a 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.849
 little loose because you can put zeal 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:52.549
 with the bars and with the bars theme by 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.980
 please stop saying this is a 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.810
 very random video but very large that 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.150
 I had never done anything like'm the 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.099
 plan for good in fact had done the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.840
 firecracker but this is more complicated this 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.540
 you make me feel neutral in papyrus flexia 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.739
 ok or now I'm a professional so 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.970
 none of that is all for today give me 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.079
 like if you like it if you do not like it 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.939
 generate do not do anything leave a comment 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.200
 While I am not offensive either subscribe 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.200
 once done and nothing we see
