let me show you a couple quick

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.919 
let me show you a couple quick
techniques<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.300> there<00:00:30.449> are<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.810> many

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
techniques so there are so many

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.749

different<00:00:31.320> kinds<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.650> olives<00:00:32.070> available<00:00:32.610> but

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
different kinds of olives available but

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.240 
different kinds of olives available but
the<00:00:32.880> basic<00:00:33.420> kind<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> know-how<00:00:34.739> when<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> comes

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the basic kind of know-how when it comes

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.490 
the basic kind of know-how when it comes
to<00:00:35.399> pitting<00:00:35.730> olives<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.780> black<00:00:36.989> olives

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
to pitting olives there are black olives

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.590 
to pitting olives there are black olives
and<00:00:37.620> green<00:00:37.860> olives<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.489> many<00:00:38.910> variations<00:00:39.239> in

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and green olives and many variations in

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.959 
and green olives and many variations in
between<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.469> black<00:00:40.710> olives<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.250> riper<00:00:41.579> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
between the black olives are riper so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180 
between the black olives are riper so
the<00:00:42.059> pit<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.480> looser<00:00:42.960> inside<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.590> general<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the pit is looser inside in general and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.190 
the pit is looser inside in general and
your<00:00:44.550> green<00:00:44.850> olives<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.450> much<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:45.809> attached

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
your green olives are much more attached

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.920 
your green olives are much more attached
to<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> pit<00:00:46.770> I've<00:00:47.700> got<00:00:47.910> these<00:00:48.059> tiny<00:00:48.360> Nicoise

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.460 
around pretty much get the pit right out
of<00:01:44.850> course<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.840> whole<00:01:46.079> but

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
of course it's not going to be whole but

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.350 
of course it's not going to be whole but
you'll<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.680> two<00:01:46.950> pretty<00:01:47.340> nice<00:01:47.579> halves<00:01:47.880> there

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you'll have two pretty nice halves there

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.139 
you'll have two pretty nice halves there
now<00:01:48.990> green<00:01:49.590> olives<00:01:49.950> again<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.640> pit<00:01:50.909> is

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
now green olives again that pit is

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.060 
now green olives again that pit is
really<00:01:51.899> well<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.770> you're<00:01:52.890> going<00:01:53.040> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
really well in there so you're going to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.270 
really well in there so you're going to
have<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.369> slice<00:01:53.720> around<00:01:54.720> these<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
have to slice around these it's not the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.300 
have to slice around these it's not the
most<00:01:56.430> efficient<00:01:56.909> thing<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.619> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
most efficient thing to do but it is a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.399 
most efficient thing to do but it is a
way<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> get<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.090> pit<00:02:00.329> out<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.990> there<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.259> are

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
way to get that pit out so there you are

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.289 
way to get that pit out so there you are
then<00:02:02.100> those<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:02.670> probably<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.180> be

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
then those will probably have to be

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.560 
then those will probably have to be
sliced<00:02:03.570> further<00:02:03.930> now<00:02:04.670> for<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> black<00:02:06.030> olives

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
sliced further now for the black olives

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.529 
sliced further now for the black olives
you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.500> big<00:02:07.829> batch<00:02:08.009> by<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.209> putting

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
you can do a big batch by just putting

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.760 
you can do a big batch by just putting
some<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> olives<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.619> with

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
some of the olives you can do this with

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.680 
some of the olives you can do this with
quite<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> few<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.849> we'll<00:02:12.300> put<00:02:12.450> them<00:02:12.510> down

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
quite a few and we'll put them down

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790 
quite a few and we'll put them down
underneath<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.379> ziplock

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
underneath the ziplock

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.070 
underneath the ziplock
bag<00:02:14.010> or<00:02:14.340> something<00:02:14.700> similar<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> nice

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
bag or something similar and with a nice

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.610 
bag or something similar and with a nice
heavy<00:02:16.380> pan<00:02:16.740> just<00:02:17.310> give<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.640> good<00:02:17.760> press<00:02:18.620> now

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
heavy pan just give it a good press now

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.690 
heavy pan just give it a good press now
again<00:02:19.890> you're<00:02:20.100> not<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.520> that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
again you're not going to have that

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.380 
again you're not going to have that
intact<00:02:21.270> olive<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.110> who's<00:02:22.740> counting<00:02:23.130> right

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
intact olive but who's counting right

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.970 
intact olive but who's counting right
then<00:02:24.390> same<00:02:24.900> thing<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.350> you're<00:02:25.530> going<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.800> just

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
then same thing is you're going to just

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.030 
then same thing is you're going to just
pull<00:02:26.400> those<00:02:26.610> out<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.210> make<00:02:27.270> sure<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.860> put

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
pull those out and make sure to put

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.540 
pull those out and make sure to put
those<00:02:29.310> pits<00:02:29.820> aside<00:02:30.480> keep<00:02:31.320> those<00:02:31.620> separated<00:02:32.160> I

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
those pits aside keep those separated I

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.300
