this waterfall I took in New York I have
to<00:03:51.049> dig<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.319> out<00:03:51.409> but<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.950> did<00:03:52.310> take<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:53.030> same

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
to dig it out but I did take the same

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.130 
to dig it out but I did take the same
waterfall<00:03:53.810> with<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.879> 3GS<00:03:55.879> camera<00:03:56.659> I<00:03:56.720> believe

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140

waterfall with the 3GS camera I believe
and<00:03:58.000> once<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.090> dig<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.329> up<00:03:59.420> we<00:03:59.569> can<00:03:59.689> do<00:03:59.810> a

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
and once I dig it up we can do a

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.780 
and once I dig it up we can do a
comparison<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.470> see<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.829> difference<00:04:01.340> as<00:04:01.730> you

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
comparison and see the difference as you

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.089 
comparison and see the difference as you
can<00:04:02.030> see<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:03.170> can<00:04:03.290> watch<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.650> video<00:04:03.889> in

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
can see you can watch the video in

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:10.660 
can see you can watch the video in
landscape<00:04:04.609> or<00:04:04.819> portrait<00:04:04.879> mode<00:04:09.190> let's<00:04:10.190> take<00:04:10.639> a
