card and I think some RCA cables so this

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.910 
card and I think some RCA cables so this
is<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:50.329> this<00:01:51.329> was<00:01:51.390> my<00:01:51.930> second<00:01:52.350> capture<00:01:52.649> card<00:01:52.799> my

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
is a this was my second capture card my

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.060 
is a this was my second capture card my
first<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.640> was<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> dazzle<00:01:54.990> DBC<00:01:55.409> 100<00:01:55.920> which

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
first one is was a dazzle DBC 100 which

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.200 
first one is was a dazzle DBC 100 which
I<00:01:56.340> would<00:01:56.969> still<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.270> using<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:58.640> due<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.670> some

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I would still be using but due to some

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.330 
I would still be using but due to some
audio<00:02:00.420> errors<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.530> no<00:02:01.649> longer<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.250> use

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
audio errors with it I no longer to use

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.060 
audio errors with it I no longer to use
it<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.409> this<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
it so this is the this is the this is

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.920 
it so this is the this is the this is
the<00:02:05.189> step-up<00:02:05.640> from<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.899> a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the step-up from it and this is a

if<00:03:16.030> it's<00:03:16.510> just<00:03:16.720> more<00:03:16.870> convenient<00:03:17.109> for<00:03:17.290> me<00:03:17.319> to

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470

record<00:03:17.769> on<00:03:18.209> capture<00:03:19.209> card<00:03:19.389> so<00:03:19.840> yeah<00:03:19.959> this

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
record on capture card so yeah this

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.280 
record on capture card so yeah this
thing<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.530> pretty<00:03:20.739> standard<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.840> dazzle

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
thing is pretty standard the dazzle

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.840 
thing is pretty standard the dazzle
doesn't<00:03:24.190> be<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.400> same

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
doesn't be the same

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.050 
doesn't be the same
so<00:03:25.709> either<00:03:26.709> way<00:03:27.040> like<00:03:27.250> if<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.489> want<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.730> if<00:03:27.910> you

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
so either way like if you want to if you

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.150 
so either way like if you want to if you
want<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.230> only<00:03:29.349> thing<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:29.680> says<00:03:29.829> this<00:03:30.040> has

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
want the the only thing it says this has

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.309 
want the the only thing it says this has
better<00:03:30.400> quality<00:03:30.579> than<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.120> dazzle<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:32.109> if<00:03:32.230> you

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
better quality than the dazzle so if you

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.440 
better quality than the dazzle so if you
want<00:03:32.500> slightly<00:03:33.040> better<00:03:33.250> quality<00:03:33.340> go<00:03:34.299> ahead

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
want slightly better quality go ahead

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.360 
want slightly better quality go ahead
with<00:03:34.599> this<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.440> only<00:03:35.620> reason<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:36.010> didn't<00:03:36.250> get

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
with this the only reason I didn't get

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.740 
with this the only reason I didn't get
another<00:03:36.549> dazzle<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.180> because<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.510> couldn't

to do here's the video in my second
video<00:04:21.750> in<00:04:22.049> what<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:22.590> usually<00:04:22.710> do<00:04:22.919> is<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.130> plug<00:04:23.370> in

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
video in what I usually do is I plug in

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.969 
video in what I usually do is I plug in
here<00:04:23.790> my<00:04:24.240> if<00:04:25.169> I'm<00:04:25.350> not<00:04:25.470> plugged<00:04:25.710> in<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.889> the

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
here my if I'm not plugged in to the

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.060 
here my if I'm not plugged in to the
side<00:04:26.220> here<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.639> plug<00:04:27.180> in<00:04:27.300> here<00:04:27.620> for<00:04:28.620> my<00:04:28.860> game

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
side here I plug in here for my game

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.279 
side here I plug in here for my game
console<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.610> this<00:04:29.940> is<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> video<00:04:30.539> out<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:31.080> get

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
console and this is the video out I get

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.490 
console and this is the video out I get
another<00:04:31.560> cable<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:33.060> take<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.510> cable<00:04:33.780> plug

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
another cable and I take that cable plug

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.890 
another cable and I take that cable plug
it<00:04:34.620> into<00:04:34.770> my<00:04:35.930> plug<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.050> into<00:04:37.199> my<00:04:38.600> my<00:04:39.600> capture

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
it into my plug it into my my capture

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.719 
it into my plug it into my my capture
card<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.260> then<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:40.620> goes<00:04:40.800> through<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.550> can

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
card and then that goes through so I can

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.240 
card and then that goes through so I can
use<00:04:41.820> my<00:04:41.970> TV<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.810> play<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.080> game<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.530> use<00:04:44.100> my

use my TV to play the game and use my

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.320 
use my TV to play the game and use my
computer<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.729> capture<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.180> now<00:04:45.860> because<00:04:46.860> of

computer to capture it now because of

computer to capture it now because of
the<00:04:48.330> way<00:04:48.449> my<00:04:48.630> TV<00:04:48.960> is<00:04:49.110> it's<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.500> con<00:04:50.090> convex<00:04:51.090> TV<00:04:51.919> an

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
old-school convex TV what's something

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.490 
old-school convex TV what's something
you<00:04:56.580> might<00:04:56.760> notice<00:04:57.120> in<00:04:57.240> my<00:04:57.300> LPS<00:04:57.660> is<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.169> on

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
you might notice in my LPS is that on

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.770 
you might notice in my LPS is that on
the<00:04:59.100> higher<00:04:59.340> on<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.850> tops<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.300> bottoms<00:05:00.600> is<00:05:00.750> a

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
the higher on the tops and bottoms is a

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.480 
the higher on the tops and bottoms is a
little<00:05:01.050> brighter<00:05:01.289> that's<00:05:02.039> because<00:05:02.340> that's

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
little brighter that's because that's

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.550 
little brighter that's because that's
the<00:05:02.669> way<00:05:02.760> these<00:05:02.910> TV<00:05:03.330> screens<00:05:03.630> are<00:05:03.780> made<00:05:03.810> it's<00:05:04.500> a

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
the way these TV screens are made it's a

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.860 
the way these TV screens are made it's a
little<00:05:04.740> dusty<00:05:05.070> too<00:05:05.220> because<00:05:06.000> it's<00:05:06.270> because

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
little dusty too because it's because

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.170 
little dusty too because it's because
it's<00:05:07.050> convex<00:05:07.560> because<00:05:07.979> it<00:05:08.100> goes<00:05:08.250> in<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.880> bubble

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
it's convex because it goes in a bubble

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.420 
it's convex because it goes in a bubble
shape<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:10.169> has<00:05:10.350> to<00:05:10.500> put<00:05:10.650> light<00:05:10.860> up<00:05:11.010> here<00:05:11.250> and

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
shape it has to put light up here and

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.089 
shape it has to put light up here and
light<00:05:11.910> down<00:05:12.120> here<00:05:12.180> to<00:05:13.169> even<00:05:13.590> out<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:13.889> that

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
light down here to even out and that

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.550 
light down here to even out and that
comes<00:05:14.400> down<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.580> my<00:05:14.760> cache<00:05:15.000> recordings<00:05:15.599> but

comes down to my cache recordings but

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.260 
comes down to my cache recordings but
there<00:05:16.949> are<00:05:17.130> ways<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.400> fix<00:05:17.699> that<00:05:17.940> it's<00:05:18.120> not

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
there are ways to fix that it's not

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.279 
there are ways to fix that it's not
hundred<00:05:18.479> percent<00:05:18.510> but<00:05:18.930> there<00:05:19.050> are<00:05:19.139> ways<00:05:19.260> to

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
hundred percent but there are ways to

hundred percent but there are ways to
fix<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.710> now<00:05:19.889> if<00:05:20.220> you<00:05:20.280> don't<00:05:20.580> have<00:05:20.760> AV<00:05:20.940> out

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
fix that now if you don't have AV out

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.480 
fix that now if you don't have AV out
you're<00:05:22.740> either<00:05:22.830> going<00:05:23.039> to<00:05:23.099> need<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.340> get<00:05:23.460> a

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
you're either going to need to get a

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.520 
you're either going to need to get a
splitter<00:05:24.979> an<00:05:25.979> out<00:05:26.669> splitter<00:05:27.120> or<00:05:27.440> you're<00:05:28.440> gonna

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
splitter an out splitter or you're gonna

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.810 
splitter an out splitter or you're gonna
have<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:28.919> just<00:05:29.070> plug<00:05:29.340> your<00:05:30.830> game<00:05:31.830> console<00:05:32.280> into

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
have to just plug your game console into

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.600 
have to just plug your game console into
the<00:05:32.910> capture<00:05:33.210> card<00:05:33.449> and<00:05:33.599> use<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.650> plays

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
the capture card and use the and plays

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.210 
the capture card and use the and plays
in<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:35.970> software<00:05:36.449> now<00:05:36.960> this<00:05:37.800> isn't<00:05:38.070> too<00:05:38.190> bad

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
in the software now this isn't too bad

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.020 
in the software now this isn't too bad
but<00:05:38.789> there<00:05:38.940> is<00:05:39.090> for<00:05:39.419> games<00:05:39.599> like<00:05:39.750> Paper<00:05:40.199> Mario

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
but there is for games like Paper Mario

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.360 
but there is for games like Paper Mario
where<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:42.090> have<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.300> have<00:05:42.389> timing<00:05:43.190> this<00:05:44.190> could

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
where you have to have timing this could

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.189 
where you have to have timing this could
plugging<00:05:45.150> in<00:05:45.270> directly<00:05:45.570> here<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:45.960> come<00:05:46.080> this

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
plugging in directly here and come this

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.689 
plugging in directly here and come this
to<00:05:46.320> be<00:05:46.410> back<00:05:46.590> because<00:05:46.680> there<00:05:46.889> is<00:05:47.010> a<00:05:47.039> slight

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
to be back because there is a slight

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.250 
to be back because there is a slight
delay<00:05:48.530> until<00:05:49.530> you<00:05:49.770> get<00:05:49.889> used<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.160> it<00:05:50.250> like<00:05:51.260> like

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
delay until you get used to it like like

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.620 
delay until you get used to it like like
games<00:05:52.500> like<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.159> need<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.669> a<00:05:54.120> ballute

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
games like that you need a a ballute

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.870 
games like that you need a a ballute
precision<00:05:55.139> with<00:05:55.289> like<00:05:55.500> Tony<00:05:56.220> Hawk<00:05:56.490> I<00:05:56.550> would

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
precision with like Tony Hawk I would

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.129 
precision with like Tony Hawk I would
not<00:05:57.030> recommend<00:05:57.180> directing<00:05:57.870> I<00:05:57.990> would

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
not recommend directing I would

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.370 
not recommend directing I would
recommend<00:05:59.010> going<00:05:59.130> through<00:05:59.250> your<00:05:59.430> TV<00:05:59.639> or<00:05:59.789> your
