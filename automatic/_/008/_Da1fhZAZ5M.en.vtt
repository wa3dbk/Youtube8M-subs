00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.730 
another causes of chemical reaction an
explosion<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:04.150> so<00:02:04.390> now<00:02:04.540> you<00:02:04.990> have<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.380> basic

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
explosion and so now you have the basic

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.590 
explosion and so now you have the basic
constructs<00:02:06.159> of<00:02:06.430> again<00:02:06.700> blocks<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.390> tools

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
constructs of again blocks and tools

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.779 
constructs of again blocks and tools
come<00:02:08.020> together<00:02:08.349> to<00:02:08.920> form<00:02:08.950> puzzles<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.729> in

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
come together to form puzzles and in

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.880 
come together to form puzzles and in
this<00:02:09.970> puzzle<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.750> player<00:02:10.989> has<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.319> level<00:02:11.800> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
this puzzle the player has to level the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.290 
this puzzle the player has to level the
entire<00:02:11.920> structure<00:02:12.550> with<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.120> single<00:02:13.540> throw<00:02:15.300> all

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
entire structure with a single throw all

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.330 
entire structure with a single throw all
right<00:02:16.510> maybe<00:02:16.720> two<00:02:16.959> throws<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:23.010> we've<00:02:24.010> built

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
right maybe two throws so we've built

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.509 
right maybe two throws so we've built
literally<00:02:25.000> hundreds<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.959> levels<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.069> puzzles

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
literally hundreds of levels and puzzles

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.610 
literally hundreds of levels and puzzles
for<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.730> game<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.390> challenge<00:02:28.780> players<00:02:29.050> with
