00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hi guys to leave Tahiti and today 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.009
 I came back to talk a little bit about 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.980
 liars from ireland ratified 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.490
 publisher's October launch 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.290
 next and a book so the tasco 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.289
 good my first contact with the author 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.590
 and bacardi was through the historical book 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.590
 frank report the infamous history of 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.920
 frank lampard bank that I read in the beginning 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.830
 of the year I think and not of five stars 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.260
 because of games of a behavior is 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.160
 especially the character that bothers me 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.270
 a little 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.790
 but this book here people write here 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.800
 I'll tell you how the experience was. 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.050
 it was being supplemented 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.770
 super praised goes several buttons that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.860
 No one was commenting there. 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.590
 shows were discussions so one okay up 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.480
 cap of the united states attracted me 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.250
 quite so you can not imagine 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.789
 more or less about what this would be 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.039
 story I read the synopsis on a tram one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.680
 history about the goal 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.600
 but people are different the book is going to be 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.330
 narrated in the first person by the fall 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 She said she is the daughter and granddaughter More 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.049
 old woman of the sinclar family who is a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.960
 super state traditional family in 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.610
 Yes, you are very rich, and they are very rich. 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.979
 need that the little model where 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.840
 even if you see a person you 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 recognizes that it is the 5 is by the model that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.600
 follow him for the behavior they 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.110
 are in a hurry or prison they need 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.140
 to continue to the standards of the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.640
 good that family is the oldest granddaughter 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.560
 her mother and insists that she 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.720
 or grandfather reserves that the patriarch of 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.159
 family, then he can sort of 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.899
 to manipulate all people to 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.549
 do his will because all the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.040
 people to have an eye on heritage 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.689
 he can handle it well and gives 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.090
 This family has an island. 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.259
 certain place in the United States and 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.689
 all the heroes 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.969
 This family goes there and has a whole 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.610
 waiting as people I do not expect 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.740
 no ritual to say so was to whom 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.049
 born always goes to the island in the summers 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.000
 spending time with family with cousins and 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.270
 always have to follow the standards have to 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.750
 obey his grandfather from home and it 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.210
 that this family so south 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.550
 had this to the standards before 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.520
 to respect one of these rules is 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.320
 so it surpassed the can not then 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.620
 falls and she will always leave the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.640
 island 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.930
 only at a certain point yes a 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.480
 time she went 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.280
 something happened and she did not 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.970
 can remember she suffered a 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.310
 accident and is traumatized and picturesque 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.980
 strong head can not remember 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.690
 what happened and she changes very little 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.070
 from the various as from this 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.080
 We'll find out a little bit later. 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.170
 of the past gives a little of the present 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.239
 that it will become thus the beginning 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.520
 This book is so boring. 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.820
 boring is how we know the family 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.860
 a noble family sucks because 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.870
 those who do not remember that the 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.450
 what is happening until the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.610
 strange hockey behaviors so 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.739
 but it was a sharing to his thing that 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.540
 refer to where this book is leading because 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.220
 this book is good because everyone today 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.130
 this is going to take what is a half of 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.060
 book people make plans we realize the 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.030
 What happened? What was all this about you? 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.440
 It is so hot wonderful book 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.080
 when he discovered that it had happened 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.870
 when I called and gathered all the 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.700
 pieces and so on 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.400
 My gosh, how did I realize that before? 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.370
 this fantastic height 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.320
 well you do not know which side you stand on 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.959
 who you support and so the best you 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.709
 You have to do is not know anything about the 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.680
 book that I told the family of 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.959
 girl ex-president and so will you 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.980
 going through the beginning of history will 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.260
 It can be annoying as I found it and it continues 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.780
 time because there is a reason why 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.570
 everything she's on the street and the way she 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:12.970
 narrated and all actions that 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:15.489
 They will happen, they have a reason and it's bad 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.760
 scott westerfeld and some 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.620
 newspapers and magazines read 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.880
 I think this book is one of the most 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.130
 Fantastic I read 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.870
 2014 I think it probably just is 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.390
 along with the mechanical princess but so 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.010
 it takes totally mechanical reason 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.870
 entirely different this book was 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.850
 striking the way they phosphates 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.070
 facts that he solved is the author 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.680
 decided to put here how 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.170
 amazing is the magic of this book is 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.990
 why give a thump like that 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.780
 You did not expect and make that sense. 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.910
 And you fucking hell 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.770
 that toy was what I found of 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.900
 liars I highly recommend reading 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.660
 of this book if you are stuck in the 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.520
 start do not give up this cover a lot of people 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.370
 Did not like it but also got to see it. 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.820
 with the spirit of some book scenes 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:14.410
 then it has to do with the other cover more 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.340
 beautiful but it's a little bit generic 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.440
 huh 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.480
 this has to do with the content of the 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.240
 book and you also said just go 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.910
 fix it with a year that I have to see 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.950
 what they symbolize when you read 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.660
 the end of this super recommended book 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.060
