00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and we made a poor decision I mean

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.679 
and we made a poor decision I mean
whether<00:01:38.250> though<00:01:38.729> I'd<00:01:38.880> probably<00:01:39.090> his<00:01:39.299> own<00:01:39.450> say

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
whether though I'd probably his own say

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.810 
whether though I'd probably his own say
something<00:01:40.140> though<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.490> simply<00:01:41.490> fill<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
something though I simply fill that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.569 
something though I simply fill that
Franco<00:01:42.390> would<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.689> tank<00:01:43.170> boulder<00:01:43.530> when<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
Franco would a tank boulder when the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.710 
Franco would a tank boulder when the
ball<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.790> thrown<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.270> was<00:01:45.360> controlled

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
ball was thrown and then was controlled

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.039

it<00:01:45.840> with<00:01:45.960> his<00:01:46.079> own<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:48.180> thought<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> was<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
it with his own and I thought I was a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.749 
it with his own and I thought I was a
free<00:01:49.200> kick<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> wasn't<00:01:49.799> given<00:01:49.979> Ryan<00:01:50.369> me<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.610> see

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
free kick it wasn't given Ryan me to see

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.160 
free kick it wasn't given Ryan me to see
even<00:01:51.000> maybe<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.360> could<00:01:51.509> arrived<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> later

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
even maybe we could arrived at it later

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.960 
even maybe we could arrived at it later
so<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.250> two<00:01:53.399> things<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.759> mean<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
so it was one of two things I mean the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
so it was one of two things I mean the
4th<00:01:54.180> corps<00:01:54.390> fellows<00:01:54.720> earthly<00:01:55.079> thick<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.890> it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
4th corps fellows earthly thick and it

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.170 
4th corps fellows earthly thick and it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
was getting against this having said

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.340 
was getting against this having said
that<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.420> still<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.780> defend<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.259> it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that we still have to defend it when it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.230 
that we still have to defend it when it
comes<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.490> better<00:01:59.610> about

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
