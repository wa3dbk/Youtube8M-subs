just<00:01:33.540> drive<00:01:33.840> themselves<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.189> know

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
just drive themselves because you know

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
what one thing computers are really good

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.120

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.490 
in September the way that they're going
to<00:03:16.060> build<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.720> well<00:03:17.049> that<00:03:17.290> they're<00:03:17.410> going

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
to build this is well that they're going

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.229 
to build this is well that they're going
to<00:03:17.590> prefabricate<00:03:18.099> parts<00:03:18.819> of<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.030> building

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
to prefabricate parts of the building

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.000 
to prefabricate parts of the building
and<00:03:19.540> then<00:03:19.959> just<00:03:20.230> like<00:03:20.410> move<00:03:20.650> them<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.919> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
and then just like move them to the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.440 
and then just like move them to the
location<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.549> put<00:03:21.700> them<00:03:21.849> together<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.359> like

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
location and put them together it's like

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.909 
location and put them together it's like
Lego<00:03:22.780> bricks<00:03:23.139> if<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.349> kind<00:03:23.440> of<00:03:23.560> think<00:03:23.620> about

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
Lego bricks if you kind of think about

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.620 
Lego bricks if you kind of think about
it<00:03:24.069> just<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:24.340> real<00:03:24.639> world<00:03:25.000> Lego<00:03:25.299> bricks

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
it just like real world Lego bricks

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.050 
it just like real world Lego bricks
which<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.930> kind<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.260> cool<00:03:26.470> now<00:03:26.950> back<00:03:27.160> in<00:03:27.310> 2012

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
which is kind of cool now back in 2012

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.640 
which is kind of cool now back in 2012
they<00:03:28.209> actually<00:03:28.540> built<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.840> 30-story<00:03:29.470> building

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
they actually built a 30-story building

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.759 
they actually built a 30-story building
in<00:03:30.069> a<00:03:30.129> mere<00:03:30.310> 15<00:03:31.060> days<00:03:31.450> showing<00:03:32.230> off<00:03:32.379> that<00:03:32.410> this

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
in a mere 15 days showing off that this

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.470 
in a mere 15 days showing off that this
type<00:03:33.099> of<00:03:33.129> building<00:03:33.730> kind<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.060> construction

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
type of building kind of construction

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.020 
type of building kind of construction
way<00:03:34.810> is<00:03:35.139> actually<00:03:35.829> faster<00:03:36.040> than<00:03:36.340> anything

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
way is actually faster than anything

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.369 
way is actually faster than anything
else<00:03:37.239> though<00:03:37.629> being<00:03:37.840> able<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.109> build<00:03:38.290> the

else though being able to build the

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.800 
else though being able to build the
building<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.829> such<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.220> fast<00:03:39.579> rate<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:40.180> awesome

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
building and such a fast rate is awesome

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.259 
building and such a fast rate is awesome
is<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.680> safe<00:03:41.949> like<00:03:42.220> should<00:03:42.609> I<00:03:42.639> go<00:03:42.879> into<00:03:43.150> the

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
is it safe like should I go into the

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.509 
is it safe like should I go into the
building<00:03:43.720> or<00:03:43.900> heck<00:03:44.109> even<00:03:44.290> be<00:03:44.650> around<00:03:44.829> the

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
building or heck even be around the

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.220 
building or heck even be around the
building<00:03:45.879> because<00:03:46.030> if<00:03:46.389> this<00:03:46.870> thing<00:03:47.079> comes

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
building because if this thing comes

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.039 
building because if this thing comes
down<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.889> don't<00:03:48.730> want<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.000> die<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.449> hey<00:03:49.750> I'm<00:03:49.930> not

the only person worried about this

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.589 
the only person worried about this
professionals<00:03:51.730> are<00:03:51.849> actually<00:03:52.120> worried<00:03:52.359> dude

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
professionals are actually worried dude

professionals are actually worried dude
the<00:03:52.840> apparent<00:03:53.260> lack<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.530> an<00:03:53.799> internal

the apparent lack of an internal

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
structure inside of this building it

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.289 
structure inside of this building it
could<00:03:56.500> just<00:03:56.680> collapse<00:03:56.919> in<00:03:57.489> on<00:03:57.669> itself<00:03:57.730> the

could just collapse in on itself the
company<00:03:58.599> behind<00:03:58.720> this<00:03:58.989> is<00:03:59.139> hoping<00:03:59.349> to<00:03:59.410> prove

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
company behind this is hoping to prove

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.199 
company behind this is hoping to prove
that<00:03:59.650> prefabricated<00:04:00.519> buildings<00:04:00.879> are<00:04:01.000> less

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
that prefabricated buildings are less

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.449 
that prefabricated buildings are less
wasteful<00:04:01.720> than<00:04:01.780> like<00:04:02.139> they're<00:04:02.379> bigger<00:04:02.680> normal

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
wasteful than like they're bigger normal

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.729 
wasteful than like they're bigger normal
counterparts<00:04:04.269> because<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.870> regular<00:04:05.379> building

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
counterparts because a regular building

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.860 
counterparts because a regular building
construction<00:04:06.190> will<00:04:06.310> produce<00:04:06.459> over<00:04:06.790> 5<00:04:07.180> million

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
construction will produce over 5 million

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.319 
construction will produce over 5 million
pounds<00:04:08.410> of<00:04:08.530> waste<00:04:08.739> where<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.430> prefabricated

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
pounds of waste where a prefabricated

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.569 
pounds of waste where a prefabricated
building<00:04:10.780> will<00:04:10.900> only<00:04:11.079> produce<00:04:11.319> around<00:04:11.650> 50,000

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
building will only produce around 50,000

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.189 
building will only produce around 50,000
so<00:04:12.730> yes<00:04:12.940> it's<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.180> considerable<00:04:13.599> cost<00:04:13.840> with<00:04:14.109> the

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
so yes it's a considerable cost with the

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.539 
so yes it's a considerable cost with the
amount<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.440> waste<00:04:14.680> that's<00:04:14.829> produced<00:04:15.250> though

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
amount of waste that's produced though

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.490 
amount of waste that's produced though
I'm<00:04:15.760> still<00:04:16.090> not<00:04:16.329> sure<00:04:16.389> if<00:04:16.780> it's<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.079> good<00:04:17.289> thing

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
I'm still not sure if it's a good thing

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.870 
I'm still not sure if it's a good thing
the<00:04:17.680> hope<00:04:17.829> is<00:04:17.949> to<00:04:18.070> begin<00:04:18.310> construction<00:04:18.430> on

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
the hope is to begin construction on

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.580 
the hope is to begin construction on
this<00:04:19.000> building<00:04:19.299> in<00:04:19.419> September<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.410> course

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
this building in September and of course

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.140 
this building in September and of course
if<00:04:20.709> all<00:04:20.829> goes<00:04:20.859> well<00:04:21.099> it<00:04:21.489> will<00:04:21.519> overtake<00:04:21.969> the

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
if all goes well it will overtake the
