00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
very commonly so several reasons why we

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.000 
very commonly so several reasons why we
might<00:02:23.970> want<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.210> think<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
might want to think this is this is the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.730 
might want to think this is this is the
real<00:02:26.250> deal<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:27.870> course<00:02:27.930> we<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.650> keep

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
real deal and of course we want to keep

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.010 
real deal and of course we want to keep
in<00:02:28.890> mind<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.670> only<00:02:29.820> for<00:02:30.090> xbox<00:02:30.540> 360

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
in mind that this is only for xbox 360

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.140 
in mind that this is only for xbox 360
but<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.890> kind<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.340> leads<00:02:32.520> us<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.850> believe<00:02:32.880> that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
but it kind of leads us to believe that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.510 
but it kind of leads us to believe that
it<00:02:33.420> will<00:02:33.480> also<00:02:33.540> include<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.740> pc<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.280> ps3
