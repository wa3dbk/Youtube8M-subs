00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.250
 hi friends, I continue to support 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.349
 tricky Chinese manufacturer for 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.880
 something in turn puts me to sleep 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:15.550
 a bunch of goods we all know the quality well 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.270
 I hope what about the quality I bent 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.840
 carries what came here so it should 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.119
 be 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:28.300
 they were in the mail was destroyed let's 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.550
 weigh parcel eighty-two 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:37.649
 gram 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:43.269
 corresponds to the promised track in the description 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.100
 track code and here is the long awaited without 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.019
 what am i 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:55.299
 the last time is very uncomfortable 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:01:00.129
 exist on the roads here 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:03.399
 here are some miniatures some kind of mirror mirror 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.969
 bicycle attachment note 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.630
 show in 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:16.929
 in how to say inside the wheel but note 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.859
 attention let's open immediately about 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:23.950
 advantages and advantages of this mirror 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:25.600
 the main advantage is of course yes you 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.149
 longing that she does not want to pull out 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.789
 their main advantage is sitting like a glove 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:35.969
 here are the main advantages of it 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.969
 microscopic dimensions 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.609
 the thing is that on my steering wheel is not 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.030
 just a little space too little 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:50.079
 places if I find a photo hang 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.929
 just sure there is nowhere 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.569
 mount bicycle mirrors 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.030
 they are very necessary especially when moving in 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.869
 the city as they say at least 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.409
 small 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.719
 just to identify the object going 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.539
 behind you go call you a mirror 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.250
 Of course you need my condition was to 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.379
 the mirror was very small 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.739
 so that all this space does not take much 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.360
 And because storage space 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.890
 I have a bike, too, very, very 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.450
 a bit of my terms urban well and here 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.680
 I found a mirror like this 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.290
 plastic material to feel plastic like 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.260
 it will be mounted will be mounted yes I think 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.930
 obviously elementary complete 6 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:44.439
 borders the gadget . 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:49.780
 and a cog like this board is inserted 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:50.970
 and tightened hex fell 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.900
 nut 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.870
 then hexa hammer part on 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.140
 all phrases are completely here 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.560
 the mirror is mounted like this inside the steering wheel 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.519
 It should be very comfortable and very, very 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.610
 do not take the place further so that you can 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:17.950
 say here they ate and the film which i 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.720
 I want to immediately take off while I shoot need 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.140
 will tell what came to me this 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.140
 mirror 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.360
 no i can't take it off mind just not 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:33.180
 grabs how they all securely 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:38.500
 Packed up on the Chinese don't even seem 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:42.579
 so picked up so the cost of $ 6 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.860
 22 cents did not come and I need exactly for 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.040
 30 days 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.400
 the long-awaited can say device 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.400
 that's how it works 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:03.470
 material the material of this mirror is not 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.670
 it is not glass it seems like three or 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.140
 this glass will pop out 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:12.290
 it's either metal or plastics 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.230
 with mirror coating like it at all 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.090
 working what it is i don't know i 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.000
 I'll see it again in the description 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.710
 exact group for sure it did not subside hundred 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.020
 percent it doesn't seem like 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.070
 metal even it doesn't look like metal can 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.340
 strong plastic sleep behavior 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.830
 interesting then about the reliability of this 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.260
 the mirror how it will work for a long time 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.360
 is asked 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.440
 no whether pancetta sprays well 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.320
 the dimensions of the mirror itself let's measure 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.190
 it's four and a half centimeters at 6 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.979
 centimeters 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.320
 a very small mirror 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.510
 really only to determine 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.510
 determine the object going backwater so what 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:03.380
 I can still say the mirror itself 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.669
 surfaces are convex respectively 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:11.389
 very comfortable she will put it let's say 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:14.710
 more objects to display i.e. 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:17.750
 there is a possibility of a larger display 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.250
 which in principle is not bad for such here 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.919
 almost nothing uchiha razemchik of 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.289
 accordingly, the mirror revolves around 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.800
 its axis 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.559
 deflected mount all the same 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.629
 hexagons i.e. it will be easy when 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:38.629
 want the same key which 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.789
 I'll have to put my bike 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:46.249
 set it will be easy to pull it all up 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:49.969
 Here is such a product 30 days exactly 622 goods 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:50.979
 long-awaited so it will be necessary today 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.469
 same him 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.960
 screw well and quietly try 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.759
 well, so far that's all if 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.830
 something extra to say on this 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.360
 product 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.999
 I will definitely say the material from which 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.860
 a mirror will need to be looked at 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:10.399
 the description is not too lazy really 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:14.349
 I wonder what is well, well, toadstool 

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:14.349
 and thank you all for all the attention
