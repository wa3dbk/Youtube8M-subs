going to use this aqua and this pretty
pink<00:01:53.580> so<00:01:54.300> we<00:01:54.330> have<00:01:54.479> our<00:01:54.600> two<00:01:54.720> colors<00:01:54.979> we're

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
pink so we have our two colors we're

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.340 
pink so we have our two colors we're
going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.190> stack<00:01:56.400> them<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:57.860> flatten<00:01:58.860> them<00:01:59.010> out

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
going to stack them up flatten them out

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.070 
going to stack them up flatten them out
so<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.680> fold<00:02:01.979> them<00:02:02.220> in<00:02:02.550> half<00:02:03.080> once

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
so that we can fold them in half once

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.330 
so that we can fold them in half once
you<00:02:04.170> fold<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.440> in<00:02:04.500> half<00:02:04.530> go<00:02:05.490> ahead<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.970> cut<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
you fold it in half go ahead and cut a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.980 
you fold it in half go ahead and cut a
one-inch<00:02:08.929> notch<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.380> each<00:02:11.220> fold<00:02:11.580> now<00:02:12.570> fold<00:02:12.840> in

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
one-inch notch and each fold now fold in

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.160 
one-inch notch and each fold now fold in
half<00:02:13.140> again<00:02:13.260> cut<00:02:13.680> another<00:02:14.580> slit<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.900> fold

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
half again cut another slit in this fold

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.310 
half again cut another slit in this fold
and<00:02:16.410> then<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.340> middle<00:02:18.110> these<00:02:19.110> are

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
and then one in the middle these are

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.020 
and then one in the middle these are
going<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.470> make<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.739> petals<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.280> our<00:02:20.820> flower

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
these corners to make a rough petal

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.530 
these corners to make a rough petal
shape<00:02:28.410> don't<00:02:29.220> worry<00:02:29.400> about<00:02:29.610> getting<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.270> too
