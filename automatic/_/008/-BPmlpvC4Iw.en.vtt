00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.910
 currently presented on 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.760
 world car market models have three 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.550
 rear drive front and 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.010
 full they differ in what axis 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.320
 is leading front wheel drive cars 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.360
 these are cars in which the front wheels 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.390
 are both leading and 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.609
 torque control generated by 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.449
 car engine is transmitted to 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.100
 front axle 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.269
 first front wheel drive car 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.190
 appeared in 1929 and in the present 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.079
 moment similar construction is 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.280
 most common to 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.710
 benefits of front-wheel drive 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.880
 Reliability is relative to 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.130
 rear and full 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.350
 engine efficiency 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.510
 in front-wheel drive car above 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.660
 due to low energy loss when 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.800
 transmission from the engine to the wheels 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.020
 front wheel drive cars are different 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.000
 better handling and good 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.980
 steering sensitivity 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.110
 no drive shaft in 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.659
 front wheel drive cars allows 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.549
 create a more spacious interior to the cons 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.560
 front-wheel drive include more 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.789
 complex and costly 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.670
 repair construction 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.100
 perceptible vibration from the power unit and 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.770
 possible axle boxes to the front wheels when 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.289
 sharp acceleration of the car in cars 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.889
 rear wheel drive are rear 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.869
 wheels 

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:24.700
 which are driven in 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.429
 the result of cardan transmission 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.869
 This design provides 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.539
 rear axle load 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.179
 thanks to which the car 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.409
 characterized by better maneuverability 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.169
 the exception is slippery 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.719
 snowy road where preferred 

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:43.119
 front wheel drive car and cars 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.499
 rear wheel drive easier to manage case 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.079
 skidding 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:49.719
 and the drive design itself is 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.630
 more reliable and easier to repair 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.719
 and maintenance significantly minus 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.229
 rear wheel drive cars is 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.299
 tunnel need 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.819
 which reduces the space in the cabin 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.579
 cars in all-wheel drive cars 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.770
 leading are all-wheel drive full 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.719
 the drive can be plugged in 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.310
 normal operating mode lead 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.430
 showing up 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.290
 only one axis if necessary 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.160
 all wheel permanent 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.560
 four-wheel drive 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.140
 uses all wheels as leading 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.840
 in all modes of operation 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.849
 there is also a cross between 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.130
 permanent and plug drive this 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.630
 four -wheel drive on the requirements of this 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.580
 switching types 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.599
 all-wheel drive mode occurs 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.730
 automatically 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.920
 to the advantages of all-wheel drive cars 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.720
 applies increased permeability and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.290
 good stability on slippery roads 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.450
 and by cons high fuel consumption and 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.700
 complicated car design 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.610
 rear wheel drive and all-wheel drive are more 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.350
 fast that's why these types of drive 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.350
 set on sports cars
