00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:18.660
 Juan EscÃ¡rcega This is the good today 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.840
 is going to be the use of the contact pedal 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.580
 is the pedal that joins the shoe 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.170
 that is made one piece by means of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.230
 a plate that carries the shoe 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.090
 screwed is good in this case are 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 shoes that we would comment slipper 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.180
 they have a screwed plate that is 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.920
 well these are your hand this can be 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.250
 in some other type of steel materials 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.370
 the pedals are just as shimano they are 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.910
 those that I use the one sponsored by your hand 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.300
 is the top of the range are the pedals 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.430
 in my case the most efficient and one of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.590
 the lightest in the market this good 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.690
 It works with springs can be 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.500
 Tighten according to the comfort of each 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.010
 one to the security that one gets 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.950
 feel 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:13.360
 have to adjust I say the two 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.630
 screws and good a form of the form 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.100
 to use is just step on if it 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.100
 and one piece is made 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.799
 to get them out this one just has to 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.420
 turn your foot a little and leave alone 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.340
 when one falls by inertia 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.490
 opens feet and that makes 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.250
 automatically this one is free of 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.100
 the pedals in case you have any doubt 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.250
 will give security and more efficiency of the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.430
 good pedaling is a pleasure to share 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.979
 this and this I hope they put it in 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.750
 practice and believe me it is something very 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.100
 different from pedaling without pedals 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.100
 contact greetings
