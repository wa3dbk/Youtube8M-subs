allows us to procedurally add guys to
that<00:01:02.649> pile<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:03.160> instead<00:01:03.340> of<00:01:03.399> just<00:01:03.550> having

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
that pile so instead of just having

three guys you can have up to nine it's

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.680 
three guys you can have up to nine it's
not<00:01:05.740> just<00:01:05.800> nine<00:01:06.310> players<00:01:06.759> with<00:01:07.030> an<00:01:07.240> offensive

really knock it over so it's an ad it's

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.500 
really knock it over so it's an ad it's
an<00:01:19.990> addition<00:01:20.410> to<00:01:20.560> our<00:01:20.590> animation<00:01:21.069> tech<00:01:21.220> now

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
an addition to our animation tech now

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.000 
an addition to our animation tech now
that<00:01:21.720> really<00:01:21.930> allows<00:01:22.230> to<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.620> things<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.920> are

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
that really allows to do things that are

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.070 
that really allows to do things that are
a<00:01:23.070> lot<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.250> realistic<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.000> DC<00:01:24.210> before<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
a lot more realistic in DC before the
