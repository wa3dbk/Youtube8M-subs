here<00:00:06.810> I'm<00:00:07.020> going<00:00:07.440> going<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.069> show<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.370> an

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
here I'm going going to show you an

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.100 
here I'm going going to show you an
interesting<00:00:09.240> technique<00:00:09.960> with<00:00:10.380> with<00:00:10.860> using

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
interesting technique with with using

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.880 
interesting technique with with using
complementary<00:00:13.110> colors<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.620> your<00:00:14.009> base<00:00:14.849> layer

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
complementary colors as your base layer

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.080 
complementary colors as your base layer
so<00:00:16.890> here<00:00:17.160> I'm<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.730> knew<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:19.550> was<00:00:20.550> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.880> paint

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
so here I'm I knew I was going to paint

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.880 
so here I'm I knew I was going to paint
a<00:00:22.070> mountain<00:00:23.070> for<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> scene<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.350> which<00:00:25.350> has<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
a mountain for a scene so which has the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220 
a mountain for a scene so which has the
the<00:00:26.340> overall<00:00:26.849> scheme<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.240> yellows<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.990> browns

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the overall scheme of yellows and browns

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.200 
the overall scheme of yellows and browns
so<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.859> started<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:30.859> with<00:00:31.859> desaturated<00:00:32.520> blues

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
so I started with with desaturated blues

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.630 
so I started with with desaturated blues
and<00:00:33.540> purples<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.440> even<00:00:34.950> pushed<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and purples and even pushed the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.590 
and purples and even pushed the
saturated<00:00:36.149> saturation<00:00:36.989> further<00:00:37.440> after<00:00:37.890> that

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
saturated saturation further after that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
saturated saturation further after that
created<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> base<00:00:39.870> layer<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.280> pretty<00:00:41.579> much

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
created a base layer with a pretty much

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.130 
created a base layer with a pretty much
similar<00:00:42.000> composition<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> had<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.500> mind<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
similar composition what I had in mind I

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
similar composition what I had in mind I
know<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.070> sounds<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.640> unusual<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:49.940> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
know it is it sounds bit unusual but the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.450 
know it is it sounds bit unusual but the
reason<00:00:51.300> why<00:00:51.570> I've<00:00:51.809> done<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:55.070> all<00:00:56.070> these

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
reason why I've done this is all these

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.000 
reason why I've done this is all these
all<00:00:56.969> these<00:00:57.239> may<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.960> these<00:00:58.170> colors<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.859> these

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
all these may all these colors all these

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.729 
all these may all these colors all these
complementary<00:00:59.520> colors<00:00:59.850> are<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.960> sort

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
complementary colors are going to sort

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.190 
complementary colors are going to sort
of<00:01:01.829> shine<00:01:02.609> through<00:01:03.949> my<00:01:05.420> quite<00:01:06.420> final<00:01:06.810> painting

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
of shine through my quite final painting

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.719 
of shine through my quite final painting
so<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> next<00:01:10.409> step<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.799> started<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
so as as the next step I started to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.600 
so as as the next step I started to
block<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.420> already<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.900> greens<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.979> browns

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
block in already the greens and browns

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.870 
block in already the greens and browns
and<00:01:15.150> yellows<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.470> scrimmage<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and yellows on from scrimmage but but I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.690 
and yellows on from scrimmage but but I
always<00:01:18.270> sort<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.900> step<00:01:19.229> back<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.590> erase<00:01:20.400> back

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
always sort of step back and erase back

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.560 
always sort of step back and erase back
certain<00:01:21.240> parts<00:01:22.759> what<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.479> the

colors are in the shadows exactly and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780 
colors are in the shadows exactly and
what<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.200> these<00:01:43.470> hidden<00:01:43.710> colors<00:01:44.100> what<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> have

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
what are these hidden colors what I have

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.819 
what are these hidden colors what I have
to<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> lay<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.140> those<00:01:46.649> were

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
to have to lay down and those were

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.539 
to have to lay down and those were
mainly<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:48.619> really<00:01:49.880> purplish<00:01:50.880> bluish

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
mainly like really purplish bluish

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.770 
mainly like really purplish bluish
bluish<00:01:53.549> colors<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.090> that's<00:01:54.240> why<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> chose

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
bluish colors and that's why I chose

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.340 
bluish colors and that's why I chose
those<00:01:54.960> ones<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:57.950> because<00:01:58.950> um<00:01:59.810> I'm<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
those ones and because um I'm going to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.280 
those ones and because um I'm going to
I'm<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.399> paint<00:02:02.689> in<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> whole<00:02:03.930> image

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
I'm going to paint in the whole image

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.459 
I'm going to paint in the whole image
with<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:05.460> pretty<00:02:05.700> much<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.469> complementary

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
with we pretty much the complementary

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.020 
with we pretty much the complementary
colors<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.979> these<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.959> jános<00:02:10.550> creamy<00:02:11.550> shadows

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030

stuff<00:02:14.050> like<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:15.580> that's<00:02:16.000> why<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:17.650> even<00:02:18.040> if<00:02:18.630> if

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
stuff like that that's why if even if if

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.740 
stuff like that that's why if even if if
I<00:02:19.810> only<00:02:20.080> leave<00:02:20.380> like<00:02:21.250> certain<00:02:21.880> dots<00:02:22.209> and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
I only leave like certain dots and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.350 
I only leave like certain dots and
certain<00:02:23.080> parts<00:02:23.260> from<00:02:23.680> these<00:02:24.360> original

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
certain parts from these original

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.570

complementary<00:02:26.230> because<00:02:26.470> they<00:02:26.800> all<00:02:27.010> going<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
complementary because they all going to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.650 
complementary because they all going to
shine<00:02:27.849> through<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.690> image<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:30.330> even<00:02:31.330> if<00:02:31.450> I'm

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
shine through the image and even if I'm

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.309 
shine through the image and even if I'm
using<00:02:32.849> even<00:02:33.849> on<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.090> parts<00:02:34.390> where<00:02:34.569> I'm<00:02:35.110> using

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
using even on the parts where I'm using

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.870 
using even on the parts where I'm using
we<00:02:36.510> less<00:02:37.510> saturated<00:02:37.930> colors<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:39.640> gonna

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
we less saturated colors it's gonna

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.870 
we less saturated colors it's gonna
create<00:02:40.269> some<00:02:40.840> sort<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.349> vibration<00:02:41.880> between

create some sort of a vibration between

create some sort of a vibration between

the between the pixels this whole

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.830 
the between the pixels this whole
technique<00:02:45.910> comes<00:02:46.299> comes<00:02:46.840> from<00:02:47.430> from<00:02:48.840> my

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
technique comes comes from from my

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.930 
technique comes comes from from my
traditional<00:02:50.470> painting<00:02:50.920> background<00:02:51.420> because

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
traditional painting background because

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.740 
traditional painting background because
usually<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.569> what<00:02:56.290> when<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.040> this<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.340> this<00:02:57.549> is

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
usually you what when so this is this is

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.780 
usually you what when so this is this is
sort<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.870> technique<00:02:59.260> when<00:02:59.709> you<00:02:59.739> create<00:03:00.519> a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
sort of a technique when you create a

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.190 
sort of a technique when you create a
base<00:03:01.090> coat<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:02.530> your<00:03:02.680> canvas<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.459> or<00:03:04.390> on<00:03:05.049> your

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
base coat on your canvas on or on your

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.110 
base coat on your canvas on or on your
paper<00:03:05.500> before<00:03:05.920> before<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.519> start<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.910> paint

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
paper before before you start to paint

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.449 
paper before before you start to paint
with<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.930> colors<00:03:08.049> of<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:09.160> your<00:03:09.489> shadows<00:03:09.910> or

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
with the colors of of your shadows or

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.030 
with the colors of of your shadows or
with<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.549> powers<00:03:12.849> of<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:14.380> complementary

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
with the powers of the complementary

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.680 
with the powers of the complementary
colors<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.670> your<00:03:15.880> overall<00:03:16.330> color<00:03:16.959> scheme<00:03:18.690> so

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
colors of your overall color scheme so

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.069 
colors of your overall color scheme so
yeah<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.670> basically<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.910> just<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.329> just<00:03:22.570> went

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
yeah and basically I just I just went

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.590 
yeah and basically I just I just went
down<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:24.510> I'm<00:03:25.510> really<00:03:26.290> trying<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:26.799> establish

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
down so I'm really trying to establish

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.170 
down so I'm really trying to establish
the<00:03:28.600> lightening<00:03:29.019> first<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.920> from<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:30.910> point

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
the lightening first and from this point

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.210 
the lightening first and from this point
it's<00:03:31.420> pretty<00:03:31.660> much<00:03:31.810> like<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:32.170> straight<00:03:33.040> on

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
it's pretty much like a straight on

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.400 
it's pretty much like a straight on
painting<00:03:33.970> process<00:03:34.180> process<00:03:35.019> what<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.230> usually

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
painting process process what I usually

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.680 
painting process process what I usually
do

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
do

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.250 
do
I<00:03:38.430> didn't<00:03:39.430> use<00:03:39.640> any<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.540> textures<00:03:40.989> or

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
I didn't use any and the textures or

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.420 
I didn't use any and the textures or
anything<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:41.889> time

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
anything this time

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.580 
anything this time
I<00:03:42.459> just<00:03:42.850> really<00:03:43.359> tried<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.780> focus<00:03:44.079> on<00:03:44.380> the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
I just really tried to focus on the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.930 
I just really tried to focus on the
overall<00:03:44.859> mood<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:47.340> wanted<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.400> create<00:03:48.730> like

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
overall mood and I wanted to create like

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.940 
overall mood and I wanted to create like
a<00:03:48.970> really<00:03:49.510> strong<00:03:51.870> pretty<00:03:52.870> strong<00:03:53.170> whitening

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
a really strong pretty strong whitening

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:02.729 
a really strong pretty strong whitening
and<00:03:54.720> really<00:03:55.720> moody<00:03:55.900> moody<00:03:56.609> piece<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.590> word

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
and really moody moody piece so the word

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.599 
and really moody moody piece so the word
was<00:04:03.459> in<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.670> focus<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.600> I<00:04:05.130> there<00:04:06.130> wasn't<00:04:06.430> any

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
was in the focus so I there wasn't any

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.559 
was in the focus so I there wasn't any
real<00:04:07.060> tricks

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
real tricks

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.229 
real tricks
the<00:04:08.410> only<00:04:08.739> tricks<00:04:09.069> what<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.340> what<00:04:09.639> I<00:04:09.670> started<00:04:10.090> to

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
the only tricks what I what I started to

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.150 
the only tricks what I what I started to
add<00:04:10.389> is<00:04:10.600> just<00:04:10.989> happening<00:04:11.200> at<00:04:11.560> miss<00:04:11.889> Perriman

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
add is just happening at miss Perriman

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.190 
add is just happening at miss Perriman
on<00:04:12.430> because<00:04:13.889> in<00:04:14.889> this<00:04:15.040> point<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.489> just<00:04:15.519> use<00:04:16.200> pure

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
on because in this point I just use pure

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.830 
on because in this point I just use pure
painting<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:19.000> at<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:19.419> point<00:04:19.600> I

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
painting and this at this point I

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.370 
painting and this at this point I
started<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:21.000> overlay<00:04:22.000> layers<00:04:22.210> just<00:04:22.630> to

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
started to overlay layers just to

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.120 
started to overlay layers just to
strengthen<00:04:23.770> certain<00:04:24.640> colors<00:04:24.970> and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
strengthen certain colors and

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.160 
strengthen certain colors and
every<00:04:26.460> gradient<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:30.120> bottom<00:04:30.330> part<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.810> to

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
every gradient to the bottom part and to

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.610 
every gradient to the bottom part and to
the<00:04:31.260> dock<00:04:31.500> pipe<00:04:31.740> as<00:04:32.490> well<00:04:32.750> an<00:04:33.750> ingredients<00:04:34.440> to

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
the dock pipe as well an ingredients to

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.580 
the dock pipe as well an ingredients to
to<00:04:34.890> your<00:04:35.010> images<00:04:35.840> could<00:04:36.840> be<00:04:36.900> always<00:04:37.140> helpful

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
to your images could be always helpful

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.780 
to your images could be always helpful
to<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.430> create<00:04:38.790> sort<00:04:39.090> of<00:04:39.180> like<00:04:39.630> an<00:04:39.810> extra<00:04:40.200> space

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
to to create sort of like an extra space

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.970 
to to create sort of like an extra space
it's<00:04:41.790> it's<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.270> real<00:04:42.390> trick<00:04:42.690> especially<00:04:42.980> useful

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
it's it's a real trick especially useful

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.970 
it's it's a real trick especially useful
at<00:04:44.280> painting<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:45.000> death<00:04:45.390> gradients<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.050> to

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
at painting to death gradients to to

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.280 
at painting to death gradients to to
your<00:04:47.130> images<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:47.850> to<00:04:48.180> certain<00:04:48.990> shapes

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
your images and to certain shapes

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.480 
your images and to certain shapes
because<00:04:49.980> our<00:04:50.670> gradients<00:04:51.240> instantly<00:04:51.930> creates

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
because our gradients instantly creates

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.810 
because our gradients instantly creates
space

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
space

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:05.090 
space
I<00:04:58.580> also<00:04:59.580> added<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.120> figure<00:05:00.390> here<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:04.100> I'm

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
I also added the figure here and I'm

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.430 
I also added the figure here and I'm
just<00:05:05.340> I'm<00:05:05.640> just<00:05:05.820> adding<00:05:06.120> details<00:05:07.010> and<00:05:09.440> it's

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
just I'm just adding details and it's

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.360 
just I'm just adding details and it's
really<00:05:11.690> it<00:05:12.690> can<00:05:12.960> really<00:05:13.650> save<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.130> ton<00:05:14.310> of

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
really it can really save you a ton of

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.200 
really it can really save you a ton of
time<00:05:14.520> if<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.360> if<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:16.310> create<00:05:17.310> if<00:05:17.760> you<00:05:17.970> have

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
time if you if you create if you have

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.100 
time if you if you create if you have
all<00:05:18.330> your<00:05:18.630> details<00:05:18.840> consciously<00:05:19.790> because<00:05:21.110> you

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
all your details consciously because you

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.320 
all your details consciously because you
basically<00:05:22.710> have<00:05:22.950> to<00:05:23.070> choose<00:05:23.340> where<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.210> want

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
basically have to choose where you want

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
basically have to choose where you want
to<00:05:24.450> put<00:05:24.540> your<00:05:24.750> details<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:25.380> can<00:05:25.530> choose<00:05:27.350> your

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
to put your details you can choose your

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.010 
to put your details you can choose your
wide<00:05:29.070> side<00:05:29.670> or<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.180> can<00:05:30.360> choose<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.780> dark

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
wide side or you can choose the dark

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.600 
wide side or you can choose the dark
side<00:05:31.380> hit'em<00:05:32.310> basically<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.920> I<00:05:34.920> chose<00:05:35.460> the

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
side hit'em basically and I chose the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.720 
side hit'em basically and I chose the
light<00:05:35.790> side<00:05:36.030> here<00:05:36.270> so<00:05:36.630> I<00:05:36.960> can<00:05:37.350> I<00:05:37.530> get<00:05:37.740> this<00:05:38.520> way

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
light side here so I can I get this way

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.560 
light side here so I can I get this way
I<00:05:38.760> can<00:05:39.060> only<00:05:39.180> focus<00:05:39.540> most<00:05:40.080> of<00:05:40.260> my<00:05:40.380> detailing

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
I can only focus most of my detailing

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.920 
I can only focus most of my detailing
onto<00:05:42.570> my<00:05:42.810> lights<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.440> I<00:05:44.010> can<00:05:44.400> keep<00:05:44.610> my<00:05:44.940> shadows

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
onto my lights and I can keep my shadows

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.870 
onto my lights and I can keep my shadows
really<00:05:46.530> loose<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:47.100> really<00:05:47.610> plaintively<00:05:49.880> and

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
really loose and really plaintively and

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.050 
really loose and really plaintively and
really<00:05:51.390> bad<00:05:51.570> sheet<00:05:51.870> because<00:05:52.050> it<00:05:52.790> won't<00:05:53.790> really

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
really bad sheet because it won't really

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.320 
really bad sheet because it won't really
matter<00:05:54.240> because<00:05:54.570> I'm<00:05:55.380> going<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.650> focus

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
matter because I'm going to focus

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.990 
matter because I'm going to focus
support<00:05:57.330> on<00:05:57.420> like<00:05:57.570> my<00:05:57.750> I<00:05:57.920> can<00:05:58.920> can<00:05:59.490> focus<00:05:59.760> on

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
support on like my I can can focus on

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.930 
support on like my I can can focus on
the<00:06:00.090> lights<00:06:00.300> first<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:01.230> details<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:02.040> all

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
the lights first the details and all

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.560 
the lights first the details and all
these<00:06:03.240> small<00:06:03.570> leaves<00:06:03.810> in<00:06:04.200> the<00:06:04.830> lights<00:06:05.010> and<00:06:05.570> and

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
these small leaves in the lights and and

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.000 
these small leaves in the lights and and
I<00:06:06.660> can<00:06:06.870> believe<00:06:06.990> there<00:06:07.350> are<00:06:07.470> the<00:06:07.770> same<00:06:07.950> amount

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
I can believe there are the same amount

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.300 
I can believe there are the same amount
of<00:06:08.340> leaves<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.540> details<00:06:10.020> are<00:06:10.290> in<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:10.950> shadows

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
of leaves and details are in the shadows

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.710 
of leaves and details are in the shadows
I<00:06:11.490> just<00:06:11.730> I<00:06:11.910> just<00:06:12.000> can't<00:06:12.360> really<00:06:12.450> see<00:06:12.660> them

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
I just I just can't really see them

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.170 
I just I just can't really see them
because<00:06:13.170> they<00:06:13.380> don't<00:06:14.160> get<00:06:14.490> that<00:06:14.760> much<00:06:14.910> light

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
because they don't get that much light

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.040 
because they don't get that much light
so<00:06:16.670> this<00:06:17.670> is<00:06:17.760> pretty<00:06:17.940> much<00:06:18.030> the<00:06:18.210> finishing

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
so this is pretty much the finishing

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.610 
so this is pretty much the finishing
already<00:06:19.770> so<00:06:21.170> just<00:06:22.170> any<00:06:22.500> bits<00:06:22.800> and<00:06:22.980> pieces<00:06:24.620> here

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
already so just any bits and pieces here

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.030 
already so just any bits and pieces here
and<00:06:25.740> there<00:06:28.370> some<00:06:29.370> extra<00:06:29.730> leaves<00:06:30.890> and<00:06:31.890> some

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
and there some extra leaves and some

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.560 
and there some extra leaves and some
extra<00:06:32.340> highlights<00:06:32.760> in<00:06:33.000> the<00:06:33.060> focal<00:06:33.390> point

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
extra highlights in the focal point

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.339 
extra highlights in the focal point
where<00:06:33.840> the<00:06:33.930> figure<00:06:34.229> walks<00:06:35.750> tightening<00:06:36.750> up

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349 
where the figure walks tightening up

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:51.149 
where the figure walks tightening up
the<00:06:38.619> serial<00:06:39.039> of<00:06:39.309> the<00:06:39.460> figure<00:06:43.710> and<00:06:46.020> I<00:06:50.099> think<00:06:51.099> the

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.159 
the serial of the figure and I think the

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.189 
the serial of the figure and I think the
people<00:06:51.249> details<00:06:51.789> the<00:06:52.389> big<00:06:52.539> monster<00:06:52.960> chief

00:06:59.639 --> 00:06:59.649 
comes there and as a final step creating

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:03.420 
comes there and as a final step creating
some<00:06:59.949> really<00:07:00.189> foreground<00:07:00.939> elements<00:07:02.430> just

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
some really foreground elements just
