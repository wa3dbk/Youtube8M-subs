00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
kind of winch so you can just line it

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.190 
kind of winch so you can just line it
back<00:06:17.820> up<00:06:17.900> and<00:06:19.640> lastly<00:06:20.640> I<00:06:20.850> do<00:06:21.570> like<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:22.050> fact

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
back up and lastly I do like the fact

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.680 
back up and lastly I do like the fact
that<00:06:22.410> there<00:06:22.680> are<00:06:22.830> pegs<00:06:23.250> throughout<00:06:23.880> Outlaw<00:06:24.419> up

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
that there are pegs throughout Outlaw up

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.400 
that there are pegs throughout Outlaw up
top<00:06:25.050> down<00:06:25.470> here<00:06:25.830> where<00:06:26.180> your<00:06:27.180> mask<00:06:27.410> figures

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
top down here where your mask figures

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.390 
top down here where your mask figures
have<00:06:28.620> holes<00:06:28.800> on<00:06:28.919> the<00:06:28.979> bottom<00:06:29.070> of<00:06:29.220> their<00:06:29.370> feet
