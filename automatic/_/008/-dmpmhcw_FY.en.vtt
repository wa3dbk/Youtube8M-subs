00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.540
 and that's great because today I have 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.580
 a news to announce 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.080
 I went to 400 subscribers and that's 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.280
 thanks to you and I wanted you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.530

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.619
 that they will continue to please you 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.390
 anyway I will do everything for that and in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.529
 the meaning there precisely speaking of that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.140
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.150
 new video a style of videos that 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.470
 I've never done in gta 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.019
 I walked around I discovered a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.490
 unusual atypical character while 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.009
 simply because it is a 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.440
 zombie i was talking to him i'm going to you 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.850
 show the scene right after I you 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.800
 will also show where you can 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.500
 find and I will give you my opinion 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.059
 after on this character why 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.770
 lamy rockstar in the game I leave you 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.070
 watch this video and I tell you to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.070
 see you later 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.650
 we live 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.770
 no 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
 supreme 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.750
 the asbr to the rules brussels 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.810
 ah yeah 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.810
 m 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.280
 and 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:43.070
 all three had brought to mind as 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:55.150
 at coppola and we do not fear before 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:55.150
 that a series marc cherry and nm 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.890
 so now you've seen the 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.530
 video 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.670
 I will give you a little my opinion on 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.440
 this character 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.730
 first of all it is super well done a 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.860
 dirty and no problem on it 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.330
 well, we can see that when we 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.360
 talking about one can see that it's not a 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.130
 true zombie 7 lower down a character who 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.880
 avoid what it is a little bit like 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.330
 Circus freak 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.800
 by cons there is just I do not know if 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.940
 you did it tilter but to a 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.600
 given moment says something 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.790
 interesting 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.980
 he says my name is g and he drops this 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.140
 sentence like that and we know very well 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.970
 with rockstar now that there is 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.360
 nothing without anything if said that is that there is 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.760
 Something 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.570
 so suddenly I was looking for this 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.910
 famous g 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.610
 I actually discovered that there is a 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.209
 article that was put on a site 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.980
 Internet 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.440
 So the site is the Meuse point them 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.989
 a journalistic site actually there 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.660
 had an article that was published then 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.209
 the article was published on May 30, 2013 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.670
 a few months before the release of the 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.530
 first gta 5 is just the title of 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.660
 the article already it is very evocative 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.970
 so I can give you it's cork 2 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.130
 points a Belgian doctor at the bedside of a 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.590
 zombie in the flesh and in fact what 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.209
 that this article he explains to us is 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.370
 that what happened is that there is a 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.110
 English patient so 49 years old who 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.820
 really suffer from a disorder 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.459
 neurological and which of which has been 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.620
 was present at the chu de cork 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.109
 to meet professor stevens 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.400
 laury's so professor stevens 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.970
 the horizon apparently this is the 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.229
 global specialist of the commons 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.820
 trauma and that's why we talk 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.229
 of zombies or two rather of 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.669
 undead in this article this is 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.160
 because this patient when he got 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.830
 presented in front of Professor Ben 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.410
 words that told him I quote doctor I 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.330
 have come to prove to you that I am dead 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.770
 my brain died in a body 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.870
 alive I am a living dead 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.030
 it is with these terms that g 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.580
 49-year-old English as I said was 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.919
 presented to the doctor and so after 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.260
 well they did tests for him and that's 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.789
 after that so what is 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.400
 impressive is that they are seen 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.810
 to the fact that it was an illness so he 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.200
 does it seem that his wife has it 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.530
 quits 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.700
 he wanted to commit suicide as between lebanon 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.160
 like claude franÃ§ois 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.639
 and then behind what happened 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.680
 that he did not die by against 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.900
 from that moment on he health could 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.819
 brain for him his brain besides 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.639
 there is something also in the article the 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.139
 say there is the teacher who says I 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.449
 had never had a consultation 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.099
 impatient but says I feel dead and the 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.050
 teacher even answered him but your 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.849
 heart beats yet and you breathe and 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.580
 he did not perceive it like that 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.680
 exactly explains the professor 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.199
 stephen florise here is an explanation 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.669
 for which I would not say why he 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.560
 there was a zombie why he got 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.180
 present mostly as being a 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.860
 certain g 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.960
 that's what I could find this level 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.490
 there now it can be that like 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.800
 something else but in any case that's it 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.449
 a track by the way I take the opportunity to 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.009
 tell you that atypical characters 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.080
 like him there are others in the 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.300
 map so it will be up to you to find them from 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.590
 discuss with them and me too personally I 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.189
 am eager to know what the 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.259
 others can say at least on what 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.639
 rockstar wants to get our attention there 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.110
 for example it's an article me 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.699
 personally I passed by 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.710
 the information you did not even know it 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.330
 existed so that's why I 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.310
 also wanted to make a video for the 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.360
 to share with you has gone by the way 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.310
 there on the video ends 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.430
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.159
 as for me, I'll see you soon 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.289
 continue to comment videos etc 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.759
 it's really nice to read you 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.300
 and to answer you as soon as I have 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.520
 opportunity 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.330
 that was all for today I 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.899
 tell you see you soon 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.899
 ciao
