00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
thing so I don't have to lean up against

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
thing so I don't have to lean up against
the<00:01:14.010> tree<00:01:14.310> or<00:01:14.460> anything<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.420> that's

the tree or anything like that so that's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.410 
the tree or anything like that so that's
really<00:01:15.630> nice<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.680> brakes<00:01:16.890> they<00:01:17.400> suck<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.820> with

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
really nice the brakes they suck as with

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.580 
really nice the brakes they suck as with
every<00:01:18.720> single<00:01:19.009> machine<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.159> make<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:20.790> suck<00:01:21.060> so

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
every single machine I make they suck so

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.480 
every single machine I make they suck so
slowdowns<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.740> little<00:01:22.920> bit<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.130> an<00:01:23.220> issue

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.690 
slowdowns a little bit of an issue
and<00:01:24.150> stopping<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.869> painted<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.950> yellow<00:01:25.979> I'm

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and stopping I painted it yellow I'm

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
and stopping I painted it yellow I'm
kind<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.970> regretting<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:28.020> looks<00:01:28.229> really

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
kind of regretting it it looks really

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.940

cool<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:28.920> every<00:01:29.820> single<00:01:30.060> little<00:01:30.479> dart<00:01:30.950> spot

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
cool but every single little dart spot

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.640 
cool but every single little dart spot
every<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:32.549> thumbprint<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.650> hands

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
every little thumbprint if your hands

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I'll get a more powerful motor for this

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
I'll get a more powerful motor for this
thing<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> video<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.450> of
