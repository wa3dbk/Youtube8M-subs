00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.839
 seconds below if ever asked 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.989
 noted that a software too 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.460
 Installing evil is dangerous 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.470
 is and still is the guarantee is gone 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.850
 does not stand still no matter we press 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.070
 to settle down 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.210
 here we are in so-called media 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.360
 Mode above , we have once the device type 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.060
 Samsung is the keys binary 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.310
 system status official all well here 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.580
 that we do not do anything is the device 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.050
 to connect a computer 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.300
 We already have the drivers there 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.149
 I installed that in the 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.500
 injured at samsung gravel made 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.110
 Commented all this is of course to 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.690
 download in various poken 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.380
 different ways and close 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.960
 but now just so on device 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.320
 we will start connecting 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.799
 the applications or - a flash tool 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.960
 you can take along your samsung galaxy 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.610
 s 4 or any other device is good 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.200
 surfaces and software flash and of course 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.149
 even in the case the dazzle than that 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.210
 Remove provider branding 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.560
 this we go to ppp's just a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:03.659
 complete package of having you get hold 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.270
 the problem down as well as now 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.509
 here in the case on my desktop 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.880
 software 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.070
 I must confess here is about 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.260
 a german telecom mobile 4 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.260
 because your training is free 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.030
 crc a lot is called the puzzle pieces 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.950
 do not take that 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.959
 here simply for the view 1 with 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.940
 Branding just about how do I flash that 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.800
 whole important now is shaking the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.090
 computer first that takes depending on 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.319
 Calculator 15 to 75 seconds depending on 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.660
 how fast the hard disk is how big 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.160
 she rather is very important is car 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.370
 reboot should be in there 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.650
 everytime at nothing else because you 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.989
 Otherwise, your device is completely honest 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.630
 can do a paperweight here 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:54.610
 is still working hard 04 is 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.260
 perfect the connection for the device if 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.730
 nothing more devices have connected 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.920
 same type can be directly on with 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.840
 bottles I had another one here if 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:09.250
 continues here in 1990 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:11.470
 the computer shakes very diligently and there 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.510
 has been exactly the inspector has 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.830
 checked everything super well now we would 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.140
 start here right away 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.850
 but on my open your rather 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.610
 no telekom four times over it because he 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.370
 I want to go at this point even a 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.489
 cut what would happen next is 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.459
 Your device is now working for five minutes 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.079
 play the company or one and then have 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.400
 her branding away or in this 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.709
 Case played on branding 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.750
 usually the device starts completely 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.510
 normal in a few rare 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.360
 you would have my carey mode and 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.690
 reset the device there 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.850
 just the old data with the data 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.320
 did not tolerate and there you have to 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.799
 just stop there again completely empty 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.780
 Clear 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.220
 it is important to make a backup beforehand 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.989
 make a backup or just 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.820
 I realize I need my data 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.239
 not there you can with relative 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:05.370
 risk-free and increase the download 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.750
 counters speaks the 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.850
 Samsung fender that can 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.800
 error is played on or around the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.270
 warranty or deny 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.920
 warranties or at least 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.190
 try as not blowing through increased 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.780
 and are wonderful on the go 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.790
 the safe side after without branding 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.400
 under circumstances the device times in the 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.170
 warranty should be sent before you 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.170
 have a fuse of original 4
