00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.950 
footwork was also keeping him out of
trouble<00:01:39.860> but<00:01:40.860> nonetheless<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.509> don't<00:01:42.720> see

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
trouble but nonetheless I just don't see

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.710 
trouble but nonetheless I just don't see
the<00:01:43.110> same<00:01:43.290> Pacquiao<00:01:43.829> ok<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.540> being

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the same Pacquiao ok so I see it being

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.260 
the same Pacquiao ok so I see it being
similar<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.259> don't<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:46.649> Pacquiao's<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.270> far

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
similar I don't think Pacquiao's is far

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.639 
similar I don't think Pacquiao's is far
over<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.570> hill<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:48.869> Tyson<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.439> when<00:01:49.590> he

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
over the hill as Tyson was when he

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.090 
over the hill as Tyson was when he
fought<00:01:49.829> lewis<00:01:50.159> no<00:01:50.369> where<00:01:51.360> near<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.439> still

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
fought lewis no where near but I still

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.740 
fought lewis no where near but I still
think<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> similar<00:01:53.909> kind<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.180> situation

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
think it's a similar kind of situation

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.499 
think it's a similar kind of situation
but<00:01:55.200> either<00:01:55.350> way<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> am<00:01:56.369> glad<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.880> Tyson

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
but either way I am glad that Tyson

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.020 
but either way I am glad that Tyson
Lewis<00:01:57.750> happened<00:01:58.170> then<00:01:59.070> didn't<00:01:59.579> happen<00:01:59.820> at<00:01:59.909> all

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
Lewis happened then didn't happen at all

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.389 
Lewis happened then didn't happen at all
because<00:02:00.240> even<00:02:00.719> leading<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> Tyson

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
because even leading up to the Tyson

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.350 
because even leading up to the Tyson
Lewis<00:02:02.610> fight<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.570> was<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:04.729> huge<00:02:05.729> number<00:02:06.329> of

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
Lewis fight there was a huge number of

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.889 
Lewis fight there was a huge number of
Tyson<00:02:06.810> fans<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.259> still<00:02:07.649> for<00:02:07.860> Tyson<00:02:08.220> would<00:02:08.310> win

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
Tyson fans the still for Tyson would win

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.390 
Tyson fans the still for Tyson would win
they<00:02:09.899> weren't<00:02:10.110> saying<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.530> mean<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:11.250> all

Tyson must not Lewis out you don't work

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.440 
Tyson must not Lewis out you don't work
like<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.460> have<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.700> land<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.030> punches

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
like that you have to land the punches

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.480 
like that you have to land the punches
but<00:02:46.570> anyway<00:02:46.840> I'm<00:02:47.040> getting<00:02:48.040> way<00:02:48.160> off<00:02:48.190> topic

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
but anyway I'm getting way off topic

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.190 
but anyway I'm getting way off topic
here<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:50.710> pacquiao<00:02:51.130> Floyd<00:02:51.880> fight<00:02:52.240> could

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
here so the pacquiao Floyd fight could

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.410 
here so the pacquiao Floyd fight could
be<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.410> similar<00:02:53.740> situation<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.520> as<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.210> said<00:02:55.270> I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
be a similar situation and as I said I

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.450 
be a similar situation and as I said I
was<00:02:55.630> happy<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.140> despite<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.950> fact<00:02:57.100> Ison<00:02:57.430> was

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
was happy that despite the fact Ison was

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.860 
was happy that despite the fact Ison was
over<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.790> hill<00:02:57.940> when<00:02:58.060> Lewis<00:02:58.300> wasn't<00:02:58.660> in<00:02:58.720> his

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
over the hill when Lewis wasn't in his

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.750 
over the hill when Lewis wasn't in his
prime<00:02:59.080> evil<00:02:59.410> when<00:02:59.500> he<00:02:59.560> fought<00:02:59.710> Tyson<00:03:00.130> he<00:03:00.580> was<00:03:00.730> a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
prime evil when he fought Tyson he was a

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.970 
prime evil when he fought Tyson he was a
few<00:03:01.030> years<00:03:01.240> past<00:03:01.540> his<00:03:01.720> prime<00:03:01.750> although<00:03:02.710> he<00:03:02.740> was

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
few years past his prime although he was

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.250 
few years past his prime although he was
again<00:03:03.430> much<00:03:03.940> closer<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.330> his<00:03:04.540> primary<00:03:04.870> Tyson

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
again much closer to his primary Tyson

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.340 
again much closer to his primary Tyson
because<00:03:05.410> he<00:03:05.500> hadn't<00:03:05.740> taken<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.160> beatings<00:03:06.550> and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
because he hadn't taken the beatings and

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.960 
because he hadn't taken the beatings and
such<00:03:08.350> like<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.830> Tyson<00:03:09.160> had<00:03:09.250> taken<00:03:09.580> but<00:03:10.270> um

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
such like that Tyson had taken but um

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.940 
such like that Tyson had taken but um
the<00:03:12.970> pacquiao<00:03:13.390> floyd<00:03:14.320> fight<00:03:14.620> will<00:03:14.860> be

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
the pacquiao floyd fight will be

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.550 
the pacquiao floyd fight will be
something<00:03:15.340> similar<00:03:15.730> yeah<00:03:16.630> not<00:03:16.870> as<00:03:16.990> satisfying

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
something similar yeah not as satisfying

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.320 
something similar yeah not as satisfying
as<00:03:17.740> seeing<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.400> two<00:03:18.610> guys<00:03:18.820> square<00:03:19.180> off<00:03:19.300> in

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
as seeing the two guys square off in

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.020 
as seeing the two guys square off in
their<00:03:19.600> primes<00:03:19.870> but<00:03:20.280> bit<00:03:21.280> better<00:03:21.700> late<00:03:21.910> than

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
their primes but bit better late than

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.820 
their primes but bit better late than
never<00:03:22.300> basically<00:03:22.959> that's<00:03:23.260> that's<00:03:23.590> what<00:03:23.740> I'm
