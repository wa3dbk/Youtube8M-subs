 hi this is the minute discovered 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.020
 today I propose to discover 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.660
 another product that comes from Japan so 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.130
 this is a drink so pokemon then 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.689
 this one is the first version you 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.250
 discover in another video of the 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.880
 second version so this one is the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.190
 orange version so a big blunder has 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.110
 is 300 g so in the beginning we did not know 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.900
 not so dirty is a drink a compote 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.100
 a fruit juice or jelly on 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.260
 did not know at all so it was a 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.910
 a little bit of a surprise 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.010
 so here is in any case a very pretty 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.640
 gourd so of course with pokemon and 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.290
 all his friends so 300 drama 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.970
 then there are still many thing 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.920
 writing in Japanese practically nothing 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.320
 of writing in English so it's not 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.180
 obvious so by deduction selick 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.710
 it was apple juice anyway at 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.839
 bust and album level 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.180
 if not at the level of the color so she 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.220
 is clear enough it's a very yellow 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.049
 clear and it's a drink that very 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.049
 refreshing and child-friendly 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.280
 because it is opulent key then we 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.780
 was really expecting something from 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.150
 very very chemical is actually not the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.340
 it's all a delicious apple juice or 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.630
 frankly delicious saiki you 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.050

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.320
 la France 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.360

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.100
