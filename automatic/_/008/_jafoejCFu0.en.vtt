00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.459 
by page and I believe there's over a
hundred<00:00:41.010> pages<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:43.110> just

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
hundred pages in this one you can just

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.060 
hundred pages in this one you can just
simply<00:00:44.010> turn<00:00:44.280> page<00:00:45.210> by<00:00:45.480> page<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> look

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
simply turn page by page and have a look

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.940 
simply turn page by page and have a look
and<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> articles<00:00:48.719> are<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.800> can

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and see what the articles are or you can

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.560 
and see what the articles are or you can
use<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> search<00:00:50.460> function<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:51.300> there's

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
use a search function if there's

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.639 
use a search function if there's
something<00:00:51.780> there<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.320> wanted<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
something there that you wanted to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.889 
something there that you wanted to
search<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.430> let's<00:00:53.640> say<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.149> wanted<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
search for so let's say you wanted to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.459 
search for so let's say you wanted to
find<00:00:55.140> something<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.920> shooting<00:00:57.050> you'd<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
find something on shooting you'd do that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.889 
find something on shooting you'd do that
type<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.609> there<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> would<00:01:00.480> simply

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
type in there and then it would simply

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.590 
type in there and then it would simply
lists<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> pages<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.149> shooting

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
lists all the pages that have shooting

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.010 
lists all the pages that have shooting
in<00:01:03.780> there<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.159> instance<00:01:05.250> page<00:01:05.700> 111<00:01:06.299> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
in there so for instance page 111 and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.429 
in there so for instance page 111 and
it'll<00:01:07.260> take<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> right<00:01:07.590> there<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it'll take you right there so that's the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.649 
it'll take you right there so that's the
search<00:01:10.680> function<00:01:10.979> which<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
search function which we really like and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.600 
search function which we really like and
then<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.170> other<00:01:13.350> thing<00:01:13.439> which<00:01:14.369> I've
