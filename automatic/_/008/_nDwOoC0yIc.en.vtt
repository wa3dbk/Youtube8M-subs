00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
seemed like rhoda movie the best to go

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.870 
seemed like rhoda movie the best to go
with<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> safe<00:01:53.040> option<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.759> that's

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
with just as a safe option so that's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.429 
with just as a safe option so that's
when<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.869> let's<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.140> into<00:01:55.259> this

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
when we not to do so let's get into this

when we not to do so let's get into this
so<00:01:56.159> i<00:01:56.219> guess<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.490> dude<00:01:56.670> laid<00:01:56.820> off<00:01:56.939> throat<00:01:57.240> him

so i guess that dude laid off throat him

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
so i guess that dude laid off throat him
he's<00:01:57.840> gonna<00:01:57.990> lead<00:01:58.170> off<00:01:58.290> with<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> talonflame

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
he's gonna lead off with the talonflame

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.709 
he's gonna lead off with the talonflame
and<00:01:59.280> I'm<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.460> okay<00:01:59.880> there's<00:02:00.119> no<00:02:00.270> easy<00:02:00.509> he's

even if I controls gonna spin I do have

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.390 
even if I controls gonna spin I do have
ways<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.810> block<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.439> then<00:02:31.980> just<00:02:32.129> take<00:02:32.280> him

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
ways to block it and then just take him

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.160 
ways to block it and then just take him
out<00:02:32.459> if<00:02:32.670> he<00:02:32.700> really<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.540> aggressive<00:02:33.930> for<00:02:34.049> this

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
out if he really is aggressive for this

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.140 
out if he really is aggressive for this
spinning<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:34.709> he<00:02:35.250> actually<00:02:35.370> goes<00:02:35.609> your<00:02:35.819> curse

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
spinning but he actually goes your curse

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.899 
spinning but he actually goes your curse
right<00:02:36.420> there<00:02:36.599> which<00:02:36.719> is<00:02:36.840> really<00:02:37.260> weird<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:38.700> I

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
right there which is really weird like I

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.089 
right there which is really weird like I
did<00:02:39.060> not<00:02:39.209> expect<00:02:39.329> curse<00:02:39.719> to<00:02:39.900> happen<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:40.379> one

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
did not expect curse to happen but one

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.280 
did not expect curse to happen but one
of<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.219> case<00:02:41.569> getting<00:02:42.569> on<00:02:42.689> a<00:02:42.719> gengar<00:02:42.959> cuz<00:02:43.260> I

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
of the case getting on a gengar cuz I

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.629 
of the case getting on a gengar cuz I
figured<00:02:43.560> he<00:02:43.739> would<00:02:43.829> go<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.159> like<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.340> burn<00:02:44.609> or

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
figured he would go for like a burn or

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.789 
figured he would go for like a burn or
something<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.389> I<00:02:45.599> guess<00:02:46.139> he<00:02:46.260> has<00:02:46.349> curse<00:02:46.620> as

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
something but I guess he has curse as

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.140 
something but I guess he has curse as

we'll<00:04:37.510> just<00:04:37.540> kind<00:04:37.840> of<00:04:37.930> half-sack<00:04:38.590> Rotom<00:04:38.979> and

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
we'll just kind of half-sack Rotom and

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.240 
we'll just kind of half-sack Rotom and
he<00:04:39.280> got<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.550> sub<00:04:39.729> up<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.540> then<00:04:41.010> his<00:04:42.010> healing

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
he got the sub up and then his healing

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.159 
he got the sub up and then his healing
for<00:04:42.370> accurate<00:04:42.669> echoed<00:04:43.180> voice<00:04:43.210> on<00:04:43.690> me<00:04:43.870> such<00:04:44.139> a

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
for accurate echoed voice on me such a

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.320 
for accurate echoed voice on me such a
thing<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.710> guess<00:04:44.949> I<00:04:45.070> don't<00:04:45.280> know<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.580> didn't

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
thing I guess I don't know I didn't

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.460 
thing I guess I don't know I didn't
really<00:04:46.449> know<00:04:46.600> what<00:04:46.630> else<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:46.930> bring<00:04:47.199> in<00:04:47.320> at

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
really know what else to bring in at

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.200 
really know what else to bring in at
this<00:04:47.590> point<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.949> was<00:04:48.070> like<00:04:48.160> okay<00:04:48.580> let's<00:04:48.760> try<00:04:48.970> me

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
this point I was like okay let's try me

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.540 
this point I was like okay let's try me
don't<00:04:49.389> greninja<00:04:49.690> I<00:04:50.110> was<00:04:50.620> hoping<00:04:51.010> well

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
don't greninja I was hoping well

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.940 
don't greninja I was hoping well
actually<00:04:51.699> one<00:04:52.000> mr.<00:04:52.270> after<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:53.350> just<00:04:53.650> break<00:04:53.830> the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
actually one mr. after to just break the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.469 
actually one mr. after to just break the
sub<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.340> then<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.580> had<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.910> let<00:04:55.060> something<00:04:55.240> die

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
sub and then I had to let something die

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.500 
sub and then I had to let something die
obviously<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:56.500> just<00:04:56.860> chose<00:04:57.070> greninja<00:04:57.520> but

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
obviously so I just chose greninja but

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.330 
obviously so I just chose greninja but
now<00:04:58.690> at<00:04:58.870> this<00:04:58.960> range<00:04:59.229> I<00:04:59.440> know<00:04:59.530> I<00:04:59.710> can<00:05:00.010> take<00:05:00.160> out

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
now at this range I know I can take out

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.760 
now at this range I know I can take out
the<00:05:00.729> guard<00:05:01.389> war<00:05:01.600> with<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.080> u-turn<00:05:02.380> so<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.620> just

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
the guard war with the u-turn so I just

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.840 
the guard war with the u-turn so I just
go<00:05:02.860> back<00:05:03.010> to<00:05:03.040> miss<00:05:03.220> Rapp<00:05:03.370> she<00:05:03.520> goes<00:05:03.669> into

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
go back to miss Rapp she goes into

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.000 
go back to miss Rapp she goes into
excadrill<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.540> I<00:05:05.169> break<00:05:05.350> his<00:05:05.380> balloon<00:05:05.830> which

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
excadrill and I break his balloon which

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.170 
excadrill and I break his balloon which
is<00:05:06.130> really<00:05:06.310> matter<00:05:06.460> if<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.610> got<00:05:06.729> on<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:06.940> Kauri

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
is really matter if I got on the Kauri

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.420 
is really matter if I got on the Kauri
out<00:05:07.330> here<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.800> realized<00:05:09.190> that<00:05:09.340> was

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
out here and I realized that was

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.940 
out here and I realized that was
actually<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.729> really<00:05:10.030> stupid<00:05:10.330> play<00:05:10.950> reason

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
actually a really stupid play reason

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.240 
actually a really stupid play reason
being<00:05:11.979> is<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:12.750> X<00:05:13.750> well<00:05:14.320> I<00:05:14.350> looked<00:05:14.800> up<00:05:14.950> extra

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
being is that X well I looked up extra

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.730 
being is that X well I looked up extra
drills<00:05:15.490> base<00:05:15.729> speed<00:05:15.970> and<00:05:16.270> I<00:05:16.510> mean<00:05:17.320> I'm<00:05:17.530> down

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
drills base speed and I mean I'm down

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.740 
drills base speed and I mean I'm down
most<00:05:17.979> xq<00:05:18.400> drills<00:05:18.580> are<00:05:18.669> gonna<00:05:18.760> be<00:05:18.880> running<00:05:19.120> max

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
most xq drills are gonna be running max

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.180 
most xq drills are gonna be running max
speed<00:05:19.990> but<00:05:20.229> if<00:05:20.289> he<00:05:20.380> was<00:05:20.530> running<00:05:20.740> backs<00:05:20.979> feed

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
speed but if he was running backs feed

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.439 
speed but if he was running backs feed
he<00:05:21.400> would<00:05:21.550> have<00:05:21.639> that's<00:05:21.699> been<00:05:21.940> me<00:05:22.060> and<00:05:22.090> killed

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
he would have that's been me and killed

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.420 
he would have that's been me and killed
me<00:05:22.600> so<00:05:22.780> I<00:05:22.810> wanted<00:05:23.289> to<00:05:23.350> make<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.010> safe<00:05:24.220> play

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
me so I wanted to make the safe play

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.520 
me so I wanted to make the safe play
just<00:05:24.760> go<00:05:24.850> into<00:05:25.060> Rotom<00:05:25.270> and<00:05:25.419> sackett<00:05:25.780> and<00:05:25.930> then

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
just go into Rotom and sackett and then

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.020 
just go into Rotom and sackett and then
go<00:05:26.710> back<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:26.889> mr.<00:05:27.160> after<00:05:27.370> who<00:05:27.520> can<00:05:27.700> out<00:05:27.820> to<00:05:27.940> be

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
go back to mr. after who can out to be

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.210 
go back to mr. after who can out to be
tango<00:05:28.419> for<00:05:28.539> close<00:05:28.660> combat<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:29.200> might<00:05:29.650> not<00:05:29.800> kill

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
tango for close combat it might not kill

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.159 
tango for close combat it might not kill
but<00:05:30.280> i'll<00:05:30.550> bring<00:05:30.760> it<00:05:30.820> in<00:05:31.030> to<00:05:31.210> kill<00:05:31.539> range<00:05:31.930> of

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
but i'll bring it in to kill range of

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.290 
but i'll bring it in to kill range of
like<00:05:32.320> an<00:05:32.440> extreme<00:05:32.770> speed<00:05:33.039> so<00:05:33.370> I<00:05:33.580> felt<00:05:34.180> like

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
like an extreme speed so I felt like

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.490 
like an extreme speed so I felt like
that<00:05:34.450> would<00:05:34.539> be<00:05:34.660> safer<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.169> that<00:05:35.260> is<00:05:35.350> what<00:05:35.470> I

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
that would be safer and that is what I

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.200 
that would be safer and that is what I
do<00:05:35.590> buddy<00:05:35.800> bring<00:05:35.979> bringing<00:05:36.760> Gardevoir

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
do buddy bring bringing Gardevoir

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.390 
do buddy bring bringing Gardevoir
instead<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:38.139> I<00:05:38.530> just<00:05:38.710> take<00:05:38.830> that<00:05:38.979> down<00:05:39.220> with

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
instead and I just take that down with

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.710 
instead and I just take that down with
close<00:05:39.550> combat<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.120> they<00:05:40.180> just<00:05:40.330> goes<00:05:40.599> in

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
close combat and they just goes in

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.860 
close combat and they just goes in
cloistered<00:05:41.200> hoping<00:05:41.560> that<00:05:41.770> he<00:05:41.979> can<00:05:42.130> live<00:05:42.370> a

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
cloistered hoping that he can live a

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.900 
cloistered hoping that he can live a
close<00:05:43.870> combat<00:05:44.110> which<00:05:44.620> he<00:05:44.770> does<00:05:44.979> and<00:05:45.430> just<00:05:45.610> gets

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
close combat which he does and just gets

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.070 
close combat which he does and just gets
the<00:05:46.000> shells<00:05:46.240> mashup<00:05:46.599> which<00:05:46.750> is<00:05:46.870> pretty

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
the shells mashup which is pretty

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.620 
the shells mashup which is pretty
fruitless<00:05:47.500> just<00:05:47.919> because<00:05:48.220> uh<00:05:48.250> I<00:05:48.910> do<00:05:49.510> have

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
fruitless just because uh I do have

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.750 
fruitless just because uh I do have
experienced<00:05:50.050> a<00:05:50.110> no<00:05:50.200> Lucario<00:05:50.530> so<00:05:50.979> I<00:05:51.340> can<00:05:51.669> just

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
experienced a no Lucario so I can just

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.790 
experienced a no Lucario so I can just
go<00:05:51.880> into<00:05:52.030> that<00:05:52.150> mega<00:05:52.840> up<00:05:53.110> which<00:05:53.380> means<00:05:53.560> I'm

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
go into that mega up which means I'm

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.200 
go into that mega up which means I'm
gonna<00:05:53.950> have<00:05:54.010> to<00:05:54.190> be<00:05:54.250> at<00:05:54.310> excadrill<00:05:54.700> no<00:05:55.000> matter
