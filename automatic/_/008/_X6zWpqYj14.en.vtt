pieces that we're looking for so that's

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.780 
pieces that we're looking for so that's
just<00:00:52.120> let's<00:00:52.449> say<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:53.129> quick<00:00:54.129> figure<00:00:56.579> see<00:00:57.579> that's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
just let's say a quick figure see that's

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.610 
just let's say a quick figure see that's
you've<00:00:57.969> highlighted<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.690> gas<00:00:58.899> masks<00:00:59.230> and

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
you've highlighted the gas masks and

you've highlighted the gas masks and
stuff<00:00:59.890> like<00:01:00.039> that<00:01:00.219> on<00:01:00.309> it<00:01:00.430> as<00:01:00.550> well

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
stuff like that on it as well

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.490 
stuff like that on it as well
and<00:01:02.680> as<00:01:02.980> we've<00:01:03.190> gone<00:01:03.430> through<00:01:04.289> and<00:01:05.289> we've

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
and as we've gone through and we've

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.650 
and as we've gone through and we've
looked<00:01:07.380> where<00:01:08.380> we<00:01:08.500> can<00:01:08.649> highlight<00:01:08.890> buns<00:01:09.660> we've

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
looked where we can highlight buns we've

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.520 
looked where we can highlight buns we've
done<00:01:10.899> that<00:01:11.110> as<00:01:11.229> well<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.850> so<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:14.200> we<00:01:14.259> are<00:01:14.289> so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
done that as well and so there we are so

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.109 
done that as well and so there we are so
this<00:01:14.619> is<00:01:14.800> like<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:14.979> basic<00:01:15.310> paint<00:01:15.670> job<00:01:15.880> basically

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
this is like a basic paint job basically

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.889 
this is like a basic paint job basically
easy<00:01:16.930> tabletop<00:01:17.680> standard<00:01:18.130> paint<00:01:18.399> job<00:01:18.660> and<00:01:19.660> we

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
easy tabletop standard paint job and we

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.440 
easy tabletop standard paint job and we
just<00:01:20.110> command<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.500> would<00:01:20.590> be<00:01:20.680> a<00:01:20.710> bit<00:01:21.009> too<00:01:21.160> close

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
just command it would be a bit too close

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.090 
just command it would be a bit too close
and<00:01:22.450> we've<00:01:23.170> based<00:01:23.410> it<00:01:23.619> all<00:01:23.710> we're<00:01:23.800> going<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:23.979> do

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
and we've based it all we're going to do

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.210 
and we've based it all we're going to do
now<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.460> wait<00:01:24.610> for<00:01:24.789> that<00:01:24.910> to<00:01:25.000> dry<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:26.099> we<00:01:27.099> can

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
now is wait for that to dry and we can

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.550 
now is wait for that to dry and we can
do<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.399> mud<00:01:27.520> effects<00:01:27.819> and<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:29.380> some

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
do the mud effects and do some

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.529 
do the mud effects and do some
weathering<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:29.979> stuff<00:01:30.160> on<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.369> figures<00:01:30.640> okay

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
weathering and stuff on the figures okay

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.330 
weathering and stuff on the figures okay
so<00:01:31.599> and<00:01:32.080> I've<00:01:32.170> also<00:01:32.289> done<00:01:35.039> obviously<00:01:36.039> the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.119 
onto different areas we've also covered
the<00:03:41.239> bases<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.080> then<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.319> base<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:42.709> now<00:03:42.860> story

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
the bases and then the base is now story

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.300 
the bases and then the base is now story
for<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.340> bases<00:03:43.700> we<00:03:43.879> used<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.269> dry<00:03:45.260> mud<00:03:45.530> then<00:03:46.190> we

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
for the bases we used a dry mud then we

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.009 
for the bases we used a dry mud then we
hit<00:03:46.519> them<00:03:46.670> with<00:03:46.819> a<00:03:46.849> deadly<00:03:47.299> mud<00:03:47.480> over<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.780> top

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
hit them with a deadly mud over the top

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.530 
hit them with a deadly mud over the top
and<00:03:48.260> then<00:03:48.769> we<00:03:49.010> let<00:03:49.190> that<00:03:49.310> dry<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:50.269> what<00:03:50.390> you're

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
and then we let that dry and what you're

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.720 
and then we let that dry and what you're
getting<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:51.140> is<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:52.190> areas<00:03:52.849> where<00:03:54.340> it's<00:03:55.340> dark

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
and it's light so you have areas

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.620 
and it's light so you have areas

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
figure but we've talked about how we've

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.409 
figure but we've talked about how we've
progressed<00:04:59.990> from<00:05:00.550> just<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.669> basic<00:05:02.090> model

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
progressed from just the basic model

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.050 
progressed from just the basic model
where<00:05:02.810> we<00:05:02.870> put<00:05:03.080> it<00:05:03.200> together<00:05:03.940> what<00:05:04.940> we've

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
where we put it together what we've

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.730 
where we put it together what we've
already<00:05:05.300> put<00:05:05.810> together<00:05:05.930> unfortunately<00:05:06.200> these

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
already put together unfortunately these

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.159 
already put together unfortunately these
ones<00:05:06.979> were<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.970> then<00:05:08.389> we<00:05:08.539> talked<00:05:08.750> about<00:05:08.870> how

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
ones were and then we talked about how

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.260 
ones were and then we talked about how
to<00:05:09.229> spray<00:05:09.620> or<00:05:09.860> paint<00:05:10.160> them<00:05:10.340> then<00:05:10.970> we<00:05:11.120> went

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
to spray or paint them then we went

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.110 
to spray or paint them then we went
through<00:05:11.389> the<00:05:11.510> different<00:05:12.520> areas<00:05:13.520> of<00:05:13.820> bat

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
through the different areas of bat

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.450

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
a monotonous process but if you can

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.990 
a monotonous process but if you can
batch<00:05:21.169> if<00:05:21.500> you<00:05:21.620> can<00:05:21.740> batch<00:05:21.919> your<00:05:22.160> army<00:05:22.430> out<00:05:22.550> do
