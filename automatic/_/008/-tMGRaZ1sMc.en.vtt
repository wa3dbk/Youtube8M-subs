and then I can't run a lot so I'm going

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.229 
and then I can't run a lot so I'm going
to<00:00:30.900> use<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.830> lunge<00:00:32.340> rip<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.090> use<00:00:33.210> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
to use a lunge rip or you can use a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.260 
to use a lunge rip or you can use a
lunge<00:00:33.480> line<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:34.489> you<00:00:35.489> would<00:00:35.730> naturally<00:00:35.910> want

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
lunge line now you would naturally want

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.790 
lunge line now you would naturally want
to<00:00:36.660> use<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.290> small<00:00:38.129> round<00:00:38.489> pen<00:00:38.760> um<00:00:39.750> not<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> huge

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
to use a small round pen um not a huge

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.130 
to use a small round pen um not a huge
arena<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.420> don't<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.780> so

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
arena like this but we don't have one so

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.779 
arena like this but we don't have one so
we're<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> use<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.520> works

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
we're going to use this and it works

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.670 
we're going to use this and it works
it's<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.480> better<00:00:45.780> especially<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> young

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it's just better especially the young
