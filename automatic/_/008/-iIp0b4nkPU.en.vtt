00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
natural level what we need to do is take

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.970 
natural level what we need to do is take
the<00:02:27.120> hair<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.720> cut<00:02:28.050> off<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.230> track<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
this is call shifting so I sort of shift

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.490 
this is call shifting so I sort of shift
my<00:02:32.340> fingers<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.060> pulls<00:02:34.370> sections<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.519> hair
