00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.070
 worth knowing I am now going to be the curtain 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.020
 and make a number of films about the various subjects and the 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.800
 very first that we take closely that is one about the garden trampolines 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:17.050
 existing tomic in the netherlands thousands one there is in the garden trampolines mine 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.519
 children jump on 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.559
 and that week as a rule not at all how to deal with the 

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:25.300
 bulldozer incredible number of accidents 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.800
 one of the some already have been very very serious and probably 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.550
 has produced the first death 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.129
 how come she knows you with no possibility how to deal with it 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.920
 and that is open life dangerous then there are some basic principles you 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.040
 must adhere to it and if he adheres to it, damsel hardly ever has to do anything 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.970
 to happen 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.300
 prizes and tram good players from an association that is here all highest level 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.870
 so jump who you know what about 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.960
 the fifty years of experience in the meantime and we will now show a video 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.440
 in the way b say that the event must be rowing in lucerne and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.400
 trampoline 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.570
 to begin with never go on a trampoline with several people because that is 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.340
 ask for trouble 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.710
 when you get there for the first time with this band and he who does not have absolute governance 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.450
 to check the case if it gets out of hand 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 slowly but surely you will not be taught how 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.120
 jump slowly trampoline 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.480
 pay particular attention to the very special things that are said because the one is running there 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.760
 the om 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.130
 and then it is not that difficult at all and you can do it relatively quickly 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.130
 delicious 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.910
 the first thing you learn how to do is just walk over it 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.180
 from any other side of the net 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.180
 if you have done a few times then you continue 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 now allowed to make steps 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.229
 how is that possible 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.600
 play poorer 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.640
 arnhem through it all the way through the knees 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.580
 abolish her husband 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.580
 why do you have to move more there? 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.179
 very quiet upstairs for a moment 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.249
 well do it yourself with a jump and should have talked 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:22.039
 again 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:23.709
 again 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.709
 then you must keep your arms above that still 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.639
 now hear the trampoline with the arms 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.219
 with value as their struggles advance 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.059
 get 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.039
 what to get in the next 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.240
 the middle 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.819
 upright animal handlers stand 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.819
 and thereby the new is above egypt 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.689
 again 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.689
 it worked 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.190
 striking what he is going to do efficiently search 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.190
 that's why I'm here 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.239
 martinary 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.729
 has spoken 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.939
 so you have to lie on your stomach 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.279
 why you stand behind each other alone 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.619
 certainly trade and kenya outside 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.079
 We are troubled and remain unanswered 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.079
 again 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:49.959
 valcke 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.509
 become an eagle 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.559
 have no work at all 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:57.749
 and now comes the roma you can do things where martin 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.929
 lasse nilsson 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.679
 but always grab hold of walking group with chantal 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:13.579
 everyone there is so outspoken that they need another property million euros 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.579
 that made rob trip although it was clear 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.130
 buy online 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.430
 heard adele 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:36.139
 don't make me smile can dream 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.090
 such a man jay z the ek performance 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.090
 grab more 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.659
 van der laan live have children 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:11.839
 everyone has delay because I was on the trampoline for the fact that it is 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.259
 always be able to make 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.919
 That was mainly due to the strong outsiders think once 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.919
 it goes fast above the head roll 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.149
 stay lower the very first time 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.719
 become others 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.360
 the first time this week earlier 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.749
 continue to record defeat 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:36.749
 none not quite right 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.909
 8 how do you not worry about our put the church pening, among other things 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.080
 then you are going to help make all the little bits 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.309
 if you don't always go to school 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:55.149
 furthermore it will always be again that find it is not possible that all of you can do that 

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:58.279
 a few people again at any time 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.279
 that is 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.189
 the perpetrator kills himself that is 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.569
 well done 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.569
 you go a little higher yourself 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.279
 to make 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.279
 and then you finally create the santÃ© 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.770
 played 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.309
 and so you can, in a very safe way, flourish 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.870
 if you find this you have seen and you have tried all that i think 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.860
 so want to learn something brittle 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.729
 then that can give no here 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.830
 among other parties where you have the jumps you have had 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.139
 can learn and you actually come 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.669
 virtually somersaults are increasing 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:10.669
 and you need an hour for that 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:13.279
 are you interested in 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:16.719
 then look at google at tom mcrae show 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:21.029
 and then you come everywhere psv must state everything neatly to give up
