00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
people get blood work I think that's the

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.110 
people get blood work I think that's the
way<00:04:27.500> that<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.800> remove<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.729> demonization

these things in the stigma and it is

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.879 
these things in the stigma and it is
easy<00:04:32.389> you<00:04:32.629> can<00:04:32.750> do<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:32.990> right<00:04:33.050> now<00:04:33.229> easily<00:04:33.710> in

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
easy you can do that right now easily in

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.010 
easy you can do that right now easily in
the<00:04:34.009> US<00:04:34.280> believe<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:34.729> or<00:04:34.819> not<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.120> can<00:04:35.479> do<00:04:35.870> it

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
the US believe it or not you can do it

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.719 
the US believe it or not you can do it
that<00:04:36.199> way<00:04:36.409> it's<00:04:36.949> just<00:04:37.190> it's<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.370> bit<00:04:37.550> more

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
that way it's just it's a bit more

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.010 
that way it's just it's a bit more
expensive<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.360> lot<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.539> people<00:04:38.690> choose<00:04:38.990> not

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
expensive and a lot of people choose not

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.170 
expensive and a lot of people choose not
to<00:04:39.349> go<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:39.770> route<00:04:39.949> due<00:04:40.159> to<00:04:40.280> cost<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:41.030> then

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
to go that route due to cost but then

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.550 
to go that route due to cost but then
when<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:41.389> take<00:04:41.569> the<00:04:41.690> alternative<00:04:42.259> like<00:04:42.440> we

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
when you take the alternative like we

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.140 
when you take the alternative like we
have<00:04:42.710> in<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.919> UK<00:04:43.310> right<00:04:43.340> now<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.789> way<00:04:44.030> this

responsible with it and I think that's

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.870 
responsible with it and I think that's
really<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.949> key<00:05:37.159> to<00:05:37.279> this<00:05:37.400> if<00:05:37.550> you<00:05:37.580> want

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
really the key to this if you want

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.550 
really the key to this if you want

further deeper immobilization of Lou the

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:41.569 
demonization we need people who are

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:44.769 
demonization we need people who are
being<00:05:42.169> responsible<00:05:42.949> with<00:05:43.069> these<00:05:43.310> things<00:05:43.779> not

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
being responsible with these things not

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.480

without medical supervision that's why

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.890 
without medical supervision that's why
you<00:05:54.199> see<00:05:54.860> it's<00:05:55.580> so<00:05:55.819> easy<00:05:56.000> to<00:05:56.120> demonize<00:05:56.360> it<00:05:56.779> now

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
you see it's so easy to demonize it now

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.689 
you see it's so easy to demonize it now
we<00:05:57.169> need<00:05:57.289> to<00:05:57.319> go<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:57.620> other<00:05:57.680> direction<00:05:57.949> and<00:05:58.490> I

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
we need to go the other direction and I

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.100 
we need to go the other direction and I
fully<00:05:58.879> support<00:05:59.150> the<00:05:59.569> idea<00:05:59.900> of<00:05:59.960> this<00:06:00.050> being

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
fully support the idea of this being

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.110 
fully support the idea of this being
done<00:06:00.349> as<00:06:00.620> a<00:06:00.650> legal<00:06:01.009> business<00:06:01.520> with<00:06:01.729> medical

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
done as a legal business with medical

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.760 
done as a legal business with medical

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
involved through it with oversight I

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.700 
involved through it with oversight I
think<00:06:05.300> that's<00:06:05.479> the<00:06:05.629> way<00:06:05.779> forward<00:06:06.050> with<00:06:06.379> it<00:06:06.529> if

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
think that's the way forward with it if

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.379 
think that's the way forward with it if
we<00:06:07.460> want<00:06:07.639> to<00:06:07.699> make<00:06:07.819> a<00:06:07.849> business<00:06:08.120> out<00:06:08.330> of
