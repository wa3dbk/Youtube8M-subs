00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 some spots that appear rust is 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.429
 so the Mrs. Maria Madalena Felipe 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.580
 describes what has been happening with your 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.199
 foot of fig there in goiás says that the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.199
 leaves scroll and ask what to do 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:21.630
 for the plant looks more beautiful 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.119
 the blue tone so characteristic of 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 fig groves has everything to do with 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.230
 treatment for the control of this 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.140
 problem that appeared on the property 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.910
 Lady Mary Magdalene the owner 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.820
 municipality of valinhos in são paulo 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.760
 produces something around 2 million and 50 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.430
 a thousand fig boxes per year so if 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.190
 self denominates as the capital of the fig in the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.500
 Brazil, here nobody says take care of 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.110
 treatment of this rust that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.239
 rolls the leaves is a serious problem, right? 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.250
 Doctor Mark is a serious problem and if 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.320
 nothing is done the producer can lose the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.879
 total production is the main disease 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.920
 of this major disease of the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.230
 culture it appears due to high 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.359
 temperature and high humidity characterizes 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.090
 our summer and what causes this 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.130
 sick it is caused by a fungus 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.950
 called being Othello an end in itself 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.680
 anyway and it starts with these spots 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.119
 brown leaf tips leaf crinkles 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.189
 to overturn the production because the plant 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.310
 keep an eye on the fruits 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.950
 according to doctor landmarks does not exist 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.290
 fig farming in brazil that does not suffer 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.170
 with a rust attack the way it is 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.509
 to live with and live with the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.110
 products available to combat this

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.040
 preventive way even if the disease 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.830
 not in the plant she will make a 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.350
 preventive control with non-rust 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.960
 settle in the budding culture
