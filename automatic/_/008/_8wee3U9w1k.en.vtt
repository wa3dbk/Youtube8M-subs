tattoo was when I was 17 years old I was

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.429 
tattoo was when I was 17 years old I was
not<00:00:26.789> even<00:00:27.060> legally<00:00:27.660> allowed<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> tattoo

not even legally allowed to get a tattoo

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.500 
not even legally allowed to get a tattoo
but<00:00:28.980> despite<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.640> best<00:00:29.820> efforts<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.390> my

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
