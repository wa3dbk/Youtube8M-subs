that's<00:01:25.289> different<00:01:25.380> about<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.069> really<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
that's different about it really that I

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.999 
that's different about it really that I
noticed<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:28.319> course<00:01:28.590> they've<00:01:28.740> got<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
noticed is of course they've got the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.550 
noticed is of course they've got the
seasoning<00:01:29.429> on<00:01:29.520> top<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.910> it<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.380> Cool<00:01:31.380> Ranch

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
seasoning on top of it for Cool Ranch

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.199 
seasoning on top of it for Cool Ranch
but<00:01:32.190> it<00:01:32.429> doesn't<00:01:32.700> come<00:01:32.789> in<00:01:32.910> its<00:01:33.030> own<00:01:33.119> little

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:33.209 
but it doesn't come in its own little

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.570 
but it doesn't come in its own little
sleeve<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> Doritos<00:01:34.530> look<00:01:34.709> at<00:01:34.890> us<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
sleeve like the Doritos look at us and I

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.669 
sleeve like the Doritos look at us and I
think<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.420> happens<00:01:36.780> because<00:01:36.899> that

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
think that that happens because that

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.889 
think that that happens because that
gets<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.190> over<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.670> goddamn<00:01:39.000> place<00:01:39.060> alright

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
gets all over the goddamn place alright

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.350 
gets all over the goddamn place alright
so<00:01:40.020> I'm<00:01:40.080> gonna<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.319> them<00:01:40.380> all<00:01:40.500> pre<00:01:41.360> unwrapped
