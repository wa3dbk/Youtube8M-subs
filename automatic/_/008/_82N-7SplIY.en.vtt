00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
take the jump straight on rather than at

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.740 
take the jump straight on rather than at
an<00:00:51.340> angle<00:00:51.730> so<00:00:51.910> you<00:00:51.940> don't<00:00:52.180> flip<00:00:52.390> on<00:00:52.600> your

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
an angle so you don't flip on your

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.610 
an angle so you don't flip on your
landing<00:00:54.660> there<00:00:55.660> are<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.899> couple<00:00:56.289> of<00:00:56.440> other

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
landing there are a couple of other

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.110 
landing there are a couple of other
achievements<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.340> can<00:00:57.489> get<00:00:57.670> during<00:00:57.879> this

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
achievements you can get during this

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.240 
achievements you can get during this
sequence<00:00:58.629> I<00:00:58.960> would<00:00:59.230> suggest<00:00:59.440> going<00:00:59.800> ahead<00:00:59.980> and

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
sequence I would suggest going ahead and

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.529 
sequence I would suggest going ahead and
grabbing<00:01:00.579> them<00:01:00.730> while<00:01:00.910> you're<00:01:01.059> doing<00:01:01.390> this

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
grabbing them while you're doing this

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.150 
grabbing them while you're doing this
because<00:01:01.809> you<00:01:02.079> can<00:01:02.230> just<00:01:02.260> restart<00:01:02.829> your<00:01:02.949> last

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
because you can just restart your last

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.519 
because you can just restart your last
checkpoint<00:01:03.460> there<00:01:04.329> is<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.659> thirsty<00:01:05.170> grunt
