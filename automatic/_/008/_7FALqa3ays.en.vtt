tracks you can choose file but uh

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.860 
tracks you can choose file but uh
instead<00:00:39.109> of<00:00:39.199> having<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:40.100> regular<00:00:40.870> Nintendo

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
instead of having the regular Nintendo

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.520 
instead of having the regular Nintendo
characters<00:00:42.530> here<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.370> do<00:00:43.489> have<00:00:43.519> these<00:00:44.530> cute

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
gonna take a little while because it

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.399 
gonna take a little while because it
does<00:01:08.180> lag<00:01:08.509> a<00:01:08.540> little<00:01:08.689> bit<00:01:08.990> because<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.350> the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
does lag a little bit because of the

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.280 
does lag a little bit because of the
video<00:01:09.680> recording<00:01:10.270> but<00:01:11.270> this<00:01:11.600> game<00:01:11.780> does<00:01:11.990> like

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
video recording but this game does like

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.709 
video recording but this game does like
a<00:01:12.500> little<00:01:12.770> bit<00:01:12.860> at<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.250> same<00:01:13.430> time<00:01:13.700> just<00:01:14.540> in

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
a little bit at the same time just in

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.350 
a little bit at the same time just in
general<00:01:15.200> even<00:01:15.799> when<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.460> wasn't<00:01:16.700> recording<00:01:17.270> it

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
general even when I wasn't recording it

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.429 
general even when I wasn't recording it
was<00:01:17.479> kind<00:01:17.719> of<00:01:17.780> laggy<00:01:19.329> but<00:01:20.329> um<00:01:20.570> I<00:01:22.960> do<00:01:23.960> believe

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
was kind of laggy but um I do believe

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.639 
was kind of laggy but um I do believe
this<00:01:24.590> is<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.829> good<00:01:25.070> game<00:01:25.399> however<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:27.259> controls

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
this is a good game however the controls

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.880 
this is a good game however the controls
are<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.979> little<00:01:28.280> bit<00:01:28.659> I<00:01:30.579> believe<00:01:31.579> even<00:01:32.240> if<00:01:32.600> you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
are a little bit I believe even if you

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.590 
are a little bit I believe even if you
adjust<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.070> sensitivity<00:01:34.430> it's<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.299> little<00:01:35.479> bit

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
adjust the sensitivity it's a little bit

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.440 
adjust the sensitivity it's a little bit
too<00:01:35.840> sensitive<00:01:36.759> even<00:01:37.759> if<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:37.969> adjust<00:01:38.329> the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
too sensitive even if you adjust the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.099 
too sensitive even if you adjust the
sensitivity<00:01:38.750> like<00:01:39.200> I<00:01:39.350> said<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:41.210> still<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.990> a

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
sensitivity like I said it still is a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.950 
sensitivity like I said it still is a
little<00:01:42.289> bit<00:01:42.500> over<00:01:42.950> responsive<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.479> sometimes

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
little bit over responsive and sometimes

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.700 
little bit over responsive and sometimes
at<00:01:45.289> the<00:01:45.439> same<00:01:45.649> time<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:48.200> not<00:01:48.439> very

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
at the same time it's not very

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.770 
at the same time it's not very
responsive<00:01:49.460> at<00:01:49.609> all

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
responsive at all

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.870 
responsive at all
so<00:01:51.500> this<00:01:52.250> game<00:01:52.429> is<00:01:52.549> a<00:01:52.579> little<00:01:52.820> bit<00:01:53.060> buggy<00:01:53.539> but

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
so this game is a little bit buggy but

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:27.649 
and such that are the power-ups and
whatnot<00:02:24.409> but<00:02:25.549> other<00:02:26.549> than<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:26.970> being<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.269> little

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
whatnot but other than it being a little

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.660 
whatnot but other than it being a little
glitchy<00:02:27.900> at<00:02:28.140> times<00:02:28.379> this<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.340> pretty<00:02:29.579> much

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
glitchy at times this is pretty much

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.179 
glitchy at times this is pretty much
just<00:02:30.090> having<00:02:30.930> Mario<00:02:31.409> Kart<00:02:31.709> on<00:02:31.950> your<00:02:32.099> own

just having Mario Kart on your own

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.140 
just having Mario Kart on your own
device<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.930> believe<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.379> get<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.769> in<00:02:35.069> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
device I believe you can get this in the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.069 
device I believe you can get this in the
iTunes<00:02:36.150> Store<00:02:36.299> but<00:02:37.079> if<00:02:37.620> they've<00:02:37.799> already

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
iTunes Store but if they've already

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.509 
iTunes Store but if they've already
taken<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.170> down<00:02:40.200> by<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.590> time<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:41.099> video<00:02:41.310> is

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
taken it down by the time this video is

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.360 
taken it down by the time this video is
up<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:43.319> running<00:02:45.049> you<00:02:46.049> can<00:02:46.079> get<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.709> an<00:02:46.920> install

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
up and running you can get it an install

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.960 
up and running you can get it an install
it<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.819> if<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.359> have<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.480> jailbroken<00:02:49.019> device

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
it so if you have a jailbroken device

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.580 
it so if you have a jailbroken device
you<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.120> check<00:02:51.299> out<00:02:51.450> insta<00:02:51.840> list<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.290> it

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
you can check out insta list and it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.379 
you can check out insta list and it
should<00:02:52.829> be<00:02:52.980> there<00:02:53.810> but<00:02:54.810> uh<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.730> have<00:02:56.940> various
