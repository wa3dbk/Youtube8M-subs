00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.729

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.789

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.329
 I'm looking forward to the girls

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.329
 become 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.649
 Do you already have a few impressions of 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.390
 Perhaps you can also collect vienna 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.659
 really wiener rapper you know 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.479
 You are my first one then 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.360
 feature was so glowing red except was one 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.140
 wiener shows hot at that time 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.360
 was missing 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.720
 in my first things my second or 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.009
 third video Rades even believe 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 otherwise you know just a few so 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.180
 the independence or anna says hennig 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.560
 of do not come from vienna otherwise 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.159
 I do not really care about anyone right now 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.290
 a so that in august last year 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.420
 then the recovery is not alone 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.509
 released how was the response and that 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.710
 feedback about it and has since then something 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.710
 basic or grand whole 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.570
 changed yes so I learned how 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.119
 one put album on the legs so 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.770
 completely from a to z 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.630
 I have a lot of gutted the resonance I think 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.280
 Definitely very positive for that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.560
 me now without a big label or 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.719
 even a label and generally without 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.280
 proper sales and publishing and all 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.560
 all those things that belong to it 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.710
 without all these possibilities 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.840
 I still pulled on well and so 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.459
 Now I get a few gigs of rhine 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.390
 a little bit, but somehow 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.679
 I feel it has a bit 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.540
 It took the people the first time 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.859
 check that is really important and 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.299
 Now I have the feeling it starts like this 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.180
 you're the rest with me 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.810
 now in april 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.629
 here it goes alone in april so well the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.799
 what was interesting or was 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.599
 maybe a bit surprising 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.549
 I know that you have morlockk dilemma on yours 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.109
 album represented is how it came about 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.760
 and how can the work in between 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:35.680
 Eich and Wirt and Gast or wrong mine 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.900
 label colleague of goodrich at that time or 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.489
 what is about the year then looked about 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.519
 Two years or so we start 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.139
 made on the beat of morlock plus 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.430
 countries are called producers of the song 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.260
 helpfully we have with it 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.799
 motivation made the kaluga green 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.400
 rehabilitated and is and that makes you the one 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.780
 first contact came into being so and has time 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.760
 the new items, whistled and so 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.139
 At some point thought okay coletta 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.209
 I do so and it was definitely 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.669
 my cool uncle feature what was what 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.230
 something extraordinary would be so and so 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.730
 it was then written to the letter 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.159
 has the same all clear also made the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.810
 Beat to produce and then I have 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.790
 still bleeding and checkout got it and so 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.739
 to create a creative colombo say 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.840
 I have arisen so much in soest of it 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.199
 very good cooperation look if 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.090
 dilemma very crass tea leaves what also 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.579
 with already easily addressed 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.349
 Also surprisingly, according to the 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.750
 press text you can see that end 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.879
 2014 you separated from rich 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.930
 erich offers more or less everything 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.030
 what was the reason for that? 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.400
 so direct reason so there was not it 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.750
 It was more like this thing that just that 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.129
 in general, it all kind of like that 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.079
 worked out as we imagined 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:48.669
 and everyone somehow has his 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:51.310
 has done with time and it is 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.560
 difficult to act as a label 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.509
 without really a management or 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.189
 somehow so that one says okay as well 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:59.349
 at aggro berlin that's the big three 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.000
 people are still over it and was okay like 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.829
 Everything is still coordinated and planned 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.299
 for the guys we are all artists and 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.519
 We got the message 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.229
 our art to think of the wall to the 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.680
 but the rest just does not have 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.150
 is working 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.829
 and then he sees the opinion 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.209
 come together we do ours 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.799
 things are so cool it was now 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.900
 not somehow that anyone because of 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.400
 has brought or now with the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.759
 has done or so it is always 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:27.710
 still cool between the people only but 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:28.970
 it works you have I do not know 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.820
 whether the movie seen that the annual rate 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.500
 of ice t is without a web documentary is happening 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.340
 somehow that's why the ice is his 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.330
 rap colleagues 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.830
 so visited and she asks for it afterwards 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.539
 which situations or under which 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.120
 circumstances your best texte 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.830
 write when do you write yours 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.259
 opinion after so your text 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.780
 under what circumstances now 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.430
 just al-islam it is very much 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.389
 Influence from outside so if I am 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.160
 on the way 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.310
 I always grab a lot of stuff too 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.990
 by being on the road now 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.150
 much of that now in switzerland 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.820
 was now in vienna and things first 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.110
 and things do not see and freedom does not 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.270
 have eaten or seen, we have 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.539
 In any case, that's the way it is 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.460
 travel a lot by I collect lots of cool 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.639
 words so you know sitting in the plane and 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.150
 think okay wings and d and there and 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.250
 any words simply race 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.280
 playstation embrace price if it is in 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.400
 emergency , it is such a thing 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.870
 So mostly when it's on the way 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.820
 yes to the conclusion maybe you still have 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.949
 maybe a black driver story 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.289
 at some point my angel became public 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.330
 tinkering was yes in 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.470
 It was often made in Berlin, too 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.789
 so it was a little bit nicer though 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.349
 the older we get the more 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.789
 we have done so well 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.099
 against the bvg is the berliner 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.750
 Verkehrsgemeinschaft and if the us 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.979
 have come to control others 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.750
 blatant film made so that the 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.310
 have pushed paranoia and that they are 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.680
 so little that we the songs 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.479
 have done so reste and meanwhile 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.159
 is it so that I buy ice cream with fist 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.710
 and in any case do not mind 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:03.080
 have to run away from bvg employees 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.689
 but there are many stories could be the 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.239
 minister 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:08.039
 tell there are people are checkers 

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:11.369
 there has headphones on my 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.899
 Oh, and then stop fast 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:14.099
 but the headphones were stopped 

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:15.419
 still in my ear and I have 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.709
 just done the music now 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.139
 still higher so you know so 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:21.569
 loud and then came to me and see 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.979
 what with the fist know you were 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.099
 you taken out by the head though 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.629
 the little muck rides of the lawn 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.459
 but so has paragon back 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:31.699
 got out and rheingau but from 

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:34.049
 These stories are endless 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.669
 Thank you for your time for the 

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:38.209
 meaning have fun in 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.209
 spray
