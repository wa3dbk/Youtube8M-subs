it's<00:04:08.680> got<00:04:08.860> magnets<00:04:09.459> guiding<00:04:09.880> at<00:04:09.970> home<00:04:10.209> it's<00:04:10.959> so

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
it's got magnets guiding at home it's so

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.449 
it's got magnets guiding at home it's so
easy<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.840> shift<00:04:14.080> between<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.560> years<00:04:14.800> this

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
easy to shift between the years this

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.880

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
which is nice because not all of us

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.100 
which is nice because not all of us
particularly<00:04:20.739> talented<00:04:21.419> in<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.540> way<00:04:22.720> it's<00:04:22.960> not

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
particularly talented in a way it's not

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.990

really<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.440> fair<00:04:23.680> fight<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.520> Peugeot<00:04:24.880> is

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
really a fair fight the Peugeot is

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.580 
really a fair fight the Peugeot is
probably<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.450> better<00:04:25.630> all-round<00:04:25.870> car<00:04:26.290> than<00:04:26.500> the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
probably a better all-round car than the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.200 
probably a better all-round car than the
Fiesta<00:04:27.040> it's<00:04:27.310> more<00:04:27.520> comfortable<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.150> it

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
Fiesta it's more comfortable and it

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.610 
Fiesta it's more comfortable and it
looks<00:04:28.390> better<00:04:28.510> inside<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.169> some<00:04:29.320> will<00:04:29.470> say

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
looks better inside and some will say

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.130 
looks better inside and some will say
outside<00:04:29.770> too<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:31.180> also<00:04:31.240> has<00:04:31.540> an<00:04:31.630> amazingly

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
outside too it also has an amazingly

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.550 
outside too it also has an amazingly
good<00:04:32.229> ride<00:04:32.590> it's<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.340> total<00:04:33.669> package

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
good ride it's the total package

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.080 
good ride it's the total package
but<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.710> Fiesta<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.340> harder<00:04:36.700> edged<00:04:36.880> and

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
but the Fiesta is harder edged and

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.420 
but the Fiesta is harder edged and
faster<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.169> sacrifices<00:04:38.890> are<00:04:39.010> worth<00:04:39.040> it<00:04:39.340> when

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
faster the sacrifices are worth it when

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.860 
faster the sacrifices are worth it when
you<00:04:39.460> add<00:04:39.669> in<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.850> price<00:04:39.970> difference<00:04:40.570> because

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
you add in the price difference because

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.659 
you add in the price difference because
day<00:04:41.110> after<00:04:41.410> day<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.800> Fiesta<00:04:42.220> will<00:04:42.310> keep<00:04:42.520> you
