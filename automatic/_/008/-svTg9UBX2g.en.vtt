did steaks and the insides ain't a bunch
of<00:00:27.730> stuff<00:00:28.029> and<00:00:28.330> in<00:00:29.199> the<00:00:29.380> side<00:00:29.710> video<00:00:29.980> I<00:00:30.130> did<00:00:30.580> my

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
Sunday onions not too long ago I did a

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.450 
Sunday onions not too long ago I did a
video<00:00:33.960> where<00:00:34.960> we<00:00:35.140> had<00:00:35.379> Sunday<00:00:35.710> onions<00:00:36.219> with

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
video where we had Sunday onions with

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.389 
video where we had Sunday onions with
something<00:00:36.909> else<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.569> I<00:00:38.530> link<00:00:38.920> to<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.219> video

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
something else and I link to that video

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.219 
something else and I link to that video
but<00:00:39.819> I<00:00:39.850> realized<00:00:40.359> the<00:00:40.539> sunday<00:00:40.839> onions

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
but I realized the sunday onions

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.410 
but I realized the sunday onions
probably<00:00:41.769> deserve<00:00:42.129> their<00:00:42.339> own<00:00:42.370> video<00:00:42.789> so<00:00:43.179> here

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
probably deserve their own video so here
