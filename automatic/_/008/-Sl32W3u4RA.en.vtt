00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.450
 hamid originality hello so after 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.519
 the group we are going to talk about group b 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.100
 gobbled up we find the world champion in 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.130
 title spain then the Netherlands the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.470
 chile and australia have spent a group 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.779
 less balanced obviously than the group 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.039
 with the Spanish team so I'm 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 very surprised when we talk about the team 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.029
 spain since ultimately it is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.399
 almost nobody for cities among 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.380
 the favorites as a team that remains 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.969
 on 2 euros and a world cup which 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.020
 I do not think it's an exploit 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.520
 obviously never accomplished so 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.590
 Spain even if she has players 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.120
 aging and slightly worn players 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.989
 especially the barça players in the picture 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.100
 de de xavi and iniesta also has 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.510
 real players who come from 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.949
 win the league of champions so 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.899
 it's still a team extremely 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.690
 experienced who arrives wonderfully 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.899
 1 go but real barça dissensions 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.910
 when he wears the jersey of the roja and 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.379
 Spain, which still remains under 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.650
 layer tied him on six wins 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.880
 consecutive in the final the world cup 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.860
 if it's still useful because it will 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.140
 even take into account that the match 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.090
 opening in south africa he had 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.330
 lost 1 0 against Switzerland had some 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.560
 Swiss but hey there he faces a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.080
 team of low countries so that's when 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.259
 even the remake of the final of there 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.369
 four years old but team from the Netherlands 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.590
 significantly rejuvenated and who has the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.509
 particularity of being driven by louis 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.280
 van gall who will leave office 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.390
 to train them manchester united 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.180
 after the competition 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.530
 if we refer to the euro 2004 in France 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.030
 with jacques santini did not 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.850
 situation that usually leads to 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.229
 triumph but the bataves wait no 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.240
 big thing we are world cup so 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.250
 it is to prepare there the future because 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.759
 that the team is very young even though with 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.590
 robin van persie robben or sneijder he 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.690
 still remains players of quality but 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.630
 I think Spain is going to win 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.920
 during this opening match 1 0 I 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.440
 think a zero that might be the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.509
 score spain generally 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.149
 teams that will score little bus that has 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.489
 managed to get around the game possession 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.600
 which was initially an offensive gesture 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.980
 today as a defensive gesture 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.980
 it's good for not conceding a goal 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.940
 Spain still keeps the ball 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.980
 the other match so there we risk 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.750
 maybe to attend the first carton 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.160
 of the competition why because 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.360
 Australia and 62nd in the fifa standings 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.930
 it's downright the worst team 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.489
 ranked in this world cup and the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.250
 chile is still a serious team 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.450
 even though vidal's state of health at 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.360
 the excellent midfielder of the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.850
 juventus turin is still subject to 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.370
 pigs finally even lessened the chili 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.180
 should we go say it opens me and 3 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.620
 0 against a team certainly athletic 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.390
 certainly brave but still 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.910
 extremely limited remember that in 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.880
 Friendly match at Princes' Park is here 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.540
 precise against the blues so clearly 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.030
 the second place joy between chile and 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.850
 Netherlands and I will play the Netherlands 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.160
 I will call you dear boyfriend 6 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.040
 attentive because you do not need to 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.560
 careful that all queues odds 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:18.200
 on the side facing special effects 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.380
 signed Bolloré and gathers his moments 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.380
 free
