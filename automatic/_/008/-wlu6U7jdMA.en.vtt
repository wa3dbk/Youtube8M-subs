00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
bezel that makes it like a shiny jewel

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.109 
bezel that makes it like a shiny jewel
it's<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:24.860> little<00:01:25.860> bit<00:01:25.950> different<00:01:26.310> people<00:01:26.700> no<00:01:27.090> I

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
thought it was both ways actually

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.780 
thought it was both ways actually
well<00:01:35.140> they're<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.409> really<00:01:35.650> different<00:01:35.950> yeah

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
well they're a really different yeah

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.610 
well they're a really different yeah
they're<00:01:37.000> not<00:01:37.120> feel<00:01:37.540> more<00:01:37.690> comfortable<00:01:38.020> like

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
they just speak what's the verdict I was

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.010 
they just speak what's the verdict I was
expecting<00:01:41.620> it<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:42.130> look<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.150> little<00:01:43.330> bit<00:01:43.600> more

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
expecting it to look a little bit more

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.990 
expecting it to look a little bit more
different<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.680> don't<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.310> know<00:01:45.340> expect<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.880> to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
different I don't you know expect it to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.469 
different I don't you know expect it to
be<00:01:46.090> quite<00:01:46.300> as<00:01:46.450> long<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:47.500> wait<00:01:47.680> school<00:01:47.979> yeah<00:01:48.479> it
