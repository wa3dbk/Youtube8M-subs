00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
about the murciélago I mean you get up

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.230 
about the murciélago I mean you get up
the<00:06:25.800> main<00:06:26.010> road<00:06:26.250> I<00:06:26.400> need<00:06:26.580> to<00:06:26.670> raise<00:06:26.850> the<00:06:27.060> nose

the main road I need to raise the nose

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.970 
the main road I need to raise the nose
others<00:06:27.690> you<00:06:27.780> shatter<00:06:28.140> that<00:06:28.350> expensive

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
others you shatter that expensive

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.370 
others you shatter that expensive
carbon-fiber<00:06:29.550> nose<00:06:29.880> and<00:06:30.180> then<00:06:30.840> that<00:06:31.230> is

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
carbon-fiber nose and then that is

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.000 
carbon-fiber nose and then that is
getting<00:06:31.650> old<00:06:33.020> which<00:06:34.020> is<00:06:34.050> far<00:06:34.350> from<00:06:34.470> easy

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
getting old which is far from easy

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.190 
getting old which is far from easy
but<00:06:35.370> then<00:06:35.490> that's<00:06:35.670> what<00:06:36.000> makes<00:06:36.240> the<00:06:36.390> release

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
but then that's what makes the release

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.590 
but then that's what makes the release
so<00:06:37.440> exquisitely<00:06:38.280> addictive<00:06:38.850> you<00:06:39.270> don't<00:06:39.420> use
