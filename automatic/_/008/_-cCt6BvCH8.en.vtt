00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
Spikers now but sadly it doesn't really

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.100 
Spikers now but sadly it doesn't really
fit<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.280> well<00:02:36.310> with<00:02:36.670> an<00:02:36.790> elite<00:02:37.120> he<00:02:37.870> can't

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
fit that well with an elite he can't

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.350 
fit that well with an elite he can't
really<00:02:38.260> hold<00:02:38.530> them<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.890> easily<00:02:39.370> but<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.060> did

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
really hold them that easily but I did

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.270 
really hold them that easily but I did
manage<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.750> get<00:02:40.900> him<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.170> hold<00:02:41.350> them<00:02:41.500> somewhat

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
manage to get him to hold them somewhat

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.550 
manage to get him to hold them somewhat
decently<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:43.750> very<00:02:43.989> hard<00:02:44.230> for<00:02:44.320> him<00:02:44.530> to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
decently but it is very hard for him to

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.760 
decently but it is very hard for him to
get<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.890> stick<00:02:45.160> stay<00:02:45.790> like<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.770> another

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
get the stick stay like that another

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.500

problem<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.340> elites<00:02:48.580> is<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:49.060> they<00:02:49.239> have

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
problem of the elites is that they have

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.810 
problem of the elites is that they have
a<00:02:49.930> hard<00:02:50.410> time<00:02:50.650> standing<00:02:51.190> up<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.520> this<00:02:51.640> guy

a hard time standing up and this guy
took<00:02:51.880> me<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.209> while<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.420> final<00:02:52.930> again<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.290> stand

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
took me a while to final again to stand

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.040
