you<00:03:58.480> could<00:03:58.690> also<00:03:58.810> block<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.410> back<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.700> law

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
you could also block it back and the law

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.020 
you could also block it back and the law
doesn't<00:04:01.270> work<00:04:01.420> perfectly<00:04:02.110> but<00:04:03.099> it<00:04:03.819> is

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
doesn't work perfectly but it is

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.000 
doesn't work perfectly but it is
supposed<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.720> be<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.959> locking<00:04:05.349> mechanism<00:04:05.380> at

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
supposed to be a locking mechanism at

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.000 
supposed to be a locking mechanism at
least<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:07.239> this<00:04:07.420> is<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:07.690> other<00:04:07.840> side<00:04:08.010> both

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
least and this is the other side both

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.059 
least and this is the other side both
doors<00:04:09.340> are<00:04:09.610> supposed<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.120> open<00:04:10.450> up<00:04:10.890> there<00:04:11.890> is<00:04:12.040> a

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
doors are supposed to open up there is a

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.890 
doors are supposed to open up there is a
little<00:04:12.610> satellite<00:04:13.120> looking<00:04:13.300> piece<00:04:13.690> right

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
little satellite looking piece right

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.449 
little satellite looking piece right
here<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.170> kind<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:14.590> gets<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.890> way<00:04:15.130> on

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
here that kind of gets in the way on

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.990 
here that kind of gets in the way on
this<00:04:15.730> side<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.739> they'll<00:04:18.340> open<00:04:18.730> it<00:04:18.910> just

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
this side so they'll open it just

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.080 
this side so they'll open it just
doesn't<00:04:19.450> stay<00:04:19.840> up<00:04:20.079> very<00:04:20.470> well<00:04:20.560> but<00:04:21.010> other<00:04:21.940> than

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
doesn't stay up very well but other than

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.870 
doesn't stay up very well but other than
that<00:04:22.150> kind<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.810> cool

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
that kind of cool

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.990 
that kind of cool
also<00:04:25.260> don't<00:04:26.260> notice<00:04:26.560> these<00:04:26.740> pieces<00:04:27.070> at<00:04:27.910> the

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
also don't notice these pieces at the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.540 
also don't notice these pieces at the
bottom<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.780> looks<00:04:28.960> like<00:04:29.200> rocket<00:04:29.800> boosters<00:04:30.250> you

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
bottom it looks like rocket boosters you

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.440 
bottom it looks like rocket boosters you
look<00:04:30.729> at<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.630> bottom<00:04:31.930> part<00:04:32.139> of<00:04:32.290> them<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:33.450> they

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
look at the bottom part of them and they

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.960 
look at the bottom part of them and they
there<00:04:34.990> are<00:04:35.020> two<00:04:35.380> on<00:04:35.530> each<00:04:35.740> side<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.370> they<00:04:36.820> all

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
there are two on each side and they all

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.390 
there are two on each side and they all
move<00:04:37.360> together<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:38.410> can<00:04:38.620> control<00:04:39.070> them

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
move together you can control them

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.120 
move together you can control them
by<00:04:39.520> this<00:04:39.580> one<00:04:39.850> piece<00:04:40.090> here<00:04:40.680> now<00:04:41.680> you<00:04:41.800> just<00:04:41.950> turn

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
by this one piece here now you just turn

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.190 
by this one piece here now you just turn
it<00:04:42.250> like<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:43.450> see<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:43.690> back<00:04:43.870> to

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
it like that and you see the back to

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.100 
it like that and you see the back to
each<00:04:44.800> half<00:04:45.100> a<00:04:45.340> sticker<00:04:45.729> on<00:04:45.910> them<00:04:46.030> danger<00:04:46.690> jet

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
each half a sticker on them danger jet

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.240 
each half a sticker on them danger jet
exhaust<00:04:48.450> so<00:04:49.450> I<00:04:49.690> like<00:04:50.169> that<00:04:50.440> all<00:04:50.680> four<00:04:51.010> of<00:04:51.040> them

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
exhaust so I like that all four of them

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.250 
exhaust so I like that all four of them
work<00:04:51.430> together<00:04:51.639> like<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.540> think<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.169> is

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
work together like that I think that is

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.469 
work together like that I think that is
very<00:04:53.320> cool<00:04:54.150> also<00:04:55.290> on<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.440> back<00:04:56.620> end<00:04:56.919> here<00:04:57.479> set

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
very cool also on the back end here set

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:05.370 
very cool also on the back end here set
this<00:04:58.630> down<00:04:58.840> for<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.169> second

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.920 

if<00:05:05.890> you<00:05:06.010> open<00:05:06.370> up<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.610> back<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:07.720> can<00:05:07.900> just

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
if you open up the back and you can just

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.170 
if you open up the back and you can just
open<00:05:08.230> it<00:05:08.440> like<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.730> you<00:05:09.730> can<00:05:09.850> see<00:05:10.000> there's

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
open it like that you can see there's

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.510 
open it like that you can see there's
kind<00:05:10.330> of<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.570> gentle<00:05:10.930> cell<00:05:11.260> and<00:05:11.620> inside<00:05:11.860> here

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
kind of a gentle cell and inside here

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.990 
kind of a gentle cell and inside here
and<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:14.620> can<00:05:14.740> actually<00:05:14.890> pull<00:05:15.310> this<00:05:15.520> totally

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
and you can actually pull this totally

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.360 
and you can actually pull this totally
out

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
out

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.730 
out
there's<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:19.210> walls<00:05:19.480> of<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.140> that's<00:05:20.530> the

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
there's the walls of it and that's the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.010 
there's the walls of it and that's the
door<00:05:21.070> you<00:05:21.850> know<00:05:22.210> up<00:05:22.330> like<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.690> and

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
there's Johnny Thunder inside of course

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.810 
there's Johnny Thunder inside of course
you<00:05:25.600> can<00:05:25.780> change<00:05:26.200> out<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.410> minifigures<00:05:27.100> there

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
you can change out the minifigures there

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.150 
you can change out the minifigures there
is<00:05:27.940> plenty<00:05:28.330> of<00:05:28.360> room<00:05:28.600> for<00:05:28.660> a<00:05:29.260> regular-sized

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
is plenty of room for a regular-sized

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.230 
is plenty of room for a regular-sized
figure<00:05:30.610> inside<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.990> there's<00:05:32.170> the<00:05:32.290> roof<00:05:32.470> of<00:05:32.650> it

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
figure inside and there's the roof of it

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.570 
figure inside and there's the roof of it
and<00:05:34.240> it<00:05:34.480> just<00:05:34.510> fits<00:05:34.900> right<00:05:35.020> inside<00:05:35.320> here<00:05:35.560> is<00:05:36.010> a

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
and it just fits right inside here is a

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.770 
and it just fits right inside here is a
tight<00:05:36.850> fit<00:05:36.880> but<00:05:37.510> it<00:05:37.810> does<00:05:38.050> fit<00:05:38.350> right<00:05:38.860> in<00:05:38.980> there

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
tight fit but it does fit right in there

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.420 
tight fit but it does fit right in there
and<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:42.259> think<00:05:42.560> this<00:05:42.680> is<00:05:42.800> actually<00:05:42.949> pretty<00:05:43.340> cool

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
and I think this is actually pretty cool

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.320 
and I think this is actually pretty cool
we<00:05:44.180> also<00:05:44.389> have<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:45.770> newer<00:05:46.150> spring-loaded

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
we also have the newer spring-loaded

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.050 
we also have the newer spring-loaded
flick<00:05:47.750> fire<00:05:47.960> missile<00:05:48.379> right<00:05:48.770> here<00:05:49.069> in<00:05:49.940> the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
flick fire missile right here in the

back<00:05:50.270> one<00:05:50.599> on<00:05:50.629> each<00:05:50.930> side

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.240 

fire<00:05:55.520> very<00:05:55.910> well<00:05:56.210> you<00:05:56.840> just<00:05:57.080> push<00:05:57.320> them<00:05:57.560> since

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
fire very well you just push them since

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.860 
fire very well you just push them since
they're<00:05:58.430> turned<00:05:58.700> sideways<00:05:59.150> you<00:05:59.450> just<00:05:59.630> push

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
they're turned sideways you just push

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.500 
they're turned sideways you just push
them<00:06:00.080> towards<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:00.770> middle<00:06:01.520> of<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.730> ship<00:06:01.970> and

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
them towards the middle of the ship and

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.320 
them towards the middle of the ship and
that's<00:06:03.110> how<00:06:03.350> they<00:06:03.500> fire<00:06:03.830> and<00:06:04.250> they're<00:06:04.850> very

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
that's how they fire and they're very

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.900 
that's how they fire and they're very
easy<00:06:05.570> to<00:06:05.750> load<00:06:05.960> back<00:06:06.260> but<00:06:07.100> all<00:06:07.340> in<00:06:07.460> all<00:06:07.550> I<00:06:07.610> have

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
easy to load back but all in all I have

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.629 
easy to load back but all in all I have
to<00:06:08.030> say<00:06:08.060> I<00:06:08.510> think<00:06:08.960> this<00:06:09.260> is<00:06:09.440> a<00:06:09.470> pretty<00:06:10.040> cool<00:06:10.310> set

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
to say I think this is a pretty cool set
