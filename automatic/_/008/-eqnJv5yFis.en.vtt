about maybe taking all these off and
wearing<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> watch<00:00:41.940> because<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.450> kind<00:00:42.750> of

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
wearing a watch because it is kind of

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.060 
wearing a watch because it is kind of
annoying<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.260> I'm<00:00:43.379> wearing<00:00:43.530> other

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
see the time but for some people they do

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.529
