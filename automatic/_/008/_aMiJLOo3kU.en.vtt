00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.959 
I've noticed
bull<00:02:10.799> throwing<00:02:11.099> him<00:02:11.219> and<00:02:11.370> then<00:02:11.459> throwing<00:02:11.879> them

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:11.969 
bull throwing him and then throwing them

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.440 
bull throwing him and then throwing them
into<00:02:12.269> their<00:02:12.799> programs<00:02:13.799> and<00:02:14.159> so<00:02:14.879> I've<00:02:15.269> been

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
into their programs and so I've been

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.660 
into their programs and so I've been
given<00:02:15.930> these<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.079> shot<00:02:16.439> and<00:02:16.829> i<00:02:17.069> really<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.519> it

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
given these a shot and i really like it

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.449 
given these a shot and i really like it
was<00:02:17.790> young<00:02:18.000> get<00:02:18.150> any<00:02:18.650> momentum<00:02:19.650> out<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
was young get any momentum out of the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.000 
was young get any momentum out of the
hole<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.390> definitely<00:02:21.569> makes<00:02:22.079> no<00:02:22.709> this<00:02:22.890> is

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
hole so it definitely makes no this is

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.089 
hole so it definitely makes no this is
only<00:02:23.159> like<00:02:23.400> 275<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:25.620> get<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.799> hell<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:25.980> a

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
only like 275 but you get a hell of a

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.209 
only like 275 but you get a hell of a
lot<00:02:26.219> more<00:02:26.280> at<00:02:26.579> 275<00:02:27.120> than<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.659> normally<00:02:27.810> would

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
lot more at 275 than you normally would

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.009 
lot more at 275 than you normally would
just<00:02:29.219> bouncing<00:02:29.609> bouncing<00:02:30.510> back<00:02:30.689> up<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:30.989> of

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
just bouncing bouncing back up out of

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.459 
just bouncing bouncing back up out of
the<00:02:31.170> hole<00:02:31.639> so<00:02:32.639> after<00:02:32.790> these<00:02:33.090> squats<00:02:33.450> we<00:02:34.170> moved

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
the hole so after these squats we moved

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:39.500 
the hole so after these squats we moved
on<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:35.219> a<00:02:35.659> I<00:02:36.680> personally<00:02:37.680> did<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.219> cuz<00:02:39.209> i'm<00:02:39.329> more
