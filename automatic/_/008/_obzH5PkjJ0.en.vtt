00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
should be available a USB OTG let's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.350 
should be available a USB OTG let's
check<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.360> supported<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.909> I<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.030> see

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
check if it's supported and I do see

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.789 
check if it's supported and I do see
that<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.600> has<00:01:54.630> been<00:01:54.899> detected<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.560> spin

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
that it has been detected and spin

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.920
