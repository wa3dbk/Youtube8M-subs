screwdriver<00:01:33.210> doesn't<00:01:33.719> fit<00:01:33.899> properly<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
screwdriver doesn't fit properly in the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.850 
screwdriver doesn't fit properly in the
gap<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.340> too<00:01:35.490> big<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> yeah<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.409> push<00:01:37.649> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
gap it's too big so yeah you can push it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.429 
gap it's too big so yeah you can push it
but<00:01:38.039> it's<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.280> gonna<00:01:38.399> work<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.229> best

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
but it's not gonna work this is the best

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.249 
but it's not gonna work this is the best
one<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.490> located<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.420> your

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
one and this is the one located in your

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.090 
one and this is the one located in your
trunk<00:01:43.619> tools<00:01:44.390> why<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.079> fits<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.799> in

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
trunk tools why because it fits right in

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.510 
trunk tools why because it fits right in
the<00:01:47.460> gap<00:01:47.609> see<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.479> fits<00:01:48.859> perfectly<00:01:49.859> fine<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the gap see it fits perfectly fine and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.789 
the gap see it fits perfectly fine and
the<00:01:51.000> reason<00:01:51.299> why<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:52.020> want<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.289> do<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.590> is

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the reason why you want to do that is

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.399 
the reason why you want to do that is
what<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.969> go<00:01:54.119> ahead<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.630> stick

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
what you do is you go ahead and stick

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.289 
what you do is you go ahead and stick
the<00:01:55.590> screwdriver<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.509> push<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.869> up

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
the screwdriver there and you push it up

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.179 
the screwdriver there and you push it up
just<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.679> it's<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:01.859> to<00:02:01.950> happen

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
just like this so it's going to happen

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.240 
just like this so it's going to happen
is<00:02:02.310> once<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.609> push<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:03.859> again<00:02:04.859> I'm<00:02:04.979> doing

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
is once you push it up again I'm doing

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.520 
is once you push it up again I'm doing
with<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.640> hand

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
with one hand

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.840 
with one hand
ok<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.590> pretend<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.460> here<00:02:08.490> you're

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
ok so pretend this is up here you're
