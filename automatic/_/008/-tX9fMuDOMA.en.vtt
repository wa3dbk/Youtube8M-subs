around the edges out sort of get rid of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.980 
around the edges out sort of get rid of
that<00:02:38.230> really<00:02:39.230> square<00:02:39.590> cut<00:02:39.860> off<00:02:40.390> make<00:02:41.390> things<00:02:41.660> a

enough<00:04:30.669> length<00:04:31.060> there<00:04:31.360> so<00:04:31.930> i<00:04:31.990> go<00:04:32.139> about<00:04:32.260> one

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
enough length there so i go about one

fishing in it you're going to be fishing
heavier<00:05:55.169> water<00:05:55.440> obviously<00:05:55.680> you<00:05:56.039> can<00:05:56.160> put<00:05:56.310> some

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
heavier water obviously you can put some

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.370 
heavier water obviously you can put some

to<00:05:58.440> be<00:05:58.500> fishing<00:05:58.830> some<00:05:59.009> slower<00:05:59.669> water<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.120> you

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
to be fishing some slower water and you

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.850 
to be fishing some slower water and you
want<00:06:00.360> to<00:06:00.419> sparse<00:06:00.720> or<00:06:00.870> profile<00:06:01.319> to<00:06:01.560> the<00:06:01.650> fly

want to sparse or profile to the fly

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.939 
want to sparse or profile to the fly
just<00:06:02.580> make<00:06:02.789> a<00:06:02.819> few<00:06:03.060> less<00:06:03.240> wraps<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:04.710> I<00:06:04.770> get<00:06:04.919> that

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
just make a few less wraps so I get that

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.430 
just make a few less wraps so I get that
back<00:06:05.280> down<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.699> the<00:06:05.789> base<00:06:05.970> trim<00:06:06.900> my<00:06:07.050> waist<00:06:07.229> and

back down to the base trim my waist and

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.909 
back down to the base trim my waist and
out<00:06:08.900> take<00:06:09.900> just<00:06:10.169> a<00:06:10.319> touch<00:06:10.590> more<00:06:11.030> superfine

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
out take just a touch more superfine
