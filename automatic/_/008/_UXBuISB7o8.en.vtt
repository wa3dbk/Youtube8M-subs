it's<00:00:10.230> very<00:00:10.590> important<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.730> have<00:00:12.059> tools<00:00:12.450> that

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
it's very important to have tools that

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.730 
it's very important to have tools that
can<00:00:12.990> maintain<00:00:13.290> our<00:00:14.480> after<00:00:15.480> our<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.080> our<00:00:16.379> swim

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
team if they lose time in the water

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.560 
team if they lose time in the water
it's<00:00:19.680> very<00:00:20.160> detrimental<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:21.060> their<00:00:21.300> training

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
it's very detrimental to their training

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.349 
it's very detrimental to their training
so<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.949> benefits<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
so one of the benefits is that with the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.300 
so one of the benefits is that with the
mirtha<00:00:24.660> pool<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.439> not<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.010> drain<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
mirtha pool we do not have to drain the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.750 
mirtha pool we do not have to drain the
pool<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:27.180> repaint<00:00:27.900> resurface<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.580> just

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
pool to repaint resurface we can just

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.930 
pool to repaint resurface we can just
continue<00:00:30.269> through<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.940> sustainability

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
continue through so the sustainability

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.350 
continue through so the sustainability
of<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.120> pool<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:34.040> right<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.219> top<00:00:35.460> it's

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
of that pool is right on top it's

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
of that pool is right on top it's
fascinating<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> way<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.649> put<00:00:37.800> together

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
fascinating the way it's put together

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.450 
fascinating the way it's put together
the<00:00:38.399> old<00:00:38.640> dinosaur<00:00:39.450> model<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.800> filled<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the old dinosaur model of you filled a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.040 
the old dinosaur model of you filled a
hole<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.879> ground<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.450> put<00:00:42.600> Mars<00:00:42.809> side

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
hole in the ground and you put Mars side

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.270 
hole in the ground and you put Mars side
that<00:00:43.469> really<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.340> dinosaur<00:00:45.090> approach<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
that really is a dinosaur approach and

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.440 
that really is a dinosaur approach and
Bertha's<00:00:47.280> technology<00:00:47.969> has<00:00:48.180> just

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
Bertha's technology has just

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
Bertha's technology has just
revolutionized<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.170> entire<00:00:49.289> pool<00:00:49.680> space<00:00:50.030> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
revolutionized the entire pool space the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.939 
revolutionized the entire pool space the
benefit<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> mirtha<00:00:51.930> pool<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
benefit of the mirtha pool that I see is

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.529 
benefit of the mirtha pool that I see is
that<00:00:53.010> you've<00:00:53.309> got<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> company<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.149> Italy

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that you've got a company in Italy

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.090 
that you've got a company in Italy
that's<00:00:54.690> focused<00:00:55.320> solely<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.449> building<00:00:57.449> pools

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
that's focused solely on building pools

met Kevin McGrath and Trevor Tiffany and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.210 
met Kevin McGrath and Trevor Tiffany and
and<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.110> had<00:01:16.229> been<00:01:16.680> traveling<00:01:17.130> in

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and actually I had been traveling in

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.100 
and actually I had been traveling in
Europe<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.670> happened<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> come<00:01:18.540> across<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
Europe and happened to come across the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.620 
Europe and happened to come across the
river<00:01:19.409> pool<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.970> very<00:01:21.150> impressive

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
river pool and and was very impressive

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.170 
river pool and and was very impressive
with<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> quality<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.970> durability

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
with with the quality and the durability

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.710 
with with the quality and the durability
and<00:01:24.840> ultimately<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.100> intrigued<00:01:26.970> by<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.330> pool

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
and ultimately I was intrigued by a pool

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.590 
and ultimately I was intrigued by a pool
that<00:01:27.780> looked<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.409> well<00:01:28.979> after<00:01:29.340> 20<00:01:29.640> years<00:01:29.850> I've

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
