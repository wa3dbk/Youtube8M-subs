00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.250
 against an opponent who has a minor 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.740

 duels must be compulsorily in 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.500
 the campaign mode for wilczek and when 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.629

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.390
 because at the end of a duel either 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.060
 losing or winning because your 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.010

 spaces that promotion you will notice 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.920
 because the side of the letter comes out 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.720
 stars that mean the range as 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.479
 realize if my monster has 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.720

 best way to promote your monster

 it's like this first you must go to houston well

 You put the letter you want me to do 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.930
 example a king the king of ghosts you should 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.550
 edit the macba and put it completely 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.069
 in favor of the monster as in this case 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.930
 it would be everything and to me then weapons a deck 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.180
 that contains of leads the pumpkin and 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.950
 three pumpkins in the deck you fill it with 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.769
 equipment for your pumpkin and you put three 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.230
 monsters rebounds 3 or dark taunts and 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.600
 Three puree zulos the rest of the cards 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.550
 that you want in the duel you must kill with 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.150
 the pumpkin most of the monsters 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.190
 of the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.170
 then you kill two pumpkins of him and the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.269
 you receive with your reborn monsters of 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.580
 so that five more pumpkins of 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.230
 leader in your field then just done or 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.150
 the deck of opponents and the most 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.330
 difficult you must wait for them to finish 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.400
 the 99 turns eye you should have more lp than 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.280
 the opponent to win the 99 turns 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.050
 you will have won in 99 turns and your card 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.150
 will rise if you insist everything 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.400
 but in the higher ranges usually 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.650
 be two or three duels of these and 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.480
 something important what mockery courage serves 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.130
 to be killed three times and your 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.930
 monsters win a thousand points 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.030
 You must have at least four 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.960
 pumpkins and remember to use your power to 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.900
 do not lose in the 99 turns roulette and joey 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.060
 Ready phrases like some will know and others 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.700
 not in this yoyo game when you win a 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.130
 duel do not give you points or start chips 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.380
 not a letter like in fm nor anything of 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.390
 stars or something weird but an idea 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.340
 very original in my opinion is that it comes out 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.470
 a roulette is not like the one in the casinos 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.810
 in this roulette will come the cards that you 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.180
 you have sent to the cemetery with certain 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.550
 exceptions and you can get it in three 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.590
 attempts that is the roulette is composed 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.420
 by three stripes in each of those 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.280
 fringes can draw a letter in the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.980
 means this is if your leader does not have 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.740
 ability to win the other dates if 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.620
 you take for example a ski dragon a king 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.500
 it's black dragon and a Danish paralyzer 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.720
 3 if you get two equal and one unequal 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.000
 give two cards if you draw three cards 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.560
 they give you a letter apart from that 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.270
 only you got if that 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.130
 can be very useful now as we 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.200
 I explained most of the letters that were 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.870
 kill appear in roulette but there 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.270
 exceptions of three cases first case 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.370
 there are lots of letters of all kinds that 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.290
 you only earn by drawing three in the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.900
 roulette so if you kill them 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.720
 will appear example weyes with the dragon 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.060
 second case there are many letters that you kill 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.950
 let's give the example of the leg of 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.960
 exor and that letter will not come out in the 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.160
 roulette but neither will they give it to you if 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.860
 you take three in a row 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.260
 only reincarnating third case there 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.970
 many letters for example king of you that 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.460
 although the mates will not come out in roulette 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.830
 neither if you get three in a row 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.870
 who will give it but taking it three times 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.000
 thunder nyan and before the will give is 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.479
 say that to win letters sometimes makes 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.310
 missing three specific monsters 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.320
 here the list of those monsters that 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.380
 taking out the three times are always the 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.940
