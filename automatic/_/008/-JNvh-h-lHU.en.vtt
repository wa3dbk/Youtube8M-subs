00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.400
 Welcome to the tutorial length 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.500
 in this second part it goes on a chair 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.660
 that is when you start to live 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.660
 you want to ask a top and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.790
 he needs a documentary it was 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.770
 namely first played and put 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.370
 Unfortunately , I realize that I have no free games 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.940
 I have to give the school at least 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.340
 ask and first makes the thread 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.270
 down something like that happens more often 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 you are more and just all traces 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.450
 are set 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.760
 so you should also watch that one 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.619
 not too much of colors on spraying 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.560
 should just drive up so much 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.090
 coils as the project and for its 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.909
 is about necessary 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.159
 how much behavior is necessary the man 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.679
 can say roughly for a straight 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.079
 after renting if so now 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:24.450
 then you want to take a piece of business 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:25.979
 the duplicate documents so what 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.799
 i the relationship i believe here 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.359
 Cover high from the sewing machine 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.109
 because here is the area where the flag 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:36.359
 the spraying happens and I do 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.609
 the machine to what also in the first 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.819
 some have not shown it all yet 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.360
 days the needle moves with her 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.490
 what you can see here again is 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.270
 Do not take this pen for a slip 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.870
 then he also moves up and down 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.330
 down the top pen I need to 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.730
 on a chair the na'vi do not need now 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.930
 So turn off with a small one 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.810
 trick on the handball 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.870
 that means the piece that I am inside 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.420
 and hold it almost externally 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.670
 turned off when I command the craft 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.610
 or on pedal go I'll just 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.650
 this city â€‹â€‹up here i spool 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.930
 I had his metal coil 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.980
 The plastic chairs would have been chosen 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.570
 same function 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.500
 Here it is nicely recognizable in the 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.390
 Metal coil this rectangular 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.850
 recess and that it meant for that 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.430
 that I have the front where this saved 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.320
 pin out the coil looks good on it 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.110
 can put it and then it is here 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.489
 So this is the rectangular one 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.670
 opening exactly on the black pen 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.590
 put on it so before it's time 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.360
 do the following now I take in the piece 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.020
 from the thread and wind that ever 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:52.930
 manually on the first circumnavigation in 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:55.060
 I do the school by hand 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.070
 can trick again and the thread 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.640
 at the end of this hole for example 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.220
 pull out if someone wants that well 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.600
 I leave now even stay and what 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.489
 I need to know now is in which 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.070
 direction is then played then 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.670
 right over will fit with me left 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.930
 that would be exactly what I would do 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.750
 have to watch that I over the right 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.940
 now turns a moving handwheel 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:27.330
 and she okay that goes right over 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:31.150
 wonderful a rectangle that it on it 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:37.060
 Put that all in here 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.880
 Outside, this game moves 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.070
 this chair on winder just not so 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.400
 and it goes on I just have the 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.660
 thread here 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.079
 You should note that there are 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.450
 notches sometimes here on the edge 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.819
 he thought that we were the thread 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.069
 leaves later 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.650
 Here you can already put the thread in 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.439
 lead and find the rides in the beginning he 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.719
 quickly again the next time that if 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.189
 you have to go in to the right because 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.409
 if the driver is handled quickly 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:10.280
 then it can get stuck there 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.599
 and yes it does not make it so much fun 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.760
 One thing is still to be considered too 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.440
 do not train the colors directly from 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.090
 threading on the track 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.400
 you should thread her somewhere 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.889
 Put it in between I do here 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.900
 with this metal solve here in front 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.750
 I do not care which club 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.930
 opening only once simplistic go again 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.490
 It's just about that out 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.849
 the thread is not directly on the games 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.729
 going 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:39.449
 that's what the whole thing looks like now 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:42.360
 I only have one stopper here 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.620
 Somewhere here , too , sits down with me 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.419
 I can not break the thread 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:53.789
 then go to the pedal and start now 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:56.360
 I am the whole and finished under it 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.360
 guess
