00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
have any existing hardware in them

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.700 
have any existing hardware in them
there's<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.659> good<00:01:15.080> chance<00:01:15.350> that<00:01:15.440> you're<00:01:15.590> going

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
there's a good chance that you're going

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.289 
there's a good chance that you're going
to<00:01:15.740> have<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.250> lot<00:01:16.610> of<00:01:16.640> road<00:01:16.909> grime<00:01:17.090> and

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
to have a lot of road grime and

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.850 
to have a lot of road grime and
corrosion<00:01:17.360> built<00:01:17.750> up<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.290> weld<00:01:18.320> nuts<00:01:18.680> so

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
corrosion built up in the weld nuts so

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.899 
corrosion built up in the weld nuts so
it's<00:01:18.979> a<00:01:19.009> good<00:01:19.130> idea<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.490> go<00:01:19.549> ahead<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.790> clean

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
it's a good idea to go ahead and clean

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.300 
it's a good idea to go ahead and clean
them<00:01:20.030> out<00:01:20.150> using<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:21.080> spray<00:01:21.619> lubricant<00:01:22.070> like

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
them out using a spray lubricant like

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.410 
them out using a spray lubricant like
wd-40<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:24.259> wire<00:01:24.409> brush<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.119> reason

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
wd-40 and a wire brush and the reason

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.790 
wd-40 and a wire brush and the reason
for<00:01:26.450> this<00:01:26.659> is<00:01:26.810> because<00:01:26.930> these<00:01:27.229> weld<00:01:27.470> nuts<00:01:27.649> were

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
for this is because these weld nuts were

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.510 
for this is because these weld nuts were
exposed<00:01:28.369> to<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.580> elements<00:01:28.690> over<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.960> years

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
exposed to the elements over the years
