00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello everyone and everyone welcome to a 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.879
 new road video with a liu today 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.770
 I'm here to tell you about what 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.080
 cosmetics we should invest all 20 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.150
 facial care cosmetics we can 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.370
 save us a little bit of money and that's 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.680
 often or very often 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.109
 people ask me if it compensates or if 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.170
 it's worth spending a lot of money 100 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.170
 euros 200 500 euros in a treatment 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.970
 good the answer is depends 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.340
 logically depends on the needs or 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.810
 of what worries us about our skin and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.850
 logically it also depends on the level 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 purchasing or what we value 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.430
 our facial or pleasure routine 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.260
 sensorial that that produces us in first 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.450
 place what we should do is a list 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.300
 with the concerns we have of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.920
 our skin for example in my case os 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.200
 I will explain my case because I am sure that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.600
 some feels identified my skin 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.539
 is mixed my skin has a lot to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.850
 dehydrate my skin has a lot 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.280
 tendency to produce imperfections 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.980
 I'm also worried about the first lines 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.559
 of expression and I have the eye contour 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.100
 the area around the eyes 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.650
 excessively dry 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.360
 so these would be my concerns 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.880
 each person logically has his list 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.409
 of concerns everyone has their 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.720
 preferences to the best to me 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.240
 are more concerned about imperfections and other 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.649
 person cares much more about 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.860
 pigmentation changes of your skin 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.570
 etcetera each person has to elaborate 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 your own list with your own 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.130
 worries once we have that 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.229
 list with the concerns we have 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.330
 about our skin what we have to 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.909
 to do is to think what kind of what kind of 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.700
 cosmetics we like to use or what type 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.280
 cosmetics we are interested or not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.590
 more comfortable for example if we have 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.509
 tendency to imperfections 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.850
 we will need a good cleaner maybe 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.649
 we want to invest in a cleaner that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.200
 be very sensory because we like it 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.270
 perform a relaxing massage or such 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.580
 Once we want a cleaner to clean us 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.090
 the skin quickly that eliminates 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.280
 the dirt and all those residues of 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.440
 the skin to move to the next step 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.990
 maybe you want a moisturizer that 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.299
 be nutritious that it takes a long time to absorb or 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.080
 you prefer a light fluid that is absorbed 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.850
 quickly 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.460
 or maybe you do not want any kind of 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.830
 cream and you prefer to use zeros and 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.440
 oils every preference is a world and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.270
 each person has their demands and their 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.220
 needs therefore I 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.960
 recommend you do because good one 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.270
 little reflection on what kind of 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.490
 cosmetics we like the next step 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.810
 would be to approach the establishment in 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.730
 which we usually buy our 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.280
 cosmetics you can go to a perfume shop 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.500
 you can go to the English court ' you can go to 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.540
 the body shop to single-brand stores you can 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.440
 go to kills you can also go to a 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.930
 pharmacy is to say the list is immense 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.610
 You can even buy online if 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.709
 you go to some establishment and I 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.230
 I advise you to explain it very 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.120
 clearly and very precisely 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.280
 needs and preferences to the person 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.010
 that is taking care of you since that 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.900
 way you are going to avoid so good that the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.490
 another person better you try to sell 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.950
 products that you do not need or do not need 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.870
 you are going to use and in addition you are going to help 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.459
 to that person who is working to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.450
 take out the products needed to 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.280
 your skin 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.870
 Now I am going to comment on a reflection and 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.130
 is that the steps of our routine 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.350
 facial are concatenated 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.990
 we are not interested in investing so much 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.000
 money in a serum but we will perform 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.000
 a correct exfoliation and cleaning 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.770
 very thoroughly we need to have a good 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.170
 cleaner and a good exfoliant so that 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.480
 our being fulfills its function is to say 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.490
 if we spend a hundred euros on a zero 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.470
 I advise you to clean yourself very well 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.330
 skin and use some kind of 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.280
 exfoliants before using that zero 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.350
 since that way you are taking him 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.850
 the maximum possible juice the next 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.170
 advice that I will give you is that you 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.900
 you take your time at the time of 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.580
 perform our facial routine I know that 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.590
 many days we do not have time and we go 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.050
 as crazy and we apply the 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.940
 cosmetics as fast as possible and that 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.650
 is the usual but yes there are days that 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.420
 we have a little more time or such 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.700
 once in the night when we can 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.210
 perform a massage we can apply 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.490
 our serum calmly breathe 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.100
 the aromas of our cosmetics if it is 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.720
 that have aromas and are sensory and 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.090
 that way we will be taking a 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.860
 little bit more than a match and I advise you 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.860
 that if you do not have the habit of making a 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.489
 facial routine with different steps would be 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.979
 all right 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.800
 in quotation marks that you start making it 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.389
 on the TV in front of me before 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.160
 I did not even unsheathe before 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.039
 lay down was very good disaster before 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.380
 when I was a teenager and so on 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:35.020
 What I did was take the products 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.990
 cleaning the TV to the living room and I 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.610
 I was wearing my make-up remover 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.229
 cleaner and it did was make me 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.960
 cleaning while watching TV that 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.330
 way I did not have to be in the bathroom 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.830
 I locked myself up and it was not so boring 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.110
 It was not such a boring routine I 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.580
 I recommend that you start like this and that 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.770
 way you are going to go taking the gustillo 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.930
 to your routine and the last advice is 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.669
 that you use your cosmetics if we 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.150
 we are spending 70 euros on a 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.639
 cleaner or 200 euros in a cream or 500 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.069
 euros in a zero I advise you that the 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.560
 you use them with the 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:11.110
 often that you need maybe a 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.419
 once a day or once a week or three 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.880
 times a week but I advise you 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.590
 you give him use because if they do not go at the end 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.210
 to spoil and we have not 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.400
 used and it's a shame to throw a 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.259
 cosmetic that we have not used and 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.820
 especially when you go shopping 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.160
 those cosmetics 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.840
 the best be a little more luxurious than 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.880
 go with the idea of trying them out 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.680
 know the cosmetic that you see and 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.740
 you really like it and if you really 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.330
 you want that kind of cosmetics because 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.460
 many times we end up buying things 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.700
 which then is that we do not even need 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.140
 we use or do not even like them and 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.910
 until this advice video the 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.580
 true that most are meaningless 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.410
 but I hope it helps you and I 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.480
 help a little bit to think before 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.670
 buy since many times we go as 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.130
 crazy if we want to buy everything and 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.960
 I think it's worth reflecting 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.060
 to use the best cosmetics that 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.740
 go to our skin and that way 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.110
 have a much healthier skin and 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.610
 much prettier you know that you have me 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.230
