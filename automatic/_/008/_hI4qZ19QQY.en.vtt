00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
we have access to the fan and we'll

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.190 
we have access to the fan and we'll
remove<00:01:12.159> it<00:01:12.310> next<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:13.360> fan<00:01:13.570> is<00:01:13.719> held<00:01:13.930> in<00:01:14.049> place

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.800 
remove it next the fan is held in place
with<00:01:14.320> this<00:01:14.740> nut<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.820> problem<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.390> when<00:01:16.539> we<00:01:16.570> try

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
with this nut the problem is when we try

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.080 
with this nut the problem is when we try
to<00:01:16.869> turn<00:01:17.109> the<00:01:17.259> nut<00:01:17.469> we<00:01:18.159> just<00:01:18.430> turned<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.789> fan

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
to turn the nut we just turned the fan

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.679 
to turn the nut we just turned the fan
and<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:20.049> motor<00:01:20.259> shaft<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.119> remove<00:01:22.420> this

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
and the motor shaft so to remove this

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.480 
and the motor shaft so to remove this
what<00:01:22.930> we'll<00:01:23.049> do<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.409> remove<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:24.100> spark<00:01:24.369> plug

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
what we'll do is remove the spark plug

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.420 
what we'll do is remove the spark plug
and<00:01:24.969> then<00:01:25.390> bind<00:01:25.689> up<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.049> cylinder<00:01:26.439> with<00:01:27.399> a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
and then bind up the cylinder with a

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:49.130 
and then bind up the cylinder with a
short<00:01:27.850> piece<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.210> starter<00:01:28.570> rope

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.360 

and<00:01:50.140> now<00:01:50.290> just<00:01:50.530> thread<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.010> starter<00:01:51.340> rope

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
and now just thread the starter rope

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.140 
and now just thread the starter rope
down<00:01:52.030> into<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.450> cylinder<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.670> Rope<00:01:57.850> just

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
down into the cylinder the Rope just

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.719 
down into the cylinder the Rope just
fills<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.780> space<00:01:59.190> between<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.310> top<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.550> the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
fills the space between the top of the

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.790 
fills the space between the top of the
piston<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.690> top<00:02:01.900> of<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.140> cylinder<00:02:02.470> so

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
piston and the top of the cylinder so

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.620 
piston and the top of the cylinder so
the<00:02:03.220> piston<00:02:03.610> can<00:02:03.729> no<00:02:03.850> longer<00:02:04.060> move<00:02:04.330> up<00:02:04.510> and

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
the piston can no longer move up and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.740 
the piston can no longer move up and
down<00:02:05.250> now<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:06.280> can<00:02:06.520> remove<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:07.000> nut<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
down now I can remove the nut and the

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:28.430 
down now I can remove the nut and the
fan<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:25.420> we<00:02:25.480> can<00:02:25.690> install<00:02:26.110> our<00:02:26.170> new<00:02:26.350> impeller

first I'll place one of the large
washers<00:02:30.970> beneath<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.660> impeller<00:02:32.400> then<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
washers beneath the impeller then the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.199 
washers beneath the impeller then the
impeller<00:02:33.910> back<00:02:34.209> onto<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.690> shaft<00:02:36.090> followed<00:02:37.090> by
