00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.870
 I want to tell you as long as possible 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:22.380
 store paint and so i take here such 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:24.240
 container inspired containers them 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.150
 sell in stores 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:36.260
 strength containers i take such a container 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:40.670
 I take an ordinary napkin now I 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:48.719
 I will remove the excess cut off 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:50.989
 i put this napkin on the bottom now i 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.629
 take the machine 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:08.030
 it is sold in rolls 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:16.799
 Leonardo losing my code pouring some water 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:19.460
 many distributing so that we don't 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.810
 dry up and that, too, some water was fed 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.490
 because thanks to this 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.009
 moisture will be preserved 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.880
 a little water to it was virtually 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.500
 there shouldn't be any 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:46.970
 you no further we put paint here 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.970
 what you need little green 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:05.600
 blue 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:08.930
 and in this state the paint can 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.420
 stored for a very long time but its a must 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.770
 it will be necessary here however closing to 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.770
 there was no air
