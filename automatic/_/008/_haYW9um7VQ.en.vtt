southbound lane now all right which as
you<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.360> see<00:00:31.220> is<00:00:32.220> just<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.790> ideal<00:00:33.860> but<00:00:34.860> it's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
you can see is just not ideal but it's

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
you can see is just not ideal but it's
there<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.059> get<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.420> our<00:00:36.450> house

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.610 

and<00:00:59.520> from<00:01:00.149> my<00:01:00.329> understanding<00:01:00.360> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.440> going

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and from my understanding this is going

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.000 
and from my understanding this is going
to<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> gravel<00:01:02.399> base<00:01:03.260> before<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.800> snow

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to have a gravel base before of the snow

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:14.690 
to have a gravel base before of the snow
flies<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.940> will<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.270> plowed

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.999 

and<00:01:15.689> then<00:01:15.930> eventually<00:01:16.079> we're<00:01:16.649> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.829> hop

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
