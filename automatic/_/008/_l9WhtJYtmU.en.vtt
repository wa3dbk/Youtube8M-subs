00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello I thought I'll do it now 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.240
 maybe another video and that works 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.319
 it's about christmas australia for how 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.120
 probably a few of you know 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.380
 i was not germany last year 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.990
 but of three also about christmas 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.240
 and New Years, and yes but 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.890
 pay attention that is quite different and that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.890
 I'm glad to see something like that 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.210
 And indeed, the temperatures are in 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.109
 australia and germany 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.810
 contrary to this occasion roman 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.590
 We have the winter as winter 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.329
 I was there 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.800
 I had pushed the whole thing there 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.630
 the midsummer only so in january so 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.910
 I have christmas only 28 degrees 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.020
 that is still so in the summer it was then 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.399
 partly over 40 degrees 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.350
 And then of course you have no snow 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.640
 but he is still white for Christmas 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.590
 yes, christmas everywhere white beaches yes 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.600
 Christmas is traditionally like this 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.270
 celebrated as in england so on the 25th 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.710
 and not at 24 and 24 eat many 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.180
 somehow to eat big and that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.549
 not that we do not know so what 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.630
 we ate 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.340
 but it was not now anyway 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.510
 spectacular and grandparents were there 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.430
 so on the father's side 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.220
 maternal was new zealand and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.470
 hawaii so the family is celebrating and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.060
 we drove around in the evening and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.439
 We looked at the houses 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.240
 are decorated 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.180
 It's really that typical 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 American there were houses that were 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.560
 full of lights and was once i was 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.540
 at that time it has its own radio 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.970
 frequency and the lights have become then 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.200
 changed to match the pieces of music 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.909
 and so I do not know if I will 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.600
 if I have a recording then I am 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.600
 that's just a moment 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.400
 Of course that was totally for the kids 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.250
 great the whole colorful lights and the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.800
 We did not want to leave 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.270
 then for the reindeers of center 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.940
 agents etr he comes with his sled 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.620
 approached the animal feed made 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.560
 insist that a few grains clear with 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.550
 yes but that was pretty for the girls 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.700
 great to do that 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.290
 he scattered it on the terrace 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.550
 then , of course, the glass of milk had to 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.390
 center are laid out a few 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.540
 cookie 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.010
 want in the next year the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.970
 children went to sleep sometime because 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.480
 all the presents under the tree 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.030
 placed 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.250
 we had a real tree it is like that 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.040
 what many in neutral plastic trees 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.060
 have or not because there is no 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.430
 not such typical Christmas trees 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.920
 since we know something like that here in arth 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.680
 not remember the name but it is so 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.700
 Similarly, we are building signals 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.800
 just had a real case mine 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.760
 family strictly against is the classic 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.860
 I also like trees 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.530
 then were biscuits and milk 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.320
 eliminated and have my outside 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.330
 still attracted so much attention 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:00.459
 from the sled to be from this 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.550
 cake marks painted on the driveway yes 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.590
 and the next morning just 6 were then 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.570
 so if the kids are just ours 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.850
 undivided are the santa claus 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.770
 It was there for a change that is 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.090
 just the way at 25 tomorrow there 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.180
 since the gift cards thereafter gave only 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:21.310
 Breakfast was made as the scrambled eggs 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.140
 and bacon wiens and then through the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.390
 children play with their gifts and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:30.070
 kind of helped build that up 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.830
 Trio's trio gets a lot of it 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.780
 funny little doll yes and then we have 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.870
 grilled for lunch 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.610
 many so barbecue with meat or 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.760
 seafood are also whole 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.890
 popular and then there was dessert 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.360
 pullover 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.970
 that's a pie arguing that way 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.470
 the New Zealand and the Australian where 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.959
 which takes its origin, it has been announced so 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.120
 a dancer in any case 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.349
 she has her big performances 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.909
 australia and new zealand and 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.489
 Anyone saying the internet is that 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.930
 from New Zealand originally there has one 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.819
 his cake creates it a bit 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.690
 should look like her clothes once 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:12.720
 they are very many fruits and platinum 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:15.400
 There was also I think in the evening on 25 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.549
 so threw her 74 but have eaten 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.889
 just nothing done 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.520
 many go swimming too, because yes 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.110
 true minutes without stop in pullman pool 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.430
 you have to be careful that one on 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.139
 Christmas does not get sunburned 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.669
 that's really funny, yes, too 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.380
 Christmas sodium is totally different than 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.570
 It's still nice here, and I think so 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.880
 if you live there then it is 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.310
 quite normal and is as beautiful as 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.810
 if you were here for me what it would be like 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.789
 It's a bit strange because of it 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.360
 has really been completely different 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.620
 but on the temperature alone but it 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.789
 was nice i hope i have now 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.560
 maybe a few interesting things 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.639
 who could not tell yet 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.680
 maybe you already have over 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.120
 Christmas in the country where you can do that 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.710
 celebrating a very different kind of celebration that could happen 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.550
 times in the comments write is and 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.680
 I am already interested 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.910
 and yes then I wish you a happy one 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.240
 Christmas and yes I think of his 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.240
 Video
