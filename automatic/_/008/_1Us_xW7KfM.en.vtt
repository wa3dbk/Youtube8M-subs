00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:25.300
 What was the basic c face is a dream Oh, I get quite a lot because the base 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:30.189
 It's different from its original shape.

 It's the same. 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:32.410
 A good example, I closed my mouse who dares to Paul gives the word 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:35.890
 Yeah it made up to give the sofa 4 What a fool I ever be able to get my leaf tea

 4 without Kim 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.470
 It'll be great. 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.090
 This is all right now. 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.470
 Much like unto the double eyelid crease will walk cm alternatives from which half the eyes now 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.720
 It's getting bigger. 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:11.570
 It lets do this alone, that I want to eat noodle soup with one another in the spirit of the time 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:17.410
 Why do you think so? 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:22.100
 This reduces example, who is even a little sleep to save a little hurt US sonmogaji 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.340
 Yes. So what is it that you see and specifications are 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:31.220
 Is this really a barrel of buying volume? 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:37.680
 Uh four front give blood Hey Annie What I saw a lot of our China 4 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:41.370
 It is good to hear the sound that puts in the data which is opened by the volume by the pool. 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.090
 It's true that a lot of matte top when I should I stand when it hits anyway 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.920
 What a time it was buried in the hands sweat so perfectly seasoned with garlic this is the first prospective 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.820
 M It takes a long time and you can ride better than glitters. 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.680
 4 That's when you see how things are going. 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.180
 Also there when I spend a lot of speaking sounds open banjil Kim banjil haejusijyo

 There is natural light. 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.580
 Yes, and it will be very pretty even in silver light 7. 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.410
 Seems a little long. 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.900
 I think a little longer scale department rattling You see it so just grab the gimhongsin 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.670
 I do not write so much before the previous pipe. 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:25.860
 I think the scale is 4 or passport control it a little gingeo 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:31.380
 Oh, not even two also went to the old model and what Nikki Six models prior to doing 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:36.630
 I've introduced you to yours, and then you can not do anything else. Thunder Thunderbird 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:41.700
 It's ambiguous. It's too big. And if you come to be you. 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.680
 It's not a jazz bass- style look, but it's very unusual, 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.470
 Little Ako 4 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.160
 So it's good for women 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.850
 I'm not really in the spa. 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.860

 What palram watering because dainty armor is going scaler that has passed without kkail 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:05.780
 You should have a gut . 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:09.170
 Consonants mahogany body and mind and gals, and about the universe and Rose de 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.400
 Sommer combines big SORRY for the language to 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:35.699
 Let's hear it. 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:35.699
 I like it. 

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:33.269
 It sounds like it 's a little tricky . 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:37.499
 I think so. 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:41.729
 It is not such a sound that emphasizes the middle, 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:46.109
 So I really have a presence in the bass 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:51.299
 There is such a sound just to give a sound that the existence feeling that the three-dimensional feeling is done 

00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:52.379
 Those who picked because the grip is a little thick, so I'm very 

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:59.399
 I do not think it fits. 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:06:00.359
 I think the word is going to try it this time came yoge Oh existing Then I 

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:02.689
 I was sold. 

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.689
 We 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:14.870
 Do you come to the store and the store ? It's dark. 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:16.100
 Oh, we can not only is the base and the base Panthers lately Epiphone 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.000

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.280

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:36.170
 I introduced three pairs of pitch black. 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:42.590
 Now let me ask you one parent said Kim c holistic For Word 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:47.840
 What is also common base also formalized a lot of great design in Merced today 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:51.449
 The band is not a jazz bass or anything but a good shape 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.559
 There are many people who are looking for design . 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:59.189
 I think it would be nice to make your own personality more compelling. 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:07:03.419
 Writing a little toad bass hope you bring out the personality of her own 

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:08.360
 4 We introduced this to the base in this way. 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.360
 I will be looking for another product next time. Thank you.
