00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
in the first few lines and then you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.640 
in the first few lines and then you
throw<00:02:11.640> an<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.910> minor<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.450> there<00:02:12.660> which<00:02:13.410> then

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
throw an a minor in there which then

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.280 
throw an a minor in there which then
brings<00:02:13.859> in<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.160> pointer<00:02:14.489> back<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:15.290> two

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
brings in the pointer back here two

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.970 
brings in the pointer back here two
fingers<00:02:16.650> here<00:02:17.269> use<00:02:18.269> that<00:02:18.540> nice<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:19.019> minor<00:02:19.650> sound

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
fingers here use that nice a minor sound

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.229 
fingers here use that nice a minor sound
then<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> C<00:02:21.380> which<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.500> simply<00:02:22.769> like<00:02:22.920> this

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
then a C which is simply like this

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.050 
then a C which is simply like this
hopefully<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.269> can<00:02:24.480> see<00:02:24.720> that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.740 

and<00:02:29.020> back<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.860> G<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.280> D<00:02:30.630> kind<00:02:31.630> of

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
and back to the G and D kind of

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.840 
and back to the G and D kind of
throughout<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.440> you're<00:02:32.800> simply<00:02:33.160> playing<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.550> G

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
throughout so you're simply playing a G

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.650 
throughout so you're simply playing a G
a<00:02:34.150> D<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.950> minor<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.730> see<00:02:37.090> throughout<00:02:37.540> the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
a D and a minor and a see throughout the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.199 
a D and a minor and a see throughout the
whole<00:02:37.810> song<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:39.340> pretty<00:02:39.580> simple<00:02:39.880> hopefully
