t2000 four wheel drive here they are
they're<00:00:19.710> made<00:00:19.920> out<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.189> billet<00:00:20.609> aluminum

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.370 

I'm<00:00:27.769> calling<00:00:28.160> them<00:00:28.250> spoke<00:00:28.669> benders<00:00:29.380> they're

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
not this camera I guess it that good

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.299 
not this camera I guess it that good
can't<00:00:32.870> really<00:00:33.079> read<00:00:33.320> that<00:00:33.500> but<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:33.949> can<00:00:34.100> see

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
can't really read that but you can see

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.869 
can't really read that but you can see
it<00:00:34.489> very<00:00:34.550> clearly<00:00:34.840> here<00:00:35.840> from<00:00:36.500> my<00:00:36.710> end<00:00:36.949> but

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
it very clearly here from my end but

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.910 
it very clearly here from my end but
anyway<00:00:38.210> these<00:00:38.390> are<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.839> front<00:00:39.199> aluminum

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
anyway these are the front aluminum

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.600 
anyway these are the front aluminum
swing<00:00:40.399> arms<00:00:40.910> I<00:00:41.890> didn't<00:00:42.890> see<00:00:43.010> any<00:00:43.190> need<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.430> make

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
swing arms I didn't see any need to make

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.509 
swing arms I didn't see any need to make
the<00:00:43.909> rear<00:00:44.530> because<00:00:45.530> although<00:00:45.829> they're<00:00:46.190> kind

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
the rear because although they're kind

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:47.979 
the rear because although they're kind
of<00:00:46.579> a<00:00:46.670> weaker<00:00:47.180> plastic

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
of a weaker plastic

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.810 
of a weaker plastic
I've<00:00:48.379> never<00:00:48.530> had<00:00:48.710> those<00:00:48.890> break<00:00:49.220> on<00:00:49.430> me<00:00:49.610> and

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
I've never had those break on me and

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.060 
I've never had those break on me and
they've<00:00:50.089> been<00:00:51.079> through<00:00:51.290> quite<00:00:51.409> a<00:00:51.530> bit<00:00:51.769> so<00:00:52.040> I

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
they've been through quite a bit so I

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.689 
they've been through quite a bit so I
think<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.430> rear<00:00:52.640> are<00:00:52.790> okay<00:00:53.170> but<00:00:54.170> these<00:00:54.379> are

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
think the rear are okay but these are

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.329 
think the rear are okay but these are
these<00:00:55.699> are<00:00:55.729> cut<00:00:56.390> out<00:00:56.540> of<00:00:56.719> solid<00:00:57.170> very<00:00:58.070> high

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
these are cut out of solid very high

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.880 
these are cut out of solid very high
quality<00:00:58.869> aircraft<00:00:59.869> aluminum<00:01:00.229> I<00:01:00.589> mean<00:01:00.769> these

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
quality aircraft aluminum I mean these

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.789 
quality aircraft aluminum I mean these
are<00:01:01.129> these<00:01:01.879> are<00:01:01.909> billet<00:01:02.420> machined<00:01:03.320> out<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.650> one

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
are these are billet machined out of one

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.390 
are these are billet machined out of one
piece<00:01:04.150> these<00:01:05.150> are<00:01:05.360> excellent<00:01:05.810> excellent<00:01:06.470> I'd

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
piece these are excellent excellent I'd

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.200 
piece these are excellent excellent I'd
say<00:01:07.759> their<00:01:08.000> lifetime<00:01:10.869> swing<00:01:11.869> arms<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:13.210> mean

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
say their lifetime swing arms I mean

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.300 
say their lifetime swing arms I mean
I've<00:01:14.390> had<00:01:14.570> them<00:01:14.780> on<00:01:14.840> my<00:01:15.009> t2000<00:01:16.009> right<00:01:16.130> now<00:01:16.250> I'm

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
I've had them on my t2000 right now I'm

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.950 
I've had them on my t2000 right now I'm
changing<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.880> transmissions<00:01:17.540> putting<00:01:17.900> these

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
changing the transmissions putting these

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.929 
changing the transmissions putting these
aluminum<00:01:18.530> ones<00:01:19.280> on<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.579> King<00:01:21.729> so<00:01:22.729> it's<00:01:22.850> the

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
aluminum ones on the King so it's the

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.550 
aluminum ones on the King so it's the
only<00:01:23.030> thing<00:01:23.360> really<00:01:23.630> on<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.049> thing<00:01:24.259> that<00:01:24.290> was

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
only thing really on this thing that was

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.300 
only thing really on this thing that was
making<00:01:24.799> it<00:01:25.450> crap<00:01:26.450> in<00:01:26.810> my<00:01:27.350> opinion<00:01:27.799> as<00:01:27.950> far<00:01:28.130> as

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
making it crap in my opinion as far as

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.670 
making it crap in my opinion as far as
you<00:01:28.579> know<00:01:28.670> running<00:01:28.939> up<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.390> down<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:30.110> track

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
you know running up and down the track

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.080 
you know running up and down the track
is<00:01:31.490> these<00:01:31.760> swing<00:01:32.030> arms<00:01:32.360> in<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.570> front<00:01:32.600> hubs

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
is these swing arms in the front hubs

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.730 
is these swing arms in the front hubs
but<00:01:35.090> here<00:01:35.270> they<00:01:35.390> are<00:01:35.540> they're<00:01:36.050> on<00:01:36.080> my<00:01:36.440> truck

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
all the way through both shocks and I've

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.780 
all the way through both shocks and I've
run<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.820> with<00:01:40.970> one<00:01:41.150> shock<00:01:41.450> in<00:01:41.690> here<00:01:41.900> also<00:01:42.790> but

mean a block away and it stopped
communicating<00:01:54.590> with<00:01:55.250> my<00:01:55.720> transmitter<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.110> it

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
communicating with my transmitter and it

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.219 
communicating with my transmitter and it
went<00:01:57.680> high<00:01:57.920> throttle<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.640> slammed<00:01:59.510> I<00:01:59.810> mean<00:01:59.960> 30

four-wheel drive had dug up or holes it

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.130 
four-wheel drive had dug up or holes it
was<00:02:11.330> bright<00:02:11.629> down<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.110> chassis<00:02:12.790> idling<00:02:14.140> so

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
was bright down on the chassis idling so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.960 
was bright down on the chassis idling so
everything<00:02:15.500> was<00:02:15.620> okay<00:02:16.040> but<00:02:16.459> what<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.790> had<00:02:16.939> done

is<00:02:17.629> it<00:02:18.260> completely<00:02:18.950> destroyed<00:02:19.909> this<00:02:20.450> front

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
is it completely destroyed this front

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.610 
is it completely destroyed this front
chassis<00:02:22.909> as<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.689> matter<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:23.930> fact<00:02:24.170> what<00:02:24.470> I'm

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620

doing is with that as you can see here
this<00:02:27.349> front<00:02:27.650> chassis<00:02:28.720> let<00:02:29.720> me<00:02:29.900> pull<00:02:30.110> this

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
this front chassis let me pull this

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.640 
this front chassis let me pull this
thing<00:02:30.560> off<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.099> show<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:32.780> had<00:02:32.989> taken<00:02:33.260> this

front

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.730 
front
upper<00:02:36.120> chassis<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.050> thing<00:02:37.380> and

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
upper chassis on this thing and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.059 
upper chassis on this thing and
completely<00:02:38.340> lunched<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.709> see<00:02:40.920> the

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
completely lunched it you can see the

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.140 
completely lunched it you can see the
crack<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.790> way<00:02:41.880> across<00:02:42.120> there<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.700> hit

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
crack all the way across there so it hit

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.570 
crack all the way across there so it hit
that<00:02:45.360> tree<00:02:45.780> completely<00:02:46.590> destroyed<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.130> front

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
that tree completely destroyed the front

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.559 
that tree completely destroyed the front
end<00:02:47.930> didn't<00:02:48.930> bend<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.410> well<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.160> been<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
end didn't bend the well it been the the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.870 
end didn't bend the well it been the the
chassis<00:02:52.050> itself<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.770> little<00:02:52.920> bit<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.790> it

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
chassis itself a little bit but it

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.520 
chassis itself a little bit but it
destroyed<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.900> took<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.290> and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
destroyed this it took this and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.620 
destroyed this it took this and
completely<00:02:55.890> bent<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.610> half<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.510> was

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
completely bent it in half and I it was

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.140 
completely bent it in half and I it was
bad<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.560> can<00:02:58.739> see<00:02:58.920> all<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.370> scars<00:02:59.730> on<00:03:00.000> it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
bad you can see all the scars on it

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.580 
bad you can see all the scars on it
where<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.300> straightened<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.900> out<00:03:01.050> but<00:03:01.380> what<00:03:01.530> I

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
where I straightened it out but what I

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.410 
where I straightened it out but what I
did<00:03:01.890> was<00:03:02.100> strained<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.580> out<00:03:02.730> real<00:03:02.970> good<00:03:03.180> and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
did was strained it out real good and

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.100 
did was strained it out real good and
then<00:03:04.349> I'm<00:03:04.500> going<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.739> incorporate<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.459> with

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
then I'm going to incorporate it with

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.390 
then I'm going to incorporate it with
another<00:03:07.110> one<00:03:08.269> here<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:10.410> they<00:03:10.680> both<00:03:10.980> fit

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
another one here so they both fit

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.130 
another one here so they both fit
together<00:03:11.790> good<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.630> I've<00:03:12.750> got<00:03:12.959> them<00:03:13.110> where

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
together good and I've got them where

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.490 
together good and I've got them where
they<00:03:13.319> both<00:03:13.680> fit<00:03:13.950> together<00:03:14.250> nicely<00:03:14.370> here

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
they both fit together nicely here

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.270 
they both fit together nicely here
basically<00:03:16.500> I'm<00:03:16.620> gonna<00:03:16.769> have<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> double

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
basically I'm gonna have a double

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.059 
basically I'm gonna have a double
stacked<00:03:17.790> upper<00:03:18.510> chassis<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.200> if<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.620> do<00:03:19.680> hit

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
stacked upper chassis so if I do hit

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.100 
stacked upper chassis so if I do hit
something<00:03:20.610> again<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.420> it's<00:03:21.840> got

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
something again like that it's got

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.460 
something again like that it's got
double<00:03:22.620> strength<00:03:22.860> on<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.280> thing<00:03:24.110> but<00:03:25.110> with

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
double strength on the thing but with

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.910 
double strength on the thing but with
that<00:03:25.709> said<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.819> destroyed<00:03:27.450> all<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.920> but

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
that said it destroyed all that but

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.100 
that said it destroyed all that but

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
these swing arms look I got a stack of

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
these swing arms look I got a stack of
