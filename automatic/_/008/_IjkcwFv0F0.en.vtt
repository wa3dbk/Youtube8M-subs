00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone, as always Ruslan 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.010
 Khabibullin and this project 8 and 16 April 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.440
 2015 I received my regular 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.030
 parcel from China that now look for 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.700
 what period I will say that the link to the product 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.529
 leave under this video actually under 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.080
 video leave a few links so 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.470
 go see so and what am I there 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.539
 got mean for starters show 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.460
 wrapped goods arrived in the usual 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.849
 plastic bag without any 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.820
 boxes and i got these here 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.440
 reebok zigtech sneakers 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.870
 I want to say right away that this is not 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.270
 original sneakers is a copy of a 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.309
 why because I had previously been 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.649
 were original reebok sneakers 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.559
 zigtech and how grit have something to compare 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.450
 I know what materials are made of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.550
 original sneakers but nonetheless 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.940
 it's pretty good copy and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.579
 let's see how it looks 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.899
 it means everywhere everything is correctly written without 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.309
 errors and the tank here is reebok 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.700
 reebok zigtech 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.360
 here reebok reebok she also likes 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.470
 reebok guitar in three places made 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.290
 rubberized inserts here here I think 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.140
 it will be seen that here is one material 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.280
 here in insert another material yes 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.210
 see sneakers are very light flown on 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 A really good option is a mesh that 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 most importantly do not creak when I walk 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.850
 already walked around 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.939
 and pretty really comfortable 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.520
 not to go and now an important moment means 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.180
 first price of 24 dollars with free 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.899
 delivery link, see under the video and 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.880
 I will explain the size about the size now in 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.950
 in my case, I took ten 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.520
 American and 28 centimeters right here 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.270
 indicated that this is European 46 and 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.790
 The specified tass error is incorrect 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.790
 it turns out look 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.790
 Well, see the table size seller 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.540
 or 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:15.510
 American size or best 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.030
 see the size in centimeters just 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.010
 take your some other sneakers 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.160
 either shoes and see how much 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.160
 centimeters of gas on your shoes 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.160
 respectively look at the size 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.050
 centimeters and best yet in 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.010
 order notes when you will 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.530
 order there and write what 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.420
 please put me a size there 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.100
 let's say 28 cm your size indicate and 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.000
 accordingly, you are happy with 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.430
 size will therefore help in general 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.709
 this money is really good 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.890
 option why because here even yesterday 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.160
 there was a sport master and shop and prices honest 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.010
 saying cosmic therefore for 24 dollars 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.100
 in general, the normal version is normal 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.630
 sneakers look so generally 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.450
