00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
recently this is a size 9 block and the

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.420 
recently this is a size 9 block and the
way<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.440> determine<00:03:16.859> your<00:03:16.950> glove<00:03:17.160> size

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
way that you determine your glove size

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.670 
way that you determine your glove size
is<00:03:17.790> your<00:03:18.269> app<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.450> soft<00:03:18.840> cloth<00:03:19.109> tape<00:03:19.410> around

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
is your app a soft cloth tape around

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.530 
is your app a soft cloth tape around
your<00:03:19.799> hand<00:03:20.130> whatever<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.940> number<00:03:21.239> one<00:03:21.359> comes

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
your hand whatever the number one comes

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.630 
your hand whatever the number one comes
out<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.900> be<00:03:22.049> that's<00:03:22.350> your<00:03:22.530> glove<00:03:22.739> size<00:03:23.040> mine's

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
out to be that's your glove size mine's

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.360 
out to be that's your glove size mine's
a<00:03:23.790> size<00:03:24.000> 9<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:25.049> this<00:03:25.290> glove<00:03:25.530> appears<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.100> be<00:03:26.220> in

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
a size 9 so this glove appears to be in

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.940 
a size 9 so this glove appears to be in
good<00:03:26.549> shape<00:03:26.609> then<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.780> far<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.290> last<00:03:28.590> thing<00:03:28.859> I

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
good shape then so far the last thing I

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.099 
good shape then so far the last thing I
want<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.220> check<00:03:29.459> is<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.390> make<00:03:30.540> sure<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.930> it

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
want to check is is to make sure that it

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.289 
want to check is is to make sure that it
does<00:03:31.350> not<00:03:31.590> leak<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.430> air<00:03:32.670> because<00:03:33.060> if<00:03:33.180> it

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
does not leak in the air because if it

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.809 
does not leak in the air because if it
leaks<00:03:33.510> air<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:34.410> leaks<00:03:34.709> electricity<00:03:35.489> and

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
leaks air it leaks electricity and

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.150 
leaks air it leaks electricity and
that's<00:03:36.120> important<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.049> me<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:37.890> I'll<00:03:37.980> go<00:03:38.130> ahead

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
that's important to me so I'll go ahead

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.039 
that's important to me so I'll go ahead
and<00:03:38.519> I'll<00:03:38.549> strap<00:03:38.850> some<00:03:39.090> air<00:03:39.299> inside<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.870> the

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
and I'll strap some air inside of the

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.229 
and I'll strap some air inside of the
glove<00:03:40.319> if<00:03:40.829> I<00:03:41.040> have<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> glove<00:03:41.549> inflator<00:03:42.000> that

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
glove if I have a glove inflator that

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.580 
glove if I have a glove inflator that
would<00:03:42.359> be<00:03:42.480> convenient<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.109> we<00:03:43.260> normally

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
would be convenient but we normally

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.440 
would be convenient but we normally
don't<00:03:43.709> carry<00:03:44.010> those<00:03:44.190> in<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.519> field<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.359> I'll

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
don't carry those in the field so I'll

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.330 
don't carry those in the field so I'll
go<00:03:45.630> ahead<00:03:45.660> trap<00:03:46.170> some<00:03:46.380> air<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.889> inside<00:03:47.310> of

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
go ahead trap some air on the inside of

go ahead trap some air on the inside of
it<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.239> now<00:03:48.480> listen<00:03:49.170> for<00:03:50.100> any<00:03:50.310> air<00:03:50.579> leaks
