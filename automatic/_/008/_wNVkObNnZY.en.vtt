00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
now what I like about this map itself is

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.619 
now what I like about this map itself is
that<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.530> really<00:03:26.010> emphasizes<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:27.120> fun<00:03:27.390> of

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
that it it really emphasizes the fun of

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.780 
that it it really emphasizes the fun of
battlefront<00:03:28.349> 2<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.799> also<00:03:29.189> also<00:03:29.670> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
battlefront 2 and also also the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.580 
battlefront 2 and also also the
greatness<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.540> having<00:03:31.019> mod<00:03:31.260> support

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
greatness of having mod support

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.110

something<00:03:32.159> that<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.489> course<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.939> new

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
something that of course the new

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.660 
something that of course the new
battlefront<00:03:33.540> might<00:03:34.439> lack<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.640> know

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
battlefront might lack and and you know

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.580 
battlefront might lack and and you know
there's<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.060> big<00:03:36.510> shadow<00:03:36.810> hanging<00:03:37.140> over<00:03:37.319> it

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
more casual like which of course results

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.879 
more casual like which of course results
in<00:04:40.860> more<00:04:40.949> downloads<00:04:42.380> it's<00:04:43.380> kind<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.740> same

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889

now<00:05:15.469> this<00:05:15.590> map<00:05:15.889> also<00:05:16.159> actually<00:05:17.229> supports

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
now this map also actually supports

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.159 
now this map also actually supports

is regular if you if you play that then

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.860 
is regular if you if you play that then
actually<00:05:25.939> this<00:05:26.060> map<00:05:26.240> is<00:05:26.270> not<00:05:26.389> not<00:05:26.749> so

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
actually this map is not not so

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.260 
actually this map is not not so
interesting<00:05:27.199> at<00:05:27.289> all<00:05:27.379> because<00:05:27.800> like<00:05:28.009> I<00:05:28.099> said

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
interesting at all because like I said

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.369 
interesting at all because like I said
aesthetically<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.479> map<00:05:29.659> is<00:05:29.840> exactly<00:05:30.229> the

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
aesthetically the map is exactly the

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.570 
aesthetically the map is exactly the
same<00:05:30.529> as<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:30.770> might<00:05:30.949> know<00:05:31.159> and<00:05:31.400> there<00:05:31.490> are

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
same as you might know and there are

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.540 
same as you might know and there are
better<00:05:31.759> Geno's<00:05:32.210> maps<00:05:32.599> out<00:05:32.779> there<00:05:33.520> now<00:05:34.520> I

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
better Geno's maps out there now I

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.920 
better Geno's maps out there now I
realize<00:05:34.969> that<00:05:35.120> this<00:05:35.210> is<00:05:35.270> not<00:05:35.479> supposed<00:05:35.749> to<00:05:35.840> be

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
realize that this is not supposed to be

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.010 
realize that this is not supposed to be
really<00:05:36.110> notice<00:05:36.800> but<00:05:36.949> whatever<00:05:41.020> aesthetically

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
really notice but whatever aesthetically

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:51.060 
really notice but whatever aesthetically
uses<00:05:42.439> a<00:05:42.499> lot<00:05:42.620> of<00:05:42.680> designs<00:05:43.069> from<00:05:43.279> that

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.850 

just<00:05:51.670> a<00:05:51.760> very<00:05:52.000> cool<00:05:52.300> sense<00:05:52.630> of<00:05:52.780> scale<00:05:52.900> not<00:05:53.740> the

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
just a very cool sense of scale not the

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.690 
just a very cool sense of scale not the
coolest<00:05:54.100> map<00:05:54.310> out<00:05:54.430> there<00:05:54.900> but<00:05:55.900> definitely<00:05:56.350> a

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
coolest map out there but definitely a

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.530 
coolest map out there but definitely a
worthwhile<00:05:57.700> checking<00:05:58.450> out<00:05:58.600> to<00:06:00.360> have<00:06:01.360> some

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
worthwhile checking out to have some

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:09.330 
worthwhile checking out to have some
