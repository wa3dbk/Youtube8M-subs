00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.930
 bulleted pass to proceedings in a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.390
 small pot I put the milk glass of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.829
 milk and now let's put the bonzon heart 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 he cut a little pieces to make 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:57.420
 melt this will be I already put in 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.780
 hard and now we will put rice and that is 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.780
 the latin onion make it sound 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:13.940
 meanwhile, the onion is brown 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.590

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.180

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.550
 completely ignored we pour rice and 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.550
 we do it together 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.660
 instead the milk with gorgonzola must 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.550
 go to flame very low hp one must 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.550
 form a cream and melt slowly 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.690
 now when we have reached three quarters 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:57.800
 of the luck of the rism when they are missing 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:02:00.590

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.149
 before he can contest the part if he sees it 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.840

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.820

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.580
