00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.570 
one poaching incident more inevitably
followed<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:50.799> started<00:01:51.130> going<00:01:51.310> through

followed and we started going through
all<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.729> those<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.510> measures<00:01:52.870> that<00:01:53.020> were

all of those the measures that were

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.930 
all of those the measures that were
available<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.890> us<00:01:54.010> at<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.250> time<00:01:54.280> like<00:01:54.670> oh<00:01:54.790> well

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
available to us at the time like oh well

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.340 
available to us at the time like oh well
maybe<00:01:55.150> we<00:01:55.540> should<00:01:55.810> dehorn

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
maybe we should dehorn

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.110 
maybe we should dehorn
but<00:01:56.620> we<00:01:56.799> make<00:01:57.100> our<00:01:57.280> living<00:01:57.310> largely<00:01:57.790> out<00:01:58.000> of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
but we make our living largely out of

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.649 
but we make our living largely out of
ecotourism<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.930> we<00:01:59.049> don't<00:01:59.229> want<00:01:59.409> to<00:01:59.560> do<00:01:59.680> more

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
ecotourism so we don't want to do more

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.310 
microchips and tracking devices and DNA
samples<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.360> problem<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:04.840> had<00:02:05.020> with<00:02:05.140> all

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
samples and the problem we had with all

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.420 
samples and the problem we had with all
of<00:02:05.470> those<00:02:05.590> were<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:06.010> they<00:02:06.190> were<00:02:06.250> largely

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
of those were that they were largely

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.699 
of those were that they were largely
reactive<00:02:07.360> in<00:02:07.630> nature<00:02:07.690> so<00:02:08.350> they<00:02:08.530> wouldn't

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
reactive in nature so they wouldn't

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.190 
reactive in nature so they wouldn't
prevent<00:02:09.010> an<00:02:09.220> animal<00:02:09.519> from<00:02:09.910> dying<00:02:10.239> they<00:02:11.170> would

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
prevent an animal from dying they would

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:21.900 
prevent an animal from dying they would
only<00:02:11.799> inform<00:02:12.250> us<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.640> dead<00:02:12.910> head

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.140 

and<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.840> idea<00:02:23.520> came<00:02:24.520> about<00:02:24.550> well<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.030> know

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
and so the idea came about well you know

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150 
and so the idea came about well you know

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
what if we could we could contaminate

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.330 
what if we could we could contaminate
these<00:02:27.640> horns<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.120> some<00:02:28.330> way<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:29.340> poachers

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
these horns in some way so that poachers

the<00:03:16.340> easiest<00:03:16.790> way<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.090> do<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:17.390> is<00:03:17.810> from<00:03:17.930> a
