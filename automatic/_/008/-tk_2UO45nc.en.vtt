the<00:02:30.360> crane<00:02:30.840> frame<00:02:31.110> mounts<00:02:31.730> take<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> metal<00:02:33.060> rod

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
the crane frame mounts take a metal rod

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:42.240 
the crane frame mounts take a metal rod
and<00:02:33.450> thread<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.260> into<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> hole<00:02:34.769> here

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.860 

take<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.280> second<00:02:43.730> metal<00:02:43.940> rod<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.270> thread<00:02:44.810> it

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
take a second metal rod and thread it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.750 
take a second metal rod and thread it
into<00:02:44.990> this<00:02:45.170> hole

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.059 

now<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.420> we've<00:02:53.629> got<00:02:53.930> our<00:02:54.110> frame<00:02:54.770> mounts

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
now that we've got our frame mounts

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.619 
now that we've got our frame mounts
assembled<00:02:55.520> we<00:02:55.760> can<00:02:55.910> go<00:02:56.030> ahead<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.300> insert

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
assembled we can go ahead and insert

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.990 
assembled we can go ahead and insert
them<00:02:56.810> into<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.200> two<00:02:57.379> holes<00:02:57.410> here<00:02:57.830> they<00:02:58.730> slide

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
them into the two holes here they slide

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.630 
them into the two holes here they slide
in<00:02:59.150> pretty<00:02:59.390> easy<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.739> using<00:03:01.340> these<00:03:01.430> two

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
in pretty easy and using these two

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.229 
in pretty easy and using these two
screws<00:03:02.030> we<00:03:02.450> can<00:03:02.480> lock<00:03:03.290> them<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:03.650> place

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239
