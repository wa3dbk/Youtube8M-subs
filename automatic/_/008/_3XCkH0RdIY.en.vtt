00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.810
 what in the past was talked about 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.220
 become a municipal workshop 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.349
 ended up being used during 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.510
 past weeks as a refuge from 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.580
 dogs, this is what our 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.190
 cameras when opening a door 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.220
 side of the old warehouse of products 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.930
 farmers left about 13 puppies to 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.180
 this young woman who went to visit the 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.859
 historic monument surprised him the 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.010
 find and today specifically 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.380
 We came to record a video and we are going to 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.119
 show them what he did on how to give 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.309
 people and when we notice the 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.379
 situation we opened the door and there was 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.269
 many dogs according to luis feliciano 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.460
 executive assistant to the mayor of water 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.100
 the municipality has never given authorization 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.469
 so that the rusty place and with very little 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.690
 ventilation was being used 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.370
 as a refuge for animals and is that a 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.979
 group of citizens in their character 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.749
 staff has been carrying dogs that 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.209
 they are abandoned in the streets of that 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:59.459
 sector perhaps with the best intention of 

00:00:55.209 --> 00:01:02.289
 prevent them from dying on the roads to 

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:03.670
 that people a farmer told us 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.770
 why do not they put them in storage because 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.560
 that is not used us 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.229
 vaccinating venues for venues for appointments 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.179
 vaccinate if you can or until you can 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.610
 and then they are sterilized and given in 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.469
 adoption and this has little ventilation and 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.929
 It has little ventilation but as it 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.909
 he came twice a day and since they were 12 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.159
 nothing else and they were supposed to 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.929
 will be serious and this one the 13th 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.149
 puppies were taken in a vehicle 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.299
 municipal to michelle villa hostel 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.520
 Mayagüez meanwhile on Monday the ancient 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.829
 Sugar store will be closed by 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.079
 municipal public works this place has 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.509
 been used by many people for 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.009
 abandon animals in the area so it's 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.470
 that what has increased this 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.970
 situation that they now have to solve 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.159
 probably and we take the opportunity to do 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.679
 a call to all citizenship the 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.439
 municipality offers collection service 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.599
 of dogs provided that if someone has 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.909
 an animal that wants to get rid of him 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.219
 for whatever reason it can be communicated 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.739
 to the emergency management division 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.049
 of the municipality for us to work with 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:07.390
 this situation the police went to the 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.429
 place but did not find elements of 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.660
 criminal nature that the municipality does not 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.000
 have interest 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.010
 since in the case none simply 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.750
 she did it to save normally 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.940
 to save them from nothing 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.040
 unfortunately if these puppies do not 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.110
 they get whoever adopts them will end 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.450
 being put to sleep in the next 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.790
 days if you or someone you know 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.560
