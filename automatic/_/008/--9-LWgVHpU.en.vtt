00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:30.720 

pay<00:00:18.920> attention<00:00:19.570> here<00:00:20.570> comes<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:20.990> sign<00:00:21.230> spits

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.979 

a<00:00:31.730> professor<00:00:32.150> Neko<00:00:32.390> I<00:00:32.419> notice<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.840> first

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
a professor Neko I notice the first

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.960 
a professor Neko I notice the first
thing<00:00:33.200> is<00:00:33.320> color<00:00:33.559> up<00:00:33.770> very<00:00:34.190> important<00:00:34.640> always

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
thing is color up very important always

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.979 
thing is color up very important always
do<00:00:35.300> it<00:00:35.390> this<00:00:35.510> time

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
do it this time

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.470 
do it this time
so<00:00:36.920> this<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.309> first<00:00:37.550> part<00:00:37.879> today

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
so this is the first part today

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.380 
so this is the first part today
professor<00:00:39.290> Nicole<00:00:39.410> is<00:00:39.800> gonna<00:00:40.040> explain<00:00:40.430> to<00:00:41.269> you

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
professor Nicole is gonna explain to you

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.070 
professor Nicole is gonna explain to you
how<00:00:41.660> this<00:00:41.809> works<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:42.760> this<00:00:43.760> year<00:00:44.090> we've<00:00:44.870> gone

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
how this works so this year we've gone

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.710 
how this works so this year we've gone
to<00:00:45.290> much<00:00:45.470> smaller<00:00:45.980> combustion<00:00:46.730> engines<00:00:47.300> so

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
to much smaller combustion engines so

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.540 
to much smaller combustion engines so
that's<00:00:47.989> less<00:00:48.230> horsepower<00:00:48.559> yeah<00:00:49.040> but<00:00:49.280> how<00:00:49.489> we

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
that's less horsepower yeah but how we

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.459 
that's less horsepower yeah but how we
get<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.910> horsepower<00:00:50.270> back<00:00:50.570> is<00:00:50.870> by<00:00:51.050> using<00:00:51.290> a

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
get the horsepower back is by using a

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.910 
get the horsepower back is by using a
turbo<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.340> a<00:00:52.430> turbo<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:53.649> it's<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.770> little

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
turbo and a turbo is it's a little

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.459 
turbo and a turbo is it's a little
flywheel<00:00:55.850> yeah<00:00:56.180> like<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:56.540> spinning<00:00:57.260> right

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
flywheel yeah like that spinning right

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.240 
flywheel yeah like that spinning right
through<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.860> air<00:00:58.040> intake<00:00:58.579> and<00:00:58.790> pushing<00:00:59.690> and

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
through the air intake and pushing and

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.889 
through the air intake and pushing and
compressing<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.940> air<00:01:02.120> at<00:01:02.390> higher<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.870> higher

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
compressing the air at higher and higher

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.560 
compressing the air at higher and higher
speeds<00:01:03.410> with<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:03.860> lot<00:01:04.129> of<00:01:04.160> pressure<00:01:04.399> and<00:01:05.300> so

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
speeds with a lot of pressure and so

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.080 
speeds with a lot of pressure and so
having<00:01:06.020> more<00:01:06.259> air<00:01:06.530> in<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:06.920> tiny<00:01:07.160> space<00:01:07.250> will

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
having more air in that tiny space will

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.700 
having more air in that tiny space will
give<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.420> bigger<00:01:08.600> explosion<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:09.560> is

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
give you a bigger explosion so this is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.920 
give you a bigger explosion so this is
now<00:01:09.890> our<00:01:10.160> normal<00:01:10.700> combustion<00:01:11.300> engine<00:01:11.660> in<00:01:11.810> a

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
now our normal combustion engine in a

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.840 
now our normal combustion engine in a
completely<00:01:12.649> normal<00:01:12.800> state<00:01:13.220> right<00:01:13.610> there

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
completely normal state right there

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.450 
completely normal state right there
small<00:01:14.780> amounts<00:01:15.110> are<00:01:15.200> heats<00:01:15.410> but<00:01:15.770> hardly

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
small amounts are heats but hardly

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.810 
small amounts are heats but hardly
anything<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.180> now<00:01:17.680> here<00:01:18.680> comes<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.160> turbo

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
anything and now here comes the turbo

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.950 
anything and now here comes the turbo
you<00:01:20.420> need<00:01:20.539> some<00:01:20.720> hair<00:01:20.869> styling<00:01:21.200> today<00:01:25.840> this<00:01:26.840> is

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
you need some hair styling today this is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.710 
you need some hair styling today this is
our<00:01:27.110> turbo<00:01:27.530> you'll<00:01:28.100> see<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.610> effect<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.210> our

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
our turbo you'll see the effect of our

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.330 
our turbo you'll see the effect of our
combustion<00:01:30.140> engine<00:01:30.650> with<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.890> lot<00:01:31.159> more

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
combustion engine with a lot more

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.109 
combustion engine with a lot more
compressed<00:01:31.909> air<00:01:35.020> so<00:01:36.020> it's<00:01:36.170> glowing<00:01:36.560> red-hot

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
compressed air so it's glowing red-hot

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.420 
compressed air so it's glowing red-hot
yeah<00:01:38.150> you're<00:01:39.110> getting<00:01:39.350> really<00:01:39.710> really<00:01:39.920> hot<00:01:40.130> so

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
yeah you're getting really really hot so

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.340 
yeah you're getting really really hot so
that<00:01:40.820> was<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.180> best<00:01:41.299> example<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:42.049> effect

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
that was the best example of the effect

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.780 
that was the best example of the effect
of<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.560> turbo<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.009> know<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.250> just<00:01:43.340> gives<00:01:43.520> us<00:01:43.759> so

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
of a turbo you know it just gives us so

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.700 
of a turbo you know it just gives us so
much<00:01:44.270> more<00:01:44.509> energy<00:01:44.960> in<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.350> small

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
much more energy in that small

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.649 
much more energy in that small
combustion<00:01:46.189> engine<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:46.579> we<00:01:46.670> now<00:01:46.820> have<00:01:47.030> and

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
combustion engine that we now have and

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.600 
combustion engine that we now have and
that's<00:01:47.810> more<00:01:48.020> horsepower<00:01:48.500> much<00:01:49.220> quicker<00:01:49.490> than

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
that's more horsepower much quicker than

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:59.440 
that's more horsepower much quicker than
the<00:01:49.820> straight

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.670 

Nikko's<00:02:00.450> strange<00:02:00.750> place<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.050> park<00:02:01.410> your<00:02:01.440> car

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
Nikko's strange place to park your car

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.780 
Nikko's strange place to park your car
yes<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:03.900> show<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.620> best<00:02:04.860> possible<00:02:05.460> or<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
yes to show the best possible or the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.760 
yes to show the best possible or the
simplest<00:02:06.390> way<00:02:06.720> of<00:02:06.750> explaining<00:02:07.260> this<00:02:07.560> whole

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
simplest way of explaining this whole

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.940 
simplest way of explaining this whole
compressor<00:02:08.750> functionality<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.990> my<00:02:10.230> engine

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
compressor functionality in my engine

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.370 
compressor functionality in my engine
now<00:02:11.310> we<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.990> spinning<00:02:12.990> wheel<00:02:13.020> here

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
now we have this spinning wheel here

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.650 
now we have this spinning wheel here
which<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.160> compressor<00:02:14.700> yeah<00:02:15.300> which<00:02:15.630> is

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
which is the compressor yeah which is

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.110 
which is the compressor yeah which is
what<00:02:16.260> makes<00:02:16.560> up<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.920> turbo<00:02:17.250> engine<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.880> this

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
what makes up a turbo engine is this

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.210 
what makes up a turbo engine is this
this<00:02:18.420> part<00:02:18.720> here<00:02:18.990> with<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.440> exhaust<00:02:19.800> gases

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
this part here with the exhaust gases

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.460 
this part here with the exhaust gases
coming<00:02:20.400> out<00:02:20.610> from<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.600> small<00:02:21.750> engine<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
coming out from this small engine and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.950 
coming out from this small engine and
the<00:02:22.830> faster<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.370> more<00:02:23.520> rpm<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.150> get<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> faster

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
the faster the more rpm I get the faster

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.020 
the faster the more rpm I get the faster
the<00:02:25.080> exhaust<00:02:25.410> gases<00:02:25.800> come<00:02:25.980> out<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.580> faster

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
the exhaust gases come out the faster

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.510 
the exhaust gases come out the faster
the<00:02:27.150> exhaust<00:02:27.510> gasses<00:02:28.020> spin<00:02:28.710> up<00:02:28.920> this

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
the exhaust gasses spin up this

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.940 
the exhaust gasses spin up this
compressor<00:02:30.360> will<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:31.920> turn

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
compressor will and that then in turn

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.090 
compressor will and that then in turn
will<00:02:32.660> allow<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.960> bigger<00:02:34.200> explosion<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
will allow a bigger explosion in the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.100 
will allow a bigger explosion in the
engine<00:02:35.460> but<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.420> special<00:02:36.780> thing<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.050> year

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
engine but the special thing this year

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.900 
engine but the special thing this year
is<00:02:37.320> not<00:02:37.620> only<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:37.950> turbo<00:02:38.550> engine<00:02:38.880> but

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
is not only is that turbo engine but

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.060 
is not only is that turbo engine but
also<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.510> new<00:02:39.720> compressor<00:02:40.620> wheel<00:02:40.800> is

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
also this new compressor wheel is

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.730 
also this new compressor wheel is
connected<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.700> small<00:02:42.000> motor<00:02:42.260> which<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.470> turn

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
connected to a small motor which in turn

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.270 
connected to a small motor which in turn
will<00:02:44.310> convert<00:02:44.760> into<00:02:45.200> electrical<00:02:46.200> power<00:02:46.280> which

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
will convert into electrical power which

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.060 
will convert into electrical power which
has<00:02:47.970> an<00:02:48.150> example<00:02:48.450> here<00:02:48.780> which<00:02:49.710> is<00:02:49.860> being

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
has an example here which is being

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.430 
has an example here which is being
charged<00:02:50.490> yeah<00:02:50.940> by<00:02:51.270> this<00:02:51.480> thing<00:02:51.660> turning<00:02:51.900> and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
charged yeah by this thing turning and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.390 
charged yeah by this thing turning and
so<00:02:52.950> it's<00:02:53.570> building<00:02:54.570> more<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:54.960> more

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
so it's building more and more

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.190 
so it's building more and more
electrical<00:02:56.400> battery<00:02:56.940> power<00:02:57.210> which<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.690> saving

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
electrical battery power which is saving

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.680 
electrical battery power which is saving
so<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.040> says<00:02:59.250> discharging<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.270> if<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.450> ran

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
so this says discharging so if I ran

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.590 
so this says discharging so if I ran
into<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.020> my<00:03:01.140> foot<00:03:01.320> on<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> floor

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
into it my foot on the floor

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.520 
into it my foot on the floor
then<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.410> will<00:03:03.560> massively<00:03:04.040> charge<00:03:04.460> and<00:03:05.530> it

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
then it will massively charge and it

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.580 
then it will massively charge and it
will<00:03:06.740> get<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:07.160> much<00:03:07.400> energy<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:09.050> much<00:03:09.230> energy

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
will get so much energy so much energy

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:26.570 
will get so much energy so much energy
go<00:03:10.010> for<00:03:10.220> it

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.950 

anyone<00:03:27.580> forgets<00:03:27.910> their<00:03:28.120> battery<00:03:28.450> charger<00:03:28.840> we

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
anyone forgets their battery charger we

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.850 
anyone forgets their battery charger we
know<00:03:29.080> what<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.350> do

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
know what to do

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.050 
know what to do
who's<00:03:30.220> got<00:03:30.340> one<00:03:30.460> more<00:03:30.640> part<00:03:30.880> of<00:03:30.940> our

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
who's got one more part of our

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:41.020 
who's got one more part of our
experiment<00:03:31.360> let's<00:03:32.080> take<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.290> look

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.750 

and<00:03:41.660> now<00:03:41.780> here<00:03:42.050> we've<00:03:42.260> come<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.920> place

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
and now here we've come to the place

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.100 
and now here we've come to the place
which<00:03:44.060> is<00:03:44.180> actually<00:03:44.690> one<00:03:44.840> of<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.990> most

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
which is actually one of the most

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.100 
which is actually one of the most
easiest<00:03:45.470> parts<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.190> explain<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:47.060> we<00:03:47.600> put<00:03:47.840> four

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
easiest parts to explain and we put four

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.650 
easiest parts to explain and we put four
prongs<00:03:48.440> here<00:03:48.680> because<00:03:49.100> this<00:03:49.790> is<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.090> way<00:03:50.210> most

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
prongs here because this is the way most

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.170 
prongs here because this is the way most
of<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.960> batteries<00:03:51.320> charge<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.800> produced<00:03:52.430> to

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
of the batteries charge is produced to

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.270 
of the batteries charge is produced to
start<00:03:53.390> off<00:03:53.510> with<00:03:53.720> I'm<00:03:53.960> gonna<00:03:54.140> go<00:03:54.230> on<00:03:54.770> full

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
start off with I'm gonna go on full

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.330 
start off with I'm gonna go on full
throttle<00:03:55.810> yeah<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.380> now<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.590> can<00:03:57.830> imagine<00:03:57.860> me

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
throttle yeah so now you can imagine me

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.690 
throttle yeah so now you can imagine me
going<00:03:58.520> down<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.940> Straits<00:04:00.160> ten<00:04:01.160> miles<00:04:01.400> an<00:04:01.580> hour

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
going down the Straits ten miles an hour

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.949 
going down the Straits ten miles an hour
I<00:04:01.850> think<00:04:02.120> I'll<00:04:02.209> be<00:04:02.330> doing<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.600> little<00:04:02.810> bit<00:04:02.930> more

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
I think I'll be doing a little bit more

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.750 
I think I'll be doing a little bit more
hopefully<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:03.860> now<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.040> come<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.490> end<00:04:04.670> of

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
hopefully so now I come to the end of

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.060 
hopefully so now I come to the end of
end<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.300> straight<00:04:05.600> and<00:04:06.380> I<00:04:06.650> do<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.830> full

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
end of the straight and I do a full

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.920 
end of the straight and I do a full
braking<00:04:07.280> yeah<00:04:07.850> for<00:04:08.209> braking<00:04:08.570> I<00:04:08.600> go<00:04:08.750> on<00:04:08.840> the

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
braking yeah for braking I go on the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.810 
braking yeah for braking I go on the
brakes<00:04:09.140> all<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.740> phones<00:04:10.160> are<00:04:10.310> charging<00:04:10.700> up

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
brakes all the phones are charging up

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.640 
brakes all the phones are charging up
massively<00:04:11.690> quickly<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.260> know<00:04:12.380> they're<00:04:12.530> all

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
massively quickly you know they're all

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.949 
massively quickly you know they're all
full<00:04:13.040> on<00:04:13.190> charge<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:14.270> that's<00:04:14.480> because

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
full on charge and that's because

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.349 
full on charge and that's because
there's<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.650> little<00:04:15.890> motor<00:04:16.100> connected<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.269> the

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
there's a little motor connected to the

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.560 
there's a little motor connected to the
engine<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:19.609> engine<00:04:19.640> is<00:04:20.000> turning<00:04:20.329> this

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
engine and the engine is turning this

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.840 
engine and the engine is turning this
motor<00:04:20.870> very<00:04:21.260> very<00:04:21.500> quickly<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:22.220> under

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
motor very very quickly and under

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.280 
motor very very quickly and under
braking<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:24.500> motor<00:04:24.790> switches<00:04:25.790> and<00:04:26.780> decides

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
braking that motor switches and decides

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.740 
braking that motor switches and decides
okay<00:04:27.620> now<00:04:27.800> I'm<00:04:27.919> going<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.160> take<00:04:28.310> all<00:04:28.490> that

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
okay now I'm going to take all that

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.970 
okay now I'm going to take all that
rotational<00:04:29.750> speed<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.440> I'm<00:04:30.770> going<00:04:30.950> to

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
rotational speed and I'm going to

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.830 
rotational speed and I'm going to
transform<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.550> into<00:04:31.730> electricity<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.510> charge

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
transform it into electricity and charge

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.010 
transform it into electricity and charge
the<00:04:32.990> battery<00:04:33.320> and

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
the battery and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.890 
the battery and
I<00:04:34.080> come<00:04:34.680> out<00:04:34.830> on<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.039> corner<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.629> go<00:04:36.629> back<00:04:36.870> on

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
I come out on the corner I go back on

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.779 
I come out on the corner I go back on
the<00:04:37.139> swamp<00:04:37.410> oh<00:04:37.560> yeah

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
the swamp oh yeah

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.960 
the swamp oh yeah
and<00:04:38.940> what<00:04:39.150> happens<00:04:39.449> then<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.919> motor<00:04:41.099> does<00:04:41.759> the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
and what happens then the motor does the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.210 
and what happens then the motor does the
opposite<00:04:42.360> so<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.110> uses<00:04:43.349> up<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.710> battery

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
opposite so it uses up the battery

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.659 
opposite so it uses up the battery
energy

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
energy

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.909 
energy
it's<00:04:45.120> an<00:04:45.210> incredible<00:04:45.840> amount<00:04:46.020> of<00:04:46.199> Technology

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
it's an incredible amount of Technology

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.820 
it's an incredible amount of Technology
how<00:04:47.310> different<00:04:47.940> do<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.300> cars<00:04:48.629> feel<00:04:49.080> from<00:04:49.620> your

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
how different do the cars feel from your

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.559 
how different do the cars feel from your
seat<00:04:50.159> to<00:04:50.430> actually<00:04:50.729> drive<00:04:51.000> this<00:04:51.210> year<00:04:51.270> from

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
seat to actually drive this year from

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.649 
seat to actually drive this year from
last<00:04:51.659> year<00:04:52.020> in<00:04:52.379> terms<00:04:52.620> of<00:04:52.800> all<00:04:52.949> this

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
last year in terms of all this

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.270 
last year in terms of all this
technology<00:04:54.659> it's<00:04:54.960> really<00:04:55.139> really<00:04:55.889> similar

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
technology it's really really similar

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.770 
technology it's really really similar
and<00:04:56.610> they're<00:04:57.030> more<00:04:57.210> for<00:04:57.330> you<00:04:57.449> to<00:04:57.539> do<00:04:57.629> in<00:04:57.720> a

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
and they're more for you to do in a

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.010 
and they're more for you to do in a
cockpit<00:04:57.990> this<00:04:58.259> year<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.680> lot<00:04:59.430> more<00:05:00.020> button

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
cockpit this year a lot more button

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.050 
cockpit this year a lot more button
systems<00:05:01.440> things<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.860> get<00:05:01.979> used<00:05:02.159> to<00:05:02.250> but<00:05:03.030> I

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
systems things to get used to but I

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.149 
systems things to get used to but I
think<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.389> lot<00:05:03.539> of<00:05:03.569> it<00:05:03.750> is<00:05:03.840> just<00:05:03.870> as<00:05:04.199> all-new<00:05:04.650> do

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
think a lot of it is just as all-new do

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.870 
think a lot of it is just as all-new do
you<00:05:05.250> do<00:05:05.490> your<00:05:06.199> engineering<00:05:07.759> interests<00:05:08.759> and

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
you do your engineering interests and

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.629 
you do your engineering interests and
backgrounds<00:05:09.560> helps<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:10.710> at<00:05:10.830> all<00:05:11.009> this<00:05:11.190> year

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
backgrounds helps you at all this year

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.870 
backgrounds helps you at all this year
my<00:05:11.880> my<00:05:12.330> approach<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:13.050> sport<00:05:13.409> is<00:05:13.590> that<00:05:13.620> I<00:05:13.880> am

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
my my approach to the sport is that I am

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.480 
my my approach to the sport is that I am
interested<00:05:15.330> in<00:05:15.479> all<00:05:15.659> technology<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.919> I<00:05:17.190> want

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
interested in all technology and I want

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.600 
interested in all technology and I want
to<00:05:18.110> look<00:05:19.110> into<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.650> because<00:05:20.009> I<00:05:20.099> hope<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.520> I

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
to look into it because I hope that I

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.010 
to look into it because I hope that I
can<00:05:20.669> get<00:05:21.000> myself<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.509> little<00:05:21.659> bit<00:05:21.840> of<00:05:21.930> an

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
can get myself a little bit of an

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.439 
can get myself a little bit of an
advantage<00:05:22.289> over<00:05:22.680> maybe<00:05:23.009> some<00:05:23.280> others<00:05:23.520> it's

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
advantage over maybe some others it's

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.120 
advantage over maybe some others it's
good<00:05:24.659> so<00:05:25.080> children<00:05:25.319> listened<00:05:25.889> to<00:05:26.009> Professor

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
good so children listened to Professor

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.580 
good so children listened to Professor
Nico<00:05:26.849> in<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.419> moral<00:05:27.750> of<00:05:27.870> today<00:05:28.169> professor

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
Nico in the moral of today professor

Nico's<00:05:29.069> advice<00:05:29.460> from<00:05:29.699> today<00:05:30.000> pay<00:05:30.630> attention

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
Nico's advice from today pay attention

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.550 
Nico's advice from today pay attention
to<00:05:31.409> maths<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:31.860> physics<00:05:31.889> classes
