definitely is more intimate really than

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.069 
definitely is more intimate really than
that<00:01:31.920> our<00:01:32.369> adventure<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.540> perform<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> or

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
that our adventure do you perform it or

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.929 
that our adventure do you perform it or
do<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> prefer<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.680> sort<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.250> gelatin<00:01:35.670> LG

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
do you prefer more sort of a gelatin LG

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.850 
do you prefer more sort of a gelatin LG
sort<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.299> arena<00:01:36.810> can't<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.350> compare<00:01:37.680> them

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
sort of arena can't really compare them

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
sort of arena can't really compare them
I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.700> comes<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> point

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
I think this really comes to the point

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.789 
I think this really comes to the point
where<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.079> finish<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.439> kind<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.740> like

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
where do you finish is kind of like

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.800 
where do you finish is kind of like
caught<00:01:41.130> champs<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.390> gels<00:01:42.630> kinda

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
caught champs and then the gels kinda

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.539 
caught champs and then the gels kinda
like<00:01:42.899> MLG<00:01:43.259> where<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.770> open<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.399> bite

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
like MLG where it's just open and bite

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.760 
like MLG where it's just open and bite
only<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.810> really<00:01:46.020> can't<00:01:46.200> compare<00:01:46.380> them<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.740> I

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
only you really can't compare them so I

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.340
