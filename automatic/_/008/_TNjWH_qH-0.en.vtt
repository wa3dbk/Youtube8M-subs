to<00:00:34.440> enable<00:00:35.399> blur<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.790> parallax<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
to enable blur and parallax in the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.979 
to enable blur and parallax in the
iPhone<00:00:36.750> 4<00:00:37.430> with<00:00:38.430> little<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.149> no<00:00:39.270> effect<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.870> the

iPhone 4 with little to no effect on the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.410 
iPhone 4 with little to no effect on the
performance<00:00:40.579> I've<00:00:41.579> tried<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.030> before

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
performance I've tried this before

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.049 
performance I've tried this before
it<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.350> doesn't<00:00:43.860> affect<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.430> much<00:00:44.760> this

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it really doesn't affect that much this

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
it really doesn't affect that much this
week<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.360> called<00:00:45.539> blur<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.200> blur<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:47.370> not

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
week is called blur and a blur it's not

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.430 
week is called blur and a blur it's not

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
good to you can see my phone's re

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590 
good to you can see my phone's re
springing<00:00:49.950> there<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.149> are<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> go

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
springing there and we are going to go

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.029 
springing there and we are going to go
into<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> settings<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.010> are

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
into the settings and see if there are

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.610 
into the settings and see if there are
any<00:00:53.309> settings<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.180> need<00:00:54.629> adjusting<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.500> be

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
any settings that need adjusting to be

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
any settings that need adjusting to be
able<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.860> use<00:00:56.039> blue<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.399> Ibis<00:00:56.850> give<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
able to use blue and Ibis give it a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.349 
able to use blue and Ibis give it a
second<00:00:57.510> after<00:00:57.750> its<00:00:57.870> respawn<00:00:58.260> source<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.359> so

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
second after its respawn source it so

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.299 
second after its respawn source it so
you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.750> there<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.350> fully<00:01:02.010> blurred

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
you can see there is fully blurred

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.549 
you can see there is fully blurred
control<00:01:03.210> center<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.899> there<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
control center and there is the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.590 
control center and there is the
Notification<00:01:05.129> Center<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.119> see<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.479> does

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
Notification Center you can see it does

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.570 
Notification Center you can see it does
have<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.810> bit<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> lag<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.920> pretty<00:01:08.369> much

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
have a bit of lag but it's pretty much

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.250 
have a bit of lag but it's pretty much
it<00:01:08.909> well<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.510> better<00:01:10.010> than<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.490> one

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
it well it's a lot better than the one

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.210 
it well it's a lot better than the one
then<00:01:13.310> almost<00:01:14.310> call<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.439> iPhone<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.680> parallax

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
then almost call now iPhone for parallax

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.890 
then almost call now iPhone for parallax
it's<00:01:17.460> much<00:01:17.729> better<00:01:17.970> than<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.240> look<00:01:18.630> at<00:01:18.750> this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
it's much better than that look at this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.210 
it's much better than that look at this
form<00:01:19.500> let's<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.770> back<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.220 

doesn't<00:01:23.940> really<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.450> much<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.840> all

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
doesn't really like that much at all

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.870 
doesn't really like that much at all
it's<00:01:25.590> obviously<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.010> as<00:01:26.100> good<00:01:26.160> as<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.460> 4s<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it's obviously not as good as the 4s and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.810 
it's obviously not as good as the 4s and
above<00:01:27.300> but<00:01:27.770> it's<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:29.010> that<00:01:29.040> you're<00:01:29.250> you're

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
above but it's good that you're you're

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
above but it's good that you're you're
able<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.120> have<00:01:30.360> blur<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.050> without<00:01:31.410> losing

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
able to have blur on this without losing

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.580 
able to have blur on this without losing
too<00:01:32.070> much<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.370> performance<00:01:32.930> but<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.440> is<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
too much the performance but this is a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.110 
too much the performance but this is a
free<00:01:34.980> tweak<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:35.640> gonna<00:01:35.730> show<00:01:35.940> you<00:01:35.970> how<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
free tweak and I'm gonna show you how to

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.760 
free tweak and I'm gonna show you how to
get<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.690> so<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:36.990> we're<00:01:37.110> gonna<00:01:37.200> need<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.440> do<00:01:37.560> go

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
get it so what we're gonna need to do go

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.150 
get it so what we're gonna need to do go
to<00:01:37.830> cydia<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.900> repo<00:01:40.230> is<00:01:40.290> called<00:01:40.500> cherry<00:01:40.860> n

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
to cydia and the repo is called cherry n

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.890 
to cydia and the repo is called cherry n
so<00:01:41.850> I'm<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> show<00:01:42.300> you<00:01:42.330> how<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.510> add<00:01:42.690> that

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
so I'm going to show you how to add that

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.600 
so I'm going to show you how to add that
repo<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.800> you'll<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.010> able<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.250> get<00:01:44.400> this

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
repo so you'll be able to get this

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
repo so you'll be able to get this
package<00:01:44.940> for<00:01:45.210> yourself<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> try<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.140> load
