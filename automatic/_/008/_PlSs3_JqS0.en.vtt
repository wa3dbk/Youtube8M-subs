some twos in this video but I've been

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.060 
some twos in this video but I've been
getting<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:28.370> lot<00:00:28.490> of<00:00:28.550> questions<00:00:29.120> lately<00:00:29.390> about

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
getting a lot of questions lately about

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.820 
getting a lot of questions lately about
exactly<00:00:31.070> why<00:00:31.520> it<00:00:31.580> is<00:00:31.850> that<00:00:31.880> i<00:00:32.270> use<00:00:32.750> swords<00:00:33.590> of

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
exactly why it is that i use swords of

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.740 
exactly why it is that i use swords of
the<00:00:33.890> daggers<00:00:34.430> because<00:00:35.210> apparently<00:00:35.540> that

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
the daggers because apparently that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.970 
the daggers because apparently that
appears<00:00:36.050> to<00:00:36.200> be<00:00:36.290> somewhat<00:00:36.770> of<00:00:36.920> a

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
appears to be somewhat of a

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.920 
appears to be somewhat of a
controversial<00:00:37.489> topic<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:38.420> no<00:00:38.720> one<00:00:38.840> can

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
controversial topic and no one can

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.549 
controversial topic and no one can
really<00:00:39.110> work<00:00:39.320> out<00:00:39.530> why<00:00:39.739> I<00:00:39.770> do<00:00:39.950> it<00:00:41.559> basically

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
really work out why I do it basically

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.549 
really work out why I do it basically
the<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.460> too<00:00:43.670> long<00:00:43.850> didn't<00:00:44.570> read<00:00:44.780> version<00:00:45.410> of

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
the the too long didn't read version of

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.689 
the the too long didn't read version of
this<00:00:45.800> is<00:00:46.270> it's<00:00:47.270> better<00:00:48.050> for<00:00:48.739> combo<00:00:49.129> point

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
this is it's better for combo point

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.650 
this is it's better for combo point
building<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.309> yes<00:00:52.309> I<00:00:52.670> could<00:00:53.180> just<00:00:53.360> spam

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
building and yes I could just spam

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.460 
building and yes I could just spam

daggers<00:00:57.980> as<00:00:58.250> well<00:00:58.600> but<00:00:59.600> I<00:00:59.899> prefer<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:02.000> have

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
daggers as well but I prefer to have

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.910 
daggers as well but I prefer to have
swords<00:01:03.079> because<00:01:03.500> they<00:01:03.829> do<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:04.339> more<00:01:05.920> auto

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
vicereine whenever you can fit it in so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.449 
vicereine whenever you can fit it in so
you've<00:02:34.880> got<00:02:35.090> those<00:02:35.300> 45<00:02:36.290> comma<00:02:36.620> point<00:02:36.980> finishes

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
you've got those 45 comma point finishes

you've got those 45 comma point finishes
so<00:02:38.890> realistically<00:02:39.890> you're<00:02:40.880> spamming

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
so realistically you're spamming

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.390 
so realistically you're spamming
hemorrhage<00:02:41.780> anyway<00:02:42.440> because<00:02:42.860> hemorrhage

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
hemorrhage anyway because hemorrhage

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.690 
hemorrhage anyway because hemorrhage
costs<00:02:43.790> less<00:02:44.180> energy<00:02:44.780> than<00:02:44.959> backs<00:02:45.890> them<00:02:46.160> even

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
costs less energy than backs them even

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.410 
costs less energy than backs them even
though<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.910> does<00:02:47.060> slightly<00:02:47.540> less<00:02:47.750> damage<00:02:48.230> it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
though it does slightly less damage it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.449 
though it does slightly less damage it
it<00:02:50.420> just<00:02:50.480> generates<00:02:50.989> those<00:02:51.470> combo<00:02:51.890> points<00:02:52.130> a

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
it just generates those combo points a

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.760 
it just generates those combo points a
lot<00:02:53.270> quicker<00:02:53.569> so<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:53.989> can<00:02:54.260> get<00:02:54.410> all<00:02:54.470> those

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
lot quicker so you can get all those

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.540 
lot quicker so you can get all those
finishes<00:02:55.340> out<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:56.320> it's<00:02:57.320> yeah<00:02:58.040> it's<00:02:58.070> just<00:02:58.459> the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
finishes out and it's yeah it's just the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.040 
finishes out and it's yeah it's just the
way<00:02:58.670> I've<00:02:58.760> been<00:02:58.910> playing<00:02:59.120> now<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.720> this

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
way I've been playing now that this

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.130 
way I've been playing now that this
isn't<00:03:00.470> necessarily<00:03:01.220> all<00:03:02.180> scientifically

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
isn't necessarily all scientifically

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.800 
isn't necessarily all scientifically
tested<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.130> whatnot<00:03:04.550> but<00:03:05.180> I've<00:03:05.330> been<00:03:05.540> finding

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
tested and whatnot but I've been finding

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.840 
tested and whatnot but I've been finding
it<00:03:05.989> works<00:03:06.260> really<00:03:06.620> well<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:08.330> be<00:03:09.519> remiss<00:03:10.519> if

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
it works really well and I be remiss if

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.000 
it works really well and I be remiss if
I<00:03:11.060> didn't<00:03:11.420> share<00:03:11.989> with<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.319> or<00:03:12.530> at<00:03:12.800> least
