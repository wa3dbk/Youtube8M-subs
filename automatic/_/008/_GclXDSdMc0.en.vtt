00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello to all and welcome to fon 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.929
 test do for this new video 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.600
 test 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.269
 this time it's a taste phone 6 5 it's 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.150
 so I'm testing the clone of the iphone 5 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.549
 So here we see the box 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.470
 true to the original plastic with 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.320
 the different logos everywhere 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.910
 in the back we have the information we 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.289
 could find on the real so that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.029
 anyway they are busy 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.740
 caves in general it's not invested on the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.070
 small loading cap so we find 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.770
 in the 8 pin box so that's the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.059
 apple lightning cable that's attention 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.800
 they are very fragile on the coop it 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.500
 do not get caught up in what 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.120
 otherwise it breaks easily 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.950
 tunes buddy with the apple logo just 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.059
 behind so it's headphones from 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.160
 fairly average quality 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.559
 it will just serve to make calls and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.780
 without which it is not at all 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.219
 true there is a load hours that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.930
 provides with whom absolutely useless in 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.789
 europe for most people since 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.199
 there is no grounding the priest 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.550
 rci in the east by the way a small hole 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.750
 there that allows to put the pico of this 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.789
 type there that is on your catches 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.650
 alas it is not there so it will not happen 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.049
 not on most European catches 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.229
 So here we have to take another 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.720
 charger that this one then found 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.450
 the manual with the little leprechaun extractor 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.790
 of target so the classic manual 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.439
 the apple 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.390
 what more can that say is neither more nor 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.140
 less than a copy-pasted manual that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.270
 could find in the original brief 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.520
 nothing really interesting 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.740
 so here we find the phone 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.630
 So a phone that is pretty enough 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.600
 glass under coucy 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.600
 here on the back we see the logo 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.380
 apple the mention iphone there the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.509
 small mentions 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.060
 made by apple in california seemed in 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.979
 digital what broken shoulder assembled 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.729
 in China which took a small mistake on 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.320
 the top all texts and logo sound 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.439
 polish on it so it really does 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.000
 a rendering similar to the original and we 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.350
 can make sure that it will not go on 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.899
 can be assured that it will not go away 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.399
 with the scratches the keys by 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.750
 example I do not know what will not go 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.610
 not that it's not just printed on it 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.080
 So here we are behind 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.670
 the camera that is a camera 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.899
 photo of about 5 megapixels this is 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.160
 hard to know about phones 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.269
 Chinese but the equivalent what I have 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.150
 found in relation to the quality that it 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.890
 actually gives roughly 5 megapixels a 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.290
 flash led 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.370
 on the sides we have the button volume + - 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.700
 the little switch for the muffler there the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:32.080
 new power there the small and the small 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.720
 trolley sim the speaker the port for 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.329
 load in lightning then surrendered screws 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.700
 crucifixe levis who are there it's not 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.590
 as on the original the original is 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.250
 davis tenta loeb and the cruciform cdu 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.420
 as you see it 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.459
 here we have the microphone and there we have 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.340
 the port for the jack 3 5 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.030
 So here we go check for the little 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.720
 sim cart 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.970
 if it's nice of the nano simpar 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.350
 whose announced hatred of sim and 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.030
 so as we see it's a whole 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.220
 little cart for a little sim 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.650
 actually a nano sim 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.079
 that's the phone that's already 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.299
 lit up this is like that then 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.370
 unlike the five is what 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.620
 I had had no rebound there the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.850
 trick falls down but against 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.680
 when we unlock we have 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.100
 the animation of the icons that makes quite 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.600
 nice at the processor 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.030
 it's exactly the same processor as 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.690
 in the five cases that I had received 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.310
 so that mtq to 65.72 if my memories 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.190
 are good 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.989
 it's clocked at 2 x 1,2 war it's a 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.849
 dual core that's it's largely 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.180
 enough for the screen resolution that 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.770
 it's managing its 840 by 480 something 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.090
 like that it's not monstrous either 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.319
 but on this screen size it goes 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.530
 no problem and it gives an image that 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.019
 is pretty neat enough is pretty 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.840
 we have the classic applications the 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:00.010
 phone then the claf ios that's it 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.870
 it's copper is what everybody 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.900
 knows we have most applications 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.950
 that we could find on the real 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.130
 iphone it's exactly the same 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.840
 presentation we have the small center of 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.150
 notify the unification center sambre 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.940
 to manage all the wifi the bluetooth 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.900
 the standby mode all this the quick access 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.510
 to flashes 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.310
 So here is a flash a led is 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.680
 powerful but good no more 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.810
 quick access to music all that's it 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.389
 so then especially when we're doing 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.350
 over there we spotted the android so 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.729
 I do not have the center of 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.720
 notifications it's a phone that has 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.460
 summer that was lent to me 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.870
 so it was bought at the same time 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.039
 almost at the same time as the 5th what 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.080
 I had received who had not 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.280
 again the update here but for 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.760
 the moment I did not find how the 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.050
 do that then when we do that if 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.789
 all is well we end up with the 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.990
 search bar that is no longer on the 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.970
 side as on old iphone 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.590
 the stop like that that's good copy on 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.780
 still has an android keyboard 1 that's 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.669
 not the keyboard of ios on this one 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.940
 it's really not enough 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.440
 looking like that so we're going 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.650
 to do a little is quickly done at the level 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.940
 music or see the quality of sound 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.940
 then tac tac tac tac tac 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.290
 it's a pretty pretty high sound it's not 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.790
 very pretty it's a phone sound what 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.100
 it's not extraordinary 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.870
 here we are going to watch a small video 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:48.669
 to appreciate a little the quality of 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:48.669
 the screen we have a good viewing angle 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.830
 there is a screen as you see psa 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.270
 at level 2 viewing angles it 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.830
 stays clean no matter what happens there is no 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.180
 white veil so it's pretty good 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:10.460
 we'll do a little test of devices 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:13.330
 shot pictures and we'll take this and 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.330
 see what it gives 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.760
 so even now it's still 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.440
 still not too bad we do not see 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.520
 not too much the camera but a small effect 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.650
 staircase anyway we see them 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.660
 sees a few pixels so it's pretty 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.850
 but here it is a 5 megapixel it will be 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.150
 not equivalent to the camera of 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:36.060
 the original that's for sure and certain 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.860
 here is the way to settle 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.680
 the GPS on this phone is exactly 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.080
 the same as the 5 s since it solves 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.710
 most phone problems 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.870
 under media library 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.860
 So here I am not having no 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.190
 network I could not do you the 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.140
 test 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.440
 the app store refers to the store price 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.760
 of course as on the com on the 5 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.410
 did I actually have a 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.690
 phone that is very similar since 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.360
 at the level of the Roma we have almost the 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.890
 even to say that it's the same 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.720
 here are some small differences 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.540
 mérienne well does not bring anything good 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.830
 important the main points are 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.510
 the camera that is still a 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.030
 not as good as on the 5 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.230
 aces but that I already knew before tc this 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.550
 5- piece phone still with a 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.490
 superior camera what is being done 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:20.700
 in Chinese phones in general and 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.380
 this one is still more fluid than 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.500
 the 5th is the task manager 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:28.110
 think the same as most copies 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.440
 iphone so it works there is no 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:33.990
 worry so that's okay listen that's all 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.100
 for this test if these loans Fogny 5 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.810
 you want more information you 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.250
 can still comment on the video and 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.100
 ask them and it will be with pleasure 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.050
 you will respond as soon as possible 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.480
 you can also liked the video if 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.490
 you enjoyed of course subscribe to 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.590
 my channel especially and share it as much 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.210
 as possible so that I can not 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.640
 maybe pretend to have some 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.990
 phones to win 2 here's in 

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.300
 partnership with possibly some 

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.400
 sellers so this would be have and more 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.760
 I will have subscribers and it's more likely to 

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.050
 walk 

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.050
 this is goodbye
