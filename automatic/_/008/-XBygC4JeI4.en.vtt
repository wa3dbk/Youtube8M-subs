now<00:00:00.210> I<00:00:00.480> said<00:00:00.930> that<00:00:00.960> Wikipedia<00:00:01.530> has<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.709> very

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
now I said that Wikipedia has a very

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.970 
now I said that Wikipedia has a very
nice<00:00:02.159> page<00:00:02.520> that<00:00:03.090> mentions<00:00:03.540> all<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.500> types<00:00:04.770> of

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
nice page that mentions all the types of

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.059 
nice page that mentions all the types of
hands<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:06.299> also<00:00:06.450> gives<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:07.410> percentages

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
hands and it also gives the percentages

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.070 
hands and it also gives the percentages
for<00:00:08.130> each<00:00:08.340> hand<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.120> out<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.690> all<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
for each hand that is out of all the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.290 
for each hand that is out of all the
possible<00:00:10.469> poker<00:00:10.740> hands<00:00:11.219> what<00:00:11.639> percentage<00:00:12.150> are

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
possible poker hands what percentage are

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.180 
possible poker hands what percentage are
a<00:00:12.630> straight<00:00:12.840> flush<00:00:13.049> four<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.650> kind<00:00:13.830> full

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
a straight flush four of a kind full

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.499 
a straight flush four of a kind full
house<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.210> here's<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
house and so on so here's the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.939 
house and so on so here's the
percentages<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.170> see<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.470> about<00:00:16.590> half<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
percentages we see that about half the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.370 
percentages we see that about half the
hands<00:00:17.520> don't<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.539> anything<00:00:18.779> they're<00:00:19.140> just<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
hands don't have anything they're just a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.900 
hands don't have anything they're just a
high<00:00:19.500> card<00:00:19.770> with<00:00:19.980> no<00:00:20.100> pairs<00:00:20.340> or<00:00:20.520> anything<00:00:20.670> else

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
high card with no pairs or anything else

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.240 
high card with no pairs or anything else
and<00:00:21.180> then<00:00:23.060> 42%<00:00:24.060> are<00:00:24.210> pairs<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.050> then<00:00:25.230> less<00:00:25.740> for

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
and then 42% are pairs and then less for

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.189 
and then 42% are pairs and then less for
each<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.460> those<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:27.119> see<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.660> percentages

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
each of those and we see the percentages

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.919 
each of those and we see the percentages
aligned<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.550> actual<00:00:29.910> poker<00:00:30.449> values

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
aligned with the actual poker values

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.310 
aligned with the actual poker values
that<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.340> most<00:00:33.210> rare<00:00:33.510> hand<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.140> straight

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that is the most rare hand the straight

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.229 
that is the most rare hand the straight
flush<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> highest<00:00:35.280> ranking<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.969> next

is<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.950> least<00:00:41.160> highest<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> makes<00:00:42.210> sense

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
is the least highest so that makes sense

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.479 
is the least highest so that makes sense
poker<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> sensible<00:00:43.350> game<00:00:43.649> from<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> point

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
poker is a sensible game from the point

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.690 
poker is a sensible game from the point
of<00:00:44.610> view<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.940> probability<00:00:45.870> now<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:47.039> thing<00:00:47.160> we

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
of view of probability now one thing we

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.819 
of view of probability now one thing we
can<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.170> duplicate<00:00:49.649> this

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
can do is see if we can duplicate this

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.340 
can do is see if we can duplicate this
type<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> table<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.690> test<00:00:52.170> our

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
type of table that is can we test our

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.889 
type of table that is can we test our
routines<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.129> make<00:00:53.370> sure<00:00:53.629> we've<00:00:54.629> got<00:00:54.809> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
routines and make sure we've got it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.350 
routines and make sure we've got it
right<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.340> identify<00:00:56.879> straight

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
right in that we identify straight

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000 
right in that we identify straight
flushes<00:00:57.629> high<00:00:58.079> cards<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.559> everything<00:00:58.829> else

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
flushes high cards and everything else

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.369 
flushes high cards and everything else
the<00:00:59.579> correct<00:00:59.820> number<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.090> times<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.230> what

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the correct number of times so what

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.869 
the correct number of times so what
we're<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.250> come<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
we're going to do is come up with a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.050 
we're going to do is come up with a
program<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.510> randomly<00:01:03.870> generates<00:01:04.350> decks<00:01:05.309> or

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
program that randomly generates decks or

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.960 
program that randomly generates decks or
deals<00:01:06.479> from<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> deck<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> then<00:01:08.130> checks<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
deals from the deck and then checks to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.300 
deals from the deck and then checks to
see<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.869> kind<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.650> check<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.220> if

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
see what kind it is and check to see if

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
see what kind it is and check to see if
we<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.549> reproduce<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.150> probability<00:01:12.720> table

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
we can reproduce this probability table

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.740 
we can reproduce this probability table
so<00:01:13.770> we're<00:01:13.920> gonna<00:01:14.010> look<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.540> random<00:01:15.540> deal

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
so we're gonna look at random deal

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
so we're gonna look at random deal
percentages<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.710> first<00:01:17.340> we're<00:01:17.430> gonna<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
percentages and first we're gonna have a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.840 
percentages and first we're gonna have a
quiz<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.210> say<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.720> want<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.070> deal<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.520> random

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
quiz so say we want to deal out a random

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.999 
quiz so say we want to deal out a random
number<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.240> hands<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.380> count<00:01:22.770> how<00:01:22.890> many

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
number of hands and then count how many

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.310 
number of hands and then count how many
of<00:01:23.369> each<00:01:23.700> type<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:24.990> come<00:01:25.229> up

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
of each type we have and then come up

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.810 
of each type we have and then come up
with<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.590> table<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.520> saw<00:01:26.670> from

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
with that table like we just saw from

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.390 
with that table like we just saw from
Wikipedia<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> question<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.380> about<00:01:28.829> how

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
Wikipedia and the question is about how

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.270 
Wikipedia and the question is about how
many<00:01:29.880> hands<00:01:30.420> should<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.750> deal<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
many hands should we deal out to get a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
many hands should we deal out to get a
good<00:01:32.729> estimate<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> probabilities<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
good estimate of the probabilities that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.630 
good estimate of the probabilities that
is<00:01:34.380> we're<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> exact

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
is we're not going to get the exact

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520 
is we're not going to get the exact
estimate<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:36.960> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.320> some

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
estimate but we want to get some

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.560 
estimate but we want to get some
estimates<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.159> are<00:01:38.579> close<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> right

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
estimates that are close to the right

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.350 
estimates that are close to the right
probabilities<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.950> more<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.310> sample<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
probabilities and the more we sample the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
closer we'll get should we look at about

closer we'll get should we look at about
