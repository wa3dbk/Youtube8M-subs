we'll<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.780> how<00:01:36.899> it<00:01:36.990> works<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.860> neat<00:01:38.040> thing

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
we'll see how it works the neat thing

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.490 
we'll see how it works the neat thing
about<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.659> blade<00:01:39.869> goes<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
about this is that the blade goes so

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.330 
about this is that the blade goes so
fast<00:01:41.119> that<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.600> will<00:01:42.659> actually<00:01:43.530> generate<00:01:43.710> heat

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
fast that it will actually generate heat

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.959 
fast that it will actually generate heat
but<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.630> vets<00:01:46.110> fruits<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.979> vegetables<00:01:47.610> they

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
but the vets fruits and vegetables they

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.760 
but the vets fruits and vegetables they
don't<00:01:48.290> get<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:50.219> hot<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.549> you're<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.420> past<00:01:51.770> 118

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
don't get so hot that you're up past 118

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.090 
don't get so hot that you're up past 118
degrees<00:01:52.890> or<00:01:53.520> whatever<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.890> nutrients<00:01:55.890> start

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
degrees or whatever the nutrients start

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.730 
degrees or whatever the nutrients start
to<00:01:56.219> break<00:01:56.399> down<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:58.020> actually<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to break down so it actually is a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.969 
to break down so it actually is a
considered<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.610> raw<00:01:59.820> soup<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.500> we'll<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:01.860> how

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
considered a raw soup so we'll see how

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.010 
considered a raw soup so we'll see how
that<00:02:02.130> worked<00:02:02.310> except<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.880> chicken<00:02:03.210> um

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
