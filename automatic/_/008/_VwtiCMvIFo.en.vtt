here<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.320> later<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:54.470> it's<00:01:55.470> just

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
here you will get it later so it's just

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.469 
here you will get it later so it's just
this<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.159> kind<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.460> an<00:01:56.610> added<00:01:56.909> bonus<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
this is kind of like an added bonus and

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.860 
this is kind of like an added bonus and
here's<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> hard<00:01:57.899> container<00:01:58.259> right<00:01:58.469> now

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
here's the hard container right now

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.450 
here's the hard container right now
it's<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.500> first<00:01:59.710> one<00:01:59.860> I've<00:01:59.890> gotten<00:02:00.370> that

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
it's the first one I've gotten that

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.240 
it's the first one I've gotten that
probably<00:02:00.880> won't<00:02:01.000> get<00:02:01.120> to<00:02:01.180> too<00:02:01.600> many<00:02:01.750> more<00:02:02.250> but

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
probably won't get to too many more but

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.800 
probably won't get to too many more but
yeah<00:02:03.490> they're<00:02:03.730> nice<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:04.030> have<00:02:04.210> nice<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.750> a

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
yeah they're nice to have nice in a

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.430 
yeah they're nice to have nice in a
pinch<00:02:05.430> yeah<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:07.360> upgrade<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.110> nice<00:02:08.290> to

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
pinch yeah the the upgrade is nice to

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.440 
pinch yeah the the upgrade is nice to
get<00:02:08.590> as<00:02:08.800> soon<00:02:08.979> as<00:02:09.100> poss<00:02:09.310> possible<00:02:10.119> because<00:02:10.390> it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
get as soon as poss possible because it

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.800 
get as soon as poss possible because it
just<00:02:10.540> makes<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.900> game<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.380> little<00:02:11.710> bit<00:02:12.160> easier

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
just makes the game a little bit easier

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.240 
just makes the game a little bit easier
now<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.930> point<00:02:14.230> I'm<00:02:14.320> pretty<00:02:14.500> convinced<00:02:14.830> that

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
now this point I'm pretty convinced that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.030 
now this point I'm pretty convinced that
there's<00:02:15.490> an<00:02:15.940> energy<00:02:16.180> tank<00:02:16.810> if<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.680> just<00:02:17.860> work

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
there's an energy tank if you just work

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.410 
there's an energy tank if you just work
your<00:02:18.190> way<00:02:18.310> through<00:02:18.340> these<00:02:18.700> miners<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.270> go

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
your way through these miners and go

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.120 
your way through these miners and go
over<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.780> top<00:02:19.960> but<00:02:20.260> I'm<00:02:20.410> pretty<00:02:20.680> sure<00:02:20.950> my

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
over the top but I'm pretty sure my

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.820 
over the top but I'm pretty sure my
search<00:02:21.490> comes<00:02:21.880> up<00:02:22.090> fruitless<00:02:22.720> which<00:02:23.680> was

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
search comes up fruitless which was

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.200 
search comes up fruitless which was
disappointing<00:02:24.100> for<00:02:24.490> me<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.700> then<00:02:24.790> after<00:02:25.150> I

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
disappointing for me and then after I

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.510 
disappointing for me and then after I
finished<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:25.840> was<00:02:26.710> thinking<00:02:27.070> about<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.400> and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
finished I I was thinking about it and

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.920 
finished I I was thinking about it and
I'm<00:02:27.610> pretty<00:02:27.850> sure<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.330> there<00:02:28.480> actually<00:02:28.600> is

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
I'm pretty sure that there actually is

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.200 
I'm pretty sure that there actually is
an<00:02:29.110> e-tank<00:02:29.470> here<00:02:29.770> I<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:30.460> did<00:02:30.640> not<00:02:30.790> take<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
an e-tank here I just did not take the

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.110 
an e-tank here I just did not take the
the<00:02:31.480> leap<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:31.810> faith<00:02:32.080> necessary<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:33.790> get<00:02:33.970> it

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
the leap of faith necessary to get it

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.700 
the leap of faith necessary to get it
and<00:02:34.330> said<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.570> ended<00:02:34.840> up<00:02:34.900> with<00:02:35.050> just<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.350> one<00:02:35.560> up

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
and said I ended up with just a one up

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.200 
and said I ended up with just a one up
so<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:35.980> think<00:02:36.190> if<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.310> jump<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.820> left<00:02:36.850> here

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
so I think if you jump to the left here

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.710 
so I think if you jump to the left here
you<00:02:37.330> can<00:02:37.450> get<00:02:37.570> an<00:02:37.660> e-tank<00:02:37.990> pretty<00:02:38.260> easily<00:02:38.500> but

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
you can get an e-tank pretty easily but

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.580 
you can get an e-tank pretty easily but
unfortunately<00:02:40.720> i<00:02:40.750> was<00:02:40.990> i<00:02:41.200> was<00:02:41.350> playing

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
unfortunately i was i was playing

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.800 
unfortunately i was i was playing
conservatively<00:02:42.270> they<00:02:43.270> didn't<00:02:43.450> want<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.660> have

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
conservatively they didn't want to have

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.450 
conservatively they didn't want to have
another<00:02:43.840> embarrassing<00:02:44.590> accident<00:02:45.100> like<00:02:45.220> i<00:02:45.310> had

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
another embarrassing accident like i had

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.840 
another embarrassing accident like i had
in<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:45.730> storm<00:02:46.570> ecoute<00:02:46.930> video<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.620> dying<00:02:48.460> for

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
in that storm ecoute video and dying for

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.120 
in that storm ecoute video and dying for
basically<00:02:49.210> no<00:02:49.330> reason<00:02:49.750> but<00:02:50.500> in<00:02:50.590> any<00:02:50.710> case<00:02:50.770> I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
basically no reason but in any case I

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.120 
basically no reason but in any case I
digress<00:02:51.840> yeah<00:02:52.840> we're<00:02:53.020> approaching<00:02:53.710> the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
digress yeah we're approaching the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.700 
digress yeah we're approaching the
halfway<00:02:54.250> point<00:02:54.490> of<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.880> stage<00:02:55.090> right<00:02:55.300> now<00:02:55.710> the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
halfway point of the stage right now the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.650 
halfway point of the stage right now the
fact<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.100> all<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:57.460> stuff<00:02:57.520> is<00:02:57.880> frozen<00:02:58.300> means

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
fact that all this stuff is frozen means

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.620 
fact that all this stuff is frozen means
I<00:02:58.930> really<00:02:59.200> should<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.800> walking<00:03:00.630> under

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
I really should just be walking under

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.210 
I really should just be walking under
these<00:03:01.810> instead<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.530> taking<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.920> risk<00:03:03.100> of

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
these instead of taking the risk of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.770 
these instead of taking the risk of
getting<00:03:03.340> hit<00:03:03.670> like<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.970> did<00:03:04.120> right<00:03:04.270> there<00:03:04.300> but

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
getting hit like I did right there but

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.940 
getting hit like I did right there but
uh<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.680> know<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:07.840> don't<00:03:08.500> really<00:03:08.590> know<00:03:08.770> what<00:03:08.890> to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
uh you know I don't really know what to

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.170 
uh you know I don't really know what to
say<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.130> have<00:03:09.340> nothing<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.640> offer<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:10.090> my

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
say I have nothing to offer in my

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.840 
say I have nothing to offer in my
defense<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:11.290> was<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.500> poor<00:03:12.130> selection<00:03:12.489> on<00:03:12.730> my

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
defense it was a poor selection on my

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.770 
defense it was a poor selection on my
pod<00:03:13.590> all<00:03:14.590> right<00:03:14.739> now<00:03:14.860> this<00:03:15.040> part<00:03:15.310> is

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
pod all right now this part is

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.760 
pod all right now this part is
relatively<00:03:16.780> easy<00:03:16.900> all<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.320> have<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.530> do<00:03:17.650> is

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
relatively easy all you have to do is

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.160 
relatively easy all you have to do is
avoid<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.220> be<00:03:18.370> spikes<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.690> course<00:03:19.930> the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
avoid to be spikes and of course the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.260 
avoid to be spikes and of course the
lava<00:03:20.590> that's<00:03:20.890> stripping<00:03:21.100> down<00:03:21.340> from<00:03:22.090> those

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
lava that's stripping down from those

and<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:33.010> secret<00:03:33.489> with<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.730> spikes<00:03:34.000> is<00:03:34.209> that

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
and the secret with the spikes is that

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.170 
and the secret with the spikes is that
they<00:03:34.890> change<00:03:35.890> directions<00:03:36.310> whenever<00:03:36.790> they<00:03:36.940> hit

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
they change directions whenever they hit

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.400 
they change directions whenever they hit
a<00:03:37.860> lava<00:03:38.860> drop<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.300> can<00:03:40.570> usually<00:03:40.750> time<00:03:41.260> your

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
a lava drop so you can usually time your

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.840 
a lava drop so you can usually time your
jumps<00:03:41.709> pretty<00:03:41.920> well<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.580> most<00:03:42.700> part

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
jumps pretty well and for the most part

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.890 
jumps pretty well and for the most part
you<00:03:43.060> should<00:03:43.090> be<00:03:43.300> able<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.510> get<00:03:43.630> through<00:03:43.870> here

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
you should be able to get through here

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.560 
you should be able to get through here
without<00:03:44.290> getting<00:03:44.440> hit<00:03:45.060> although<00:03:46.060> again<00:03:46.180> as<00:03:46.540> a

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
without getting hit although again as a

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
ball stir that was poor form on life

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.850 
ball stir that was poor form on life
and<00:04:02.490> in<00:04:02.580> any<00:04:02.670> case<00:04:02.760> odd<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:04.260> can<00:04:04.410> use<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.709> Mega

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
and in any case odd you can use the Mega

Buster flame ma'am if you'll probably be

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.589 
Buster flame ma'am if you'll probably be
fine<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.770> mean<00:04:08.069> he's<00:04:08.190> not<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.550> difficult<00:04:08.819> but

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
fine I mean he's not that difficult but

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.949 
fine I mean he's not that difficult but
it's<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.930> lot<00:04:10.110> easier<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.709> just<00:04:11.280> use<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:12.180> storm

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
it's a lot easier to just use a storm

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.510 
it's a lot easier to just use a storm
Eagles<00:04:13.380> attack<00:04:13.680> because<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.069> won't<00:04:14.310> end<00:04:14.430> up

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
Eagles attack because you won't end up

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.550 
Eagles attack because you won't end up
getting<00:04:14.790> hit<00:04:14.910> like<00:04:14.940> at<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.390> let's<00:04:16.260> switch<00:04:16.530> to

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
getting hit like at it let's switch to

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.650 
getting hit like at it let's switch to
that<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:16.950> bat<00:04:17.700> method<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.150> choice<00:04:18.329> at<00:04:18.570> this

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
that a bat method of choice at this

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.120 
that a bat method of choice at this
point<00:04:18.780> basically<00:04:19.590> what<00:04:19.769> we're<00:04:19.859> going<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.040> do

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
point basically what we're going to do

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.730 
point basically what we're going to do
is<00:04:20.280> just<00:04:20.459> use<00:04:20.669> our<00:04:20.820> new<00:04:21.000> upgrade<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:22.440> using

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
is just use our new upgrade and using

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.610 
is just use our new upgrade and using
secondary<00:04:22.950> fire<00:04:23.490> on<00:04:23.820> storm<00:04:24.300> tornados<00:04:24.840> attack

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
secondary fire on storm tornados attack

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.550 
secondary fire on storm tornados attack
and<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:27.120> will<00:04:27.240> cause<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.450> vertical<00:04:28.110> tornado

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
and this will cause a vertical tornado

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.940 
and this will cause a vertical tornado
to<00:04:28.760> basically<00:04:29.760> this<00:04:29.970> ruins<00:04:30.360> day<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:31.440> downside

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
to basically this ruins day the downside

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.360 
to basically this ruins day the downside
is<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.700> takes<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.479> long<00:04:33.720> time<00:04:34.010> but<00:04:35.010> it's

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
is that it takes a long time but it's

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.800 
is that it takes a long time but it's
also<00:04:35.550> extremely<00:04:36.350> extremely<00:04:37.350> safe<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:39.690> are

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
also extremely extremely safe you are

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.440 
also extremely extremely safe you are
not<00:04:40.020> really<00:04:40.460> under<00:04:41.460> any<00:04:41.610> threat<00:04:41.700> at<00:04:42.060> all<00:04:42.210> as

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
not really under any threat at all as

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.560 
not really under any threat at all as
long<00:04:42.510> as<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:42.930> just<00:04:42.960> keep<00:04:43.229> climbing<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.710> wall

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
long as you just keep climbing the wall

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.730 
long as you just keep climbing the wall
so<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.630> always<00:04:45.840> thought<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.020> play<00:04:46.350> mammoth

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
so I always thought that play mammoth

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.800 
so I always thought that play mammoth
got<00:04:46.919> kind<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.220> raw<00:04:47.400> deal<00:04:47.460> if<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.419> if<00:04:48.690> you

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
got kind of a raw deal if you if you

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.570 
got kind of a raw deal if you if you
took<00:04:48.960> this<00:04:49.169> path<00:04:49.410> because<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:50.190> never<00:04:50.310> even

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
took this path because you never even

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.310 
took this path because you never even
really<00:04:50.880> got<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.150> see<00:04:51.330> his<00:04:51.690> other<00:04:51.900> attacker

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
really got to see his other attacker

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.020 
really got to see his other attacker
just<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.710> shoot<00:04:52.860> fire<00:04:53.220> at<00:04:53.430> you<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.700> just<00:04:53.880> kind

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
just to shoot fire at you you just kind

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.290 
just to shoot fire at you you just kind
of<00:04:54.260> jump<00:04:55.260> set<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:55.710> like<00:04:55.889> an<00:04:56.010> idiot<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.490> you

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
of jump set you like an idiot and you

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.210 
of jump set you like an idiot and you
take<00:04:57.570> him<00:04:57.750> down<00:04:57.990> without<00:04:58.320> too<00:04:58.530> much<00:04:58.650> effort<00:04:58.710> in

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
take him down without too much effort in

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.000 
take him down without too much effort in
the<00:04:59.370> least<00:05:02.419> so<00:05:03.419> yes<00:05:03.600> we<00:05:03.840> are<00:05:04.050> almost<00:05:04.350> halfway

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
the least so yes we are almost halfway

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.040 
the least so yes we are almost halfway
through<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.789> robot<00:05:06.120> masters<00:05:06.539> at<00:05:06.660> this<00:05:06.780> point

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
through the robot masters at this point

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.560 
through the robot masters at this point
and<00:05:07.289> this<00:05:08.190> is<00:05:08.340> kind<00:05:08.520> of<00:05:08.580> where<00:05:08.729> my<00:05:08.880> boss<00:05:09.120> order

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
and this is kind of where my boss order

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.070 
and this is kind of where my boss order
falls<00:05:09.930> apart<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.350> little<00:05:10.470> bit<00:05:10.620> because<00:05:11.930> I'm<00:05:12.930> not

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
falls apart a little bit because I'm not

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.779 
falls apart a little bit because I'm not
really<00:05:13.229> gunning<00:05:13.800> for<00:05:14.010> upgrades<00:05:14.460> at<00:05:14.669> this

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
really gunning for upgrades at this

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.610 
really gunning for upgrades at this
point<00:05:15.090> I'm<00:05:15.330> just<00:05:15.510> gonna<00:05:15.600> do<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.020> in<00:05:16.169> the<00:05:16.320> order

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
point I'm just gonna do it in the order

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.450 
point I'm just gonna do it in the order
that<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:17.720> that<00:05:18.720> weapon<00:05:19.140> efficiency<00:05:19.800> goes<00:05:20.039> so

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
that the that weapon efficiency goes so

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.950 
that the that weapon efficiency goes so
you<00:05:20.789> know<00:05:20.880> next<00:05:21.210> I<00:05:21.270> will<00:05:21.330> be<00:05:21.479> doing<00:05:21.630> spark

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
you know next I will be doing spark

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.469 
you know next I will be doing spark
mandril<00:05:22.470> and<00:05:22.880> after<00:05:23.880> that<00:05:23.910> i<00:05:24.060> will<00:05:24.210> be<00:05:24.390> using
