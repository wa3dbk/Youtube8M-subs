and<00:01:18.600> they're<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.320> powerful<00:01:19.580> because<00:01:20.580> they

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
and they're more powerful because they

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.179

have infinite damage they never go lower
in<00:01:23.430> damage<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:25.460> ya<00:01:26.460> also<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> wave<00:01:27.450> gun

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
in damage and ya also with the wave gun

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
in damage and ya also with the wave gun
that<00:01:27.960> also<00:01:28.200> has<00:01:28.320> infinite<00:01:28.710> damage<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> damage

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that also has infinite damage the damage

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
that also has infinite damage the damage
will<00:01:29.670> never<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.030> down<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.570> always<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.869> one

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
will never go down it will always be one

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.499 
will never go down it will always be one
hit<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.650> kill<00:01:32.000> then<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.299> pack<00:01:33.479> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
hit one kill then when it's pack a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.219 
hit one kill then when it's pack a
punched<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.500> becomes<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.729> max<00:01:36.329> wave<00:01:36.600> gun<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
punched it becomes the max wave gun and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.149 
punched it becomes the max wave gun and
the<00:01:38.070> zap<00:01:38.430> guns<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.790> think<00:01:38.970> become<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> Porter<00:01:40.159> X

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the zap guns I think become the Porter X

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.830 
the zap guns I think become the Porter X
-<00:01:41.490> zap<00:01:41.729> gun<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.150> basically<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.630> same

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
- zap gun so basically it's the same

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.179 
- zap gun so basically it's the same
thing<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> array<00:01:43.710> gun<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> ray

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
thing as like the array gun and the ray

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.490 
thing as like the array gun and the ray
gun<00:01:44.369> supporter<00:01:44.880> X<00:01:45.119> -<00:01:45.540> Riggins<00:01:45.869> pack<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> punch

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
gun supporter X - Riggins pack a punch

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.319 
gun supporter X - Riggins pack a punch
and<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.740> zap<00:01:46.950> guns<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.820> same<00:01:48.000> exact

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and the zap guns have the same exact

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.270 
and the zap guns have the same exact
kind<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.659> name<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.079> them<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.040> basically

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
kind of name to them so basically

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
kind of name to them so basically
they're<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:51.299> close<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.869> could<00:01:52.020> be

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
they're really like close they could be

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.410 
they're really like close they could be
like<00:01:52.290> cousins<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:52.979> brothers<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.759> something<00:01:53.970> if

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
like cousins or brothers or something if

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.910 
like cousins or brothers or something if
users<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.140> say<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:55.619> some<00:01:55.649> odd

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
users like to say that for some odd

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.440 
users like to say that for some odd
reason<00:01:56.930> then<00:01:57.930> when<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> wave<00:01:59.490> wave<00:01:59.969> guns<00:02:00.240> pack

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
reason then when the wave wave guns pack

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.039 
reason then when the wave wave guns pack
a<00:02:00.479> punched<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> holds<00:02:01.380> 24<00:02:01.829> total<00:02:02.130> bullets<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
a punched it holds 24 total bullets and

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.740 
a punched it holds 24 total bullets and
the<00:02:04.049> zap<00:02:04.259> guns<00:02:04.500> hold<00:02:04.770> 144<00:02:05.700> total<00:02:06.180> bullets<00:02:06.479> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the zap guns hold 144 total bullets and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.180 
the zap guns hold 144 total bullets and
I<00:02:06.810> forgot<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.079> mention<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.469> before<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.979> zap

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
I forgot to mention this before the zap

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.540 
I forgot to mention this before the zap
guns

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
guns

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.449 
guns
dual<00:02:09.119> wielded<00:02:09.599> non<00:02:10.170> upgraded<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.800> hold<00:02:10.950> 96

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
dual wielded non upgraded to hold 96

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.430 
dual wielded non upgraded to hold 96
shots<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.330> believe<00:02:12.599> they<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:12.900> 6<00:02:13.140> there

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
shots and I believe they have 6 there

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.090 
shots and I believe they have 6 there
clip<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.780> basically<00:02:16.020> what<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.260> gun<00:02:16.470> does<00:02:16.740> the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
clip so basically what this gun does the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.980 
clip so basically what this gun does the
what<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> waveone<00:02:17.550> does<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.300> when<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.690> go<00:02:18.840> and

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
what the waveone does is when you go and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.680 
what the waveone does is when you go and
shoot<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.260> zombie<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.830> basically<00:02:20.640> hits<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
shoot a zombie it basically hits the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.780 
shoot a zombie it basically hits the
zombie<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.230> any<00:02:22.860> zombies<00:02:23.280> around<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.700> it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
zombie and any zombies around it that it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.520 
zombie and any zombies around it that it
may<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:24.030> hit<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.510> basically<00:02:24.900> zombie<00:02:25.140> starts

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
may have hit it basically zombie starts

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.890 
may have hit it basically zombie starts
to<00:02:25.680> puff<00:02:25.920> up<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.310> float<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.940> air<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.450> then

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
to puff up and float in the air and then

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.780 
to puff up and float in the air and then
they'll<00:02:28.380> blow<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.010> then<00:02:29.190> make<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> dig<00:02:29.640> know

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
they'll blow up and then make a dig know

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.430 
they'll blow up and then make a dig know
is<00:02:29.940> kind<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.360> like<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> microwave<00:02:30.990> effect

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
is kind of like a microwave effect

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.920 
is kind of like a microwave effect
basically<00:02:31.980> they<00:02:32.220> rise<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.850> then<00:02:33.270> they<00:02:33.390> expand

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
basically they rise and then they expand

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.990 
basically they rise and then they expand
and<00:02:34.170> then<00:02:34.350> they<00:02:34.500> explode<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.550> dinging

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
and then they explode like a dinging

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.030 
and then they explode like a dinging
noise<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:36.870> really<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.440> kind<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.830> fun

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
noise and it's really it's kind of fun

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.320 
noise and it's really it's kind of fun
just<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.280> listen<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> ding-ding-ding

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
just to listen to the ding-ding-ding

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.090 
just to listen to the ding-ding-ding
didn't<00:02:39.660> go<00:02:39.780> off<00:02:39.990> or<00:02:40.260> ping<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:40.770> whatever<00:02:41.010> you

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100

didn't go off or ping or whatever you
want<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.610> say<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:44.210> then<00:02:45.210> with<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.660> zap<00:02:45.840> guns

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
want to say it is then with the zap guns

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.050 
want to say it is then with the zap guns
basically<00:02:46.860> basically<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.370> Zygons<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.910> just

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
basically basically the Zygons is just

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.760 
basically basically the Zygons is just
the<00:02:48.150> same<00:02:48.330> thing<00:02:48.540> as<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> wonder<00:02:49.200> waffle<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
the same thing as a wonder waffle and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.160 
the same thing as a wonder waffle and
the<00:02:50.220> wave<00:02:50.400> gun<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.940> kind<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.780> Thunder

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
the wave gun is kind of like the Thunder

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.320 
the wave gun is kind of like the Thunder
gun<00:02:52.350> except<00:02:52.830> it's<00:02:53.100> uh<00:02:53.190> takes<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.910> lot<00:02:54.030> longer<00:02:54.180> to

gun except it's uh takes a lot longer to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.480 
gun except it's uh takes a lot longer to
kill<00:02:54.540> them<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:55.140> they<00:02:55.230> do<00:02:55.350> die<00:02:55.530> instantly<00:02:56.040> they

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
kill them but they do die instantly they

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.040 
kill them but they do die instantly they
just<00:02:56.760> take<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.000> while<00:02:57.210> cuz<00:02:57.420> they<00:02:57.510> float<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:57.960> the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
just take a while cuz they float in the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.750 
just take a while cuz they float in the
air<00:02:58.080> which<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.770> be<00:02:58.920> really<00:02:59.190> annoying<00:02:59.460> if<00:02:59.670> you

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
air which can be really annoying if you

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.280 
air which can be really annoying if you
want<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.060> run<00:03:00.240> past<00:03:00.510> them<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.930> they're<00:03:01.200> kind

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
of floating your heads you can't really

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.750 
of floating your heads you can't really
see<00:03:02.700> past<00:03:02.940> them<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:03.890> um<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.100> guess<00:03:05.430> it's<00:03:05.610> kind

like calling it has the damage on this
gun<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:18.030> kind<00:03:18.270> of<00:03:18.300> interesting

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
gun is kind of interesting

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.130 
gun is kind of interesting
basically<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.920> damage<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.550> zero<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.390> I'm

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
basically the damage is zero and I'm

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.930 
basically the damage is zero and I'm
only<00:03:22.320> saying<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.709> because<00:03:22.770> all<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.580> does<00:03:23.730> is

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
only saying this because all it does is

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.880 
only saying this because all it does is
shrink<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.360> zombies<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.260> they're<00:03:25.470> one<00:03:25.680> hit

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
shrink the zombies so they're one hit

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.370 
shrink the zombies so they're one hit
one<00:03:26.070> kill<00:03:26.340> when<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.790> run<00:03:27.239> over<00:03:27.510> them<00:03:27.840> so

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
one kill when you run over them so

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.750 
one kill when you run over them so
basically<00:03:28.590> what<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.800> do<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.310> get<00:03:29.550> up<00:03:29.640> a

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
basically what you do is you get up a

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.060 
basically what you do is you get up a
horde<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.510> zombies<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.959> get<00:03:31.080> like<00:03:31.230> 20<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:31.920> them

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
horde of zombies you get like 20 of them

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.650 
horde of zombies you get like 20 of them
in<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.160> horde<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.550> shoot<00:03:32.730> all<00:03:32.850> 20<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.239> them<00:03:33.330> all

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
in a horde you shoot all 20 of them all

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.570 
in a horde you shoot all 20 of them all
20<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.140> them<00:03:34.320> shrink<00:03:34.560> down<00:03:34.830> like<00:03:35.100> little<00:03:35.370> baby

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
20 of them shrink down like little baby

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.790 
20 of them shrink down like little baby
size<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.270> what<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.020> do<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.530> run

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
size and what you do is you just run

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.979 
size and what you do is you just run
into<00:03:38.100> them<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.430> you'll<00:03:38.850> kill<00:03:39.060> them<00:03:39.209> kind<00:03:39.870> of

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
into them and you'll kill them kind of

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.650 
into them and you'll kill them kind of
like<00:03:40.110> how<00:03:40.350> in<00:03:40.640> transit<00:03:41.640> zone<00:03:41.850> mode<00:03:42.209> there's<00:03:42.510> a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
like how in transit zone mode there's a

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.330 
like how in transit zone mode there's a
called<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:43.019> red<00:03:43.260> insta-kill<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.980> basically

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
called a red insta-kill and basically

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.640 
called a red insta-kill and basically
with<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:44.519> red<00:03:45.150> insta-kill<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:46.140> just<00:03:46.350> run

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
with that red insta-kill you just run

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.290 
with that red insta-kill you just run
into<00:03:46.950> them<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.220> they<00:03:47.340> die<00:03:47.580> which<00:03:48.120> isn't

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
into them and they die which isn't

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.449 
into them and they die which isn't
really<00:03:48.390> relatable<00:03:48.870> because<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:49.709> know<00:03:49.830> that

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
really relatable because you know that

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.800 
really relatable because you know that
sound<00:03:50.820> kind<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.260> after<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:53.510> shrink<00:03:54.510> ray<00:03:54.630> was

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
sound kind of after the shrink ray was

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.330 
sound kind of after the shrink ray was
invented<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.320> basically<00:03:55.530> rip<00:03:55.980> off<00:03:56.130> with<00:03:56.280> a

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
invented so basically rip off with a

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.920 
invented so basically rip off with a
shrink<00:03:57.030> ray<00:03:57.120> basically<00:03:57.480> same<00:03:57.630> thing<00:03:57.810> isn't

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
shrink ray basically same thing isn't

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.490 
shrink ray basically same thing isn't
great<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:58.610> that's<00:03:59.610> what<00:03:59.820> it<00:03:59.880> is<00:04:00.500> basically

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
great so that's what it is basically

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.750 
great so that's what it is basically
it's<00:04:01.709> really<00:04:01.800> powerful<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.459> does<00:04:02.610> not

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
it's really powerful and it does not

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.520 
it's really powerful and it does not
lose<00:04:02.970> power<00:04:03.239> at<00:04:03.390> all<00:04:03.480> because<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.200> doesn't

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
lose power at all because it doesn't

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.560 
lose power at all because it doesn't
really<00:04:04.620> have<00:04:04.890> power<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.519> then<00:04:05.700> again<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.450> will

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
really have power but then again it will

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.960 
really have power but then again it will
always<00:04:06.750> keep<00:04:06.959> shrinking<00:04:07.140> them<00:04:07.440> with<00:04:07.560> one<00:04:07.739> hit

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
always keep shrinking them with one hit

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.880 
always keep shrinking them with one hit
in<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.090> magazine<00:04:09.510> size<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:10.110> five<00:04:10.590> when<00:04:10.800> it's

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
in the magazine size is five when it's

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.680 
in the magazine size is five when it's
not<00:04:11.070> pack<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.280> punched<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:11.760> eight<00:04:11.910> when<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.540> is

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
not pack a punched in eight when it is

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.080 
not pack a punched in eight when it is
pack<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.019> punched<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.709> then<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.310> magazine<00:04:14.790> and

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
pack a punched and then the magazine and

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.830 
pack a punched and then the magazine and
the<00:04:15.330> maximum<00:04:15.750> amount<00:04:16.230> of<00:04:16.290> ammo

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
the maximum amount of ammo

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.110 
the maximum amount of ammo
it's<00:04:16.989> not<00:04:17.139> packed<00:04:17.380> punch<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.829> 20<00:04:18.190> extra<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:18.820> I

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
it's not packed punch is 20 extra and I

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.120 
it's not packed punch is 20 extra and I
think<00:04:19.359> there's<00:04:19.570> 25<00:04:20.470> because<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:20.889> have<00:04:21.010> the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
think there's 25 because you have the

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.490 
think there's 25 because you have the
other<00:04:21.340> five<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.880> then<00:04:22.660> when<00:04:22.840> it's<00:04:22.990> um

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
other five and then when it's um

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.560 
other five and then when it's um
pack-a-punch<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:24.550> have<00:04:24.639> a<00:04:24.669> total<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.030> 40<00:04:25.419> as

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
pack-a-punch you have a total of 40 as

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.870 
pack-a-punch you have a total of 40 as
well<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.440> it's<00:04:26.979> also<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.250> semi-automatic

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
well and it's also a semi-automatic

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.490 
well and it's also a semi-automatic
weapon<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.419> you<00:04:28.510> could<00:04:28.630> shoot<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:28.930> rapidly<00:04:29.260> if

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
weapon so you could shoot it rapidly if

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.870 
weapon so you could shoot it rapidly if
you<00:04:29.620> really<00:04:29.919> feel<00:04:30.100> like<00:04:30.130> that<00:04:30.280> say<00:04:30.669> if<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.820> get

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
you really feel like that say if you get

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.390 
you really feel like that say if you get
stuck<00:04:31.150> in<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.360> corner<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:32.830> can<00:04:32.979> just<00:04:33.100> shoot<00:04:33.250> it

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
stuck in a corner you can just shoot it

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.990 
stuck in a corner you can just shoot it
really<00:04:33.610> rapidly<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.270> kill<00:04:34.690> him<00:04:37.590> um<00:04:38.590> I'm<00:04:39.000> not

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
really rapidly and kill him um I'm not

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.580 
really rapidly and kill him um I'm not
quite<00:04:40.060> sure<00:04:40.210> how<00:04:40.540> what<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.870> Splash<00:04:41.169> Damage<00:04:41.199> is

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
quite sure how what the Splash Damage is

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.590 
quite sure how what the Splash Damage is
on<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:41.979> gun<00:04:42.220> I've<00:04:42.490> not<00:04:42.760> used<00:04:43.000> it<00:04:43.270> in<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.419> while

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
on this gun I've not used it in a while

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.090 
on this gun I've not used it in a while
and<00:04:43.630> I'm<00:04:43.870> not<00:04:44.020> quite<00:04:44.229> sure<00:04:44.260> exactly<00:04:44.680> what<00:04:45.010> it

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
and I'm not quite sure exactly what it

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.770 
and I'm not quite sure exactly what it
is<00:04:45.190> realest<00:04:45.880> school<00:04:45.910> I<00:04:46.090> do<00:04:46.180> not<00:04:46.449> think<00:04:46.630> there's

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
is realest school I do not think there's

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.450 
is realest school I do not think there's
really<00:04:46.930> any<00:04:47.139> Splash<00:04:47.500> Damage<00:04:47.530> involved<00:04:48.340> with

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
really any Splash Damage involved with

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.860 
really any Splash Damage involved with
the<00:04:48.550> weapon<00:04:48.820> but<00:04:49.180> if<00:04:49.270> there<00:04:49.389> is<00:04:49.510> I<00:04:49.660> really

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
the weapon but if there is I really

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.400 
the weapon but if there is I really
don't<00:04:49.990> think<00:04:50.110> that's<00:04:50.320> that<00:04:50.500> much<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.010> uh

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
don't think that's that much and uh

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.540 
don't think that's that much and uh
basically<00:04:53.410> it's<00:04:53.500> really<00:04:53.830> all<00:04:53.950> I<00:04:53.979> just<00:04:54.280> covered

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
everything with this gun it's kind of a

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.600 
everything with this gun it's kind of a
um<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:58.139> don't<00:04:59.139> really<00:04:59.229> know<00:04:59.440> it's<00:04:59.740> just<00:04:59.830> it's

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
um I don't really know it's just it's

not that interesting oh yeah I forgot
says<00:05:02.410> when<00:05:02.889> you<00:05:03.040> pack<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.430> punch<00:05:03.669> it<00:05:03.790> becomes

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
says when you pack a punch it becomes

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.810 
says when you pack a punch it becomes
the<00:05:04.300> fresh<00:05:04.540> the<00:05:04.960> fractal<00:05:05.650> Iser<00:05:05.860> I<00:05:06.280> forgot<00:05:06.700> to

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
the fresh the fractal Iser I forgot to

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.980 
the fresh the fractal Iser I forgot to
mention<00:05:06.940> that<00:05:07.150> sorry

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990

mention that sorry
that's<00:05:08.500> really<00:05:08.680> all<00:05:08.889> I<00:05:08.950> wanted<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.220> do<00:05:09.310> in<00:05:09.460> this

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
that's really all I wanted to do in this

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.159 
that's really all I wanted to do in this
video<00:05:09.880> well<00:05:10.090> that's<00:05:10.240> basically<00:05:10.450> covering

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
video well that's basically covering

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.870 
video well that's basically covering
everything<00:05:11.410> about<00:05:11.950> these<00:05:12.130> weapons<00:05:12.340> I<00:05:12.669> guess

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
everything about these weapons I guess

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.740 
everything about these weapons I guess
that<00:05:13.270> I<00:05:13.539> felt<00:05:14.320> like<00:05:14.470> covering<00:05:14.949> and<00:05:15.750> leaving

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
that I felt like covering and leaving

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.060 
that I felt like covering and leaving
the<00:05:16.810> comment<00:05:17.139> section<00:05:17.410> which<00:05:17.560> gun<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:17.860> things

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
the comment section which gun you things

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.830 
the comment section which gun you things
better<00:05:18.250> overall<00:05:18.760> I<00:05:18.850> think<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.180> wave<00:05:19.330> gun<00:05:19.570> is

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
better overall I think the wave gun is

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.529 
better overall I think the wave gun is
better<00:05:20.080> because<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:21.190> has<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.550> zap<00:05:21.729> guns<00:05:22.000> but

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
better because it has the zap guns but

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.360 
better because it has the zap guns but
let's<00:05:22.780> just<00:05:22.930> say<00:05:23.110> wave<00:05:23.470> gun<00:05:23.740> versus<00:05:24.250> the

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
let's just say wave gun versus the

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.400 
let's just say wave gun versus the
shrink<00:05:24.610> ray<00:05:24.729> itself<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.630> shrink<00:05:25.900> ray<00:05:26.050> the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
shrink ray itself the shrink ray the

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.060 
shrink ray itself the shrink ray the
shrink<00:05:27.039> wit<00:05:27.220> shrink<00:05:28.090> ray<00:05:28.360> wins<00:05:28.930> because<00:05:29.919> it

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
shrink wit shrink ray wins because it

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.909 
shrink wit shrink ray wins because it
has<00:05:30.190> more<00:05:30.430> ammo<00:05:30.700> and<00:05:31.210> it's<00:05:31.840> a<00:05:31.990> more<00:05:32.260> fun<00:05:32.440> it's<00:05:32.830> a

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
has more ammo and it's a more fun it's a

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.070 
has more ammo and it's a more fun it's a
more<00:05:33.070> fun<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.340> a<00:05:33.400> gun<00:05:33.550> to<00:05:33.700> use<00:05:33.880> rather<00:05:34.810> than<00:05:34.900> the

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
more fun of a gun to use rather than the

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.510 
more fun of a gun to use rather than the
wave<00:05:35.229> gun<00:05:35.410> and<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.740> wave<00:05:35.860> gun<00:05:36.010> is<00:05:36.130> a<00:05:36.160> lot<00:05:36.340> less

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
wave gun and the wave gun is a lot less

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.270 
wave gun and the wave gun is a lot less
ammo<00:05:36.849> um<00:05:37.240> but<00:05:38.229> since<00:05:38.349> the<00:05:38.530> wave<00:05:38.680> gun<00:05:38.830> has<00:05:39.099> to

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
ammo um but since the wave gun has to

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.790 
ammo um but since the wave gun has to
zap<00:05:39.849> guns<00:05:40.120> it<00:05:40.389> makes<00:05:40.630> it<00:05:40.750> a<00:05:40.810> lot<00:05:40.930> better<00:05:41.139> but

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
zap guns it makes it a lot better but

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.420 
zap guns it makes it a lot better but
overall<00:05:41.950> as<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:43.120> whole<00:05:43.599> gun<00:05:43.900> just<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:45.280> wave

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
overall as the whole gun just the wave

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.719 
overall as the whole gun just the wave
gun<00:05:45.700> the<00:05:45.880> big<00:05:46.060> gun<00:05:46.919> the<00:05:47.919> shrink<00:05:48.250> ray<00:05:48.370> is<00:05:48.520> better

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
gun the big gun the shrink ray is better

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.310 
gun the big gun the shrink ray is better
