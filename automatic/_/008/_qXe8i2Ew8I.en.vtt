Bernard is one of the weaker players on
the<00:01:33.000> game<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.390> believe<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.990> something<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.350> 28

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the game I believe of something like 28

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.429 
the game I believe of something like 28
29<00:01:35.400> strength<00:01:35.970> Romario<00:01:36.689> isn't<00:01:37.049> too<00:01:37.200> bad<00:01:37.380> of

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.490 
muscled out like it's absolutely nothing
in<00:02:45.030> terms<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.660> week<00:02:45.810> four<00:02:45.990> they<00:02:46.110> both<00:02:46.290> have

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
in terms of week four they both have

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.170 
in terms of week four they both have
four<00:02:46.709> star<00:02:46.950> weak<00:02:47.160> foot<00:02:47.430> which<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.760> very<00:02:47.970> very

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
four star weak foot which is very very

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.449 
four star weak foot which is very very
decent<00:02:49.020> indeed<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.770> means<00:02:50.040> they<00:02:50.160> can<00:02:50.310> both

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
decent indeed it means they can both

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.580 
decent indeed it means they can both
actually<00:02:51.090> do<00:02:51.330> something<00:02:51.600> on<00:02:51.870> their<00:02:52.110> left<00:02:52.350> foot

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
actually do something on their left foot

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.380 
actually do something on their left foot
so<00:02:53.040> they're<00:02:53.310> both<00:02:53.430> right<00:02:53.700> footed<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.240> means

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
so they're both right footed it means

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.910 
so they're both right footed it means
they<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.750> actually<00:02:55.080> switch<00:02:55.260> over<00:02:55.590> onto<00:02:55.830> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
they can actually switch over onto the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920 
they can actually switch over onto the
left<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.340> are<00:02:56.490> very<00:02:56.700> capable<00:02:57.180> which<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.720> very

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.449 
left and are very capable which is very
good<00:02:58.140> when<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.380> have<00:02:58.410> skills<00:02:58.830> players<00:02:59.190> like

their<00:03:25.980> defenses<00:03:26.610> which<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:27.060> obviously<00:03:27.600> quite

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
their defenses which is obviously quite

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.560 
their defenses which is obviously quite
big<00:03:28.050> deal<00:03:28.290> with<00:03:28.500> Mario's<00:03:28.800> finishing<00:03:29.160> as<00:03:29.280> well

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570

little<00:03:33.390> things<00:03:33.600> are<00:03:33.900> things<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.290> make<00:03:34.560> the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
little things are things that make the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.080 
little things are things that make the
big<00:03:34.860> difference<00:03:34.950> between<00:03:35.250> these<00:03:35.640> two<00:03:35.700> guys

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
now they can both be a player and they

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.530 
now they can both be a player and they
can<00:03:38.130> both<00:03:38.250> score<00:03:38.459> some<00:03:38.730> lovely<00:03:39.030> goals<00:03:39.269> but

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
can both score some lovely goals but

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.930 
can both score some lovely goals but
when<00:03:39.959> Bernards<00:03:40.410> finish<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.769> is<00:03:40.890> 73<00:03:41.220> Andrew

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
when Bernards finish it is 73 Andrew

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.270

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
Mario's is 99 these things do stand out

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.100 
Mario's is 99 these things do stand out
but<00:03:44.610> like<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.910> said<00:03:45.209> when<00:03:45.390> they<00:03:45.510> both<00:03:45.690> got<00:03:45.870> five

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
but like I said when they both got five

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.900 
but like I said when they both got five
star<00:03:46.320> skills<00:03:46.590> they<00:03:46.739> were<00:03:46.799> both<00:03:47.070> just<00:03:47.340> amazing
